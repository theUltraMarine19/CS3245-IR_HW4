2704268,R v Ray [2014] NSWDC 279,"Judgment


	
	In this case I am sentencing a man who is both a drug addict and a drug supplier.
	
	
	One passing aspect of the case is that the offender asserted some moral parameters to his behaviour. But those moral parameters were limited by his own addiction and restricted ability to see the wider impact of his behaviour. Nevertheless he represented his behaviour by reference to a limited moral compass. I will return to this.
	
	
	I am sentencing Glen Ray for two serious offences. One is supplying prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. The drug was methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice. The offence is against s 25A(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act 1985 (NSW). Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to that crime. The second offence is supplying a prohibited drug. Again the drug was methylamphetamine. That is a crime against s 25(1) of the Drug (Misuse and Trafficking) Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 15 years imprisonment to that crime.
	
	
	It is important for a judge to list briefly what happened to amount to the crime that the judge is sentencing an offender for, so that some assessment can be made of the relative seriousness of the crime committed.
	
	
	In this case the police were monitoring the supply of the drug known as ice within the Newcastle area. Their attention fell on Glen Ray and they monitored his behaviour. In fact they sent in an undercover operative. Mr Ray sold ice to that undercover operative on five separate occasions. On each occasion he sold about half a gram and on each occasion he given $350 for the transaction. The earliest was 4 April 2013 and the most recent 3 May 2013. In other words, the transactions occurred over a month. The transactions occurred at various places around Newcastle.
	
	
	A second activity of Mr Ray which the police were monitoring involved his buying the methyl amphetamine which he was in turn supplying to his customers. Police were monitoring his telephone use and the agreed facts - which are part of exhibit A - say that an “analysis of the intercepted telephone calls reveal that the offender was in the regular business of drug supply, servicing a regular customer base with street level deals on a daily basis”. Police monitored Mr Ray buying from what are described as “up-line suppliers”. The amounts negotiated for purchase were in excess of the commercial quantity but the prosecution concedes that some of those drugs were for Mr Ray’s own use, so that the final amount of nearly 250 grams was short of the commercial quantity. However that is to be seen in context that the indictable quantity is 5 grams.
	
	
	Mr Ray was arrested on 12 June 2013. That was the last day of that surveillance which had occurred over two months since 12 April 2013. Police found on his arrest two amounts of cash, one about $1500 and the other nearly $5000. He was charged with two counts of dealing with the proceeds of crime which are offences against s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The police surveillance also disclosed that on a number of occasions Mr Ray was accompanied by his partner, Lynette Bean. She was in fact charged with knowingly taking part in the supply of prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Mr Ray, to his credit, pleaded guilty at what Ms K. Mulley who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions agrees was the earliest available opportunity. He is therefore entitled to a 25% discount on the sentence which he eventually receives. That is because the criminal justice system is overloaded and his early plea means that other cases were able to be accommodated and brought on sooner than they might otherwise have been.
	
	
	It is also important for a judge to assess the personal circumstances of an offender. Mr Ray is now 56. He has a criminal record which extends back many years but most of the offences were dealt with in the Local Court and involved motor car offences or cultivating cannabis. However in 2007 he received a prison sentence of 12 months from the Newcastle Local Court (confirmed in the District Court - although the non-parole period was reduced) for supplying a prohibited drug. Then again in 2012 he was convicted of supplying a prohibited drug and this time he received an 18 month sentence from the Newcastle District Court. It is significant to note that this offending behaviour occurred only some weeks after the expiry of that 18 month sentence.
	
	
	I should add here that Mr J. Fitzgerald of counsel who appeared for Mr Ray called his client to give evidence. He has been in custody since his arrest and has a trusted position of employment within prison. He has a daughter and four sons from two relationships. His life has been overshadowed by what he says was a sexual assault when he was a boy. It lacked resolution because the offender committed suicide. I should add that I place little weight on that aspect continuing to influence the behaviour of a 56 year old man in the sense that it ought to have been dealt with by now by him in a way which was consistent with him not offending. Nevertheless it is relevant to observe that that behaviour brought about, I expect, a drug addiction which Mr Ray developed to cannabis and amphetamines as well as a problem with alcohol. It also brought about an end to his second and longer marriage. In fact when the house was sold he spent the proceeds on drugs and alcohol and, as he said to Mr Fitzgerald, got himself then into the vicious circle of selling drugs in order to support his own habit.
	
	
	Since he has been in prison he has not taken drugs and this is the longest period that he has been drug free for many years. He has been in gaol, bail refused, for some 16 months. He wants to pursue rehabilitation and that is influenced by the fact that Lynette Bean, his partner, has undertaken her own rehabilitation and is presently on remand but is in Dooralong Rehabilitation Centre, part way through a course. She communicates with Mr Ray regularly and is very positive about their future together as rehabilitated drug users.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Ms Mulley, Mr Ray acknowledged that he had been part of the drug scene in Newcastle for some 20 years. This is where the issue of the moral compass becomes a factor. I say it as a matter of interest rather than relevance. When cross-examined about his supply of drugs he said that he had never robbed or stolen in order to finance his use of drugs. What he did was to sell drugs in order to finance his own habit. He also asserted that he had never introduced anyone to the use of drugs, nor had he sold to minors. He said he knew most of the people whom he sold to as regular users. There is a moral dimension to those assertions - whether they are true or not - but it is very circumscribed by the fact that the man was driven by his own addiction.
	
	
	Mr Ray said to Ms Mulley that one of the previous convictions that he was sentenced for involved 22 individual sealed bags of drugs. Ms Mulley cross-examined him about his motivation for wanting to rehabilitate himself now at this late stage of life. He referred to his partner Lynette Bean and to the fact that he had the opportunity recently to look back on his life and see where it had put him at this stage.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald pointed to his client being at some kind of cross roads driven by the impetus of his partner’s rehabilitation. Mr Fitzgerald acknowledged the significance of his client’s prior convictions. They are in my opinion relevant as aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The second offence of buying for up-line suppliers involved a good deal of planning and organisation - as Ms Mulley fairly indicated not sophisticated, but nevertheless some degree of planning and organisation. I do not regard that as a factor relevant to the other offence because by its nature it involved some organisation.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald urged me to alter the usual relationship between a non-parole period and balance of the term of a sentence which I am able to do if I find that there are special circumstances for doing so. Mr Fitzgerald acknowledged that his client will be in custody for some years and will need some supervision on release if he is to follow the example of his partner. Ms Mulley on the other hand pointed to the realistic aspect that this was not the first time Mr Ray had committed these sorts of offences and that he had opportunities in the past to rehabilitate himself. I should not alter the usual balance, she argued. She pointed out that when Mr Ray was released he had returned not only to drug use but to the supply of drugs to support that habit.
	
	
	There should be some minor accumulation of the sentences in respect of the two offences, both Ms Mulley and Mr Fitzgerald agree.
	
	
	This is the most serious of Mr Ray’s drug supply convictions. He is facing two charges on this occasion, one of them carries a significant maximum penalty and is the most serious that he has committed so far. Ms Mulley emphasised the importance of general deterrence and particular deterrence in this case to incapacitate Mr Ray so that he does not return to distributing prohibited drugs to people in the community.
	
	
	Ms Mulley argued that his remorse is limited. I think she has some point there but there was some remorse and insight. However the insight was blinkered because of the fact that he was driven at the time by his own addiction. I would regard his prospects of rehabilitation as quite guarded.
	
	
	The sentence should date from Mr Ray’s arrest on 12 June 2013.
	
	
	I should say that I accept Ms Mulley’s submissions about general and specific deterrence.
	
	
	I will adjust the non-parole period to some extent but not very significantly. I put weight on Ms Mulley’s submissions there but I think that Mr Fitzgerald has a point about his client’s motivation from his partner’s own rehabilitation. That motivation may not have been present before.
	
	
	I would regard an appropriate overall sentence for the first offence of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis as one of five years imprisonment. I would regard an appropriate sentence for the second offence of supplying a prohibited drug as six years imprisonment. I fix that as higher because it is a serious example of that kind of offence and falls just short of the commercial quantity. I would accumulate those two sentences by some six months so that I would regard an overall sentence of six and a half years as appropriate for these two crimes. In due course I will fix an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	However Mr Ray has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I would therefore discount that six and a half year sentence by 25% and fix an aggregate sentence of four years and ten months as the appropriate sentence. It goes without saying that the form of the sentence must be full time custody given his involvement in trafficking.
	
	
	For his sentence of four years and ten months a non-parole period of three years and seven months would normally be appropriate, being 75% of that sentence. I propose to reduce that to three years and four months to allow him a few months additional time during his parole for assistance with his rehabilitation. I take into account his age and the supervision he will require and the motivation he will have, given his partner’s apparent efforts at rehabilitation. The non-parole period will therefore be three years and four months. The balance of the term will be one year and six months. I will now formally sentence Mr Ray.
	
	
	25 In respect of both offences I impose an aggregate sentence of four years and ten months. It commenced on 12 June 2013 and will expire on 11 April 2018. I fix a non-parole period of three years and four months to commence on 12 June 2013 when you were arrested that non-parole period will expire on 11 October 2015. The balance of the term is one year and six months. That commences on 12 October 2016 and will expire on 11 April 2018.    
	
	
	So far as the two matters of dealing with the proceeds of crime, in respect of each matter, under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I convict you and dispose of those proceedings without imposing any other penalty for both of those offences. Have a seat Mr Ray.
	


HIS HONOUR: Ms Mulley, Mr Fitzgerald, any factual or legal matters which I may deal with now and secondly, the mathematics please?

FITZGERALD: I’m satisfied with the mathematics, your Honour and I’m satisfied with the sentence, thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes?

MULLEY: Likewise your Honour, there’s only the four remaining matters on the section 166 certificate which I will formally withdraw.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you.

MULLEY: Sequences 1, 2, 3 and 4.

HIS HONOUR: I note that the - where do I see them, where do I identify them?

MULLEY: Section 166 Certificate which was tendered in the Crown material at tab 4, no they’re under back up offences.

HIS HONOUR: No I don’t have a tab 4. I’ve got a tab 3, I don’t have a tab 4. Yes I do. So they’re the last - what did you say, 1, 2 3 and 4?

MULLEY: The 1, 2, 3 and 4 that are noted under back up offences. They are to be withdrawn.


	
	I note that the matters referred to as sequences 1, 2, 3 and 4 at tab 4 of exhibit A are withdrawn by the Director of Public Prosecutions.
	


FITZGERALD: The Court pleases, thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Is that correct?

MULLEY: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Good.

MULLEY: Would your Honour also make an order for the transcript of yesterday’s proceedings and today’s remarks on sentence to be taken out?

HIS HONOUR: Yes, you want yesterday’s proceedings as well?

MULLEY: Yes, the cross-examination of the accused.


	
	I direct that a transcript of yesterday’s proceedings.
	


HIS HONOUR: Ms Mulley I’m thinking just the evidence and today’s remarks.

MULLEY: Yes.


	
	That direction is limited to the evidence of the offender. I direct that a transcript of my remarks on sentence today be taken out.
	
	
	MULLEY: Thank you, your Honour.
	


HIS HONOUR: And just remind me they are for a matter which is--

MULLEY: A trial listed next week of Russell Morris. It is before your Honour, I think there is an application to vacate on Friday.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, there was. If that transcript can be available on Friday, 8 November 2014 that would be helpful and I add if possible that would be helpful.

HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Ray, do you understand you got five years and you got six years, I have got them running together except they overlap by six months so the overall is six and a half years. Then I took off your 25% because of your plea, so your overall sentence is four years and ten months. It started when you were arrested on 12 June last year. The sentence finishes on 11 April 18. I fixed three years and four months as your non-parole period and that ends on 11 October 2016. That is the first date on which you will be eligible for parole. You know better than I do, that is up to the Parole Authority. I do not make an order for parole, for that kind of sentence and after your parole your balance of your sentence finishes on 11 April 2018 and I have given you just a conviction for the two sums of money, proceeds of crime, and some of the others have been withdrawn. Do you understand that? Okay. Mr Ray can be taken down.

		19 February 2015",2014-11-03 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704269,R v Swan [2014] NSWDC 226,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 12 February 2013 Jason Dewey was at home sitting on his nine year old son's bed playing video games. His partner Samantha Vincent had gone to bed, as had their six year old daughter. Mr Dewey was attracted by a commotion from outside. He heard male voices yelling threatening things to him. He went out to have a look at what was going on and saw an angry mob of men. Mr Dewey was clearly the focus of the mob's intentions. Ms Vincent joined him on the front porch of their home and she too looked at the group. 

2Mr Dewey and Ms Vincent were able to recognise a number of the people who had come to their home and made threats. They recognised this offender, Dean Swan. He was easy to recognise as he was Ms Vincent's cousin and indeed at one stage she had allowed him to stay with her and Mr Dewey for some time. Ms Vincent recognised others too, including brothers of the offender. 

3One of the Swan brothers, Joshua Swan, went around to the back of the house and attempted to force his way inside. He armed himself with a large piece of wood and proceeded to smash a number of windows in the house. When he came back to the front of the house he threw that piece of wood towards Ms Vincent, causing a significant wound on her forehead.

4Mr Dewey thought it was best for him to ensure the safety of his young children. He grabbed his daughter and was heading towards his mother's place next door when Dean Swan, the offender, threw a large rock at him. Given that he was carrying his daughter, Mr Dewey, his daughter and of course Dean Swan himself are very fortunate that the rock missed, albeit narrowly, both Mr Dewey and his daughter. 

5Mr Dewey was able to ensure his daughter's safety before he was set upon by the mob. He suffered a number of injuries but given what occurred to him, it is remarkable that he got off as lightly as he did. He was kicked, he was punched, he was struck with a rock and cricket bat and an object like a screwdriver was used to inflict small wounds on the back of his neck. At one stage a guitar was smashed over his back. 

6It is difficult of course to be precise as to what individual members of the mob did. It is clear, however, that all of the men who went there that evening were involved in a joint criminal enterprise to inflict fear and violence upon Jason Dewey and in that endeavour they succeeded dramatically well.

7I am unable to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender actually struck Mr Dewey. His criminality is less than those who did, but in the circumstances of this case, where he was part of the mob and where he threw objects at Mr Dewey as part of his participation in the mob's joint criminal enterprise, his conduct was, as his counsel recognises, seriously criminal.

8Eventually police arrived and the mob scattered. Police officers offered first aid to Mr Dewey and Ms Vincent and an ambulance was called which took them to John Hunter Hospital where investigations revealed that Mr Dewey had suffered a fracture to the transverse process of his L3 vertebra. Fortunately this was a stable fracture and there was no risk of any damage to the spinal cord. Nevertheless he remained in hospital for two days in considerable pain before he was able to walk with difficulty from hospital and return home. Mr Dewey found it difficult to walk for a number of weeks after discharge from hospital. He improved, as the doctors expected, but he was left with some residual consequences of the injury suffered to his back. Whereas before he could lift up a bag of cement and carry his children around without any adverse consequences, to do so now leaves him with some pain.

9The offender now stands to be sentenced for an offence of affray which has a maximum penalty of 10 years' imprisonment and an offence of causing grievous bodily harm to Jason Dewey in company, being reckless as to whether actual bodily harm would be caused, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of five years. I have taken this standard non-parole period and the maximum penalties into account in deciding the appropriate sentences. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, for the recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company offence, appear in these remarks on sentence. Clearly, there is a considerable degree of overlap in these two offences and I have been careful not to double count this overlap in criminality.

10I am sentencing this offender but another judge has sentenced others involved in the offences. The reason for that is this. Mr Swan pleaded not guilty. During the course of his trial I heard evidence concerning the actions of other people involved who had pleaded guilty. The Crown and representatives of some of those men told me that the facts on which those who pleaded guilty were to be sentenced, were significantly different from the evidence which I had heard. Accordingly, it was appropriate for a judge who had not heard that evidence to sentence those who pleaded guilty. I do not know what sentences were imposed on those other men.

11These were most serious offences. Something in the order of 10 angry men were involved in the affray and attack upon Mr Dewey. They were not armed with pitchforks and flaming torches as they might have been in olden times, but did arm themselves instead with fence palings, a cricket bat, a rock, something like a screwdriver and even, bizarrely, a guitar, clearly with the intention of causing harm to Mr Dewey and terrifying both him and his wife.

12Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the behaviour of this unruly mob was the disregard that was shown to the presence of young children, even to the extent that - and this is worth repeating for emphasis - this offender threw a rock at Mr Dewey while he was carrying his six year old daughter to safety. There could be absolutely no suggestion that Mr Swan was unaware of the presence of the daughter. There was another child of course too. The nine year old son of Ms Vincent and Mr Dewey, a child who had looked up to Dean Swan in the past, observed a large part of what went on. Mr Swan seems to have cared very little for the safety of the young girl and very little for his relationship with the young boy by acting as he did that night.

13Quite why the mob was there in the first place is a matter of some speculation. At the trial the Crown suggested that Mr Swan was out for revenge, having himself been the victim of an offence of violence and intimidation at the hands of Mr Dewey and Ms Vincent. For reasons which Ms Hutchinson outlined in the course of her submissions today, it is not possible for me to accept that that is the reason why the mob did as they did. The offender did not tell me. He pleaded not guilty and did not give evidence at his trial. He denied that he was there in the first place so there was no evidence from him as to why he was there. The violence is thus largely, if not completely, unexplained. That is scarcely a matter of mitigation.

14The events of that evening were both terrifying and violent. As might be imagined, neighbours were attracted by what occurred. They witnessed what can happen when a large group of men come together for the purposes of being violent. To say that the conduct of Mr Dean Swan and his co-offenders that evening represented a breach of the peace is something of an understatement. The offences caused harm not only to the immediate victim Mr Dewey but also his wife, his children and neighbours nearby. Fortunately, as I have already mentioned, the injuries to Mr Dewey were much less serious than might have been expected. That is a matter of good luck rather than good management. Indeed the injuries he actually suffered are very much at the lower range of injuries encompassed by the expression ""grievous bodily harm"". 

15The offender is the second of five siblings. His parents separated and got back together fairly regularly over Mr Swan's early life. His father was a drinker and a violent drinker at that. From a very young age Mr Swan was exposed to alcohol and violence. When I say exposed to, I do not only mean that Mr Swan observed violence, on many occasions he was the victim of violence at the hands of his father. Not all of us have the same ability in life to make wise choices as we grow up. Mr Swan's ability to make the correct choices in life was very much inhibited by what he observed and experienced as he grew up. His moral culpability is lower than it would otherwise have been because of this circumstance.

16He has some matters on his criminal history. There is reference in the material to offences committed by the offender when he was under the age of 18 and an offence of common assault and one of breaching an apprehended domestic violence order when the offender was in his early 20's, but he is now 27 and so there is a significant gap in his offending behaviour. That is of some significance.

17He left school in year 9 but has led a rather aimless life since then. He has never had a job apart from a short period picking grapes and has no real intention or desire to ever obtain work. He relies on his family for his social network, as well as accommodation. This appears to be because of a significant lack of self-confidence. Mr Swan does not like crowds and prefers to socialise with his family. Indeed a significant part of his life has been taken up assisting his sister in the care of her children.

18Mr Swan's upbringing is such that a psychologist, who assessed him for the purposes of these sentence proceedings, said that:

""The ongoing conflict within the home, the apparent lack of security, neglect and the absence of consistent care-giving seems to have affected Mr Swan's conduct, interpersonal functioning and his psychological wellbeing.""

19The psychological report also notes some other important aspects of Mr Swan's behaviour. It appears that he has not functioned well socially at any point of his life and he struggled to complete the questionnaires and interview that the psychologist asked him to participate in. She assessed his intellectual functioning at a very low level. These matters suggest that general deterrence has less of a part to play in this sentencing exercise than would otherwise be the case.

20His behaviour on the night, when these offences were committed, is consistent with the behaviour that was reported in the psychological report and consistent with the description of the offender given by his mother and sister in evidence today. They all describe him as a follower. His behaviour on the night the offence was committed is consistent with that description. As I said, he is a man with little self-confidence. In those circumstances the prospects of rehabilitation need to be assessed as guarded. It is to be hoped that over the course of his incarceration, because a fulltime custodial sentence is the only option in the present case, he will be offered the assistance of psychological counselling, hopefully continuing upon his release from custody in an effort to encourage Mr Swan to do things in his life which have more of a purpose than simply gambling, drinking and using drugs as has so much been the case with Mr Swan's life to date.

21There are clearly special circumstances in this case justifying a departure from what would ordinarily be the statutory ratio between non-parole period and head sentence. This will be the offender's first time in custody and once he is released from custody he will benefit from significant assistance from the Probation and Parole Service, in order to ensure that next time the opportunity to commit offences presents itself to him, he will not follow those intent on such behaviour. 

22I do not want to under-estimate the challenge that lies ahead for the offender. As I mentioned, his social activities have to date largely revolved around his family and yet the very facts of this offence, where other members of his family were involved in the nasty attack on Mr Dewey, demonstrate the problems of someone associating with influences of that kind.

23For the offence of affray I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of two years commencing from 14 June 2014 and a head sentence of three years and six months. 

24For the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm in company, I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of one year and six months commencing from 14 March 2015 and a head sentence of three years. Thus the overall effective sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing from 14 June 2014 and a head sentence of three years and nine months. This means that the offender will be eligible to be released on parole on 13 September 2016.

25Any other order required?

26HUTCHINSON: Your Honour I would respectfully request that your Honour make a recommendation that the Department of Aging, Disability and Home Care assess Mr Swan in custody, as was recommended by Ms Durkin.

27HIS HONOUR: I will certainly make that recommendation.

2704279,R v West [2014] NSWCCA 250,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Adamson J.  I particularly endorse her Honour's remarks concerning the obligation of judicial officers to properly apply relevant legislation and sentencing principles.  The sentencing principles referred to by her Honour have been developed over time so as to not only fulfil the requirements of sentencing in s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) but to ensure consistency in sentencing.  There is no place in the sentencing process for idiosyncratic manipulation.
2R A HULME J: I agree with the order proposed by Adamson J and with her Honour's reasons.  I also agree with the additional remarks of Hoeben CJ at CL.
3ADAMSON J: This is an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the sentence imposed on the respondent on 6 June 2014 by Ellis DCJ on grounds set out in more detail below, the principal of which was that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.
4The respondent pleaded guilty on 13 November 2013 at the Wyong Local Court and was committed to the District Court for sentencing on a change of supplying a prohibited drug, 245.22g of methylamphetamine, contrary to ss 25(1) and 29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (DMTA). On 6 June 2014 the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment to be served in the community by way of an Intensive Correction Order (ICO). 
5The offence and the relevant maximum penalty and the matters on a Form 1 are set out in the table below.SectionCircumstancesMaximum penaltyCount 1S 25(1) and 29 of DMTASupplying 245.22g of methylamphetamine15 years imprisonment and/ or fine of 2000 penalty units.Form 1 S 189 of Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)Receiving stolen property (laptop computer and digital camera)3 yearsS 10(1) DMTAPossess prohibited drug (Cannabis)2 years or 20 penalty unitsS 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW)Possess prohibited weapon (knuckledusters)14 yearsS 93FA(2) of the Crimes ActPossess explosive for unlawful purpose (railway detonators)3 years and/ or 50 penalty units
The facts
6The Police executed a search warrant at the respondent's premises on 23 January 2013.  The respondent pointed out a laptop computer on the kitchen bench and retrieved a Canon SLR camera from the top of a fish tank near the kitchen bench.  He told police that he bought the computer from his mates and admitted knowing that it was stolen [Form 1]. In the course of their search of the premises, the police found the following:
(1)17 plastic resealable bags containing while crystalline substance [4g methylamphetamine];
(2)Two glass smoking pipes;
(3)Three digital scales;
(4)One cupboard box containing empty plastic resealable bags;
(5)One glass water pipe;
(6)Six plastic bags containing moist crystalline substance  [20.62g methylamphetamine];
(7)One silver smoking pipe.
7Police told the respondent that he would be charged with deemed supply, to which he responded:  ""I fucked up.  I know I fucked up you know.  I've never done this shit in my life.""  The respondent was taken to Wyong Police Station while the police continued searching the garage of the premises, in which the following items were located:
(1)A cylindrical plastic container containing a piece of paper with ""$8000"" written on it and 32 plastic resealable bags containing a moist crystalline substance [109g methylamphetamine];
(2)A rectangular plastic container that contained a piece of paper with ""$8000"" written on it and four plastic containers each containing a crystalline substance [all were found to contain methylamphetamine with the following weights:  28g, 27.9g, 27.7g and 28g.]
8Upon analysis, all of the above mentioned substances were found to contain methylamphetamine.  The substance weighed, in total, 245.22g.  The purity of the prohibited drug in one of the four containers found in the garage (weighing 28g) was analysed and found to contain 10.0% methylamphetamine.
9During the search of the premises, police also located the following items:
(1)One gold coloured knuckleduster [Form 1];
(2)A small amount of cannabis weighing less than 1g [Form 1];
(3)One canister containing 12 railway track signals, commonly known as railway detonators.  In relation to this item the Respondent stated that the detonators were ""dead"" and ""useless"" and that he had them since he was a kid living in Parramatta [Form 1].
10The Respondent declined to participate in an interview with police.

The sentence hearing
11The sentence hearing commenced on 7 March 2014. The Crown tendered the agreed facts which are summarised above and the respondent's criminal and custodial history, which established the following.  
12The respondent was 28 years old at the time of the offending and 29 years at the time of sentence.  He had a criminal history mostly for driving offences but he had been convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2003 for which he received a community service order (CSO). He breached the order and was called up and received a suspended sentence of imprisonment.  In 2004 he received suspended sentences for break, enter and steal and larceny offences and good behaviour bonds for larceny and goods in custody offences.  In 2008 he received a CSO for driving whilst unlicensed.  He was called up in respect of the CSO and sentenced to periodic detention for 6 months.  He has served terms of full-time custody of 8 months for driving whilst disqualified and police pursuit offences in 2011 and 6 months for a driving whilst disqualified in 2012.  He had been at liberty for only 3 months at the time of the current offences.
13The documents tendered on behalf of the respondent included three references and a report of Mr Borenstein, psychologist. The respondent reported to him that his parents separated when he was about 2 years old.  He was sufficiently disciplined during childhood.  He left school during year 10 and has been primarily dependent on Centrelink for income since leaving school.  He has a partner and a 7 year old daughter.  He became depressed upon his release from prison and gravitated back to his old drug network.  He became a heavy user of ice.  He has previously consulted a psychologist regarding ADD/ADHD and epilepsy during adolescence, for which he was treated with medication. Mr Borenstein assessed the respondent as being of low average intelligence and extremely low emotional intelligence.  In his view, the respondent needed more direct and constant supervision than has been available to him in the past.  He considered that, although there had been no diagnosis by a psychiatrist, the respondent probably had bipolar disorder type 2.  Mr Borenstein considered that the respondent needed to be placed on appropriate medication for treatment of ADD/ADHD and possible bipolar disorder.
14Mr Vasic, who appeared on behalf of the respondent at the sentence hearing, sought an adjournment pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act). 
15In the course of the sentence hearing, his Honour indicated that his preferred option was to impose an ICO.  The Crown submitted, in effect, that any sentence of imprisonment of two years or less might be erroneous and appellable.  The following exchange ensued:
""HIS HONOUR:  One of the other options I was thinking of, given that I have this lateral thinking mind, is that either way the matter has to be adjourned.  He could be adjourned and he could be remanded in custody while I get certain reports.  For instance an ICO report.  Then at that point in time I could impose a sentence of imprisonment and then give him the ICO.  That effectively sort of creates what I am suggesting I ought to be able to do by say giving him a short term of imprisonment, then giving the ICO, couldn't actually give the bond at the end of that but we could do the first two.  I mean at the end of the day - he's only done a couple of weeks has he?
PAGE:  Two weeks your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  Well the only other option would be that I could adjourn it.  I am going to go to morning tea in a second but the other proposal that you can each think about is this.  That I could stand the matter over to Friday 6 June, just the last Friday before I go to Coffs Harbour for the last three weeks of term and remand him in custody.  That would give him, with the two weeks he's done, give him about four months all up in fulltime custody and then at that point in time if he was suitable for an ICO he could be given an ICO.  If he wasn't suitable for an ICO the next thing would be a short non parole period with perhaps him going into a fulltime rehab.""  [Emphasis added.]
16There was a short adjournment.  When the hearing resumed the Crown handed up some sentencing statistics following which his Honour said:""Well the reality is there's a few options.  If he is remanded in custody, as what I have done with a few other people who had been in custody for a bit longer, by the time you then get to the sentencing date you are able to say ""I won't give a sentence of any length greater than two years.""  Albeit that at the end of the day the totality of what they're getting might be in some cases nine months in full time custody followed then by a two year ICO but it all complies with it.  Did you want to say against doing it the way I proposed? ""  [Emphasis added.]
17The Crown, after clarifying with the sentencing judge that the proposal was that the respondent be remanded in custody until the adjourned date of 6 June 2014, indicated that he did not oppose that course.
Remarks on sentence: 7 March 2014
18At the conclusion of the hearing on that day the sentencing judge delivered brief remarks on sentence, referred the respondent for assessment for an ICO, unilaterally revoked his bail and remanded him in custody to 6 June 2014 for sentence. His Honour referred to the agreed statement of facts and summarised them as follows:""The facts are set out in the agreed statement of facts, but essentially, police arrive at his residence with a search warrant.  They searched the premises and located the items which are the subject of the counts on the Form 1 and the drugs which are the subject of the count in the indictment.  The officers also located scales, resealable bags and noted that at least two of the bags were broken down into smaller bags of approximately 2 grams each.  I think at least two of those bags had ""$8,000"" written on the outside.""
19His Honour allowed 25% for the utilitarian discount for the plea of guilty. His Honour then said:""The court has considered s 3A, s 5 and s 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.""
20The sentencing judge proceeded to list the items of evidence that had been tendered and said that he had taken them into account. His Honour referred to R v Clarke (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 15 March 1990, unrep) in support of the proposition that those involved in commercial supply of drugs would be required to serve a term of full-time custody, ""other than in exceptional circumstances"".
21His Honour then said:""I note in the written submission the various cases dealing with the fact that this sentencing process is a discretionary process and it is an intuitive process.  In this case Mr West has served time in custody on prior occasions and it seems that it is not something, which for him, is particularly difficult.  In fact he seems to struggle more when he is released than while he is in custody having things done for him.  In other words it is a form of institutionalisation but it is also reflective perhaps of the accuracy of the content of the report of Mr Borenstein in terms of his personality.
It is necessary, in my view, for there to be some full time custodial component of this sentence.  I propose though to adjourn the matter to the Friday 6 June and in the meantime to ask that he be assessed as to his suitability to serve a sentence by way of an intensive corrections order.
I can indicate that on 6 June he will be sentenced and the sentence which will be imposed will not exceed two years.  In my view this man would greatly benefit from an intensive corrections order in that it would be strict supervision while he is out in the community.  That is when he struggles, that is when he needs the supervision and it will also have a component of rehabilitation in terms of treatment counselling and a component of punishment in terms of community service, curfews, etcetera.
It is also the case that if there is some breach during the course of an ICO it simply reverts to a full time custodial sentence.  So there will be a constant incentive for Mr West to comply with such an order.
At this stage the matter is stood over to Friday 6 June 2014 and he is remanded in custody.  I request a copy of these remarks be prepared and provided and made available to me on the adjourned date.""[Emphasis added.]
The sentence hearing on 6 June 2014
22The matter came back before the sentencing judge on the adjourned date, 6 June 2014. The ICO report dated 5 June 2014 recorded, and his Honour noted, that the respondent had been assessed as suitable for an ICO. His Honour clarified with counsel that the respondent had spent a total of three months and fourteen days in custody, in two separate periods: first, a period of 14 days from 24 January 2013 before the grant of bail on 6 February 2013 and secondly, the further period on remand ordered by the sentencing judge on 7 March 2014 from that date to 6 June 2014.
23The sentencing judge then called on the representative of the Crown who submitted that, notwithstanding that the respondent had served a total of three and a half months in custody and had been assessed as suitable for an ICO, a full-time custodial sentence should still be imposed having regard to the seriousness of the offence.
The remarks on sentence: 6 June 2014
24His Honour then proceeded to give remarks on sentence. His Honour said after identifying the index offence and the matters on the Form 1:""Mr West will turn 30 years of age tomorrow.  Although it is fairly clear over the last ten years or so he's been in his twenties going on about 15 in terms of his level of maturity.  The consequences of that immature conduct is reflected in his criminal history and numerous incarcerations.
It seems that his prior periods in custody have not deterred him and as I noted on 7 March, the observations of Mr Borenstein, clinical psychologist seem to suggest that that is reflective of his personality issues.  I accept that he was a person who was a user who was supplying.
In my view the appropriate starting point for this sentence is the sentence of three years imprisonment.  A discount of twenty five percent to which he is entitled, reduces the sentence to one of two years and three months.  I note that he has now served three months and two weeks in custody, meaning that he has an outstanding balance of just under two years.
My view at the moment is that I will take into account the time spent in custody.  I will sentence him to a term of two years imprisonment but having regard to the fact that he has been assessed as suitable for an intensive corrections order I will direct that the sentence be served by way of an intensive corrections order, with the additional conditions which are set out on the last page of the ICO assessment report.""
25His Honour then passed the sentence of two years imprisonment to be served in the community by way of an ICO. His Honour ordered that the sentence commence on that day, 6 June 2014.
The appeal
26The Crown appealed on the following grounds:
(1)Failure to assess the objective seriousness of the offence and/or the moral culpability of the respondent.
(2)Failure to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence and/or the moral culpability of the respondent.
(3)Ordering that the sentence be served by way of an intensive correction order.
(4)Failure to impose a sentence that properly reflected that the offences before the Court on the Form 1 document had been appropriately taken into account.
(5)Failure to have regard to general deterrence in imposing the sentence.
(6)The sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
Reasons
Ground 1: alleged failure to assess objective seriousness and moral culpability
27The assessment of objective seriousness is an important part of sentencing: see R v Campbell [2014] NSWCCA 102 at [27] per Simpson J, Hall J agreeing and the authorities referred to, including: R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Khoury v R [2011] NSWCCA 118 at [71]-[72]. Indeed, it is also difficult to know how the maximum penalty for an offence, which has been described as a ""legislative guidepost"" (see Muldrock at [27]) could be used, if not as an indication that it is the sentence that Parliament considers ought be reserved for the worse type of case: Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46; 163 CLR 447 at 451-452, referred to in Veen v The Queen (No. 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 478. Accordingly, the objective seriousness of an offence needs to be assessed for the purposes of taking into account the maximum penalty.
28In the present case, the remarks on sentence contain no assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending conduct. Nor is there any assessment of the offender's moral culpability. I do not discern in his Honour's remarks on sentence anything that might permit the conclusion that these matters were taken into account. It is not satisfactory that an appeal court is left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the bench and counsel during submissions in an attempt to ascertain a judicial officer's reasons for determination: Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited [2006] NSWSC 343; 67 NSWLR 402 at [19]. The latitude that is afforded to remarks on sentence given ex tempore by busy judges does not, in my view, entitle this Court to infer that a matter as fundamental to the sentencing process as the assessment of objective seriousness was taken into account when it was not addressed in the remarks. 
29Ground 1 has been made out. His Honour's failure to assess objective seriousness has, in my view, led to the sentencing discretion miscarrying.
Ground 2: Failure to impose a sentence that reflected the objective seriousness of the offence and/or the moral culpability of the respondent
30The objective seriousness of the offence was relatively high. The facts disclosed that the respondent was trafficking in drugs to a substantial degree. The quantity of the drugs found, together with the location of the packaged drugs, scales and plastic bags, showed that he was in the business of trafficking to a substantial degree.  The maximum penalty for an offence of supplying the indictable quantity of the drug is 15 years. The quantity of drug involved of 245.22g was significant, being 5g short of the commercial quantity, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
31Although the quantity of drugs is not determinative of the objective seriousness of an offence of supply, it is an important material factor, although not necessarily the ""chief factor"": Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 609, [67]-[70]. Indeed the fact that different maximum penalties are provided for by Parliament by reference to quantities (indictable quantity, commercial quantity, large commercial quantity etc) for particular drugs is an indication of its importance: Wong v The Queen at [67].
32I do not consider that the sentence imposed was commensurate with the objective seriousness of the offence. To this extent ground 2 has been made out. However, the process of sentencing requires many factors, both objective and subjective, to be taken into account in a process of ""instinctive synthesis"" (Wong v The Queen at [75] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ and Markarian v The Queen at [37]-[39] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ). Accordingly, I propose to consider the effect of his Honour's failure to take into account the objective seriousness in the context of ground 6, which concerns manifest inadequacy.
Ground 3: alleged error in ordering that the sentence be served by way of an ICO
33This ground has two aspects: first, the way in which the sentencing judge conducted the sentence hearings and structured the sentence; and secondly, the result. The second aspect will be considered below in the context of the manifest inadequacy ground.
34Section 5 of the Act provides that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. Section 7 of the Act provides that, subject to Part 5, a court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment of not more than two years may make an ICO directing that the sentence be served by way of intensive correction in the community. The expression ""intensive correction"" in the Act has the same meaning as it does in the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 (NSW), namely intensive correction in the community pursuant to an order. 
35Section 47 of the Act provides that, relevantly, a sentence is to commence on the day it is imposed unless the Court directs that it is taken to have commenced on a previous day. In deciding whether such a direction is to be made, the Court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence.
36The way in which the sentence hearing was conducted is set out above. In my view, the process was affected by a number of errors by reason of his Honour's failure to have regard to the purposes of bail and the requirement that a sentencing discretion be ultimately exercised immediately before a sentence is passed rather than, as here, conditionally in advance.
37The respondent had been on bail since 6 February 2013. The long title of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) (which applied on 7 March 2014) (the Bail Act) was: ""An Act relating to bail for accused persons in or in connection with criminal proceedings."" Section 14 of the Bail Act provided that:""A power conferred by this Act to grant bail shall, subject to this Act, be deemed to include a power to refuse bail, but the power to refuse bail may only be exercised in conformity with this Act."" 
38Section 6 of the Bail Act provided that bail may be granted in respect of the period of any adjournment. The word ""adjournment"" in s 6 included the period between the conviction of a person and the sentencing of the person: s 16(e1). Section 32 of the Bail Act obliged the court to take into account certain nominated matters and only those matters: s 32(1). There was nothing identified by the judge in any of the criteria there mentioned to justify a refusal of bail. However his Honour was aware that he was not entitled to order that the term be served in the community by way of an ICO if the term was greater than two years.
39In my view, the remarks on sentence given on 7 March 2014 reveal that the purpose for which his Honour ordered that the respondent be taken into custody was to punish the respondent by sentencing him to a period of imprisonment, rather than to fulfill any of the purposes of the Bail Act (see the italicised portions of the extracts above in [15] from the proceedings on sentence). His Honour appears to have embarked on the sentencing process on 7 March 2014 and, in part, imposed the sentence, or at least the custodial portion of it, with a view to ordering an ICO at a later date.
40It is within the power of a sentencing judge either to backdate a sentence or to commence a sentence from the date of its imposition. What the Act requires is that any time for which the offender has been held in custody be taken into account in sentencing: s 24(a). However, this Court has said on a number of occasions that a sentence should take account of prior periods in custody by backdating the sentence, unless there is a good reason, which is articulated by the sentencing judge, for not adopting that approach: see the summary of authorities in Wiggins v R [2010] NSWCCA 30 at [3]-[8] and [14] per Howie J, Harrison J agreeing.   
41In my view, on 7 March 2014, his Honour decided that, provided the respondent received an appropriate assessment result, an ICO would be imposed. His Honour revoked the respondent's bail on that date for the express purposes of providing ""some full time custodial component to this sentence"" and to ensure that the ""sentence would not exceed two years"". It was not, in my view, a valid exercise of the power to revoke bail to order the accused into custody for the evident purpose of having this period ""count"" in terms of a sentence by reason of s 24(a). In substance, his Honour contrived a further period of custody with a view to making an ICO at the later date, when that was not an available sentencing option having regard to s 7 of the Act. His Honour sentenced the respondent on 7 March 2014 to three months' imprisonment, with a view to further sentencing him, at a second stage, on 6 June 2014, by making an ICO. 
42My conclusion is fortified by the circumstance that the hearing on 6 June 2014 was very brief, since his Honour appears to have regarded it as a foregone conclusion that he would make an ICO. Although the Crown objected, his Honour had already determined the matter. The reason the sentencing judge did not back-date the sentence was that it would have made patent the unavailability of an ICO and his Honour's non-compliance with the constraint in s 7 of the Act. This was not a valid exercise of his Honour's discretion not to make a direction pursuant to s 47(2) of the Act to backdate the sentence.
43His Honour's approach did not comply with s 7 of the Act. Nor was it in accordance with appropriate sentencing practice, which is to impose a sentence once, rather than, as his Honour appears to have done, in two stages. 
44Effectively, his Honour imposed a sentence of two years and three months and directed that the latter two years of the sentence be served by an ICO. This sentencing option was not open to his Honour since s 7 of the Act authorises an ICO only for sentences of no more than two years. One of the fundamental duties of judicial officers is to comply with legislation. The process the sentencing judge engaged in in the present case tended to subvert it. Ground 3 has been made out.
Ground 4: Failure to impose a sentence that properly reflected that the offences before the Court on the Form 1 document had been appropriately taken into account
45Section 33 of the Act makes provision for outstanding charges to be taken into account where an offender admits guilt to the outstanding charges and indicates that he or she wants the court to take the outstanding charges into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence. If the Court takes additional charges into account in the sentence for the principal offence, the sentence must not exceed the maximum penalty for the principal offence. Because of my view that the sentence was not commensurate with the objective seriousness of the principal offence, I consider that ground 4, too, has been made out. His Honour appears to have disregarded the Form 1 and failed to increase the sentence on the principal count, in derogation of the purpose of the Form 1 procedure: Attorney-General's Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1 of 2002) [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42]. The taking into account of the Form 1 offences pursuant to s 33 of the Act ought increase the sentence beyond that which would be required for the principal offence alone: see the summary of relevant principles in Abbas, Bodiotis, Taleb and Amoun v R [2013] NSWCCA 115. However, for the same reasons as set out in respect of ground 2 above, I propose to consider this factor in the context of ground 6.
Ground 5: Failure to have regard to general deterrence in imposing the sentence
46Section 3A of the Act lists the purposes for which a court may impose a sentence, which include punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, rehabilitation of the offender, denunciation and recognition of the harm to victims. The purpose of general deterrence is identified in s 3A(b) of the Act in the following terms:""(b) to prevent crime by deterring . . . other persons from committing similar offences,""
47Although the Act does not express the purposes of sentencing in s 3A in terms of mandatory relevant considerations, it is difficult to conceive of a sentencing exercise which would not at least require the sentencing judge to consider general deterrence and what weight ought be given to it in the circumstances of the case. General deterrence is of particular importance with respect to drug offences, particularly those which, as in the present case, are, at least in part, conducted for financial gain. Indeed, in R v Clarke, the very authority to which the sentencing judge referred in the remarks on sentence on 7 March 2013, Hunt J nominated general deterrence as the reason why custodial sentences ought be imposed on drug traffickers, in the following passage:""This Court has, on occasions too numerous to mention, emphasised that sentences involving a substantial general deterrence  are to be imposed on drug traffickers, and it has indicated that only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial order be appropriate.""
48His Honour was principally, if not solely, concerned with the rehabilitation of the offender and the protection of the public, in so far as that purpose could be advanced by the rehabilitation of the offender. There is no indication that the sentencing judge adverted to general deterrence at all. Although his Honour said, in the remarks on sentence, ""the court has considered s 3A"", a statement of that nature is manifestly insufficient to show that the factors referred to have in fact been taken into account and weighed by a sentencing judge. 
49This Court has recently had occasion to deprecate the practice adopted by this sentencing judge on a prior occasion of paying what can be no more than lip service to the requirement to take into account the purposes of sentencing or the factors germane to the task by merely referring to the applicable statute: RCW v R (No. 2) [2014] NSWCCA 190 at [57]-[58] per R A Hulme J, Bathurst CJ and Adams J agreeing. Such shorthand statements do not comply with the obligation to give reasons. On no account can they be excused, much less justified, on the grounds of the demands of a busy list.
50I consider the sentencing discretion to have miscarried by reason of his Honour's failure to take into account general deterrence.
Ground 6: manifest inadequacy
The relevant principles
51A claim of manifest inadequacy requires the Crown to establish that the sentences imposed were unreasonable or plainly unjust, having regard to the principles that there is no single ""correct"" sentence and that judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with the application of proper principle and consistency of approach: R v Dinsdale [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at 325; Markarian v The Queen at [25]; Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 538 [58].  
52Whether a sentence is manifestly inadequate is a conclusion. It is not necessary to identify any particular error in the process; it is the examination of the result that leads to the conclusion. Nonetheless it can be helpful to ascertain why and how the sentence was arrived at since this inquiry may explain the conclusion and expose the reason for any manifest inadequacy.
Analysis of the approach of the sentencing judge
53For the reasons set out above, the sentencing judge undertook the process of sentencing in two stages. His Honour imposed a short-term custodial sentence under the guise of revocation of bail in order to make an ICO at the adjourned date. There was no more than colourable compliance with s 7 of the Act. His Honour had regard only to the respondent's rehabilitation and the protection of the public, only in so far as it was advanced by the former. His Honour failed to have regard either to the objective seriousness of the offending conduct, the Form 1 offences or general deterrence. It was not open to his Honour to impose an ICO since his Honour had determined that a sentence greater than two years was warranted.
Whether the sentence was manifestly inadequate
54I consider the sentence imposed to be manifestly inadequate. In my view a custodial sentence of significantly more than minimal length was required.  A custodial sentence of minimal length was, in substance, imposed by his Honour when he revoked bail and required the respondent to serve three months in custody pending the adjourned date. In my view, the starting point for the sentence that should have been imposed by the sentencing judge was of the order of four years imprisonment. A discount of 25% ought be applied to this for the plea of guilty, giving a sentence of three years. A finding of special circumstances was warranted, and the statutory ratio adjusted from 75% to 66.67% so as to give rise to a non-parole period of two years. This sentence ought to have been backdated to 22 February 2014 to take into account the two weeks the respondent spent in custody before bail was granted and the further three months he spent in custody between 7 March 2014 and 6 June 2014. A sentence of this length takes account, in my view of the objective seriousness of the offending conduct, the need for general deterrence and the Form 1 offences, as well as the subjective circumstances, including his criminal history and the matters referred to above that are recorded in Mr Borenstein's report. The rehabilitation of the respondent would be furthered by the finding of special circumstances and give him a year with parole supervision on his release from custody.
Residual discretion 55This Court retains a residual discretion in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act to refuse to interfere in a sentence, even if error has been demonstrated and manifest inadequacy established: Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293; Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462.  
56This Court is obliged to consider the exercise of the residual discretion: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [24]; Reeves v The Queen [2013] HCA 57 at [10], [12], [60]-[61].   
57The principal purpose of the determination of a Crown appeal is to give guidance to sentencing judges. This is not to say that the sentence actually imposed on the respondent is not of importance. However, it is significant, in my view in the circumstances of the present case, that the process to which the respondent was subjected by the sentencing judge was neither of his own, nor his legal representatives' making. The process, which did not comply with the Act, was devised and executed solely by his Honour. The respondent was erroneously deprived of his liberty when bail was revoked for a collateral and extraneous purpose. It was restored to him erroneously on 6 June 2014, when his Honour made an ICO in contravention of the constraints of s 7 of the Act. Further, by reason of an administrative error based on a misapprehension, the filing of the Crown appeal had the effect that the implementation of the ICO did not in fact commence for some months. 
58I am persuaded that, in these circumstances, the residual discretion ought be exercised. Accordingly, it is not necessary to re-sentence the respondent or to recite or address the material in evidence before this Court that would be germane on re-sentence.
Proposed order
59I propose the following order:
(1)Appeal dismissed.

2704284,R v Linardon [2014] NSWCCA 247,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: David Armando Linardon (the respondent), pleaded guilty at Sutherland Local Court to five charges relating to child pornography (the offences). Four of the offences (the Commonwealth offences) alleged contraventions of various sections of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the Criminal Code). The fifth offence alleged a contravention of s 91H of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

2On 2 August 2013 the respondent was sentenced in the District Court for the offences. The respective charges and sentences imposed by the primary judge were as follows:

(a)For the possession of child abuse material contrary to s 91H of the Crimes Act (NSW) (the State offence), a sentence of a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment dated from 25 July 2013 and expiring on 24 July 2015 was imposed.

(b)For the transmission of child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code (the transmission offence), a sentence of 2 years and 8 months imprisonment commencing on 25 August 2013 and expiring on 24 April 2016 was imposed.

(c)For the accessing of child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code (the access offence), a sentence of 2 years and 8 months imprisonment commencing on 25 September 2013 and expiring on 24 May 2016 was imposed.

(d)For the transmission of an indecent communication to a person under 16 years contrary to s 474.27A of the Criminal Code (the indecent communication offence), a sentence of 2 years imprisonment commencing on 25 October 2014 and expiring on 24 October 2016 was imposed.

(e)For the aggravated offence of transmission of child pornography on three or more occasions to two or more people contrary to s 474.24A(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code (the aggravated transmission offence), a sentence of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 25 November 2013 and expiring on 24 November 2016 was imposed.

3The maximum sentences that can be imposed for the offences are as follows: for the State offence 10 years, for the transmission and access offences 15 years, for the indecent communication offence 7 years and for the aggravated transmission offence 25 years. 

4The sentencing judge, as he was required to do by reason of s 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), fixed a single non-parole period in respect of the Commonwealth offences. The non-parole period was a period of 1 year and 10 months commencing on 25 August 2013 and expiring on 24 June 2015.

5It will be immediately apparent that the whole of the non-parole period ordered in respect of the Commonwealth offences would be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for the State offence.

6The Crown has appealed against the sentences imposed pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).


Factual background

7At the sentencing hearing, the Crown tendered a statement of facts, without objection from the respondent, which summarised the facts relating to each charge.

(a) The State offence

8Following a referral from the United States Department of Justice and the execution of a search warrant on premises occupied by the respondent, three USB devices were located. These contained 4,530 child pornography images and 40 child pornography videos. The images were categorised as follows:

""Category 1

3107 images and 1 video depicted nudity, sexually suggestive posing, surreptitious images focused on underwear, explicit emphasis on genital areas or solo urination

Category 2

291 images and 0 videos depicted solo masturbation by a child, use of penetrative sex toys by the child, or non-penetrative sexual acts between children

Category 3

487 images and 9 videos depicted non-penetrative sexual activity between children and adults, including mutual masturbation and other non-penetrative sexual activity

Category 4

587 images and 28 videos depicted penetrative sexual activity between children and adults. Including, but not limited to, intercourse, cunnilingus and fellatio


Category 5

58 images and 0 videos depicted sadism, bestiality or humiliation (urination, defecation, vomit, bondage etc.), or child abuse material as defined in section 473.1 of Criminal Code Act 1995.""

9The categories referred to above and throughout this judgment are categories on a scale known as the Oliver Scale. Category 1 relates to erotic posing without sexual activity; category 2 relates to sexual activity between children or solo masturbation by a child; category 3 relates to non-penetrative sexual activity between adults and children or an adult and a child; category 4 relates to penetrative sexual activity between adults and children and category 5 relates to sadism or bestiality.

(b) The transmission offence

10A search of the respondent's email account revealed that between 4 April and 28 May 2012 the respondent had transmitted child pornography image/video files to 12 other email accounts (the identities of the accounts were disclosed in the statement of facts but need not be disclosed in this judgment). A total of 256 images/videos were distributed. Not all were transmitted to each account; the highest number transmitted to any one account was 68. Of all the files sent, 49 were category 1, 12 were category 2, 28 were category 3, 128 were category 4 and 39 were category 5.

11In addition there were a total of 29 ""chat sessions"" (in text form) between the respondent and the user of one of the email accounts. Of these, 1 was category 1 and 28 were category 5.

(c) The access offence

12The statement of facts records that the respondent accessed 130 child pornography images/videos in total sent from 4 email accounts. Of these 40 were in category 1, 4 in category 2, 36 in category 3, 41 in category 4 and 9 in category 5.

(d) The indecent communication offence

13The person to which the indecent communication was made was a female who was identified and rescued from a family home in the United States by the FBI. Although the statement of facts does not state this, the Crown submitted to the sentencing judge that she was nine years of age and this appears to have been accepted at the sentencing hearing.

14The respondent transmitted 199 image/video child pornography files to the child. Twenty-five were classified as category 1, 10 as category 2, 77 as category 3, 67 as category 4 and 20 as category 5.

15In addition, there were 13 chat sessions between the respondent and the child, all classified as category 4. An extract of some of these chat sessions was annexed to the statement of facts. They involve the respondent requesting details about the nature of the abuse to which the child was subjected to by her father, requesting naked photographs of her and photographs of her being abused. The child is spoken to in the chat sessions in derogatory and humiliating terms. The following examples referred to in the submissions of the Crown adequately set out the nature of the chat sessions:

""(a) On 8 April 2012, the respondent asked [M] for more pictures of herself; suggested that girls like her were good at fellatio and better than older girls; and praised [M] for fellating her father;

(b) On 19 April 2012, the respondent told [M] he liked the pictures of her very much and asked if he could show them to his (fictitious) 7-year-old niece. The respondent later told [M] that he liked the pictures of her with her father's penis and again praised [M] for fellating her father, including telling her that she knows how to make her father happy;

(c) On 29 April 2012, the respondent asked [M] if she had fellated her father that day and told [M] that he liked the pictures of her having sexual intercourse with her father. The respondent asked [M] whether she enjoyed it and told her that she was a good girl for her father and that he wished he had a daughter like her;

(d) On 30 April 2012, the respondent asked [M] about a dildo depicted in pictures of her and on what parts of her body she uses it. He later describes for [M] a progression of sexual acts between a girl called [A] and [A]'s father.

(e) On 10 May 2012, the respondent asked [M] if she was going to have sexual intercourse with her father in the immediate future.""

(e) The aggravated transmission offence 

16The statement of facts identified three occasions on which child pornography was transmitted. The first occurrence involved distribution to 4 email accounts of a total of 14 images/videos, 6 of which were in category 1, 1 was category 2, 2 were category 3, 2 were category 4 and 3 were category 5.

17The second occasion involved distribution to 3 email accounts of a total of 18 images/videos, 7 of which were category 1, 1 was category 2, 2 were category 3 and 8 were category 4.

18The third occasion involved distribution of a total of 54 images/videos to 3 email accounts, 39 of which were category 1, 12 were category 2 and 3 were category 5.

The remarks on sentence

19The sentencing judge noted that all the offences were serious as shown by the maximum penalties. He noted that in the context of the offences with which he was concerned, considerations of general and specific deterrence loomed large in the sentencing exercise.

20His Honour noted the subjective circumstances of the respondent. He stated the respondent was 48 years of age, married (but separated since being arrested) and having an 8 year old autistic child. The sentencing judge described the respondent as a loving husband and caring father. He stated that until his imprisonment he was living with his mother and had been in fulltime employment.

21The sentencing judge referred to the report of a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Pilsky. This reported that following the respondent being charged and released on bail he became anxious, depressed and suicidal. The judge noted the respondent was admitted to Wesley Hospital, Kogarah, on 9 June 2012 under the care of Dr Pilsky and placed on anti-depressant medication. His suicidal tendencies had decreased by the time he was discharged.

22The sentencing judge stated that the respondent had continued to maintain contact with his son. Such contact however occurred in the presence of either Corrective Services or Probation Service officers, which was upsetting to the son. The sentencing judge stated that in sentencing he had taken into account the matters referred to in s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth) and s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

23The sentencing judge then dealt with the individual offences separately. In relation to the State offence, he stated that the possession of child pornography is a callous and predatory crime and that the material could not come into existence without the exploitation and abuse of children somewhere in the world. The sentencing judge also took into account that one of the reasons for the offender's possession of the material was further distribution. Whether this approach offended the De Simoni principle (The Queen v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383) was not debated on the appeal.

24The sentencing judge, after giving a 20% discount for the plea of guilty, sentenced the respondent to a fixed term of 2 years for this offence commencing on 25 July 2013 and expiring on 24 July 2015.

25The sentencing judge then dealt with the transmission offence (although he mistakenly initially described the facts relating to this offence as relating to the access offence). He accepted the submission of the Crown that as the children depicted were of a very young age, the objective seriousness of the offence was increased.

26The sentencing judge then noted the submission of the respondent that there was no suggestion of proximity between him and those who brought the material into existence and that there was no evidence that the respondent operated in an organised network. The sentencing judge however stated without elaboration that having viewed a range of the material in each category he considered the appropriate sentence was 32 months after making a 20% discount for the plea of guilty. He stated the sentence was to date from 25 August 2013 and to expire on 24 April 2016.

27In relation to the access offence the sentencing judge referred to R v Poynder [2007] NSWCCA 157; (2007) 171 A Crim R 544. He stated that irrespective of whether the offender has no intention of acting out the fantasies in which they are indulging, the conduct has a significant deleterious impact on any child participating in it. He stated that the humiliation of the child was heightened by ""the offender's encouragement to have videos sent to him"". 

28The sentencing judge noted the submission of the Crown that the nature and content of the material could be categorised in the mid to high range of seriousness of child pornography and child abuse material. He stated the material accessed covered all fields and that the material at the more serious end of the scale included material which depicted sexual activity between children and adults and images and videos classified as sadism or bestiality.

29The sentencing judge accepted that there was no evidence that the respondent profited financially. However, he stated that of itself this did not detract from the seriousness of the offence. He stated that through his conduct the respondent contributed to a market for child pornography. In the circumstances he imposed a similar sentence as that which he had imposed for the transmission offence, the sentence to date from 25 September 2013 and expire on 24 May 2016.

30In relation to the indecent communication offence the sentencing judge referred to the fact that the chat sessions showed encouragement to send pictures of particular sexual activity. He also noted that the chat sessions encouraged the child to perform for the camera and emphasised the degradation of the victim.

31The sentencing judge noted the Crown submission that the victim was a nine year old child and the respondent had used his online relationship with her father to gain access to her. He noted the submission that the respondent requested details about the nature of the abuse to which the victim was subjected by her father and requested naked photographs of her being abused. Although the sentencing judge made no findings on these submissions the submission is borne out by the extracts of the chat sessions annexed to the statement of facts.

32The sentencing judge reached the conclusion that the appropriate sentence, after an unspecified discount for the respondent's guilty plea, was 2 years commencing on 25 October 2014 and expiring on 24 October 2016. The discount for the plea presumably was 20% consistent with the discount which was allowed for the other offences.

33In relation to the aggravated transmission offence the sentencing judge noted that the maximum penalty of 25 years indicated the seriousness of the offence.

34The sentencing judge accepted the Crown's submission that by his conduct, the respondent had taken advantage of, contributed to and exacerbated the market of sexual exploitation of children. The sentencing judge also accepted the respondent had used the internet to facilitate and encourage the ongoing corruption and abuse of a child. 

35The sentencing judge stated that, taking into account the penalty the legislature had prescribed for the offence, the appropriate term of imprisonment, but for the guilty plea, would be 45 months. Taking into account the discount for the plea of guilty, the sentencing judge held the appropriate sentence would be reduced to a period of 36 months to date from 25 November 2013 and expire on 24 November 2016.

36The sentencing judge stated that in fixing a non-parole period for the Commonwealth offences he had regard to the report of Dr Pilsky and the evidence of the respondent. He referred to the respondent's evidence of the catastrophic effect that the arrest and charge had on him and his family and his suicidal thoughts. The sentencing judge also had regard to the respondent's evidence that he had attended rehabilitation courses and intended to continue to do so upon his release on parole.

37The sentencing judge referred to the report of Dr Pilsky, which stated that the respondent's addiction to child pornography required ongoing stimulation and served to maintain the offending conduct. He then noted that Dr Pilsky's opinion was that the respondent was a case of typical denial, holding the view that as long as he was not abusing the victim directly, accessing child pornography did not harm anybody.

38The sentencing judge noted the opinion of Dr Pilsky that the respondent required long term treatment and a treatment plan had been extensively discussed with him and he had agreed to all elements of it.

39The sentencing judge referred to the evidence that the respondent was no longer in denial, that his offending was compartmentalised from his ordinary life and that he had never abused a minor directly. The sentencing judge also referred to the respondent's evidence that he had been abused by his uncle when he was a young person.

40The sentencing judge also noted the opinion of Dr Pilsky that the shame of being brought before the Court and the guilt of putting his family through a traumatic experience was sufficient to prevent the respondent from further offending.

41In the circumstances the sentencing judge fixed a non-parole period in respect of the Commonwealth offences of 22 months commencing on 25 August 2013 and expiring on 24 June 2015.

The grounds of appeal

42The appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal:

""1. His Honour erred by imposing a sentence in respect of the offence of transmitting child pornography on 3 or more occasions to two or more people that was manifestly inadequate, particularly having regard to the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment; and

2. His Honour erred by imposing overall sentences that were, in all the circumstances, manifestly inadequate, in that they:

(a) fail to reflect totality in sentencing and the separate offending by way of sufficient accumulation of the sentences imposed; and

(b) fail to reflect a sufficient regard to both specific and general deterrence.""

Ground 1

(a) The parties' submissions

43The Crown submitted that s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act (Cth) required the imposition of a sentence that was of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances. The relevant circumstances included amongst other things the matters specified in s 16A(2), as were relevant and known to the Court.

44The Crown submitted that the aggravated transmission offence carried a significantly greater penalty than the transmission offence. The Crown submitted that this reflected the intention of Parliament that persons convicted of an aggravated transmission offence would, in the ordinary course, incur a significantly greater penalty than for a transmission offence.

45The Crown acknowledged that the sentencing judge referred to the maximum penalty for the aggravated transmission offence but submitted that his characterisation of the seriousness of the offence was not reflected in the sentence imposed. The Crown pointed out the sentence was only a few months greater than the sentences imposed for the access offence and the transmission offences.

46Senior counsel for the Crown accepted that the maximum penalty provided for the offence was a yardstick to be taken into account with all other relevant factors. However, he submitted that it was an important yardstick to which the sentencing judge should have paid greater regard.

47Senior counsel for the Crown accepted that there was no network involved in the present case. However he submitted that the reference to ""networks"" in the second reading speech to the legislation introducing the aggravated transmission offence (the Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences Against Children) Bill 2010 (Cth)) (the Second Reading Speech), could not be used to limit the words of the section.

48Senior counsel for the Crown also submitted that no assistance could be gained from the sentence imposed by the District Court in R v Coupland (NSWDC, 22 June 2012) as it was a different offence, not being a transmission case.

49The respondent in his submissions referred to R v Coupland supra. He pointed out that in that case the offender was found to be operating in an established network of 187 persons sharing 511 files. He pointed to the fact that despite the relatively less serious nature of the offences in the present case, a sentence of 2 years and 8 months was imposed in R v Coupland compared to 3 years in the present case.

50The respondent submitted that the factors outlined in Minehan v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 140; (2010) 201 A Crim R 243 provided indicia for the assessment of the objective seriousness of offences involving child pornography. He emphasised that there was no evidence to suggest proximity between him and those who brought the pornography into existence and no evidence that he operated within an organised network.

51The respondent also submitted that the Crown in the sentencing hearing stated, contrary to Minehan v The Queen supra, that the lack of financial benefit did not detract from the seriousness of the offence. He also submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that any victim as portrayed in the images was aware of his activities or that his activities created a network for child pornography. He submitted that the fact that the sentencing judge took those matters into account operated unfairly against him. 

52The respondent also pointed to the Second Reading Speech stating that the aggravated transmission offence was directed to child pornography networks, something not involved in the present case. 

53Counsel for the respondent whilst accepting the maximum penalty was the yardstick to be taken into account, pointed to the fact that the offence could encompass a wide variety of circumstances. He pointed out in the present case that 86 images were transmitted to 10 persons, 52 of which were in the lowest category. He submitted this was a far less serious offence than that dealt with in R v Coupland supra.

54The respondent also pointed to the subjective circumstances. He submitted that the evidence established that he had a significantly improved level of insight into the effect of his behaviour, noting the material in the report of Dr Pilsky and his evidence to which I have referred in pars [37]-[39] above. The respondent submitted that there was clear evidence of a treatment programme in the report of Dr Pilsky. He submitted that that evidence would persuade the Court the sentence was not manifestly inadequate.

Consideration

55It is well established that for manifest inadequacy to be made out it must be established that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25]. Alternatively, the sentence must be outside the range of sentences that could have been imposed such that the appellate court concludes there must have been some misapplication of principle even though where or how is not apparent from the statement of reasons: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [59] and Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [58].

56As I indicated, the Crown placed particular reliance on the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence. However, it must be remembered that the maximum penalty is a yardstick to be taken into account with all other relevant matters, including in the case of Commonwealth offences, the matters referred to in s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth). In Markarian v The Queen supra at [30]-[31] the plurality emphasised that careful attention to the maximum penalty will almost always be required. This is because it makes possible a comparison between the worst possible case and the one before the court and because it provides, taken and balanced with all other relevant factors, a yardstick.

57In Minehan v The Queen supra, R A Hulme J, after a review of the authorities, conveniently summarised factors to be taken into account concerning offences involving the possession and dissemination of child pornography, when assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. His Honour at [94] summarised the position as follows (Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreeing):

""[94] Drawing primarily from the authorities to which I have referred, the following matters may be relevant to an assessment of the objective seriousness of offences involving the possession or dissemination/transmission of child pornography:

Whether actual children were used in the creation of the material.

The nature and content of the material, including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed.

The extent of any cruelty or physical harm occasioned to the children that may be discernible from the material.

The number of images or items of material - in a case of possession, the significance lying more in the number of different children depicted.

In a case of possession, the offender's purpose, whether for his/her own use or for sale or dissemination. In this regard, care is needed to avoid any infringement of the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383; 5 A Crim R 329.

In a case of dissemination/transmission, the number of persons to whom the material was disseminated/transmitted.

Whether any payment or other material benefit (including the exchange of child pornographic material) was made, provided or received for the acquisition or dissemination/transmission.

The proximity of the offender's activities to those responsible for bringing the material into existence.

The degree of planning, organisation or sophistication employed by the offender in acquiring, storing, disseminating or transmitting the material.

Whether the offender acted alone or in a collaborative network of like-minded persons.

Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by vulnerable persons, particularly children.

Any risk of the material being seen or acquired by persons susceptible to act in the manner described or depicted.

Any other matter in s 21A(2) or (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (for State offences) or s 16A Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (for Commonwealth offences) bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offence.""

58In this context the Victorian Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v D'Alessandro [2010] VSCA 60; (2010) 26 VR 477 noted there was substantial support across jurisdictions for a number of propositions (per Harper JA at [21], Williams AJA agreeing):

""[21] When construing and applying Commonwealth legislation, this Court follows principles of comity in according respect to the decisions of intermediate appellate courts of other jurisdictions concerning the same legislation. It is therefore worth recording that there seems to be unanimous support across the jurisdictions for a number of propositions. First, that the problem of child pornography is an international one. Secondly, that the prevalence and ready availability of pornographic material involving children, particularly on the internet, demands that general deterrence must be a paramount consideration. Thirdly, that those inclined to exploit children by involving them in the production of child pornography are encouraged by the fact that there is a market for it. Fourthly, that those who make up that market cannot escape responsibility for such exploitation. Fifthly, that limited weight must be given to an offender's prior good character. Sixthly, that a range of factors bear upon the objective seriousness of the offences to which the respondent in this case pleaded guilty.They include:

the nature and content of the pornographic material - including the age of the children and the gravity of the sexual activity portrayed;

the number of images or items of material possessed by the offender;

whether the possession or importation is for the purpose of sale or further distribution;

whether the offender will profit from the offence.""
(References omitted).

See also R v Gent [2005] NSWCCA 370; (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at [64].

59What is clear from the cases is that general deterrence is a matter of considerable significance in sentencing for offences of this nature. 

60Taking the matters referred to in those cases into account, along with the subjective factors relevant to the respondent to which the trial judge referred (see pars [36]-[40] above), I am of the view the sentence was not manifestly inadequate.

61In assessing the objective seriousness of the offence, it is necessary to bear in mind that the aggravated transmission offence involved the minimum number of occasions of transmission necessary for the offence to be committed. Second, the transmission on each occasion went to no more than four email accounts. Third, well over half the images/videos transmitted were in the least serious category (category 1), whilst only approximately 19% were in the worst two categories. 

62Further, the Second Reading Speech cannot be used to read down the plain words of the legislation in the manner suggested by the respondent: see Certain Lloyd's Underwriters v Cross [2012] HCA 56; (2012) 248 CLR 378 at [25] and [26]. However, the fact that the respondent was not a member of a network is a relevant factor as is the fact that the respondent did not profit from the dissemination of the material.

63This is not to gainsay the seriousness of the offence involving the promotion and maintenance of a market for sexual exploitation, degradation and humiliation of young children. The seriousness is evident from the significant maximum penalty and more importantly the effect of this type of conduct on child victims. However, it remains the fact that in my view the offence is towards the lower end of the range of offences of this nature. Further, in this context it must be recognised that the judge was cognisant of the maximum penalty. 

64Taking these matters into account it seems to me that a sentence of 3 years, after a 20% discount for the guilty plea, whilst lenient, could not be said to be manifestly inadequate. Questions of accumulation and the non-parole period are dealt with in Ground 2.

65It follows that this ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 2

(a) The parties' submissions

66During the course of the hearing there was a debate as to the scope of this ground. Senior counsel for the Crown contended that the ground was not confined to the particulars but was wide enough to challenge the individual sentences. Further, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that Ground 2(b) envisaged a challenge to the individual sentences as failing to pay sufficient regard to both general and specific deterrence.

67The issue arose specifically in relation to the indecent communication offence.

68Counsel for the respondent stated that he had a ""disquiet"" about the raising of this issue. He submitted that the grounds of appeal were all about totality. However, he conceded that during the sentencing proceedings at first instance he had submitted that logically the conduct the subject of the indecent communication offence was different and might result in some accumulation.

69Notwithstanding, counsel for the respondent stated that it was his primary submission that the Court should not elide the distinction made in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. Namely, the need to give separate consideration to the term of each individual sentence before issues of accumulation and totality are considered.

70The written submissions for the Crown on this ground focused on what was described as manifest inadequacy by ""manifestly excessive concurrency"". The Crown submitted that the total head sentence was manifestly inadequate because of insufficient accumulation and for similar reasons the single non-parole period for the Commonwealth offences was also manifestly inadequate.

71In dealing with this issue at the hearing senior counsel for the Crown emphasised that the indecent communication offence was part of a separate stream of offences to the access and transmission offences, which involved no direct communication with any child. He accepted that care had to be taken not to offend the principle in The Queen v De Simoni supra by relying on facts which would have constituted the offence of grooming, contrary to s 474.27 of the Criminal Code. Such an offence carries a more serious maximum penalty. He emphasised in this context that it was important to focus on the communications themselves as distinct from the effect they may have had on the child's conduct.

72In this context senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the level of depravity contained in the communication itself puts the offence at the highest level of indecent communication. He stated that it was difficult to think of a worse category of this particular offence.

73The Crown submitted that the respondent was an end user and supplier of child pornography. In addition it was submitted he was a person who encouraged the production of child pornography. It was submitted that the State, transmission and access offences committed by the respondent were not offences where sentences for one could reflect the criminality of the other. 

74The Crown also emphasised that the transmission and access offences necessarily involved a degree of leniency, because each involved numerous acts of access and transmission that were capable of constituting separate offences. The Crown submitted that a sentence in which the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offences was wholly subsumed within the fixed term for the State offence was manifestly inadequate.

75The Crown submitted that the prevalence and ready availability of child pornography, particularly on the internet, demanded that general deterrence be the primary sentencing consideration for the offences in question. It was submitted that specific deterrence was also highly relevant, particularly having regard to the following factors. First, the number and nature of videos and images in the respondent's possession; second, the finding of the judge that one reason for possession was further distribution; third, the fact that the offending was not isolated and involved a variety of offences; fourth, the encouragement of the nine year old girl to provide details of the abuse to which she was subject; fifth, the fact that the respondent attempted to minimise the seriousness of his offence by asserting he had never abused a minor directly; sixth, the lack of any genuine insight as to the effect of his actions; and finally, the lack of any clear strategy to address the risk of re-offending.

76Senior counsel for the Crown also submitted that it was not correct that the Crown had suggested to the Court below that an accumulation of one month between the different Commonwealth offences was appropriate. He submitted that the solicitor who had appeared at the hearing merely made reference to a case where that occurred.

77The respondent submitted that the principle of totality could never be subservient to sentence structure. He submitted the decision to accumulate is limited by the need to keep the sentences proportional to the offending conduct.

78The respondent submitted that the Crown had in fact urged the Court to impose substantially concurrent sentences. He put that the Crown had suggested accumulation which would result in a net increase of sentence of 3 months and that the judge sentenced in accordance with that suggestion.

79The respondent submitted that if the sentences were manifestly inadequate there was no purpose in singling out the failure to take account of general or specific deterrence as a ground for error. He also contended that in submitting that inadequate account was taken of the need for specific deterrence, the Crown was seeking to overturn the findings in favour of the respondent made by the sentencing judge on that issue.

80The respondent also emphasised no complaint was made as to the adequacy of individual sentences. I refer to the debate on this issue above.

81In relation to the indecent communication offence, counsel for the respondent emphasised the caution which had to be taken to avoid offending the De Simoni principle. He submitted it was not an incitement offence or a grooming offence and that consideration should be limited to the type of communication itself.

82Counsel for the respondent submitted that even if error was demonstrated the Court in the exercise of its residual discretion should not resentence the respondent. He submitted any variation to the sentence for the aggravated transmission offence would only amount to tinkering and because of the absence of any obvious error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge, the case had limited capacity to expound principles to guide the lower courts. He also submitted that the Crown should be bound by the conduct it took at the sentencing hearing.

(b) Consideration

83As the argument at the hearing developed this ground essentially raised two issues. First, whether the sentence on the indecent communication offence was manifestly inadequate and, second, whether the overall sentence failed to reflect totality in sentencing by way of sufficient accumulation of the sentences imposed.

84As I indicated there was some debate on the question of whether the ground of appeal was wide enough to encompass the first issue. In my opinion it was. The opening words of Ground 2 refer to sentences in the plural and it was stated relevantly that they (the sentences) were manifestly inadequate in that they failed to reflect a sufficient regard to both general and specific deterrence.

85The trial judge dealt with the sentence for the indecent communication offence relatively briefly and it is useful to set out his remarks in full:

""The next offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty is that between 7 April 2012 and 12 May 2012 he did transmit indecent communication to a person under sixteen contrary to s 474.27A subs (1) of the Criminal Code 1995. On the agreed facts between September 2012 and November 2012 a review was made of a copy of the data acquired from the offender's yahoo e-mail and chat communications. It was determined that the defendant had transmitted indecent communications to a person under sixteen years of age through e-mail account [...].The review of communications between the offender and the under sixteen years user of the e-mail address identified 199 image/video child pornography files were transmitted by the offender's e-mail account [...].

Of the 199 image video files which were classified as child pornography, twenty-five were classified as category 1, ten as category 2, seventy-seven as category 3, sixty-seven as category4 and twenty as category 5 on the Oliver scale. In additionthere were a total of thirteen chat sessions between theoffender and the under sixteen years user of e-mail account [...]. Of the thirteen chat sessions, thirteen were classified as category 4 on the Oliver scale. An extract from some of the chats are attached to the Crown brief. The chats show encouragement to send pictures that would be required of the particular sexual activity and show encouragement for the child to perform for the camera and emphasise the degradation of the victim.

In relation to this offence the Crown submits that the victim was a nine year old girl and that the offender had used his on-line relationship with the victim's father to gain access by way of e-mail and chats to the victim. The Crown also submits that the offender requested details about the nature of the abuse that the victim was subjected to by her father and requested naked photographs of the victim and photographs of the victim being abused. This is a reference to the chats to which I have earlier referred. I consider that the appropriate term of imprisonment for this offence would be a period of imprisonment of two years after taking into account his plea of guilty which would commence on 25 October 2014 and would expire on 24 October 2016.""

86It would seem that the sentencing judge concluded that the appropriate sentence prior to taking into account the plea of guilty was 2 years and 6 months.

87Although the sentencing judge made brief reference at the outset of his remarks on sentence that general deterrence and specific deterrence loom large in the sentencing exercise before him, there is nothing to suggest he took the importance of general deterrence into account in considering the appropriate sentence for the indecent communication offence. His reasoning was confined to a general description of the images and chat sessions, noting the submissions of the Crown without identifying whether he accepted or rejected them in imposing the sentence. 

88It seems to me in those circumstances the sentencing judge failed to turn his mind to the issue of general deterrence. It follows in my opinion that the sentencing judge erred in sentencing the respondent for this offence on this ground. In resentencing the respondent for this offence I have emphasised the factors that demonstrate the importance of general deterrence and why the failure by the sentencing judge to take this and specific deterrence into account, resulted in a manifestly inadequate sentence (as to which see pars [98]-[106] below).

89The sentencing judge in my opinion also erred in dealing with the issues of accumulation and totality. The structure of the sentences imposed resulted in the whole of the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offences being served concurrently with the State offence. Further, the transmission and the access offences were to be served concurrently, save for a period of one month with a total term of imprisonment for all offences being 3 years and 4 months.

90In my opinion the approach taken by the sentencing judge failed to take into account the overall criminality involved in all the offences for which the respondent was convicted: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 308, Pearce v The Queen supra at [40] and R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [11]-[14]. Whilst this is most evident in the non-parole period for the Commonwealth offences, it is also reflected in my view in the overall sentence. Further, the fact that there was only a total of one month's accumulation in respect of the access and transmission offences' sentences and the fact that the indecent communication offence sentence was to be served wholly concurrently with the other sentences, failed in my opinion to take account of the different nature of the criminality involved in each offence.

91In these circumstances, Ground 2 of the grounds of appeal has been made out.

The residual discretion

92It is necessary to consider whether notwithstanding the errors made by the sentencing judge, the Court in the exercise of its residual discretion should decline to resentence the respondent. That discretion is to be exercised having regard to the fact that the principal purpose of Crown sentence appeals is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons: see Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [1] and the cases cited. The plurality at [36] described the purpose as a limiting purpose, not extending to the general correction of errors made by the sentencing judge: see also R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [70].

93In Director of Public Prosecutions v Karazisis [2010] VSCA 350; (2010) 31 VR 634, the Victorian Court of Appeal at [104] stated that factors which might be relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion included delay, parity, the totality principle, rehabilitation and fault on the part of the Crown: see also Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen supra at [36] where Director of Public Prosecutions v Karazisis is cited with apparent approval (fn 101).

94In the present case it seems to me that the Court should resentence the respondent notwithstanding the residual discretion. The sentence on the indecent communication offence was manifestly inadequate, as was the degree of accumulation and the total sentence imposed. Further, no regard was paid to the principles underlying sentences for cases of this nature laid down by this Court in Minehan v The Queen supra and by the Victorian Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v D'Alessandro supra. It is necessary in my opinion to send clear guidance to sentencing courts as to the seriousness of these offences and the principles to be applied in dealing with them, particularly the need for general deterrence.

95There was no delay in the bringing of the appeal in the present case. The Crown had indicated on the day of sentence that it would consider appealing and lodged its notice of appeal one month after that date. It was not suggested the appeal was not properly prosecuted.

96The matter principally relied on by the respondent in support of the proposition that the residual discretion should be exercised in his favour, was that the Crown submissions influenced the sentencing judge in determining both the length of the individual sentences and the appropriate degree of accumulation. The Crown submitted that there had to be some accumulation but not entire accumulation and referred to a decision involving somewhat similar offences, where the accumulation was apparently one month. However, the Crown did not submit that this course should be adopted, accepting that it was a matter for the sentencing judge.

97In these circumstances in my opinion it is appropriate to proceed to resentence the respondent.


Resentencing

(a) The indecent communication offence

98Consistently with what was said in Pearce v The Queen supra at [45], it is appropriate to determine the sentence which should be imposed for this offence prior to dealing with issues of accumulation or concurrence and the question of totality.

99The matters giving rise to the offence involve the transmission of 199 images/videos to a 9 year old child, 87 of which were in categories 4 and 5 on the Oliver scale. I have set out material indicating the nature of the chat sessions involved at par [15] above. The communications and the request made to the child are of the most degrading and humiliating kind, although not involving incitement or grooming. Although it is possible to envisage worse cases of this offence, these communications with a young child are of a very high level of seriousness.

100The need for general deterrence in sentencing for an offence of this nature must be emphasised. The ease of availability of this type of pornography on the internet and the ease that the internet can be used for communications such as those in question in the present case, highlight the need for general deterrence, particularly in the case of conduct directed to young children.

101In the present case there is also the need for specific deterrence. The report of Dr Pilsky states that the respondent has discussed a treatment plan with him and he has agreed to all elements and that in Dr Pilsky's opinion the respondent falls into a low risk category with regard to future offending. 

102However, although the respondent said in his evidence he was willing to follow any recommendations of his psychiatrist once he re-entered the community, he stated he was not aware of any strategies or treatment to help him in addressing his sexual interest in children other than medication. He also stated that he was not undergoing any therapies with Dr Pilsky besides medication to address that sexual interest and he was not aware of any treatment plan after his release from custody. 

103Further, the respondent stated that he did not know what the effect his conduct would have been on the children depicted on the images/videos. He subsequently qualified this by saying he did not know the extent of the effect and then stated as a result of his treatment he now believed it would be quite damaging. In relation to the indecent communication offence, he stated that during the chat sessions he had with the girl he was not aware of the harm she would experience as a result of her father's abuse although he said he understood at the time of sentencing that she would not have enjoyed the abuse.

104This evidence demonstrates in my opinion that although the respondent has some insight into the serious consequences of his offending and has expressed a willingness to undergo recommended treatment, there remains a risk of his re-offending and the need for some measure of specific deterrence.

105I have taken into account the subjective circumstances outlined by the sentencing judge, to which I have referred above (see pars [36]-[40]) and to the matters raised by the respondent on appeal (to which I refer in par [54] above). I have also taken into account the remorse shown by the respondent, reflected in his plea of guilty and the evidence given by him before the sentencing judge. I have paid some regard to the fact that apart from these offences, the respondent was otherwise of good character.

106Taking all the matters I have referred to above into account, I am of the view that the appropriate sentence for this offence is imprisonment for a term of 4 years and 2 months. I accept that the discount of 20%, apparently allowed by the sentencing judge for the willingness of the respondent to facilitate the course of justice as demonstrated by the plea, should be allowed. In these circumstances the appropriate sentence on this count is a term of imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months.

Accumulation and totality

107In considering the question of accumulation and totality I am prepared to accept that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge for the State, access and transmission offences are appropriate and I have concluded that the sentence imposed for the aggravated transmission offence was not manifestly inadequate.

108In the circumstances I am of the opinion that a total term of 5 years imprisonment is an appropriate sentence to reflect the overall criminality in the present case. I would structure the sentence in the following manner so as to reflect the criminality involved in each offence:

(i)For the State offence a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 25 July 2013 and expiring on 24 July 2015.

(ii)For the transmission offence a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 25 November 2013 and expiring on 24 July 2016.

(iii)For the access offence a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 25 March 2014 and expiring on 24 November 2016.

(iv)For the aggravated transmission offence a term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 July 2017.

(v)For the indecent communication offence a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 4 months commencing on 25 March 2015 and expiring on 24 July 2018.

109A single non-parole period is required to be set for the Commonwealth offences by virtue of s 19AB of the Crimes Act (Cth). In all the circumstances I would set a single non-parole period for those offences of 3 years commencing on 25 November 2013 and expiring on 24 November 2016.

Orders

110In the result I would make the following orders:

(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)Order that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge on 2 August 2013 be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences imposed:

(a)For possession of child abuse material contrary to s 91H of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 25 July 2013 and expiring on 24 July 2015.

(b)For the offence of using a carriage service to transmit child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 25 November 2013 and expiring on 24 July 2016.

(c)For the offence of using a carriage service to access child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) a term of imprisonment of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 25 March 2014 and expiring on 24 November 2016.

(d)For the aggravated offence of transmitting child pornography on three or more occasions to two or more people contrary to s 474.24A(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) a term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing on 25 July 2014 and expiring on 24 July 2017.

(e)For the offence of using a carriage service to transmit an indecent communication to a person under the age of 16 years contrary to s 474.27A of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) a term of imprisonment of 3 years and 4 months commencing on 25 March 2015 and expiring on 24 July 2018.

(3)With respect to the offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) there be imposed a single non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 25 November 2013 and expiring on 24 November 2016.

111ADAMS J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

2704285,R v Brandon; R v Flaus [2014] NSWDC 337,"Judgment


	
	Andrew Brandon and Jason Flaus were involved in what one of their counsel called an “immature and childish exercise”. But that exercise amounted to a serious crime. They were not professional thieves. They were pushing along a shopping trolley at twenty to four in the morning through Raymond Terrace. The police became understandably suspicious when they saw them and found the shopping trolley full of what turned out to be stolen goods.
	
	
	This happened on Tuesday 25 February 2014. The police arrested both men and interviewed them. When Mr Brandon was interviewed he owned up to breaking into the local Woolworths in Raymond Terrace not long before police saw them in the street. Not only that, Mr Brandon volunteered that they had broken into the same Woolworths a few days beforehand.
	
	
	Both men were charged with two crimes. Each was the same, called aggravated break, enter and steal in company. The aggravation is being in company. They are crimes against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards that crime very seriously. That can be seen by the fact that Parliament has fixed a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment to the offence. Not only that, Parliament has fixed a standard non-parole period of five years to the offence.
	
	
	Each man pleaded guilty at what is agreed by Mr H Fitzhardinge, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, was the earliest available opportunity.
	
	
	They are before me today to be sentenced for their crimes. Mr Brandon is represented by Mr P Krisenthal of counsel and Mr Flaus is represented by Ms R Suters of counsel.
	
	
	It is important to say something about each of the young men. Andrew Brandon has just recently turned nineteen. He was only eighteen and a few months when he committed these offences. He has no criminal record at all and that will provide him some credit. Jason Flaus is not much older. He is twenty-four and had just turned twenty-four when he committed the offence. He does have a criminal record which includes common assault and contravening an apprehended violence order, as well as some traffic offences.
	
	
	We are told something about each young man by presentence reports. Nerida Newton in her report about Andrew Brandon points out that he is living with his mother and stepfather in Muswellbrook and was brought up in a supportive relationship, although he had some issues with his brothers. Mr Krisenthal pointed out that in fact those issues had led to him leaving home and he was living away from home when he committed these offences. He could not explain to Ms Newton why he had committed the offences other than to say that he was just “following my mates”. He was apparently hungry and could not afford food. He is undertaking a course in language, numeracy and literacy.
	
	
	It was Racquel Mason who prepared the presentence report for Jason Flaus. She pointed out that he had been supervised before on a bond he received for the assault and had what she described as “an unsatisfactory response to supervision”. But she also noted that his “behaviour was transient and resistant”. That may be explained by her observation that he is homeless in the sense that he is living in temporary accommodation with friends. Indeed, his parents are in the same situation.
	
	
	Neither young man is in employment at the moment.
	
	
	Ms Suters, who appeared for Mr Flaus, called him to give evidence. He confirmed his accommodation situation and affirmed the support he receives from his family. He appreciated the seriousness of the charge. To his credit, he explained that he did not want his parents in court because of the stress that it would cause them. He seemed to demonstrate a sense of the impact on others of his behaviour. He acknowledged a serious drinking problem which he is now moderating. He has problems with prohibited drugs but described his behaviour in that regard as social. He has a plan to get his driver licence and a job and to get some permanent accommodation for himself. He has been engaged in community employment through a Commonwealth government agency and has enjoyed the work that he has done at the botanical gardens at Raymond Terrace. He acknowledged, when Mr Fitzhardinge cross-examined him, that it was the police who told him about the earlier break and enter at Woolworths and he acknowledged his role in that during the interview.
	
	
	Ms Suters prepared very helpful written submissions which were also adopted by Mr Krisenthal. I accept her submissions describing the relative seriousness of the offences as being quite low for the reasons that she gave in those submissions (which became MFI 1). She also compared her client’s case with the guideline judgment given by the Court of Criminal Appeal for these kinds of crimes in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. Again, there were distinctions which show that her client’s and Mr Krisenthal’s client’s participation was less serious. I also agree that there were no aggravating factors under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and I accept her submissions regarding the mitigating factors.
	
	
	I do not accept her submission regarding a discount for her client according to the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603. It became apparent that her client was disentitled to this when he frankly and obviously honestly acknowledged that it was the police who alerted him to the earlier break-in. It seems that Mr Brandon or one of the other co-offenders - there were more than these two involved - told the police about the earlier break-in.
	
	
	Ms Suters points to the fact that the three co-offenders of these two men were all juveniles. She refers me to authority which supports the proposition that although the parity principle is not strictly applicable, those sentences are not irrelevant. She pointed out that two of the juvenile offenders received non-custodial sentences. One of them received a control order but had an extensive record.
	
	
	Both Mr Krisenthal and Ms Suters point me to s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which prohibits me from sentencing an offender to imprisonment unless I am satisfied “having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate”. I accept that submission. The objective seriousness of the offences is very low and of particular significance is the fact that both men, particularly Andrew Brandon, are very young. A judge hesitates before sending into adult custody for the first time people as young as these two men are.
	
	
	Both have pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. That is of benefit to the criminal justice system and it also indicates their contrition. Mr Brandon though does get the benefit of a discount because he owned up to the earlier Woolworths break-in.
	
	
	I accept Mr Krisenthal’s submission that this crime was immature and childish.
	
	
	Mr Fitzhardinge fairly acknowledged that a good behaviour bond for each man was in the available range of sentences. I therefore propose to deal with them in that way.
	


HIS HONOUR: I am just going to depart from my reasons. I am going to impose that in a moment and I would like Mr Fitzhardinge, Ms Suters and Mr Krisenthal to be thinking about the conditions, apart from the standard ones.


	
	Mr Brandon, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on you, I make an order directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for two years. I make that direction under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The terms or conditions of the good behaviour bond are these:
	



	
	That you be of good behaviour
	
	
	That you notify the registrar of this Court of any change in your address
	
	
	That you come to court if you receive a notice to do so.
	



	
	Mr Flaus, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on you, I make an order under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for two years. The conditions of that bond are:
	



	
	That you be of good behaviour
	
	
	That you notify the registrar at this Court of any change in your address
	
	
	That you attend court if called upon to do so.
	


HIS HONOUR: I am going to ask each of your counsel and the prosecutor about any other conditions.

KRISENTHAL: In relation to Mr Brandon, your Honour, the Probation and Parole authorities seem to think that it may be appropriate for him to be supervised and I'd support that conclusion.

HIS HONOUR: Good, and Ms Suters?

SUTERS: Your Honour, I would also say that there should be the inclusion of to accept the supervision of Probation and Parole. Page 2 of Mr Flaus’ report also recommends there can be a number of programmes that they can assist him with.

HIS HONOUR: Good, thanks. Do you agree, Mister--

FITZHARDINGE: I agree, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks.


	
	Mr Brandon, a final condition of your good behaviour bond is that you accept supervision by Community Corrections and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions which any officer of that service gives you regarding continual engagement with local job network providers and engaging in pro-social activities.
	
	
	Mr Flaus, a further condition of your good behaviour bond is that you accept supervision by Community Corrections and all reasonable recommendations and directions from officers of that service, including referral to alcohol or other drug use intervention and monitoring of your attendance, monitoring of your mental health and any intervention, and monitoring and encouragement in your employment seeking.
	


OFFENDER FLAUS: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: Okay? Anything else at all?

SUTERS: Would your Honour perhaps include a condition that ties into the final condition for Mr Flaus that he’s to report to the Maitland Community Corrections office within seven days? Just so that they can be aware he has now entered that bond and aware of--

HIS HONOUR: Good, and what about your client?

KRISENTHAL: My client, Muswellbrook, your Honour, also within that seven days.


	
	Mr Flaus, you are to report to the Community Corrections office at Maitland on or before next Thursday 13 November 2014.
	
	
	Mr Brandon, you are to report to the Muswellbrook Community Corrections office on or before next Thursday 13 November 2014.
	


OFFENDER BRANDON: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Now, look, you two, I will speak to both of you. You have been lucky and unlucky. You did a really stupid thing which, as I said, the community regards as a serious crime. You broke and entered - a commercial break and enter into a supermarket - and Parliament regards that as a twenty year gaol term. That is the kind of crime you have committed. It is not something which carries two years or a fine or a bad traffic record or anything like that. You are in the big league. Now, it was a stupid and silly offence and relatively minor, which is why I have agreed with each of your counsel to give you a good behaviour bond, which is pretty lenient, and in doing that I am not putting anyone at risk except the community. So I am going to let you two out for two years on good behaviour and that means that the community risks you two breaking out again and doing the same kind of thing, but I am confident that you will not.

You are both on a good behaviour bond which you will have to go and sign up for I think in the registry here. Both of you have to attend, you to Muswellbrook, Mr Brandon, on or before Thursday of next week and Mr Flaus to Maitland, same time. The conditions of your bond are good behaviour. One of you has had the bond. Who had the bond before?

OFFENDER FLAUS: Me.

HIS HONOUR: Yeah, you have. So you know what a good behaviour bond is. They were not very impressed by your cooperation last time, so I want you to toe the line this time. You were showing a degree of maturity when you gave evidence.

OFFENDER FLAUS: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: But you have got to both stay out of trouble. So no little stashes of dope or getting drunk or drink driving or anything like that. You have got to stay out of trouble for two years, which means you get on with your lives and start changing things around.

If you change your address, and particularly you, Mr Flaus, if you have to move you have got to let them know. Send them an e-mail, write them a letter and post it, come and tell them where you are living. And if you get a notice in the mail to say you have got to turn up, you turn up. We do not want to have to send the sheriff or the police out after you.

The final conditions are the most important and that is when you turn up next week or later this week to Community Corrections and let them supervise you. You, Mr Brandon, will be supervised by them and they are going to help you with the job networks and pro-social activities so that you get to mix with the right people. You, Mr Flaus, the areas they are going to work on is alcohol and other drug intervention and monitoring. It sounds as though you have made a start on that, which is very good.

OFFENDER FLAUS: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: And mental health, because people can get very stressed living the kind of existence you are. You do not need to be told that, by the sounds of it. And to encourage you in getting a job, and that is something you want to do yourself.

This is an opportunity for you two young men to get your lives back on track and get on with your lives so you can have a life which will not be interfered with by this sort of thing. Do you both understand?

OFFENDER BRANDON: Yes, your Honour.

OFFENDER FLAUS: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right, good luck.

2704287,R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 11) [2014] NSWSC 1570,"ex tempore Judgment

Concerning pp 144 and 1372 of MFI 49


	
	This is the fifty-second day of the trial. The evidence-in-chief of the first accused, Anthony James Dickson, occupied a number of days and was completed on the fifty-first day of the trial.
	
	
	Primarily as a result of the content of his evidence, the Crown undertook various enquiries and re-considered some material that was apparently available to it. This material was then reduced to a form of two statements with annexures. Just prior to Mr Dickson finishing his evidence, these statements were served on both accused. The Crown indicated that it wished to cross-examine Mr Dickson on the contents of that material and, if necessary, seek either to re-open its case to rely on the material or lead it by way of reply.
	
	
	The author of one of those statements was Chris Harvey, an officer of the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”), who has already given evidence. The author of the other statement was an Australian Federal Police Officer, Ian Durrand. One aspect of the material referred to in Mr Durrand's statement was refined during argument this morning.
	
	
	Objection was taken to the use by the Crown of this material. At the outset I indicate that I am not prepared to countenance the Crown, in effect, re-opening its case. There is really nothing that has been demonstrated that would warrant that exceptional course. In substance, I am only treating this as truly an application to lead evidence by way of reply or rebuttal to what has emerged from Mr Dickson's evidence and, as part of that, to raise the material with him in cross-examination.
	
	
	In this context I will deal with Mr Harvey's statement first. The critical part of Mr Harvey's statement is paragraphs 14 to 16 which set out his recollection of a telephone conversation he had with Mr Dickson on 16 February 2010 and his follow-up dealings with Mr Dickson in relation to the delivery of some further folders of documents. This also needs to be considered with a file note concerning the conversation on 16 February 2010 that he prepared.
	
	
	In his evidence in chief Mr Dickson referred to a conversation he had had with Mr Harvey in some detail. The conversation referred to the material that Mr Dickson said that he would provide in response to a letter from the ATO which was, in effect, auditing the tax returns that had just been lodged by NeuMedix Health Australasia Pty Limited (“NHA”). The terms of the conversation, as recounted by Mr Dickson, appear to have particular significance in explaining why certain documents were provided to the ATO and perhaps why others were not but were later tendered in evidence in Mr Dickson's case.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr Dickson referred to the passage from R v Chin [1985] HCA 35; 157 CLR 671 at 676 to 677 concerning the discretion of a trial judge to allow the calling of further evidence after evidence has been given for the defence. In particular, it was said that should be permitted:
	


“… only if the circumstances are very special or exceptional and, generally speaking, not if the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably to have been foreseen.”


	
	It was also stated that:
	


“The principle applies where the prosecution seeks to call evidence to rebut matters raised for the first time by the defence; if the rebutting of evidence was itself relevant to prove the prosecution case unless, perhaps, it was no more than marginally, minimally or doubtfully relevant … and the need to give it could have been foreseen it will, generally speaking, be rejected.”


	
	This statement of principle has to be considered along with the well established rule of professional practice that requires that when counsel has the opportunity to cross-examine a witness, including a Crown witness, about a conversation said to have occurred with their client, their client's version should generally be raised with that witness so that witness could be given the opportunity to comment.
	
	
	The difficulty in this case is that some very critical parts of what Mr Dickson said occurred in the conversation with Mr Harvey were not raised with Mr Harvey when he was first called. In terms of R v Chin, the Crown could quite reasonably expect that the rule of professional practice to which I have adverted to, which is often sourced to the decision in Browne v Dunn (1829) 3 Sim 23; 57 ER 909, will be applied. It was entitled to take the view that there was nothing of substance on the accused's, Mr Dickson's, case that occurred in the conversation with Mr Harvey.
	
	
	Instead, as I have indicated, it emerged from Mr Dickson's evidence that matters of substance were, at least on his case, definitely discussed. In those circumstances, I have no hesitation in allowing the Crown to raise with Mr Dickson in cross-examination and then lead in by way of rebuttal, if necessary, that part of Mr Harvey's statement which deals with his conversations with Mr Dickson and the supporting file note.
	
	
	The balance of the statement up to paragraph 28 deals with correspondence between a representative of NHA and the ATO in relation to the pursuit of their audit. I am not satisfied that any part of that was material that ought not reasonably to have been foreseen. In general terms, the dealing between the ATO and the company were matters that were quite important to the Crown case and there was nothing by way of surprise that emerged from Mr Dickson's evidence in that regard.
	
	
	The last part of Mr Harvey's statement deals with the terms of taxation information agreements between Samoa and the Cayman Islands. They are not of any great moment. The reason, as I apprehend it, for the Crown seeking to rely upon those is that, in his evidence, Mr Dickson said that he was aware that there were such tax information exchange agreements. It will no doubt be submitted that, in those circumstances, his alleged actions in incorporating and controlling companies in Samoa and the Cayman Islands were not some form of scheme of tax fraud because, in effect, he knew that those places were not beyond the reach of the Australian Taxation authorities.
	
	
	The material the Crown seeks to lead simply identifies the dates and terms upon which those information sharing agreements came into effect. In my view, they are matters that solely arise out of Mr Dickson's evidence and they are not matters that the Crown could reasonably have foreseen would be relied upon. Accordingly, I will allow the Crown to, if necessary, lead that evidence by way of rebuttal and raise it with Mr Dickson.
	
	
	Thus, in summary, I will allow that part of Mr Harvey's evidence which concerns his conversations with Mr Dickson on around 15 and 16 February 2010 and his denial that there was any further telephone conversation as well as the file notes in support as well as the material concerning the tax information exchange agreements with Samoa and the Cayman Islands to be raised with him in cross-examination and to be led in rebuttal. I will not allow the Crown to lead the balance of Mr Harvey’s statement.
	
	
	I then come to Mr Durrand's statement, but I will pass over that part of it that deals with the terms of the non-compete agreement that were annexed to his statement as what the Crown sought to lead on that topic was clarified in oral argument.
	
	
	The balance of Mr Durrand's statement consists of a number of searches of persons and entities done on the Internet. The searches either seek to demonstrate, or disprove, their existence as well as one search which involves an historical Internet search of a particular website.
	
	
	The first of the identities is Rand Stone Consulting (“Rand Stone”). In his evidence Mr Dickson has stated that he was an employee of Rand Stone, that Rand Stone was providing services to a Cayman Islands based private equity partnership known, in broad terms, as HFAC Harmony, and that the actions he took as a director of NHA were, in effect, done pursuant to, and in accordance with, his obligations to Rand Stone and Rand Stone's obligations to HFAC.
	
	
	Subject to one matter, it is clear that Rand Stone was not referred to in any of the materials that the Crown relied upon, nor raised with any of the Crown witnesses, although I add I am not suggesting that there was any such obligation. Subject to the one matter which I will shortly note, Rand Stone is an entity that appears to have first originated in this case in Mr Dickson's evidence.
	
	
	The one matter of exception is that there is a dispute apparently between Mr Dickson and the Crown as to whether a copy of his employment agreement with Rand Stone was, or was not, seized during the execution of various search warrants undertaken back in 2012. It is simply not possible, without resolving every other factual issue in the case, to determine that dispute. It seems reasonably clear that if it was seized, it had certainly never fallen into the hands of the prosecution legal team.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the accused's reliance upon his employment with Rand Stone is a matter that solely arose for the first time in his evidence and it could not be said that the Crown ought reasonably to have foreseen that there was any necessity to chase up its existence or history. In those circumstances, I will allow the Crown to lead evidence by way of rebuttal in respect of that entity and cross-examine Mr Dickson on what was obtained.
	
	
	The next entity that is the subject of various searches is “HFAC Harmony”. There is no doubt that prior to the trial Mr Dickson flagged that it was part of his case that he undertook various acts on behalf of an entity known as HFAC: see [4] of his notice of response to the prosecution's notice dated 11 July 2014. The full name given for HFAC in that document was “an overseas partnership HFAC Harmony Biotechnology Private Equity Partnership”.
	
	
	The search that has been undertaken by Mr Durrand is some form of historical web search of the website “HFAC Harmony”. This has arisen because, in his evidence and in the materials supplied in support of his case, Mr Dickson included some printouts from that website and explained that it was related to the entity HFAC.
	
	
	It is finely balanced in my view as to whether this is material of which the Crown ought reasonably to have foreseen. On the one hand they were clearly told about HFAC and the word ""harmony"" does appear in the description. Equally in the world of website names perhaps one could easily see how one would not necessarily immediately leap to looking into a permutation that involves “HFAC Harmony”.
	
	
	In the end I am satisfied that the necessity for this material to be obtained has solely arisen out of the material as relied upon by Mr Dickson in support of his case, and is not material which the Crown ought reasonably to have foreseen was part of its case. Accordingly I will allow the Crown to lead it in rebuttal if necessary and rely upon it.
	
	
	The next category of searches concerned the travel movements of Mr Paul Gregory Dickson, Mr Anthony Dickson's brother. Included in the materials in support of Mr Dickson's case is a document said to have been executed on or around a particular date that was witnessed by Mr Paul Dickson. This document was not included in the Crown bundle. Mr Anthony Dickson contends, and the Crown denies that it was initially seized pursuant to the search warrant. In any event, I think it is clear it is certainly not in the possession of the prosecution team.
	
	
	In the end, bearing in mind my earlier observations, I am satisfied the necessity to obtain this material has solely emerged out of the case put forward by Mr Dickson. I will allow the Crown to lead it in rebuttal if necessary and to cross-examine Mr Dickson on it if it so chooses.
	
	
	The next four categories of searches all concern searches undertaken upon the website of the United Kingdom Law Society in respect of four persons, Susan Mary Williams, Susan Harper, Edward Chang and David Whittome. Each of these persons was referred to in material in the Crown case, but at least for Susan Mary Williams, Susan Harper and Edward Chang I do not understand that it was suggested that they were lawyers. The first suggestion that they were lawyers appears to have come in Mr Dickson's evidence.
	
	
	The Crown appears to rely upon these searches to somehow rebut that, although I doubt that will travel very far given that one could still have the title ""lawyer"" and not necessarily be admitted and presumably find oneself on the United Kingdom Law Society website. That said, the material may have some marginal relevance provided those limitations are explained
	
	
	I am satisfied that for the first of those three people it is material that has arisen solely out of Mr Dickson's evidence and was not reasonably able to be foreseen. The Crown will be allowed to cross-examine on it and lead it in rebuttal if necessary. However in respect of Mr Whittome I think the evidence in the Crown case was that he was a lawyer and there is, in my view, nothing that emerges out of Mr Dickson's evidence that really could be said to have taken the Crown by surprise in that respect.
	
	
	The last matter concerns two versions of a non-compete agreement which bears the date 15 March 2007 between an entity Karkalla Timber Fund and Craxgold Pty Ltd. In particular the Crown seeks to cross-examine Mr Dickson and, if necessary, lead by way of reply or rebuttal a version of that agreement that has various handwritten annotations, including a handwritten annotation specifying that the contact person for the entity Karkalla Timber Fund is a Mr John Taylor. The Crown also seeks to do the same with a more advanced version of that agreement that has Mr Taylor's name typed, in effect demonstrating that the handwritten annotation was given effect to.
	
	
	The forensic significance that the Crown attributes to this is as follows. As I have said, in his evidence Mr Dickson states that he undertook many, if not most, of the relevant conduct impugned by the Crown in his capacity as an employee of Rand Stone and in the execution of Rand Stone's alleged obligations to its client HFAC. He has tendered, as part of his case, a number of agreements that appear to bear execution by HFAC, including at least some of them by a Mr John Taylor. Otherwise he has stated that the representative of HFAC that he dealt with in respect of a number of issues, including most crucially the negotiation of the assignment agreements between NHA and Athena as the alleged agent of HFAC, was Mr Taylor.
	
	
	It appears to be common ground that the fact that a Mr John Taylor was the representative of HFAC in a number of allegedly crucial steps first emerged from Mr Dickson's evidence.
	
	
	The Crown seeks to cross-examine Mr Dickson about this material and, in particular, Mr John Taylor as the representative of what appears to be an unrelated organisation, namely Karkalla Timber Fund, as part of an overall submission that Mr Dickson has invented him and deploys the name Mr John Taylor when it suits him.
	
	
	I am satisfied that this has solely emerged from Mr Dickson's evidence. Were it not for one matter, I would grant the Crown leave to cross-examine Mr Dickson on these two documents and if necessary allow the Crown to lead them in reply. The difficulty is that this is a joint trial. The agreement to which Mr Taylor's name is being attached is said to be between the other accused's personal company, that is Craxgold Pty Ltd and Karkalla Timber Fund.
	
	
	Senior counsel for the other accused, that is Mr Issakidis, submits that there is a real risk of prejudice to his client if the suggestion is pursued that Mr Dickson attributed a bogus name to the representative of the counter party. The consideration specified in the non-compete agreement is, at least on one version, divided into two tranches, the first of which is $155,000 and the other which is $1.75 million. The first tranche appears to correspond with an amount that was paid to Craxgold and is said to be an act that gave effect to the conspiracy that is alleged by Count 6.
	
	
	The real concern of Mr Byrne QC is that by cross-examining and suggesting that the bogus name Mr John Taylor was attached to Karkalla Timber Fund and was used in relation to this non-compete agreement that it would, at least as against his client, amount to an effective reopening on Count 6. It may have the potential to demonstrate that his client somehow participated in the disguising of funds which, at least on one view, is part of the Crown's allegation on Count 6. As I have indicated,  I am not countenancing a Crown re-opening.
	
	
	I have found the determination of this aspect of the application a difficult one. In the end I consider that the prejudice to Mr Issakidis in this respect can be ameliorated by the giving of an appropriately strongly worded direction to the jury that the sole basis upon which they are to consider any such documents and any cross-examination on this topic is to the question as to whether there was such a person as Mr John Taylor and as to the veracity of Mr Dickson's evidence in that regard, and that they are not to use it as evidence in any way to suggest that Mr Issakidis participated in disguising or covering up the source of any funds received by him or any company associated with him.
	
	
	I accept Mr Byrne QC's submission that it is a complex trial and directions of this kind can present difficulties. Nevertheless, I think I should accept that the jury has the capacity to accept and act in accordance with appropriate and strongly worded directions in that respect.
	
	
	Accordingly, and on that basis, I will allow the Crown to cross-examine Mr Dickson in respect of those two documents and, if necessary, to lead evidence by way of rebuttal.

2704288,R v Flax [2014] NSWDC 268,"Judgment


	
	There are three prominent factors operating in this case where I have to sentence a 66 year old man for sexually assaulting a seven year old boy.
	
	
	The first and most prominent factor is that he has pleaded guilty to an extremely serious offence. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 25 years imprisonment to the offence. Not only that, it has fixed a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment to this offence.
	
	
	The second factor is that the offender has a sick and disabled partner who is the grandmother of the victim of his offence.
	
	
	The third factor is that although he has pleaded guilty, he vehemently denies committing the offence.
	
	
	The man’s name is Michael Flax. He has been charged with the crime of sexual intercourse with a child under 10. That is an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. I have already indicated the maximum penalty and standard non-parole period that Parliament has fixed to that crime.
	
	
	The offence happened some time between Boxing Day in 2012 and the last day of January 2013. Mr Flax was arrested on 14 February 2013. He was committed for trial in this Court on 11 September 2013, the trial being fixed for hearing on 7 April 2014. Only a week or two before that trial date he entered a plea of guilty. That was on 27 March 2014.
	
	
	Because he pleaded guilty, but at a relatively late time, in due course he will receive a discount of 10% off his sentence. A good amount of trial preparation would have occurred over the six months between his committal and his plea.
	
	
	It is first important for a judge to record what happened when sentencing an offender for a crime so that some assessment can be made of how serious an example the crime is of the particular offence.
	
	
	Michael Flax’s partner is Mary Ivory. Her son has a son who was at the time seven years old. The boy knew Mr Flax as “Poppy” for all of his life. He became enrolled in year one at the local public school and it was found that he had a learning disability. It seemed to be consistent with a severe language delay. He and his brother would be minded by Mr Flax and his partner Mary Ivory on a Friday night. One Friday night during the period that I have mentioned, the agreed facts record that Mr Flax woke the boy and took him to the kitchen to get a drink of water. Then Mr Flax approached the boy “and touched the complainant’s penis and groin area, then lent down and removed the complainant’s pyjamas. The offender fondled the complainant’s penis and then performed fellatio on the complainant.” He then stopped and took him back to bed. His brother was asleep.
	
	
	The boy complained to his parents. He persevered in his complaint over about a week, adding that “Poppy put his mouth on my part”. The boy’s mother reported the complaint and the police interviewed the boy.
	
	
	About two weeks later, on 14 February 2013, the police arrested Michael Flax. He was interviewed. He agreed about the babysitting arrangements and about getting a drink, but “denied the allegations of sexual misconduct”.
	
	
	It is also important to say something about the personal features of any offender whom a judge is sentencing. There is a helpful pre-sentence report that confirms that Mr Flax has a completely clean criminal record. It also confirms that neither Mr Flax nor Ms Ivory “accept that he committed this offence”. Indeed, the author of the report added that Mr Flax “vehemently denied that this offence had occurred”. Mr Flax and Ms Ivory have been together for some 35 years. The author of the report regarded Mr Flax as having a medium to high risk of re-offending.
	
	
	A psychologist who prepared an actuarial risk assessment regarding the risk of re-offending was of a different opinion. She regarded Mr Flax as falling in the low risk category relative to other male sex offenders. She explained why in her report which is part of exhibit A. The author of that report confirmed that Mr Flax “denies the commission of the offence”. She added that he pleaded guilty to “put an end to it” and “to save the victim and his brother from the court process”.
	
	
	Mr Flax was bailed almost straight away after his arrest.
	
	
	Mr Flax was represented by Mr J Fitzgerald of counsel, who tendered a report by a forensic psychiatrist, Dr Christopher Bench, as well as medical material regarding Ms Ivory and material from Mr Flax’s son and daughter-in-law.
	
	
	Dr Bench provided a good amount of background material regarding Mr Flax and thought that he suffered an adjustment disorder with anxious mood. It seems to me that this is likely to be associated with his predicament. The psychiatrist noted that there would be a “significant exacerbation of his anxiety and be at high risk of the development of depressive illness” if he was to receive a custodial sentence.
	
	
	What the various reports also note is that Mr Flax has been the full time carer for Ms Ivory for some years. She has serious medical issues, and I will refer to those in a moment.
	
	
	Dr Bench also assessed Mr Flax as having a “low risk for recidivism”.
	
	
	Exhibit 2 was a report from Mary Ivory’s general practitioner, Dr [Name]. He pointed out that his patient over the last seven years has developed insulin-dependent diabetes as well as heart disease, gross obesity and hypertension. She has had a heart operation. Dr [Name] adds the following, referring to his patient -
	


“I feel she would be unable to live on her own (unaided) and due to these limitations she would most certainly need help in the home with house cleaning, washing her clothes, personal hygiene and help with the correct delivery of her medication.

Ms Ivory would require admission to a nursing home if she did not have the help of her partner and carer, Michael Flax.”

That view is supported by Michael Flax’s son and daughter-in-law, both of whom live in [another state]. They both express serious concern for Ms Ivory and her condition and how it may be affected by the absence of Mr Flax.


	
	I should return now to the points which I referred to in my opening remarks. I repeat, this is a most serious offence. I think the 25 year maximum imprisonment is the highest length of a prison sentence other than a life sentence. I think that a standard non-parole period of 15 years is also the highest which Parliament has fixed. Mr Flax has pleaded guilty to an extremely serious offence.
	
	
	Next I will refer to the third factor, which is his plea of guilty, despite a denial. Mr Fitzgerald helpfully referred me to the judgment of Dawson J in Meissner v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 132. His Honour said the following at 157 -
	


“It is true that a person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person’s belief in his guilt. He may do so for all manner of reasons: for example, to avoid worry, inconvenience or expense; to avoid publicity; to protect his family or friends; or in the hope of obtaining a more lenient sentence than he would if convicted after a plea of not guilty. The entry of a plea of guilty upon grounds such as these nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.”

That case itself concerned such a plea.


	
	It is apparent in this case that Mr Flax claims that he has pleaded guilty on the basis mentioned by Dawson J of protecting his family but nevertheless he has pleaded guilty and he has admitted his guilt of an extremely serious offence. I have to make it abundantly clear that I must sentence him upon that basis.
	
	
	The second factor I referred to in my opening remarks concerned Mary Ivory’s ill health. It is obvious, as Mr Fitzgerald pointed out, that if Mr Flax goes to gaol, then Ms Ivory is going to suffer some impact. It may or may not be as serious as having to be moved to a nursing home; I do not know. But it will certainly have a serious impact on her.
	
	
	The courts have considered over the years the relevance of such an impact that a sentence might have on a person other than the offender and how a judge should take that into account. Mr Fitzgerald helpfully referred me to a recent explanation of those principles by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in Dipangkear v R [2010] NSWCCA 156. Whealy J, with whom Hodgson and Buddin JJ agreed, referred to what had been said by Gleeson CJ on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Edwards (1996) 90 ACrimR 510. Whealy J extracted the following passage from Gleeson CJ’s judgment. That extract appears at [30] of Whealy J’s judgment -
	


“There is nothing unusual about a situation in which the sentencing of an offender to a term of imprisonment would impose hardship upon some other person. Indeed, as senior counsel for the respondent acknowledged in argument, it may be taken that sending a person to prison would more often than not cause hardship, sometimes-serious hardship, and sometimes-extreme hardship, to another person. It requires no imagination to understand why this is so. Sentencing Judges and Magistrates are routinely obliged, in the course of their duties, to sentence offenders who may be breadwinners of families, carers, paid or unpaid, of the disabled, parents of children, protectors of persons who are weak or vulnerable, employers upon whom workers depend on their livelihood, and many others, in a variety of circumstances bound to result in hardship to third parties if such an offender is sentenced to a term of full time imprisonment.”


	
	Gleeson CJ went on to point out that the real difficulty “is to identify a ground upon which they can properly and relevantly be regarded as exceptional”. His Honour was referring to circumstances where imprisoning an offender causes hardship to a third party.
	
	
	Gleeson CJ referred to the judgment of Wells J in R v Wirth (1976) 14 SASR 291 at 295-296. Wells J referred to the inevitable consequence of hardship as a result of a sentence but of the need for courts to do their clear duty “especially where the element of retribution, deterrence, or protection of society is the predominant consideration”. Wells J, in an often cited passage, referred to a way of assessing the exception where a judge may be willing “when applying a principle, not to carry it past the point where a sense of mercy or an affront to common sense imperatively demands that they should draw back.” The circumstances need to be “highly exceptional”.
	
	
	I have naturally, as a human being, some sympathy for the predicament which Mr Flax has left Ms Ivory in as a result of committing this crime. But it seems to me that my duty is clear. I repeat, he has pleaded guilty to an extremely serious offence. The circumstances of his partner, Ms Ivory, are not such that they would provide me with an alternative to sentencing him to a custodial sentence. The crime is simply too serious to warrant that option.
	
	
	Mr Fitzhardinge appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions and, as well as his oral submissions, provided helpful written submissions. Part of the guidance that he took me to in sentencing offenders for this kind of crime came from the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Fisher (1989) 40 ACrimR 442 at 445. Mr Fitzhardinge extracted the following passage from the Court’s judgment -
	


“This Court has said time and time again that sexual assaults upon young children, especially by those who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished, and that those who engage in this evil conduct must go to gaol for a long period of time, not only to punish them, but also as an endeavour to deter others who might have similar inclinations. …

This Court must serve notice upon judges who impose weakly merciful sentences in some cases of sexual assault upon children, that heavy custodial sentences are essential if the courts are to play their proper role in protecting young people from sexual attacks by adults… .”


	
	Mr Fitzhardinge pointed out some aspects of this offence which are important to take into account. It was aggravated by the fact that it involved a serious breach of trust. The boy had been placed at the home of his grandmother and Mr Flax by his parents to look after him. Mr Flax, on the charge that he has pleaded guilty to, took the opportunity to commit a most serious offence against the child. The sexual intercourse involved was performing fellatio on the child. It was, therefore, a very serious form of sexual assault. I do not say that it is the most serious kind but it is certainly more serious than some forms of sexual intercourse may be.
	
	
	I do acknowledge that the offence was spontaneous and isolated. It was not part of an ongoing course of conduct which is often the case when sentencing offenders such as these. In addition, the boy was seven years old. The offence is for crimes committed against those who are 10 or under. In other words, the victim in this case was well under 10 years old. He was far from being extremely young for this kind of crime but nevertheless he was still two or three years younger than the maximum age for a victim of this kind of crime.
	
	
	Mr Fitzhardinge submitted that the “offence falls below the middle of the range” but he added it is “not towards the bottom of the range” because of the features which he had pointed out. I accept his proposed classification of the seriousness of the offence, and Mr Fitzgerald realistically acknowledged as much as well.
	
	
	Mr Flax is entitled to the benefit of the fact that he has had no prior convictions whatsoever. I accept both Mr Fitzhardinge’s and Mr Fitzgerald’s submissions that I should not be satisfied that his good character “was of assistance to the offender in the commission of the offence” so that s 21A(5A) does not apply. So, as Mr Fitzhardinge fairly conceded, “the offender is entitled to have his prior good character taken into account in mitigation of his sentence”.
	
	
	I also accept, as I have already found, that the hardship to Mary Ivory is not such that it would warrant other than an appropriate period of custody.
	
	
	Mr Fitzgerald pointed out that there are special circumstances for adjusting the normal ratio between a non-parole period fixed by a judge and the balance of the term of a sentence. Normally a non-parole period represents 75% of a sentence but he submitted that I could reduce that in this case. He pointed to his client’s age, being 66, and the fact that it was his very first offence and his first time in custody. Mr Fitzhardinge acknowledged those factors. I think that special circumstances in this case are particularly strong. I am going to make a significant reduction in the non-parole period.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the degree of seriousness of the offence, I regard an appropriate overall sentence for an offence such as this, given the maximum which Parliament has imposed, as six years imprisonment. I would reduce that by 10% because of Mr Flax’s plea of guilty. That produces a prison sentence of a little over five years, which I would round off at a prison sentence of five years.
	
	
	Needless to say, I regard this offence as such that I have no alternative but to impose a penalty of full time imprisonment. That penalty will be five years imprisonment.
	
	
	I regard an appropriate non-parole period, taking into account the factors which I have mentioned, and especially Mr Flax’s age, to be two years. I appreciate that that is less than 50% of the overall sentence but, given his age and the fact that it is his first time in prison and his very first offence, I am going to reduce it to two years imprisonment.
	


HIS HONOUR: Would you stand up, please, Mr Flax.


	
	I set a non-parole period for your sentence of two years commencing today, 5 November 2014 and expiring on 4 November 2016. The balance of the term is three years commencing on 5 November 2016 and expiring on 4 November 2019. The first date on which you will be eligible for parole is 4 November 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Have a seat there for a moment, Mr Flax, whilst I check with Mr Fitzgerald and Mr Fitzhardinge about those figures.

FITZHARDINGE: I was content with those figures, your Honour, they seem to work.

FITZGERALD: Yes, the mathematics, thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Mr Flax, I have sentenced you to five years gaol for that crime. Normally a five year gaol term would - well, I have not done the sums, but your non-parole period for a five year gaol term would be over three years imprisonment, it would be close to four years imprisonment; that is the normal non-parole period for a five year gaol term. But I have reduced yours substantially to two years. You have got to spend two years in gaol. That starts today, and it finishes on 4 November 2016, two years from today. On that day, 4 November 2016, you are eligible for parole. I do not give you parole, the Parole Authority does. They will assess your parole beforehand and determine whether to release you on parole. Once you are on parole, you are still under sentence for the rest of the time, until 4 November 2019. Five years from today your sentence expires. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yep.

HIS HONOUR: All right. Mr Flax can be taken away.

2704299,Pitts v R [2014] NSWCCA 244,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2R A HULME J: Craig Charles Pitts (the applicant) applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Adamson J in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 9 May 2013. The applicant had been tried before a jury on a charge of murder but the jury returned a verdict of guilty to manslaughter. Adamson J imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months with effect from 16 September 2012.

3The Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed a short period out of time. At the outset of the hearing today the Crown indicated it did not oppose an extension of time being granted. Accordingly it was.

4The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence is unreasonable or plainly unjust; in other words it is manifestly excessive. The ground of appeal is supported by submissions that the offence was of relatively low objective seriousness and there were favourable findings as to certain subjective features of the applicant. The contention of manifest excess is said to be confirmed by an analysis of sentences imposed in other cases.

Facts

5There was no dispute about the findings of fact made by Adamson J. The following summary is derived from her Honour's remarks on sentence.

6The applicant lived in a unit on the fourteenth floor of an apartment block in Redfern. His sister and two nieces arrived in the early hours of 2 August 2011 to stay with him. Later that morning he went out with one of the nieces to purchase groceries. While they were out, a man named Leonard Gow visited the unit. The applicant's sister told him that the applicant was out and suggested that he return later.

7When the applicant returned with his niece he encountered Mr Gow and the deceased, John Marceta, on the ground floor of the apartment building. He understood that the two men wanted to purchase cannabis from him as they had done previously. He told them to come back later.

8The applicant returned to the unit. He and his sister went into a back room to discuss personal matters, leaving the two girls in the lounge room near the front door. There was a knock at the front door. One of the nieces went to the back room to inform the applicant that there was someone at the door. The applicant, who realised that it was probably the deceased and Mr Gow, told her to tell whoever it was that they should come back later. The niece then relayed that message through the front door.

9The deceased kicked in the front door. The two girls screamed with fright and were so scared that they ran to the back room and locked the door. The applicant and his sister heard the noise and came to the front door. The applicant opened the door and called out to the deceased and Mr Gow, who were walking in the direction of the lifts and were already some distance away from the unit, ""why did you kick my front door in?"" 

10The applicant recognised it was the deceased and Mr Gow. He knew that the deceased had been a boxing champion. He went back into the unit and retrieved a knife, returned and followed the deceased and Mr Gow. There was an altercation when they were halfway down the hall, about 14 metres from the applicant's front door. The applicant stabbed the deceased in the chest with the wound penetrating through to the heart. He collapsed and died shortly afterwards. As soon as the applicant realised what he had done he retreated to his unit in a state of shock and dismay.

Basis for manslaughter

11Adamson J discussed whether the evidence supported a finding of manslaughter by way of unlawful and dangerous act or murder reduced to manslaughter because there was self-defence which was excessive. She concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to cause grievous bodily harm. She considered that his act of picking up the kitchen knife to have been a deliberate and considered one, albeit when the applicant was angry. In those circumstances she concluded that manslaughter by excessive self-defence was a finding which was consistent both with her own view of the applicant's intention and with the jury's verdict. This entailed her satisfaction that it was reasonably possible that the applicant believed that his conduct was necessary in self-defence or in defence of his sister or his nieces. Her Honour was also satisfied that his conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them to be.

Seriousness of the offence

12Her Honour recognised that manslaughter produces the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability, and so there is a substantial range in the sentences imposed: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381; The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 at [22] (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ). She also recognised that the fundamental touchstone for sentencing in such cases is that there has been an unlawful taking of human life for which the offender is criminally liable: R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1995, unrep). 

13Her Honour also referred to the maximum penalty for manslaughter being 25 years, it being an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [31] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.

14Her Honour said the following about the objective seriousness of the offence:

""The deceased died because the offender responded instantaneously to the deceased's act of violence in kicking his front door down. The offender assessed correctly that the deceased was in significantly better physical condition than he was. In a heinous and misguided attempt to redress the physical discrepancy between them, he armed himself with a knife before confronting the deceased in the corridor outside his unit.

The offender bore no longstanding animosity or hostility towards the deceased. Nonetheless, he intended to cause the deceased grievous bodily harm. The offender misjudged the threat which the deceased posed to him and his family. By resorting to violence with a dangerous weapon he overreacted, with disastrous and irreversible consequences.""

15Adamson J considered that it was an aggravating factor that the offender used a knife but in mitigation was the fact that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity; the applicant was provoked by the deceased's act of kicking in his front door, the effect of the provocation being heightened because the deceased knew that the applicant's sister and young nieces were inside the flat. 

Personal circumstances of the applicant

16The judge was satisfied that the applicant had a ""very troubled childhood"". He was the youngest of six children. He did not know his biological father. His mother was unable to care for him and did not have the emotional or financial resources to bring up six children on her own. From a young age the applicant spent considerable periods either with other family members with whom he sought refuge or without any home at all. 

17The applicant had attended many schools and had substantial difficulties in learning. He was often victimised by his classmates and, as a result, frequently refused to attend school. As a child he suffered from seizures due to epilepsy, which remained undiagnosed for several years.

18From his early teens the applicant suffered from depression and low self-esteem and often felt hopeless about his life. As a result he turned to alcohol and drugs from the age of about 12. He drank heavily between the ages of 12 and 16 although he had not been a regular drinker as an adult. He began using heroin when he was 12 and became addicted.

19In April 2010, at the age of 27, the applicant was referred to Dr Byrne for treatment of his addiction. Dr Byrne was engaged in a medical practice which specialised in the treatment of drug and alcohol issues. The applicant began treatment with methadone and made what Dr Byrne described as ""excellent progress"". He attended the practice regularly for medication, counselling and random supervised urine testing. Dr Byrne's report of 30 November 2012 included that the applicant was well presented, polite to staff, and invariably alert, oriented and in good spirits. He was rarely, if ever, seen to be intoxicated. 

20Her Honour noted that a test taken of the applicant's blood shortly after the offence did not indicate the presence of any intoxicating substances that would have affected either his self-control or his behaviour. 

21A number of statutory mitigating factors (s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)) were taken into account in the applicant's favour. The applicant had no significant record of previous convictions; he was unlikely to reoffend; he had good prospects of rehabilitation; and he had shown remorse.

22Her Honour considered a submission that there were special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act for reducing the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. However her Honour concluded that a parole period in accordance with the statutory ratio would be sufficient to deal with the need for the applicant to be supervised in the community following his release on parole. There is no challenge to that finding.

Submissions and consideration

23It was submitted that the objective seriousness of the offence was low relative to the broad range of conduct comprising manslaughter offences. The judge did not expressly identify where within the range of objective seriousness the offence at hand fell. However, it was submitted that the findings made by her Honour pointed to a relatively low degree of objective seriousness. Specifically identified were:


The applicant acted in defence of himself or his sisters and nieces but misjudged the threat the deceased posed.


The applicant was provoked by the deceased's violence and the effect was heightened by the fact that the deceased knew of the presence of the applicant's sister and two young nieces in the apartment.


The applicant armed himself in an attempt to redress the physical discrepancy between himself and the deceased.


The applicant's response was instantaneous but it was an overreaction in resorting to the use of a weapon.


The applicant did not intend to kill but ""only"" to inflict grievous bodily harm.

24It was also submitted that the judge's favourable findings regarding the applicant's subjective circumstances warranted significant mitigation. 

25It was submitted that, when all those matters were taken into account, this Court should find that the sentence exceeded the boundaries of a reasonable exercise of discretion. 

26Mr Gartelmann, counsel for the applicant, acknowledged with his usual candour the limitations inherent in drawing comparisons with sentences imposed in other cases. Amongst other authorities, he cited Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 where, in the joint judgment of French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ, the proper approach to a consideration of comparative cases was described thus:

""[54] In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: 'Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts.' But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix 'the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence'. Past sentences 'are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence' (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, 'it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that ""unifying principles"" may be discerned'.

[55] As the plurality said in Wong:

'[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.'"" (Footnotes omitted)

27Whilst also acknowledging that there is no hierarchy in relation to the relative seriousness of the various categories of manslaughter offences (R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520 at [27]- [29]), counsel provided schedules of a large number of cases (44) involving manslaughter offences committed by excessive self-defence in a wide range of circumstances. The schedules comprised cases considered in this Court as well as first instance sentencing judgments going back to 2002 (as the Crown observed, the partial defence to murder of excessive self-defence came into force in 2001). The salient features of each case were usefully and comprehensively summarised. It was submitted that an examination of these cases tended to confirm that the sentence imposed in the applicant's case exceeded the boundaries of a reasonable sentencing discretion. 

28The learned Crown Advocate assisted the Court with reference to a number of authorities concerning the use of comparative cases. Most pertinently, she referred to the recent decision in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 where the Court (Bathurst CJ, Johnson J and myself) said:

""[227] The myriad circumstances of manslaughter offences render it unhelpful to speak in terms of a range of sentences, or tariff, for a particular form of manslaughter. ...""

29I do not understand Mr Gartelmann's submissions to transgress what was said in R v Loveridge. The key to his analysis was that an examination of the facts, circumstances and outcomes in a large selection of other cases illuminated ""unifying principles"" which were informative in assessing the sentence in the applicant's case. More specifically, it was submitted that the cases provide something of a yardstick against which the applicant's sentence may be considered.

30I have carefully considered the cases to which Mr Gartelmann has referred and have derived from them the following. 

31First, the survey is extensive; it encompasses all excessive self-defence sentencing exercises that have occurred in the past 12 years that counsel was able to identify.

32Secondly, the survey confirms the extremely wide range of circumstances in which manslaughter by way of excessive self-defence is encountered.

33Thirdly, the cases which involve juvenile or youthful offenders are of very little, if any, utility given the special considerations that apply in such cases.

34Fourthly, a few of the first instance sentencing decisions seem (based upon the summaries provided) to be remarkably lenient; arguably inadequate.

35Fifthly, quite a number of the cases involve offenders whose sentences were reduced on account of their pleas of, or offers to plead, guilty. That is a factor absent from the applicant's case.

36Sixthly, and most pertinently, many of the cases involve offences committed in the face of a real threat of violence by the deceased. In the present case, the door of the applicant's apartment had been kicked in but then the deceased and his companion were in the process of leaving. It was the applicant who engaged them in a confrontation by calling out to them, then retreating into his unit to get a knife, and then confronting them again. He need not have confronted them at all. This is a significant feature that distinguishes the present case from many in the schedules.

37Finally, this broad review of sentences passed in a large number of excessive self-defence manslaughter cases does not leave me with an impression of manifest excess.

38The learned judge found that the applicant had an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. To reconcile that finding (which is not challenged) with the jury's verdict, it followed that there must have been a perception by the applicant that it was necessary to do what he did but his conduct was not a reasonable response. In my view, and consistent with the view taken at first instance, the degree to which the applicant's response was unreasonable was quite extreme. Her Honour described the applicant's actions as ""heinous"" and ""misguided"". That assessment was open to be made.

39I acknowledge the favourable findings the judge made as to the applicant's subjective case and note that it is not suggested that there was any error in her Honour overlooking anything of relevance in that respect. But in the end I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was one that can be characterised as unreasonable or plainly unjust.

Orders

40I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

41DAVIES J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2704306,Maglovski v R [2014] NSWCCA 238,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  Offence and sentenceOn 1 November 2012 the applicant was arraigned on an indictment which charged that on 8 October 2011 he murdered Rosa Maglovski, his wife.  The applicant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter.  The Crown did not accept that plea and the trial proceeded.  On 12 November 2012 the jury returned a verdict of guilty to the charge of murder.
2The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  The sentence imposed by the trial judge was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years and a balance of term of 4 years, i.e. a total term of 20 years.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in fixing the non-parole period at 80 percent of the overall term.
Ground 2 - His Honour was in error in not finding special circumstances.
Factual background
4The sole issue before the jury was whether the applicant had made out a defence of provocation.  The applicant and the deceased had been married for over 25 years and had lived at the same address in Hurstville for over 20 years with their two adult children.  At the time of their marriage, the applicant was aged 30 and the deceased was aged 19.  At the time of her death, the deceased was aged 48 and the applicant was aged 59.
5Until approximately a year before her death, the relationship between the applicant and the deceased had been good.  The applicant's evidence was that about nine months before her death, his wife told him that she did not want to sleep with him anymore because he was ""stinking"".   He said that this made him feel extremely bad and hurt.  It was at this time that the applicant and the deceased commenced sleeping in separate bedrooms.  
6The applicant said that within a few weeks of him moving to a separate room, the deceased told him ""I can't live with you anymore"".  When they were arguing she said ""I don't want to sleep with you anymore"", referring to their sexual relationship.  The applicant said that this made him feel humiliated and ""like I don't exist anymore"".  
7The deceased operated a business cleaning offices in the years before her death.  The applicant would often undertake work for the business out of hours.  The applicant said that about six weeks before the deceased's death, the deceased said to him ""You're not going to work anymore.  You're too slow and I'm going to employ another man"".  He said this made him feel ""very humiliated"".  On the long weekend before her death, the deceased went to Canberra and Queanbeyan to work.  When asked about this, the applicant said ""She wanted to be a man and I a woman"".  He said that the deceased said ""I don't want you to come"" and ""I don't want you anymore"" and she stayed overnight.  He described this as a ""great humiliation"".
8When asked by the Crown prosecutor why he killed his wife, the applicant said:
""Because she spat in my face and she didn't want to live with me anymore.  I'd been working all my life for that house and all of a sudden it had to be destroyed overnight.""
9It was following that exchange, that the applicant said that he pushed the deceased onto the couch and a fight ensued.  After the applicant had punched her, he walked about 2.5m-3m into the kitchen, grabbed a knife from the kitchen sink and stabbed the deceased.  He then drew the knife away and dialled triple 0.
10When the police arrived, the applicant admitted the offence.  Three of the police officers who attended, gave evidence and each described the applicant as being in a very calm state.  The most senior of them described him as ""Not showing any real emotion at all.  Very cold"" and that ""He seemed very matter of fact, wasn't trying to explain things or move away.  Just standing there ..."".
11Implicit in the jury's verdict of guilty of murder was a rejection of the applicant's defence of provocation.  The jury were either not satisfied that the act of the applicant which caused the death of the deceased resulted from a loss of self-control on his part, that was induced or caused by some conduct on the part of the deceased, or that the conduct of the deceased was such that it could possibly have induced or caused an ordinary person in the position of the applicant to have so lost his self-control as to have formed an intention to kill the deceased.  It may have been that the jury was not satisfied that either limb of the provocation defence had been made out.
Proceedings on sentence
12At the time of sentence, the applicant was aged 60.  After coming to live in Australia in 1984, he had worked for the same carpentry firm making cabinets, office furniture and kitchens until the date of his arrest.  On weekends he did cleaning work in the deceased's business.  There was no evidence of any disharmony or violence in the relationship between the applicant and the deceased until about a year before the murder.
13The applicant did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings, but a psychologist's report was tendered on his behalf.  No psychiatric or psychological illness or disorder was identified as affecting the applicant.
14His Honour accepted the analysis of causation provided by the psychologist as follows:
""The incident in question occurred in the context of a very long term, intimate relationship which underwent marked changes that affected the [offender] deeply. His cultural perspectives and expectations made the dynamics of the changed relationship between himself and his wife acutely painful and emotionally distressing and Mr Maglovski appeared to lack strategies for releasing stress and tension or ways of addressing differences and conflict in his marriage. His capacity to control his strong emotional responses to their changed circumstances was overcome by small but highly significant incidents which occurred between them on the morning of [the murder]. The cumulative impact precipitated a sudden and violent outburst by the [offender] which was unprecedented in the history of his marital relationship. His expressions of regret and remorse appear to be sincere and genuine. The likelihood of a similar set of circumstances reoccurring appears to be negligible.""
15As his Honour put it:
""69 ... Nevertheless, there is no doubt that Mrs Maglovska was an extremely resourceful woman. Over time, her position and the nature of their relationship changed dramatically as she became more independent. Ms Robilliard's description of the offender as someone who had no mechanisms for addressing the difficulties in their relationship strikes me as persuasive. The offender was simply ill-equipped to deal with the changing nature of his relationship with his wife, and could not accept the exercise by her of her right to determine a future without him.""
16When considering aggravating and mitigating features, his Honour noted that there was little by way of aggravation except that the offence occurred in the home.  In mitigation, his Honour found that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity and that there was no pre-meditation.  His Honour accepted that the applicant was a person of good character and had no previous convictions.  His Honour was satisfied that there was almost no chance of the applicant re-offending and that there were good prospects of rehabilitation.  His Honour also took into account the applicant's early co-operation with the police.  On the basis of what he told the psychologist, his Honour was prepared to accept that the applicant regretted and was remorseful for killing the deceased.
17By reference to the decisions in Goebel-McGregor v R [2006] NSWCCA 390 at 128 and Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164, his Honour was not prepared to take into account the applicant's age as a reason for reducing an otherwise appropriate term of imprisonment.  Having reviewed all the facts, his Honour was of the opinion that the objective seriousness of the offending was below the middle range of objective seriousness so that the standard non-parole period would not apply.  He did, however, take into account as guideposts the maximum penalty for the offence and the standard non-parole period.  It should be noted that counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings did not submit that his Honour should make a finding of special circumstances.
Appeal
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in fixing the non-parole period at 80 percent of the overall term.
18The applicant submitted that s44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required that after setting a non-parole period, pursuant to s44(1), the balance of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period unless the court decided that there were special circumstances for it being more.  This had the effect that the non-parole period was 75 percent of the overall sentence unless there was a finding of special circumstances.  The applicant submitted that the primary judge imposed a non-parole period which was 80 percent of the overall sentence but did not provide reasons for doing so.
19The applicant accepted that s44(2) did not prohibit a non-parole period being greater than 75 percent but submitted that in the circumstances of this case, his Honour's failure to do so constituted an error particularly when regard was had to the matters which would have allowed a finding of special circumstances.
20In support of that submission, the applicant relied upon the following statement of Grove J (with whom Simpson and R A Hulme JJ agreed) in Wakefield v R [2010] NSWCCA 12 at [26]:
26  No reference was made to the effect of the partial cumulation whereby the balance term then set for count 8 created a minimum custodial term of 80 percent of the total sentence. It is true that, whilst the statute requires reasons to be stated for reducing the non-parole period against the stated formulation, no such requirement has been legislated if it is increased. However it has been stated in this Court more than once that it is expected that in circumstances where there is such an increase some reasons should be provided if only to forestall a conclusion that the specification was the result of error or oversight. In R v Dunn [2007] NSWCCA 312 it was said that this was especially the case where cumulation had taken place. Other examples of intervention by this Court in similar circumstances can be found in R v Lyndon [2003] NSWCCA 152; R v Ibraham [2005] NSWCCA 43.""
21The applicant also relied upon the observation of Fullerton J (with whom Hodgson JA and Price J agreed) in Briggs v R [2010] NSWCCA 250 where her Honour said:
""34  However, and despite the clarity of his Honour's sentencing remarks and his express finding that the non-parole period should be 8 years, his silence as to the reason for increasing the proportion of the minimum period in custody relative to the total term above 75 per cent leaves me with a sense of disquiet that he may have overlooked giving appropriate focus to the statutory ratio provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In the result, I am persuaded that error is demonstrated in this limited respect and that an adjustment to the non-parole period should be permitted.""

Ground 2 - His Honour was in error in not finding special circumstances.
22The applicant submitted that there should have been a finding of special circumstances, given that this was the applicant's first time in custody, his age and his cultural background.
23The applicant accepted that it has been held that an appeal court will be reluctant to find error in this regard where there was no submission made upon sentence for a finding of special circumstances (Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 at [11]).  Nevertheless, he submitted such a finding should have been made in the circumstances of this case.
24In the alternative, the applicant submitted that if Ground of Appeal 1 was made out and this Court decided to re-sentence the applicant pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, then in the exercise of its discretion it should make a finding of special circumstances in favour of the applicant.
ConsiderationGround 1
25In considering this Ground of Appeal, two of the specific findings by the primary judge are of particular importance:
""53 In the end result I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender made a deliberate decision to attack his wife. He intended to kill her. However his actions were not premeditated. His anger rose up on 8 October 2011 after she made it clear that their marriage was over and he realised she was determined to finally leave. After he started attacking her he had the ability to stop, but instead stabbed her while she begged him to stop.

91 In the end, I am required to sentence a man who violently killed his wife because he could not cope with her decision to leave him. Her death was violent, but unplanned. She was slain in her own home after spending the morning with her daughter and with her son nearby, both innocent in every sense of the word. Until the breakdown of his marriage the offender had lived an exemplary life and still had much to look forward to, even if his marriage had not survived. In this case considerations of general deterrence and the need for the sentence to reflect notions of retribution and denunciation are highly significant. Married women have the right to choose their own destiny. Significant punishments will be imposed upon those who inflict violence on them for exercising that right. That said the offender does not represent a danger to society and his imprisonment is not necessary for its protection.""
26It is clear from his Honour's sentence judgment that the non-parole period which he set was carefully considered by him to be ""the appropriate term of imprisonment to be served"" [90].  In that regard, it should be noted that this was a sentence imposed after trial and was not subject to any discounts.  Had his Honour considered that any other non-parole period was appropriate, it would have been a simple matter on the figures to substitute 15 years (being 75 percent of the head sentence).  In that regard, it is not without significance that his Honour specifically referred to s44(2) (at [96]) when setting the non-parole period of 16 years.
27Because his Honour specifically referred to s44(2), I infer that the setting of 16 years as the non-parole period did not involve an error or oversight such as was referred to in Wakefield and Dunn.  Those were cases where more than one sentence was imposed and questions of cumulation and concurrency arose.  That is not the case here.  Unlike the situation in Briggs, the analysis of his Honour in this case does not leave me with any sense of disquiet that the terms of s44(2) might have been overlooked.
28As the applicant fairly conceded, the language of s44(2) does not require that the balance of term must not be less than one-third of the non-parole period:  Musgrove v R [2007] NSWCCA 21; 167 A Crim R 424 at [27]; Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v RHB [2008] NSWCCA 236 ; 189 A Crim R 178 at [17], [19] and Wakefield to which the applicant has referred.  What has developed is a rule of practice where because of the particular facts of some cases, this Court has said that it is advisable for a sentencing judge to explain why a ratio in excess of 75 percent was selected.  Such cases usually involve facts where it could be inferred that an oversight might have occurred.
29That was the kind of circumstance to which I adverted in R v Dunn [2007] NSWCCA 312 where I said:
""40 The submission in relation to s44 is, however, in a somewhat different category.  I appreciate that the section does not create a statutory norm in relation to the proportion of the non-parole period as against the total term of the sentence and that special circumstances are required only where the proportion is to be less than three-quarters.  Nevertheless general sentencing principles suggest that where there is a departure from the statutory ratio there should be some reason provided.  It is not clear here that his Honour appreciated that the combined effect of the sentences was to produce a non-parole period in excess of 80% of the head sentence.  If he did he failed to indicate why he thought such a departure from the statutory ratio was appropriate.
41 It has been held by this Court that where one or more sentences are made cumulative upon another sentence so as to produce a non-parole period which is in excess of the statutory ratio that of itself may amount to special circumstances.  On the facts of this case that consideration and the absence of an explanation as to why the non-parole period has been increased beyond the statutory ratio, lead me to conclude that this Court ought intervene so that the combined effect of the sentences conforms with the statutory ratio.  A reduction of 4 months in the non-parole period in respect of count 3 would substantially achieve that result.""
30This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2
31This Court in recent times has stated with increasing force that a failure by defence counsel in sentence proceedings to make submissions on a particular topic will usually not give rise to error if the sentencing judge does not take that particular matter into account.  This has particular applicability to a complaint that a sentencing judge failed to make a finding of special circumstances (Johnson J in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [80] (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed)).  There Johnson J reiterated the proposition that in applications for leave to appeal against sentence, applicants are usually to be bound by the conduct of their counsel.  His Honour said that there is a ""practical expectation that an offender's legal representative will make submissions to the sentencing judge at first instance, by reference to the particular factors which are sought to be taken into account in mitigation of the sentence in the case at hand"".  At [81] Johnson J said:
""81 ... The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea. ...""
Observations to similar effect were made in relation to special circumstances in Edwards v R.
32In this case, the rationale for the application of special circumstances is somewhat problematic.  The fact that a person is being imprisoned for the first time as a basis for a finding of special circumstances is controversial.  In Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [12] McClellan CJ at CL said:
""12 ... Reservations have been expressed in this Court as to whether the fact that a person will be in custody for the first time is capable of constituting special circumstances R v Kama (2000) 110 A Crim R 47 (per Spigelman CJ at [10]); R v Kaliti [2001] NSWCCA 268. I have similar reservations. There will be many persons facing a court for sentence who will receive a custodial term for the first time. No doubt where appropriate that fact will be reflected in the sentence which is imposed. But whether for that reason alone a finding of special circumstances is appropriate is doubtful. Most people who have been incarcerated for any period will need assistance in re-establishing themselves in the community and it may be that a repeat offender is in greater need than some one incarcerated for the first time.""
33 Insofar as the applicant's age is concerned 60 is not by reference to contemporary life expectancies, to be regarded as a particularly old age.  In some circumstances, age may provide a basis for a finding of special circumstances but this is not one of them.  The findings by Ms Robilliard as to the applicant not having any psychiatric or psychological illness and that he was not experiencing any particular difficulties with incarceration would also not constitute a basis for a finding of special circumstances.
34As has been often said by this Court, a ground of appeal which asserts a failure to adjust a sentence for special circumstances raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court has been reluctant to intervene.  As a practical matter, the Court will only intervene if the non-parole period is manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive:  R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [19]; Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83].
35It is not to the point that some lesser non-parole period may have been imposed.  What the applicant must establish if this Court is to intervene is that the primary judge erred in not finding special circumstances and that in the result, a non-parole period of 16 years is excessive.  I am not persuaded that such is the case.  I do not consider that his Honour was obliged to find special circumstances or that his discretion in fixing the non-parole period of 16 years miscarried for that reason.
36This ground of appeal has not been made out.
37Although the above is sufficient to dispose of the appeal, I make one further observation.  Had either ground of appeal been made out, it would have been necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion pursuant to s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  In view of the comprehensive analysis of the objective seriousness of the offence and the applicant's subjective circumstances made by the primary judge had it been necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, I am not satisfied that any lesser sentence is warranted and I would not have interfered with the sentence imposed by his Honour.
38The orders which I propose are:
(1)That leave to appeal be granted.
(2)Appeal be dismissed.
39HIDDEN J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
40DAVIES J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2704309,Asplund v R (Cth) [2014] NSWCCA 237,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offences and sentence
On 19 January 2011 the applicant pleaded guilty in the NSW District Court to the following offences:

Count 1 - Doing an act with the intention of influencing a person to be called as a witness to give a false statement intending to procure his own acquittal of a serious indictable offence, contrary to s323(a) and 324 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the ""influencing a witness offence"").

Count 2 - Possessing child pornography contrary to s91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (the ""child pornography offence"").

2The conduct relevant to the influencing a witness offence occurred between 20 February 2008 and 20 November 2009. The conduct relevant to the child pornography offence occurred between 1 February 2008 and 21 February 2008. The maximum penalty for the influencing a witness offence is 14 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the child pornography offence is 5 years imprisonment.

3On 13 April 2012 the applicant was sentenced as follows:

Count 2 - The child pornography offence, imprisonment for a fixed term of 9 months commencing 19 September 2013 and expiring 18 June 2014.

Count 1 - The influencing a witness offence, imprisonment for 4 years commencing 19 June 2014 and expiring 18 June 2018 with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months expiring 18 December 2015.

4At the time the sentences were handed down, the applicant was already serving sentences of imprisonment for two serious indictable offences, contrary to s474.27(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) namely using a carriage service to transmit a communication which included indecent material to a person who was under the age of 16 with the intention of making it easier to procure that person to engage in, or submit to sexual activity with himself (the child grooming offences). As a result of a Crown appeal (R v Asplund [2010] NSWCCA 316) those sentences were: imprisonment for 3 years commencing 19 March 2010 and expiring 18 March 2013 (in respect of Count 1, which related to grooming over the internet) and imprisonment for 4 years commencing 19 March 2013 and expiring 18 March 2017 (in respect of Count 2, which related to grooming over a mobile telephone service). In relation to both child grooming offences, a non-parole period of 4 years was fixed, commencing 19 March 2010 and expiring 18 March 2014.

5The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed by Judge Hock on 13 April 2012. The grounds of appeal are as follows:

Ground 1 - That her Honour erred when sentencing the appellant on Count 2, in failing to proceed to the second step, referred to by this Honourable Court in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17.

Ground 2 - That her Honour erred in failing to consider the second limb of the principle of totality, namely to review the aggregate sentence on Counts 1 and 2 and consequently failed to consider whether the aggregate sentence was just and appropriate.

Ground 3 - That her Honour erred in that, having recited the appellant's age and having made no reference to his date of birth, she failed to consider the appellant's age as a factor in mitigation and, in particular, failed to consider whether or not mercy should be afforded to the appellant by reason of his advanced age and/or that each additional year of sentence represented a substantial proportion of the period of life left to the appellant and/or the rigour of imprisonment for a person of the age of the appellant.

Factual background

6In order to understand the grounds of appeal, it is necessary to set out the facts in respect of the child grooming offences, as well as the facts concerning the offences, the subject of this application.

7The applicant and CF had met in a public chat room on a website known as the ""Friendship Page"" on 29 October 2006. They were known to each other by their online user names. The next day the applicant and CF engaged in a private chat where they exchanged mobile telephone numbers. The applicant stated at the time that he was 28 years of age, when he was in fact 61 years old, and CF stated that she was 14 years old when in fact she was 13 years of age.

8Over the period of 28 October 2006 to 1 January 2007 the applicant communicated frequently with CF by mobile telephone and via the internet including seven online chats and hundreds of telephone calls and text messages to CF's mobile telephone. The communications were sexual in nature, including discussions about CF's sexual experience, whether she would meet him for sexual activity and the transmission of a photograph of the offender's penis on CF's mobile phone.

9At various times throughout the communications, the applicant commented on CF's age. He commented favourably on photographs she had sent him via her mobile phone. In his communications with her, the following issues were raised: 

(a)She was 14; 

(b) CF told him of her sexual inexperience; 

(c) He initiated topics of conversation of an explicit and sexual nature; 

(d) He sent CF a photograph of his erect penis by his mobile phone; 

(e) He encouraged CF to send explicit photographs of herself; 

(f) He initiated topics of conversation concerning CF meeting him; 

(g) He initiated topics of conversations concerning what he intended to do with CF when she met him and 

(h) He expressed his love for her and on one occasion, told her he wanted to marry her.

10The applicant made cash deposits into CF's bank account throughout the grooming offence period. The total amount deposited into CF's account by the applicant was $2,500.

11On 19 March 2010 the applicant was convicted of the grooming offences and sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 3 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months. On 16 December 2010, following a Crown appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal re-sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The non-parole period was to expire on 18 March 2014.

12On 20 February 2008 as a result of the execution of a search warrant in the child grooming matters, the applicant's computer was seized. During a record of interview with the police on 20 February 2008 the applicant denied that he had sent a photograph of a penis to CF and denied that he intended to groom CF. Upon forensic examination of the computer hard-drive, police located child pornography material. On 5 August 2008 the applicant was charged with one count of possess child pornography (which is count 2 in these proceedings). 

13The applicant lived with his son, Adam. The applicant and Adam's mother were divorced in 2006. Soon after the applicant was charged, he asked Adam to help him by writing a statement so that he could stay out of gaol. Adam was 17 at the time. The applicant told Adam the key points to include in the statement and asked him to write the statement in his own words incorporating those key points. After Adam wrote a draft, he showed it to the applicant who told him what changes to make. Adam then wrote a final version incorporating the applicant's changes.

14In this 5 page handwritten statement Adam said:

(2)His father was a nice person.

(3)He knew all about the Friends Page.

(4)He hacked into his father's email, MSN and the Friends Page.

(5)He chatted to people on the Friendship Page like ""Dark Mystical"" and ""Aussie Girl"" (which was the user name of CF).

(6)One night when his father went out to the club and during a party with his friends, he started messaging a girl on his father's mobile phone that his father had left behind.

(7)He then got a picture of a penis from the computer and sent it to her with a message like ""Is this big enough?""

(8)He got bored with it after a while and continued to drink with his friends.

(9)He got a program called ""Live Wire"" which he used to download pornography; and

(10)He would hide the pornography on his father's computer so that his father could not find it.

15Adam signed the first statement and handed it to the applicant who told him he was going to give it to his solicitor. Some time after Adam wrote the first statement in early 2009, the applicant asked him to write another version of the statement because he had changed solicitors. The applicant again told him the key points to include in the statement and asked Adam to write the statement in his own words. The applicant reviewed the draft before Adam wrote a final statement which he signed. The contents of that second statement were exculpatory of the applicant.

16At the time he was asked to write the first and second statements, Adam:

(a)had never been to any chat rooms called the Friendship Page.

(b)did not know any passwords used by his father on the internet.

(c)did not know anyone known as ""Dark Mystical"" or ""Aussie Girl"".

(d)had never used his father's profile ""Homie"".

(e)had never used his father's phone to send a message of a penis.

(f)did not know about any text ""Is this big enough"" or ""will this do"" and; finally

(g)had never used ""Live Wire"" to download child pornography.

17Adam asked the applicant why he had to write the statements and the applicant told him that he ""needed to do this to help him stay out of gaol"" and that everything would be fine because at the time the offences occurred, Adam was only 16 and would be treated as a minor. The applicant told Adam that if he did not agree to provide the statements, he might go to gaol and they would lose their house. 

18The applicant also asked Adam to find two friends to back up the story and get him out of trouble by writing a statement or attending a police interview. The applicant told Adam to tell his friends to say that they were at the party and that they knew that the picture of the penis was sent by Adam. The applicant said that he would give Adam some money as payment for signing the false statement but he did not mention any particular figure and no money was ever paid. At the applicant's request, Adam approached his two best friends, MH and CB, and asked them to help because there was a possibility that his father might go to gaol.

19After Adam wrote the second statement, the NSW Police contacted him and requested him to participate in an electronically recorded interview. Before Adam gave evidence to police, the applicant instructed him to make it clear that he (Adam) was the person who sent the picture of the penis and that it was he who downloaded the child pornography. The applicant also gave Adam the user names of the people he was to say he was talking to online.

20On 27 March 2009 Adam attended Parramatta Police Station and participated in an electronic interview, which lasted one and a half hours. In that interview, Adam gave a version of events consistent with the first and second statements. He provided the names of his two friends, MH and CB, who were supposedly at the party when the transmission of the photo took place. Subsequently, the two friends provided statements to the police with a similar false version of events.

21In early July 2009 subpoenas were issued regarded the child grooming trial that was to commence in August 2009. When Adam received his subpoena he became worried and had a conversation with the applicant about it. The applicant told him not to worry and that everything would be fine. On another occasion, in the presence of one of his friends, Adam told the applicant that he did not want to do it anymore, that he was scared and worried and that he did not want his friends to get into trouble for something that the applicant did. The applicant told Adam ""Don't worry about it, it will be fine, you're a minor, everything is going to be good. If anything ever goes wrong, I'll just take the blame anyway"".

22Towards the end of July, Adam contacted NSW Police and requested to speak about the versions he and his friends had previously given. On 29 July 2009 Adam participated in a second electronically recorded interview. In that interview, he retracted his original version contained in the first and second statements and in the first interview and informed the police that the version was fabricated. Throughout the interview, Adam was visibly distressed and broke down in tears. Adam provided a formal statement after the interview, retracting his original version. Subsequently his two friends provided statements to police retracting their original statements.

23Adam gave evidence for the Crown during the grooming trial. His evidence was that the contents of his first and second statements were untrue and that he gave false answers to the police in his first interview. Adam was cross-examined by the applicant's counsel at the grooming trial, both on the voire dire and before the jury, during which it was put to him that the version of events contained in his first and second statements and the first interview with the police was true and he was cross-examined in detail as to the contents of those statements and that interview.

24On 20 November 2009 the applicant was found guilty at the end of the trial of one count of use an internet carriage to groom CF (a minor), and one count of use of a mobile telephone carriage service to groom CF.

25Initially the applicant pleaded not guilty to the two charges, the subject of this application. The influencing witness trial commenced in the Sydney District Court on 25 August 2010. Adam gave evidence in that trial and was cross-examined by the applicant's counsel, during which it was again put to him that the version of events contained in his first and second statements and the first interview with police was true and that he was giving false evidence in the trial to protect a friend and because he had discovered that the applicant was not his biological father.

26On the fifth day of trial, after Adam had completed his evidence, the jury was discharged. Subsequently, the prosecution consented to the influencing witness charge and the child pornography charge being heard together at the request of the applicant's counsel. The matters were relisted for trial on 17 January 2011. Pleas of guilty were entered on 19 January 2011.

27The second count in these proceedings, was based on the police examination of the computer seized during the execution of the search warrant on 20 February 2008 in the course of the police investigation of the grooming offence. Of the 58 movie files on the computer, 7 contained child pornography material.

28Four of those files were Category 4 on the Oliver scale. The scale is from 1 to 5, 5 being the worst category. Category 4 depicts penetrative sexual activity between a child or children and an adult or adults. The remaining 3 were Category 3, namely non-penetrative sexual activity between children and adults. In order to understand the seriousness of the offences, it is necessary to provide an example of each category so as to put the offences in context.

29One of the Category 4 videos depicted two girls aged about 3 to 4 years old of South American appearance in a bath masturbating an adult penis. One female child then performed oral sex on the male's penis. A vibrator was then placed on the exterior of the vagina of one of the girls. An erect adult penis was shown being rubbed and penetrating the anus and vagina of one of the girls. This file was 4 minutes and 39 seconds in length.

30An example of Category 3 was two girls aged 13 and 6 kissing and masturbating an adult erect penis while the adult male touched one girl on the breast. This file was 41 seconds in length.

31Those two examples were the worst in each category. There were 9 children in total depicted in the movie files.

The sentence proceedings

32Having reviewed the facts, her Honour turned to the objective seriousness of the offending. She said, in relation to the child pornography offence:

""Serious though this offence is and a custodial sentence must be
imposed, in terms of the number of images, their category and the number of children involved and the short period of time the offender was engaged in this offence, it falls towards the lower end of the range of objective gravity."" (ROS 9.7)

33In relation to the objective seriousness of the influence witness offence, her Honour said:

""The influence witness offence is clearly the more serious. The offender's son was extremely upset during the recording in which he retracted his earlier false statement. Then, as I have related, he was extensively cross-examined during the trial in which the jury was discharged without verdict. The offender's actions were a breach of the trust that Adam had and was entitled to have in his father. The authorities make clear that such an offence strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system."" (ROS 9.8)

34Her Honour summarised the applicant's subjective features. He was aged 63 when he was imprisoned for the first time for the child grooming offences. He was trained as a fitter and had been in full employment until he was imprisoned. She accepted that the precipitating factor for the offences was the breakdown of his 20 year relationship with his wife. This in turn led to him becoming lonely and depressed.

35Two psychiatrists, Dr Donald Rowe and Dr Greenberg, provided reports to the effect that he was suffering from a major depressive disorder and an adjustment disorder with a depressed mood. The reports assessed the applicant at a low presumptive risk level, relative to other adult sex offenders. He was motivated to attend a suitable sex offenders program. Her Honour accepted that he was genuinely remorseful and that he had some insight into the seriousness of his behaviour.

36Her Honour took into account the results of the Crown appeal in respect of the child grooming offences. She noted that on 18 March 2014, which was the date on which the non-parole period as adjusted by the Court of Criminal Appeal would expire, the applicant would be 69 years of age.

37In relation to totality, her Honour said:

""While clearly these are separate offences from those in respect of which the offender was found guilty by a jury, they are very much part and parcel of the one episode. The principle of totality requires that the overall sentence to be imposed reflects all his criminality. The sentence for count 2 will be partially cumulative on the existing non-parole period and will commence on 19 September 2013 and the sentence for count 1 will be totally cumulative on the first."" (ROS 11.9)

38Her Honour made appropriate discounts for the somewhat late pleas of guilty and no challenge has been made to those discounts. In relation to special circumstances, her Honour said:

""I find special circumstances because of the accumulation of the sentences and because the offender is likely to require a longer period of assistance reintegrating into the community at his age after an inevitably lengthy sentence. The non-parole period to be fixed represents the minimum period that the offender should spend in prison having regard to all the elements of punishment including the objective seriousness of the offences, specific and general deterrence, denunciation and his subjective circumstances."" (ROS 12.7)

Application for an extension of time

39The applicant was sentenced on 13 April 2012. The application for an extension of time was not filed until 6 March 2014. The applicant filed the notice seeking leave to appeal against sentence on 7 March 2014. In support of the application for an extension of time was an affidavit from the applicant's solicitor, sworn 1 April 2014. 

40The only explanation for the delay provided by the affidavit is that after having been convicted of the child grooming offences, the applicant was in custody in Junee and that communication with him was difficult. The nature of the difficulty was not explained.

41The affidavit asserted that the only funding available for an appeal was through Legal Aid. Legal Aid was granted on 5 September 2013. A merit advice was received on 15 January 2014, after having been with counsel for 4 months. There was then a delay of 2 months before instructions were received from the applicant to proceed with the appeal.

42The Crown complained that there was no proper explanation for the delay between the handing down of sentence and the application for an extension of time and for leave to appeal against sentence. I agree. That, however, does not end the matter. The question of when and in what circumstances an extension of time should be granted was recently considered by the High Court in Kentwell v R [2014] HCA 37. There the plurality (French CJ, Hayne, Bell and Keane JJ) disapproved the test applied in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [46] - [49]. The test which the High Court approved was that in R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [35] where the Court of Criminal Appeal refrained from formulating any guideline for the exercise of the Court's discretion and held that an application for an extension of time was to be determined by asking whether ""It is just under the circumstances that such an order should be made"".

43The plurality in Kentwell said:

""30 ... The wide discretion conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal under the Act and Rules is to be exercised by consideration of what the interests of justice require in the particular case. Abdul was wrongly decided. It was an error to introduce in applications for an extension of time based on asserted ""Muldrock error"" consideration of whether refusal of the application would occasion substantial injustice.""

44In any event, the practical consequences are the same. As was done in Abdul and Kentwell, it is necessary for this Court to consider the merits of the grounds of appeal in order to decide whether it is just under the circumstances that an order for an extension of time should be made. Following that approach, it is necessary to consider the grounds of appeal.

Ground 1 - That her Honour erred when sentencing the appellant on Count 2, in failing to proceed to the second step, referred to by this Honourable Court in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17.

45The applicant submitted that based on the decision of R v Zamagias, a court was required to take a number of steps before finally determining the appropriate sentence. He submitted that these steps involved a preliminary question which was whether there was any alternative to the imposition of a term of imprisonment and in the event that the court determined that no other penalty was appropriate, the court must next determine what the term of sentence should be and finally, how that term of imprisonment should be served.

46The applicant accepted that her Honour had carried out the preliminary step and had determined the length of the sentence. He submitted that her Honour had not taken the final step of determining how the sentence was to be served, e.g. by way of suspending the sentence or an intensive correction order, or fulltime custody.

47In making that submission, the applicant accepted that if the ground of appeal was made out, it did not amount to an error such as would require re-sentence, but that ""the failure to record that the two step approach had been taken would lead the Court of Criminal Appeal to ""examine carefully"" the findings to determine ""whether the sentence was erroneous"".

Consideration

48This ground of appeal is misconceived. The analysis by Howie J in Zamagias set out a common sense mode of reasoning to be followed by a sentencing judge. The benefit of following such a mode of reasoning was that it brought transparency to the process of sentencing. What Zamagias does not do is to lay down some rule or inflexible practice whereby sentencing judges must set out their reasoning process in the way suggested. To so hold would be contrary to the instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing described in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 and approved in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 224 CLR 120.

49Her Honour's summation of the objective seriousness of count 2 was brief but accurate. The sentence which she imposed of 9 months, of which 6 months was concurrent with the existing non-parole period imposed by this Court was if anything, generous to the applicant.

50This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 2 - That her Honour erred in failing to consider the second limb of the principle of totality, namely to review the aggregate sentence on Counts 1 and 2 and consequently failed to consider whether the aggregate sentence was just and appropriate.

51The applicant submitted that in accordance with Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; 166 CLR 159 the ""total or aggregate sentence"" imposed on an offender must be ""just and appropriate"". He submitted that this principle had been breached. He submitted that the totality principle had two limbs, being:

(a)That the total effective sentence imposed on an offender, who has committed multiple offences, must bear a proper relationship to the overall criminality involved in all of the offences including those in respect of which the offender is still serving or is yet to serve a sentence of imprisonment.

(b)The total effective sentence imposed on an offender should not constitute a ""crushing sentence"" so as to ""destroy any reasonable expectation of useful life after release from custody"".

52He submitted that her Honour erred in this case by not considering the ""second limb"" of the totality principle and not expressly considering whether the additional sentences imposed by her would constitute a ""crushing"" sentence insofar as the applicant was concerned.

53The applicant submitted that while the sentences imposed by her Honour looked at in isolation, did not give rise to error, when taken in combination with the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal for the child grooming offences, the total effect of the sentences revealed error.

54The applicant submitted that the error in the approach of her Honour was that identified in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at 45 where McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said:

""45 To an offender, the only relevant question may be ""how long"", and that may suggest that a sentencing judge or appellate court should have regard only to the total effective sentence that is to be or has been imposed on the offender. Such an approach is likely to mask error. A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.""

55In oral submissions, the applicant made an additional point. He submitted that because the Court of Criminal Appeal had taken into account, as part of the background to the grooming offences, that the applicant had sought to influence his son to give false evidence, there was an element of double counting when her Honour imposed sentence for count 1. 

Consideration

56This ground is not made out.

57Her Honour was well aware of the connecting features between the grooming offences and the offences which were before her. That is why a considerable part of the judgment set out the factual background so as to place the offences before her in their proper context. What that recital of facts made clear was that despite the factual linkage, the offences before her were entirely separate, both as to time and content, from the child grooming offences.

58The child grooming offences took place between 28 October 2006 and 1 January 2007 and involved the conduct which has been described. It ceased on 1 January 2007 when the mother of the child told the applicant to cease contacting her daughter. The applicant's conduct in committing the child pornography offence occurred between 1 February 2008 and 21 February 2008, more than a year after the child grooming offences had been committed. The applicant's conduct in the influence a witness offence occurred between 20 February 2008 and 20 November 2009, after the last of the child pornography files had been downloaded and more than a year after the child grooming offences had been committed.

59The criminality in the child grooming offences, the child pornography offence and the influencing a witness offence was quite different. There was no overlap in the offending conduct. The only overlap was the apparent cause of the criminal conduct, i.e. the applicant's reaction to the breakdown of his marriage.

60As was pointed out by Howie J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Harrison J agreed) in R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [56] a sentence should not be concurrent ""simply because of the similarity of the conduct or because it may be seen as part of the one course of criminal conduct ... The question to be asked is, can the sentence for one offence encompass the criminality of all the offences?"" In this case not only could it not be said that the offences involved one course of criminal conduct but the sentence for the child grooming offences certainly could not encompass the criminality of the offences before her Honour.

61In R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38 at [5] Hall J (with whom Tobias JA and Kirby J agreed) included the following in the totality propositions which he derived:

""52 There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively: see Cahyadi v Regina (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at 47. However, a number of propositions relevant to the consideration of that issue may be derived from the case law. They include the following: 

(1) It is well established that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. What is important is that, firstly, an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence; and, secondly, that the total sentence imposed properly reflects the totality of the criminality: Regina v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38] per Simpson, Barr and Latham JJ agreeing.

...


(5) If the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentences ought to be concurrent, otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the totality of the two offences: Cayhadi (supra) per Howie J at [27].

(6) If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality: Cayhadi (supra) per Howie J at [27].

(7) Whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other calls for the identification and an evaluation of relevant factors pertaining to the offences. These will include the nature and seriousness of each offence.""

62As the applicant recognised, the influencing a witness offence struck at the very heart of the criminal justice system. In this case, there was an added dimension of seriousness because of the traumatic effect which the offence had on Adam and the breach of trust on the part of the applicant which this involved.

63Her Honour specifically referred to the principle of totality in her sentence judgment and did so immediately following her description of the sentence imposed for the grooming offences (see [37] hereof). She clearly took the principle into account and it was not necessary for her to make any reference to whether or not the sentences were likely to be ""crushing"". The length of the sentences imposed made it clear that not only was her Honour aware of the principle of totality but she applied it.

64Insofar as the question of double counting is said to arise, a proper reading of the Court of Criminal Appeal decision in Asplund v R makes it clear that nothing of that kind occurred. On the contrary, the Court of Criminal Appeal imposed sentences only for the matters which were before it as did her Honour.

Ground 3 - That her Honour erred in that, having recited the appellant's age and having made no reference to his date of birth, she failed to consider the appellant's age as a factor in mitigation and, in particular, failed to consider whether or not mercy should be afforded to the appellant by reason of his advanced age and/or that each additional year of sentence represented a substantial proportion of the period of life left to the appellant and/or the rigour of imprisonment for a person of the age of the appellant.

65The applicant submitted that having been born in November 1944, and not being eligible for parole until 18 December 2015 as a result of her Honour's sentences, he would be aged 71 at that time. He submitted that at such an age, any reasonable expectation of a useful life after release would have been largely destroyed. He submitted that this was a matter which was important and to which her Honour should have specifically referred and taken into account as a mitigating factor.

Consideration

66This ground of appeal is based on an incorrect understanding of the facts. When considering special circumstances, her Honour specifically referred to the applicant's age (see [38] hereof) as a reason for making that finding in the applicant's favour. She gave effect to that finding of special circumstances by reducing the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence from the 75 percent prescribed by s44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to 37.5 percent.

67Moreover, there was no specific evidence before her Honour as to any frailty on the part of the applicant due to health or age considerations. To the extent that there was evidence before her Honour, it was to the contrary. In any event, the authorities are clear that a sentencing judge cannot otherwise reduce an appropriate term of imprisonment, simply on the basis that it is likely to extend to most of the offender's remaining life expectancy (Goebel-McGregor v R [2006] NSWCCA 390 at [128] per James J (with whom Hidden and Hislop JJ agreed); Barton v R [2009] NSWCCA 164. 

68This ground of appeal has not been made out.

69For the reasons set out, the grounds of appeal relied upon have no prospects of success and should be dismissed. In those circumstances, applying the test in Kentwell, it is not just for an extension of time to be granted. I would refuse to extend time. Accordingly, the order which I propose is that the application for extension of time be refused.

70HIDDEN J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

71DAVIES J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2704311,R v Tonari [2014] NSWCCA 232,"Judgment
1Johnson J: I agree with Garling J.
2Harrison J: I agree with Garling J.
3Garling J:  This is an appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against an aggregate sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months, imposed in the District Court by Phegan ADCJ on 10 December 2013.  
4The respondent, Nobutomo Tonari, was found guilty by a jury of five counts of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, and two counts contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act of indecent assault. 
First Appeal
5Mr Tonari appealed against his convictions with respect to all seven counts.  For the reasons which were given, the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the appeal with respect to Counts 1, 3, 4 and 5, involving the convictions of Mr Tonari for offences against s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act.  In respect of each of those counts, it substituted a verdict of guilty of offences against s 61I of the Crimes Act of having sexual intercourse without consent: Tonari v R [2013] NSWCCA 232.
6The Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act remitted the whole of the proceedings to the District Court so that Mr Tonari could be sentenced for the five offences under s 61I of the Crimes Act, and the two offences under s 61L of the Crimes Act, in respect of which his appeal against conviction was dismissed.  
7Accordingly, when Mr Tonari came to be sentenced in December 2013 he was sentenced for five offences contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, and two offences contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act.  The maximum penalty for an offence against s 61I of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for 14 years.  There is an applicable standard non-parole period of 7 years.  The maximum penalty for an offence against s 61L of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for 5 years.  No standard non-parole period applies to this offence.  
Sentence Imposed
8Phegan ADCJ imposed a single aggregate sentence in respect of all seven offences.  That sentence was one of 4 years imprisonment commencing on 20 July 2013 with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment expiring on 19 January 2016.  
9In respect of each of the seven counts, Phegan ADCJ gave indicative sentences.  They were as follows:
Count No.Short description of offenceIndicative sentence1.Sexual intercourse without consent on 12 May 20112 years 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years.2.Indecent assault on 12 May 2011Bond3.Sexual intercourse without consent on 12 May 20111 year 6 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 1 year4.Sexual intercourse without consent on 12 May 20112 years 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years5.Sexual intercourse without consent on 12 May 20113 years 4 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 2 years 6 months6.Indecent assault on 12 May 20111 year imprisonment fixed term7.Sexual intercourse without consent on 12 May 20113 years 4 months imprisonment with non-parole period of 2 years 6 months
Crown Appeal
10The Crown gave notice of its intention to appeal by filing a Notice of Appeal on 8 January 2014.  At that time it contended that the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.
11On 15 May 2014, the Crown filed Amended Grounds of Appeal setting out five grounds.  They are as follows:
(1)Having found that the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour was in the middle of the range, the sentencing Judge failed to have proper regard to the standard non-parole period of seven years.
(2)Having given an indicative sentence for each offence his Honour failed to give proper consideration to the issues of accumulation and concurrency and the principle of totality.
(3)His Honour failed to give any weight to personal deterrence and general deterrence.
(4)His Honour erred in varying the statutory ratio, having found special circumstances, to an extent that resulted in the non-parole period not properly reflecting the objective seriousness of the offending behaviour.
(5)The aggregate sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.  
Facts of the Offences
12The following is a sufficient account of the facts, taken from the Remarks on Sentence of the sentencing Judge.  
13The victim, MT, was a 29 year old Japanese woman who had come to Australia at the beginning of 2011 for a working holiday in order to improve her English.  The respondent, Mr Tonari, was at the time 28 years of age, and was a Japanese citizen who had come on a working visa to Australia.
14The two first met at an organisation which had been set up for the purpose of helping Japanese visitors to Australia to improve their English language skills and any other matters upon which they required assistance.  
15Having met at that organisation, and having had further contact, Mr Tonari and the victim exchanged telephone numbers and made arrangements to meet for a cup of coffee on the afternoon of 11 May 2011.
16After the cup of coffee, and a visit to a shopping centre, Mr Tonari and the victim went to the apartment where the victim lived.  Mr Tonari had indicated that he would prepare an evening meal for them.
17After the meal was concluded, and the two were talking in the living room of the apartment, Mr Tonari invited the victim to come and sit next to him on the sofa where he was already sitting.  She complied with that request but when he made sexual advances to her, she resisted them.
18The conversation continued until well beyond midnight when the victim suggested to Mr Tonari that it was time for him to go home.  Mr Tonari left the apartment in order to catch a bus.  Soon after there was a telephone call during which Mr Tonari informed the victim that there were no buses running and asked if he could to return to the apartment to sleep there for the night.  
19Mr Tonari was readmitted by the victim upon condition that he would sleep on the couch in the living room.  The victim then showered and changed in readiness for bed, retired to her room for the evening and went to sleep.  
20Sometime later, after she had fallen asleep, the victim awoke to find Mr Tonari lying on top of her and pushing her down on the bed.  There was some argument about money and threats were made by Mr Tonari.  
21The victim said she was scared of Mr Tonari and complied with whatever he told her to do.  At one stage, she screamed whilst she was being held down by her neck.  Mr Tonari punched her in the stomach in retaliation.  
22Mr Tonari then started to remove his jeans and continued, forcefully, to tell the victim to be quiet.  He then forced the victim to engage in fellatio for about one minute.  This incident constituted Count 1 on the Indictment.  
23Mr Tonari then lifted up the victim's nightdress and underclothing and exposed her breasts which he proceeded to lick for a short time.  This constituted the first indecent assault which was contained in Count 2.  
24Whilst still lying on top of the victim, Mr Tonari digitally penetrated her vagina for a short time.  This constituted Count 3.
25Mr Tonari then kissed the victim on the mouth, in a particular way, which constituted the second act of indecent assault contained in Count 6 of the Indictment.
26Again, during the course of this episode of assault, Mr Tonari forced the victim to engage in fellatio for a relatively short period of time of about one minute.  This constituted the act of sexual assault referred to in Count 4 of the Indictment.
27Following this, Mr Tonari removed his penis from the victim's mouth and engaged in penile/vaginal intercourse.  During this episode of intercourse, he removed and reinserted his penis.  This constituted the sexual assault referred to in Count 5 of the Indictment.
28Finally, having removed his penis from the victim's vagina, Mr Tonari put his penis into the victim's mouth and ejaculated.  This was the last act of the counts of sexual assault covered in the Indictment, and constituted Count 7.
29According to the victim, after the last of these acts of sexual intercourse, Mr Tonari changed his mood, calmed down and soon after that fell asleep.  The victim went to the toilet and noticed that there was some bleeding from her vagina.  She contemplated escaping from the unit but feared that Mr Tonari would prevent her from doing so physically and she therefore returned to bed.
30In the morning there was some further discussion in which the victim questioned Mr Tonari about why he would do to her what he did, following which Mr Tonari left the unit.
31The victim telephoned her mother in Japan and reported what had occurred.  She also reported the assault to her host mother in Sydney, who called the police.  The police attended.  She was taken to hospital where she was examined, and then later made a statement to the police.
32The medical examination identified bruising to the victim's neck and other parts of the body and the existence of genital abrasion consistent with forceful penetration.  
33The case of Mr Tonari at trial, which the jury clearly rejected, was that all of the sexual contact between him and the victim was consensual.  It was his case, which must also have been rejected by the jury, that the victim's allegations of non-consensual sex of various kinds was the consequence of her determination to obtain compensation on the basis of deliberately false allegations.  This was, according to evidence given by a Japanese professor of law, a common practice in cases of alleged rape in Japan.
34The sentencing Judge in his Remarks noted that both the issue of consent to the various counts of sexual intercourse, and the issue of a desire for compensation, had been rejected by the victim in evidence.  
35The verdicts of the jury necessarily meant that the account given by Mr Tonari was rejected.  The sentencing Judge proceeded upon a determination of facts which also found that the account was incorrect.  
Remarks on Sentence
36Having recounted the history of the proceedings, the facts to which I have made reference and the first judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, his Honour proceeded to deal with the question of sentence.  
37He commenced by noting the maximum sentences and the existence of the standard non-parole period.  Having referred to a number of authorities, his Honour expressed his approach as being one in which he treated the standard non-parole period as a guideline or a yardstick with respect to the appropriate sentence.  His remarks in this respect were unexceptional.
38His Honour then proceeded to make an assessment of the objective gravity of the overall offences and, in so doing, dealt collectively with all of the offences.  His Honour noted that the offences had occurred over a relatively short period of time.  He noted that the offences involved Mr Tonari physically restraining the victim and threatening her in a way which was sufficient to cause her to submit to the offences.  
39He also noted that on two occasions in the course of the sexual assaults, the offender had struck the victim.
40His Honour then expressed the view that the objective seriousness of the offences, in total, would not 
""... certainly rise above what used to be described, although these terms are now not necessarily used, the midrange of objective seriousness.""
41His Honour then considered various of the factors referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  His Honour noted the following aggravating factors:
(a)the existence of verbal threats of violence: s 21A(2)(b);
(b)the offence was committed in the home of the victim: s 21A(2)(eb).  His Honour noted that this was an aggravating factor because the victim was entitled to feel secure in her home.  However, he noted that the entry by Mr Tonari into the victim's home was not a violent intrusion, but had occurred by consent; and
(c)his Honour noted the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence by reference to the Victim Impact Statement: s 21A(2)(g).  His Honour expressed the view, having considered the Victim Impact Statement, that he did not think that this particular factor was a significant aggravating factor over and above the consequences which would otherwise be expected to occur.
42His Honour then turned to consider the mitigating factors in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  His Honour noted the following:
(a)the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity, but was rather a spontaneous event: s 21A(3)(b);
(b)that Mr Tonari did not have any criminal record in Australia or in his home country of Japan, and that he was a person of good character: s 21A(3)(e)(f);
(c)his Honour then turned to consider whether Mr Tonari was unlikely to reoffend, whether he had good prospects of rehabilitation and whether he had shown remorse: s 21A(3)(g)(h)(i).
43His Honour noted that these factors were interconnected.  He further noted that although Mr Tonari maintained his innocence of the charges, and maintained that the episode was entirely consensual, he was able to assess his prospects of rehabilitation largely by reference to a Pre-Sentence Report of 1 November 2012.  His Honour noted the assessment was that the risk of reoffending was low to moderate.  His Honour found that the offender was likely to be responsive to attempts at rehabilitation.  He said that he was satisfied that the likelihood of re-offending was very low.  He noted that there had been no expression of remorse, but regarded that factor as being of no particular weight.
44His Honour then turned to consider other matters which subjectively bore upon the sentence which was to be imposed.  He noted the reports of a psychologist, Mr Anthony Diment.  The first of Mr Diment's reports was dated 28 October 2012.  The second was dated 29 November 2013.  
45The first matter which his Honour took into account was that Mr Tonari had a condition known as an obsessive compulsive disorder.  This was apparently a condition which had emerged during his high school years, but which had been under control prior to the events in question.  His Honour noted that the condition had re-emerged as a consequence of the offences, and the events which had occurred since that time.  
46His Honour noted that Mr Diment's view was that the condition required treatment and that such treatment was not available to a person in full-time custody.  Whilst his Honour did not accept that treatment of an appropriate kind would not be available, he did accept that the consequence for Mr Tonari during any period spent in full-time custody was a negative one, namely that it would impact more harshly on his custody than would otherwise be the case.
47His Honour also took into account, having regard to Mr Tonari's background and his limited language skills, and that this was his first time in custody, that the custody would be harsher than would otherwise be the case.
48Additionally, his Honour had regard to the lengthy and protracted history of the proceedings and the fact that, having regard to the involvement of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the first decision with respect to conviction, the sentencing proceedings themselves took an extended period which was well over 12 months.  
49His Honour then went on to consider each Count and set out the indicative sentences which he proposed.  Having set them out, his Honour then came to consider the process of evaluating the need for concurrency and/or accumulation.  He said this:
""I have already noted in my description of the general circumstances of the offence that each of the acts were part of an unplanned and impetuous series of sexual acts all of which occurred over a relatively short period of time in rapid succession.  
They were generally part of one overall act of sexual aggression and that therefore there is a justification for substantial concurrency in the sentences.  Were that to be the end of the matter that would lead to an overall sentence of two and a half years non-parole period accompanied by ten months on parole, and I note in particular in that regard for that purpose all of the sentences for sexual assault under 61I are served concurrently and that the different sentences in the case of the two acts of indecency would require the sentence on count 6, that is the fixed term of imprisonment to be served concurrently with the non-parole period on the more serious offences and the s 9 bond to take effect from the commencement of the period on parole, that is on release from the non-parole period.""
50He went on to consider accumulation and said:
""In those circumstances I cannot accept that the sentence in that particular case [Count 5] can be totally absorbed in the sentences on the other matters and that therefore there should be an accumulation to the extent of an additional period of six months full-time imprisonment.  That would therefore lead to a total, and again I emphasise at this stage taking a proper account of the principle of totality, a sentence of three years non-parole period accompanied by one year on parole.""
51His Honour then considered the question of special circumstances.  He held that there were additional matters to those which he had taken into account on the sentence which justify an adjustment of the ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period.  He noted that Mr Tonari was not fluent in English and that, on the evidence before him, this created difficulty communicating with Corrective Services officers and other inmates.  He noted that Mr Tonari had difficulty in understanding announcements and instructions which were issued.  He also noted that because of the nature of the offences, Mr Tonari had been placed in protective custody.  He found that he was persuaded that Mr Tonari:
""... has found and will continue find full-time custody a disproportionately negative and difficult experience""
and held that this factor, together with the others, justified a finding of special circumstances.
52His Honour further noted that given that Mr Tonari was a Japanese national who came to live in Australia on his own, imprisonment would take place in circumstances where his mother, father and wife, although they remained supportive of him, would be unlikely to be able to provide immediate support in the physical sense by visiting him more than once a year.  His Honour then went on to say this:
""In all those circumstances, therefore, my view is that an appropriate sentence following all that I have already said and taking into account the special circumstances is a sentence of two years and six months of non-parole period and a further one year and six months on parole.""
53It is now convenient to consider each of the grounds of appeal of the Crown.
54Although the grounds are specifically identified, the Crown Prosecutor, at the commencement of her oral submissions, acknowledged that:
""... in a sense they are particulars of ... ground 5 which is [that] the aggregate sentence as imposed was manifestly inadequate.  What the Crown has sought to do is to identify how his Honour erred in coming to a sentence which ... is manifestly inadequate.""
55Thus, the ultimate question of substance for this Court is whether the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.
Ground 1 - Failure to have Proper Regard to the Standard Non-Parole Period
56The Crown submits that, based upon the finding that the criminal conduct was in the mid-range of objective seriousness, the sentencing Judge 
""... paid only lip service to the existence of a SNPP [standard non-parole period] which was applicable to five of the offences.""
57The Crown acknowledges in its submissions that the sentencing Judge in his Remarks highlighted the existence of the standard non-parole periods which were applicable, and the maximum sentences applicable.  
58The Crown also concedes that having done so, his Honour correctly identified the appropriate legal approach when he said:
""Taking into account what was said in those and other Court of Criminal Appeal decisions, in light of the High Court decision in Muldrock, I adopt the approach which does treat a standard non-parole period as a guideline or yardstick with regard to the appropriate sentence ...""
59The submissions of the Crown seem to have two components.  The first, the terms of the statute fixing the standard non-parole period, and secondly, a failure of the sentencing Judge to give adequate reasons for fixing a sentence significantly less than the standard non-parole period.  
60Ultimately, the Crown's submission on this ground is that in the circumstances:
""... the non-parole period as imposed for the aggregate sentence was manifestly inadequate.""
61The initial Crown submissions based upon the construction of the statute are in error and cannot be accepted.  That is because the Crown, in its written submissions, has relied upon a version of s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, which had been amended prior to the sentence being imposed, although the conviction had occurred earlier.  During oral submissions, the Crown accepted that its reference to that version of the statute was erroneous.  
62The statute which existed at the time of the sentencing, and which the sentencing Judge was obliged to apply, simply required that the standard non-parole period for an offence is: 
""... a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender ..."".  
63The sentencing Judge clearly did.  He said that he would, and did so, in accordance with the current legal approach.
64The Court is required to make a record of its reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period: s 54B(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
65The respondent submitted that the reasons which were given were entirely adequate.  In fact, he submitted that the reasons, which were detailed and extended for over 30 pages, read as a whole, clearly indicated the basis upon which the sentencing Judge regarded the sentence which he imposed as one which was appropriate even though it was less than the standard non-parole period.  
66His Honour did not specifically describe one part of his reasons as being directed to complying with the Court's obligations under s 54B(5) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Whilst an approach which does so has much to commend it, that is not required by the legislation.  What is required is for this Court to determine whether it has, in the entirety of its reasons, complied with the provision.  In my opinion, his Honour has done so, and the respondent's submissions on this issue should be accepted.
67It is also appropriate to note that even if his Honour had not done so, such a failure does not invalidate the sentence: s 54B(7) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
68In my view, the sentencing Judge applied the correct test and took into account, in accordance with principle, the standard non-parole period.  His Honour gave extensive reasons for arriving at his conclusion.  I see no error of any specific kind as claimed in this ground of appeal.  
69The extent to which the sentencing Judge took the non-parole period into account, and the weight which he gave it, are matters that will ultimately be appropriately considered under the final ground of appeal dealing with manifest inadequacy.
70I would propose that this ground of appeal be rejected.
Ground 2: Accumulation and Concurrency
71The Crown submits by reference to the indicative sentences that, although the sentencing Judge expressly referred to the totality principle, the sentence ultimately imposed did not demonstrate that the sentencing Judge had given proper consideration to issues of accumulation and concurrency, and the principle of totality.
72The Crown submits that the sentencing Judge's Remarks that an accumulation of 6 months between Counts 5 and 7, which were the most serious of the offences and which were both said by the sentencing Judge to be in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, was not addressed in the sentences actually imposed and that, in any event, there should have been a greater accumulation than a 6 month period.  The Crown submitted that as the indicative sentences for each of Counts 5 and 7 were ""light"", they required a level of accumulation which would reflect the seriousness of the offending behaviour overall.
73The Crown submits that the sentencing Judge adopted an unduly favourable approach for the applicant by finding that all of the conduct constituting the seven counts was:
""... generally part of one overall act of sexual aggression and that therefore there is a justification for substantial concurrency in the sentences"".
74It is always necessary, and the Crown so submitted, that when sentencing, the sentencing Judge recognises the need to acknowledge and have regard to the separate harm done by the different criminal acts of the offender.  It is necessary when a court is sentencing for multiple offences for the sentencing court to have regard to the fact that there are multiple episodes of criminality.  Often, but not always, total concurrency obscures the fact that different offences have been committed, and it does not necessarily recognise the total criminality involved.  Thus, total or near total concurrency can often result in an overly lenient sentence.  
75For the Crown to succeed on this, as a separate ground of appeal, it needs to demonstrate an error of law.  
76His Honour clearly had regard to questions of accumulation and concurrency.  He explicitly said so.  He characterised the conduct in a particular way and applied, at least by reference to the individual indicative sentences, a degree of concurrency in reaching the total sentence which he ultimately imposed.  The sentencing Judge achieved this result by increasing the non-parole period for one of the two more serious counts on the indictment (Count 7) by a period of six months.  
77In those circumstances it may be, as the Crown ultimately contends, the sentence imposed was manifestly lenient.  However, I can detect no error of the kind alleged in his Honour's consideration of this question of accumulation and totality.  
78I would not be prepared to separately uphold the appeal on this ground.
Ground 3: Personal and General Deterrence
79The Crown submits that his Honour gave no weight to factors of personal and general deterrence.  
80This ground is entirely based upon the sentencing Judge's failure to specifically identify general deterrence and specific deterrence as factors which he took into account.  The mere failure to mention these undoubtedly relevant factors does not of itself, and without more, bespeak error.  His Honour did refer in a general sense to the objects of sentencing in his Remarks on Sentence.  This, at least by implication, suggests that his Honour had regard to general and specific deterrence.  
81This ground is best and appropriately dealt with as a particular of the final ground of manifest inadequacy.  
82I would not be prepared to separately uphold this ground, because I am not satisfied that the failure to mention these elements involved any error of law.  
Ground 4: Variation of Statutory Ratio
83The Crown submits that in circumstances where the sentencing Judge had found that special circumstances existed, his variation of the statutory ratio was to such an extent that:
""... the already inadequate sentence as proposed by his Honour was varied so that the aggregate non parole period in no way reflected the seriousness of the offending."" (sic)
84The Crown does not submit that a finding of special circumstances was not available to the sentencing Judge.  Rather, it submits that by varying the statutory ratio to the extent which he did, the result is a sentence which is manifestly inadequate. 
85It is appropriate to regard this ground as being subsumed in the final ground of manifest inadequacy, and I will not separately deal with it here.
Ground 5: Manifest Inadequacy
86This is the principal ground of appeal.  
87In persuading a court that sentences are manifestly inadequate, the Crown bears the obligation to show that the sentences are unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25: (2006) 228 CLR 357.  It is insufficient for the Crown, in order to succeed on this ground, to show that the appellate court would take a different view from that taken by the sentencing Judge.
88Any consideration of the sentence which was imposed, being a total sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2½ years, needs to consider the context which has been discussed at length, namely the nature and extent of the criminal conduct involved in the seven counts, and that in respect of the five counts of conduct contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act, that there is a maximum penalty of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  
89The Crown points to the fact that the respondent fell to be sentenced after a trial, and so there was no discount to be allowed by reason of any plea of guilty.  Further, the Crown points to the fact that the sentencing Judge determined that the objective seriousness overall was, it submits, in the mid-range of objective seriousness.  
90With respect to this last submission, in the course of oral argument, the Crown accepted that the accurate way of describing the sentencing Judge's determination on this issue, was to say that he determined that the objective seriousness was not above the mid-range.
91The Crown accepts that the sentencing Judge found, and that it was open to him so to do, that the respondent was not likely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation.  However, the Crown submits that notwithstanding such a finding, the sentencing Judge is not entitled to ignore any issue of specific deterrence: see Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 per Davies J at [18]; Church v R [2012] NSWCCA 149 per Button J at [48].
92The Crown points in its submissions to the need not only for personal deterrence, but also general deterrence having regard to the nature of the offences.  In addition, it submits that there was a substantial impact on the complainant and that all of these factors indicated that the sentence ultimately imposed was unreasonable or plainly unjust and, so, manifestly inadequate.
93The respondent submitted that, although the sentence may be regarded as lenient, it was nevertheless within the bounds of the sentencing Judge's discretion.  
94The respondent pointed to the fact that there had been considerable delay after verdict, through no fault of the respondent, in imposing a sentence upon him.  The respondent submits that delay is a potentially powerful mitigating factor on sentence: R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303.  In particular, the respondent pointed to the fact that he was convicted on 27 August 2012, the sentencing proceedings commenced on 9 November 2012, but that he did not come back before the Court to be finally sentenced until 6 December 2013.  The sentence was actually imposed a few days later on 10 December 2013.  The respondent submitted that there was a period of about 2½ years which had elapsed between his arrest and his final sentencing for a large part of which (2 years and 2 months) he had been on bail. 
95The respondent submitted that the particular circumstances which attached to him during his period of bail should merit significant consideration.  The respondent, noting that he was a Japanese national, submitted that during his period on bail he was not able to return home to Japan, and hence remained isolated from his wife and family.  He was unable to work and was in effect largely confined to his residential accommodation.  
96Before the sentencing Judge, the Crown Prosecutor accepted that as a matter of principle, it was open to a sentencing Judge to take account of the length and terms of an offender's period on bail awaiting trial or sentence: R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321; (2003) 151 A Crim R 166.  In that case the Court was persuaded that there was: 
""an obvious and significant disruption to the appellant's life and restrictions upon his liberty over a lengthy period as a result of the offence ..."".
At [242] the Court said:
""We accept that in an appropriate case the length and terms of an offender's period on bail awaiting trial or sentence is a matter relevant to the determination of the proper sentence to be imposed.  What weight is to be given to such a matter will vary from case to case, depending upon what other factors need to be considered and what sentence is required in the particular case to address the purpose of punishment.  Where that purpose is the protection of the community and the conditions of bail are particularly onerous, such as where the offender has been required to reside at a rehabilitation establishment, very significant weight might be placed upon such a factor where it is appropriate having regard to the nature of the offence.  However, in other cases, less weight may be given to such a consideration, particularly where the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is required for the purposes of denouncing the crime and reflecting general deterrence.""
97The respondent, in submissions to this Court, also pointed to the strong subjective case which was advanced before the sentencing Judge.  Mr Anthony Diment, a consultant psychologist, completed two reports which were before the sentencing Judge - the first in October 2012 and the second in November 2013.  The first report was prepared after an interview with the respondent whilst he was in custody, and the second occurred whilst he was on bail.  
98Mr Diment took a history that since about the age 12 or 13, the respondent had been diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (""OCD"") which had been ""controlled"" prior to the respondent entering custody.  OCD is a serious debilitating condition characterised by ""obsessions"" or thoughts that are intrusive and cause distress to an individual.  
99The respondent described his OCD in this way to Mr Diment:
""Mr Tonari stated that when aged about 12 he felt 'different' to others and told me for example if he ate a potato chip from a bag and someone else touched it he couldn't eat any more.  He also was agitated if his belongings or possessions were not in' a nice and organised way'.  He described 'compulsions' (repetitive behaviours which are attempts to reduce or neutralise the obsessions, often ritualistic in nature) involving 'lots of washing of hands'.  ... Mr Tonari told me his cell-mate does not wash his hands after using the shared cell toilet and 'my anxiety goes way up as I don't want him to touch things - I have asked him to wash his hands on three occasions but he gets very irritated and I don't want to go any further than this.  The food and cleaning here is not very good'.""
100With respect to his OCD, Mr Tonari told Mr Diment that he could control it much better when he was living by himself.  
101At the time he came to Australia, Mr Tonari had been married for four years to a woman who worked as a fashion model.  They had no children.  Because of her work, they spent a considerable time apart which seems to have caused some strain in their marriage.  
102According to Mr Diment, upon examination, testing and assessment, the respondent, by 2013 was in the moderate range of clinical anxiety and in the severe range for depression.  Both of these assessments showed considerable deterioration from 2012.  He was suffering a number of physical symptoms including sleep change and loss of appetite.  Mr Diment recorded that throughout the period of time that Mr Tonari was on bail, he had not had any further treatment for his anxiety or depression, nor any medical management of his OCD.  His ability was restricted to work on either a part-time or casual basis, and his shortage of funds meant that he was simply unable to afford any treatment for his psychological conditions and any likely medication costs.  
103Mr Diment concluded that Mr Tonari met the diagnostic criteria for Major Depression, and that the legal proceedings, the guilty verdict, and his period of incarceration had ""re-triggered"" his OCD which had previously been largely controlled.  
104Of this disorder, Mr Diment said:
""... he is at high risk of further serious de-compensation without professional intervention (psychiatric and psychological treatment on a continuing basis is the usual approach with this difficult to treat and debilitating condition).  He is at risk in a custodial situation, given the nature of this disorder and the difficulty in enlisting the 'tolerant social support' required in its management and also of encountering difficulty with other in-mates in the strict Corrective Services regimes."" (sic)
105Senior counsel for the respondent pointed to the fact that any term of imprisonment would entail social and cultural isolation.  He relied upon the fact that the respondent did not come to Australia for the purpose of committing crime, and hence there was no reason to reduce the weight which would otherwise be applicable to these matters.  He submitted that it was open to the sentencing Judge to give this matter significant weight.
106In all of those circumstances, senior counsel for the respondent submitted that it had not been demonstrated that the sentence was manifestly inadequate.  
107I am conscious that the power of this Court to substitute a sentence on the basis that the sentence pronounced by the sentencing Judge is manifestly inadequate, is not enlivened by reason of this Court considering that it would give greater weight to one or another element.  I need to be satisfied that the sentencing Judge's discretion miscarried because in the result: 
""... his Honour imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards."" (references omitted)
Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; (2013) 87 ALJR 1022 at [24].
108The objective seriousness of the conduct here was correctly regarded by the sentencing Judge as being no greater than the mid-range.  The sentencing Judge correctly identified the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  It was of particular importance that the offence took place in the home of the victim into which the respondent had been invited but on condition that he remained on the couch during the night, a condition which he breached.
109The offences for which the respondent was convicted, although they occurred in a relatively short space of time, nevertheless were each individually serious and needed to be considered in that respect.  
110Undoubtedly, the respondent had a strong subjective case.  Taking all of these matters into account, I am unable to accept that the sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge was within a reasonable range.  In my view, it was manifestly lenient.  
111In my view, in considering the question of totality of the criminality involved and giving due weight to each of the 7 counts, an overall sentence greater than that here involved was warranted and the imposition of the sentence demonstrates an error of law.  
112There are a number of reasons which justify this conclusion.  First, some accumulation was required in order to achieve a proper sentence.  Secondly, the subjective case, whilst important and weighty, needed to be properly balanced in the sentence and it appears to have been excessively weighted.  Thirdly, the effect of the statutory non-parole period as a guidepost has not been given due weight.  Finally, the sentence imposed does not pay due regard to general deterrence.  These are all features which in combination have led to my conclusion of manifest inadequacy giving rise to an error of law of the requisite kind.  
113I would propose that this ground of appeal be upheld.  
Residual Discretion
114Under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act, this Court has a discretion to dismiss an appeal even though it has reached a conclusion that a particular sentence (or sentences) are manifestly inadequate.  
115The Court has, for the purpose of its consideration of this question, been provided with a number of affidavits.  There was no challenge to the contents of the affidavits.  The affidavit of the respondent, and also of his solicitor, provides ample evidence that the respondent's circumstances in custody are particularly difficult.  He is visited rarely, and then only by one individual whose visa expired in August of this year.  He has occasional telephone contact with his wife.  He is unable readily to manage his OCD in custody, and finds his time in custody particularly stressful when dealing with that disorder.  He gives this example:
""For instance I became very concerned to hear that the server of the food at the jail does not wear a mask.  I also found a piece of plastic contained in my food.  Those makes me feel that the food has been contaminated and I lose appetite.  As a result, I often eat tinned food that I buy from the jail's shop with my limited money."" (sic)
116He also notes his difficulties managing his OCD when sharing a cell with an inmate, particularly one who has little or no regard for ordinary standards of cleanliness.  
117In addition, the evidence provided gives an example of how the respondent's OCD has led to a difficult circumstance with custodial staff, and he has been threatened with being put in a segregation cell because of his requests for accommodation suitable to his OCD.
118He has significant difficulties in communicating with custodial staff, and carries with him a Japanese/English dictionary in order to help him communicate.  He is able to take one 2 hour English language course once a week whilst in custody.  With the exception of his English classes, the respondent does not have available to him any other education courses or other activities to occupy his time in custody.  
119As well, by reason of his racial background and his relatively slight build, the respondent has been the subject of a number of assaults, both sexual and physical, during his time in custody.  
120The respondent's family, including his wife, all live in Japan.  They have not come to visit him since he has been in custody.  There is no reason to think that will change in the future.  He gets no treatment or medical assistance for his OCD whilst in custody, although he has requested it.
121None of these facts were challenged by the Crown.  There is no suggestion that his behaviour in custody has brought him to the notice of the custodial officers in terms of any failure to comply with jail discipline.  
122As well, as is apparent from remarks which I have earlier made and as the further evidence on the appeal demonstrates, the respondent's time whilst he was on bail awaiting the final determination of the offences was a particularly difficult one.  He could not leave Australia, he was obliged to report to police daily, he was obliged to surrender his passport which meant that he had no form of identification which would have enabled him to obtain work, and as well, such visa as he has been allocated did not permit him to work.
123He was unemployed, not in receipt of any income, other than by way of government assistance, and seemingly spent most of his days in his bedroom in shared accommodation.  As Mr Diment's report indicated during this period, he became quite depressed.
124Whilst it would not be fair to equate his time on bail as being the same as the time spent by a person who attends a residential rehabilitation course, and it is not strictly a circumstance of quasi-custody, nevertheless the delay between his being arrested and having his charges finally disposed of, involved a very lengthy period of almost 2½ years, in which he was not able to go about his business, and which represents an important consideration for this Court when considering the exercise of its discretion.  
125The respondent has now served over one half of the non-parole period which he is required to serve and has done so in circumstances of hardship as I have earlier described.  As well, taking into account his period on bail before commencing custodial sentence, to now increase his sentence would significantly increase the hardship which he presently undergoes, and would be likely to exacerbate his OCD.
126In all of the circumstances, in the exercise of the Court's residual discretion, I would not be disposed to uphold the Crown appeal.
Orders
127I would propose the following order:
(1)Crown appeal dismissed.

		29 October 2014",2014-10-28 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704315,Wayne v The Owners Corporation SP64622 [2014] NSWDC 217,"Judgment

1The plaintiff, a litigant in person, commenced proceedings by statement of claim filed on 24 February 2014 for damages for defamation. The statement of claim failed to identify the matter complained of, pleaded only one set of imputations alleged to arise from a series of publications, and failed to comply in a number of respects with r 14.30 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR""). As a result, the defendants brought an application to strike out the statement of claim. 

2The relevant publications were asserted to have been made between 29 April and about September 2013 but, in subsequent pleadings brought in response to the application for summary dismissal, the plaintiff now restricts his claim to statements made at one meeting of the owners' corporation (the first defendant) on 30 April 2013. It is at this meeting, chaired by the second defendant, that the plaintiff now claims that the matter complained of, consisting of statements made by the second, fourth and fifth defendants in the course of the meeting, was published.

3The defendants seek summary dismissal of these proceedings on the following bases:

(a)The statement of claim filed on 24 February 2014 fails to identify any publication made by any defendant and, as the limitation period has now expired, should be struck out pursuant to s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW) (Rossen v Airey [2012] WASCA 26 at [27]-[35]; Linnell v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 20 at [2]-[24]);

(b)The hopelessness of the pleadings is such that no cause of action can be salvaged and that the proceedings should be struck out on principles of proportionality (Bleyer v Google Inc (2014) 311 ALR 529), an application that was not proceeded with; and

(c)An application to strike out the imputations, particulars of aggravated damages and paragraph 8 of the statement of claim on the basis that it is surplusage. 

4When these proceedings first came before Bozic DCJ on 2 May 2014, his Honour pointed to difficulties in the manner in which the claim was drafted. The plaintiff agreed not to press the existing statement of claim but to file an amended version (first, second and sixth defendants' submissions, paragraph 5), and orders to this effect were made. Similarly, when the proceedings came before me for argument on 29 August 2014, I pointed out deficiencies in the plaintiff's pleading and adjourned the application so that the plaintiff could obtain legal advice. On 10 October 2014 I adjourned the matter a second time, on the plaintiff's application to enable him to obtain legal advice. 

5The plaintiff has not sought legal advice. In his written submissions (paragraph 18), he refers to Mbuzi v Hall [2010] QSC 359 at [27]:

""A court is entitled to extend some latitude to a self-represented litigant who is not familiar with forms and procedure, provided in doing so injustice and prejudice is not occasioned to other parties""

6Mr Wayne did not complete this sentence in his written submissions, which goes on to read:

""... and also provided the court is able to achieve a just and expeditious resolution of the real issues of the proceeding at a minimum of expense. A self-represented litigant should not be permitted to disregard rules and to conduct litigation in a manner which is unjust to other parties and contrary to the interests of justice.""

7The plaintiff interprets this sentence as meaning that the court is obliged to assist him with his pleadings. That is not the case. The degree of latitude afforded to a self-represented litigant has been well exceeded here. Both Bozic DCJ and myself have adjourned these proceedings a total of three times to enable the plaintiff to redraft his pleadings and to obtain legal advice, without little apparent result. The consequences for the plaintiff not only include the striking out his defective pleadings, but also an appropriate order for costs, to take into account the prejudice occasioned to the other parties, who have been brought to this court on four occasions unnecessarily by the inability of the plaintiff to plead the cause of action.

8I shall first deal with the limitation argument.

The limitation argument

9The statement of claim filed on 24 February 2014 does not need to be set out in full, as only part of that claim is now pressed. That part is paragraph 9 which reads as follows:

""9. On or about 30 April 2013, the Second Defendant chaired an Executive Committee meeting of the First Defendant. The meeting was also attended by other Executive Committee members, including Ms Anna Shepherd, Ms Deborah Moore and Mr Gavin Napier. The fabricated allegations of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Defendants were presented to the meeting as irrefutable evidence and the matter was now subject to a NSW Police investigation.""

10It is clear from this publication that the role of the first and second defendants was to hold an Executive Committee meeting. In the course of that meeting, according to the publication ""the fabricated allegations"" of Mr Stanger, Mr Metcalf and Mr Singh were presented to the meeting. There is no allegation of publication of those allegations by the first and second defendants.

11The amended statement of claim filed following the adjournment of the proceedings by Bozic DCJ pleaded in paragraph 9:

""9. On or about 30 April 2013, the Second Defendant chaired an Executive Committee meeting of the First Defendant. The meeting was also attended by other Executive Committee members, including Ms Anna Shepherd, Ms Deborah Moore and Mr Gavin Napier. Also attending the meeting was the Fourth and Fifth Defendants representing the Third Defendant. The fabricated allegations of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Defendants were presented to the meeting as irrefutable evidence and the matter was now subject to a NSW Police investigation. At the conclusion of the meeting, all participants of that meeting communicated the matter complained of

9.1 Attached hereto and marked 'A' is an affidavit sworn by Mr Yahya Hamawi on 11 June 2014. Reference to point 9 details what Anna Shepherd, an Executive Committee member attending the meeting on 30 April 2014 [sic], repeats the matter complained of to him, ""Phillip Metcalf told the meeting that David Wayne threatened to murder him""

9.2 On Friday 31 May 2013, at about 6:30pm Carole Rae Ferrier, registered proprietor of Apartment 1804 of the Owners Corporation SP64622, the First Defendant verbally communicated at Café Hernandez, 60 Kings Cross Road, Potts Point in front of the Plaintiff and other patrons ""Yahya has been stealing and you threatened to kill Phil Metcalf... the police are involved... I was away... but the Executive Committee and other residents have told me... so it must be true""""

12If that was meant to amount to a publication by ""all participants of that meeting"", it is not only outside the limitation period but fails to identify the first defendant, which is a body corporate, or to suggest that any persons publishing these slander did so at the instigation of, or under instructions from, another, or pursuant to another person's authority, or by virtue of an agency relationship, or a common agreement: Brown on Defamation (2nd ed., Carswell) at [18.4(1)(a)].

13In the amended statement of claim filed following my orders on 29 August 2014, the plaintiff identified the matter complained of as follows:

""8. Particulars of Communication 1 - At 7pm on 30 April 2013 a meeting was held at 3 Kings Cross Road, Rushcutters Bay in the state of New South Wales.

14Pursuant to my orders on 10 October 2014 the plaintiff filed another amended statement of claim on 29 October 2014 in which he identified the matter complained of as follows:

""9. On or about 30 April 2013, Ralf Harding, the Second Defendant, and as representative of The Owners Corporation SP64622 chaired an Executive Committee meeting of The Owners Corporation SP64622 the First Defendant.

9.2 David Stanger (Fourth Defendant), as representative of Francis Building Management Services Pty Ltd (Third Defendant) said the following to all the meeting attendees: ""Yes everything that Phil said is true. We have a long list on David Wayne. David Wayne threatened to murder us. The Police heard the murder threats. Phil, Shaun and I are prepared to sign statements that David Wayne threatened to murder us.

9.3 Ralf Harding (Second Defendant) and representing The Owners Corporation SP64622, said the following: ""Well there is all the evidence we need. David Wayne threatened to murder David and Phil. It is now in the hands of the police.""""

15This is the first time that any words have been attributed to the second defendant, who is referred to here as ""representing The Owners Corporation SP64622"".

16The potential for difficulties in relation to the limitation period has been made clear to the plaintiff from the commencement of this application before Bozic DCJ on 29 May 2014. No application for extension of time has been brought; I note the impact of such a failure is explained in Linnell v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd at [10]. I have accordingly dealt with the limitation argument on the same basis as in Linnell.

Limitation issues where the words of the slander are unknown 

17Where the matter complained of is a slander, the precise words of which is unknown to the plaintiff, the plaintiff may provide the best particulars he or she can and rely upon those pleadings in that form until such time as interrogatories concerning what was said can be administered: Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd [1982] 1 NSWLR 294. A party may seek discovery and/or interrogatories concerning the content of the matter complained of at any time: Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 11; r 21.2(1)(a) UCPR. In noting this entitlement in Ahmed, Nicholas J traced the long-standing recognition of the court's power to permit discovery and interrogatories has been explained in a series of cases dating from Cummings v 2KY Broadcasters Pty Ltd (1981) 1 NSWLR 246 to Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club [2013] NSWSC 1101. Consequently, failure to provide the text of the matter complained of, or even to identify precisely what was said and by whom may, in the unusual circumstances of a slander, amount to sufficient evidence of publication in this narrow exception to the general rule that the entirety of the matter complained of must be the subject of proceedings commenced within the limitation period.

18However, what the defendants submit is that the statements set out in paragraph 9 failed to establish any publication whatsoever. This is the first argument that must be dealt with.

19First, the defendants submit that there is no evidence that any of the defendants (or persons on their behalf) spoke at the meeting, or that the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants were even present. However, the test for publication is neither speaking the words, nor even presence on the relevant occasion. The broad test is as set out in Webb v Bloch (1928) 41 CLR 331 per Isaac J:

""In R v Paine it is held: ""If one repeat and another write a libel, and a third approve what is wrote, they are all makers of it; for all persons who concur, and show their assent or approbation to do an unlawful act, are guilty: so that murdering a man's reputation by a scandalous libel may be compared to murdering his person; for if several are assisting and encouraging a man in the act, though the stroke was given by one, yet all are guilty of homicide.""""

20It was not necessary for the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants to be present at the meeting if their allegations were presented to the meeting on 30 April 2013 in circumstances where the claim may be, if properly pleaded and particularised, that they were presented by some person or persons authorised on their behalf, or otherwise in circumstances fitting within the very broad definition of ""publisher"" as explained in Webb v Bloch.

21Subsequent forms of the statement of claim make it clear that the allegation against the fourth and fifth defendants was that they were in fact present and did in fact say those words. However, it is not until the most recent draft of the statement of claim that it is asserted that the second defendant, who was previously described as having chaired the meeting only, both made a statement and did so representing the first defendant (see paragraph 9.3 of the current statement of claim).

22Mr Richardson and Mr Robertson submit, and I accept, that the very limited circumstances in which a cause of action arises out of the same or substantially the same facts as the existing cause of action so as to enable a claim to be brought pursuant to s 65(2)(c) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) do not extend to pleading an entirely new publication in this fashion. Mr Richardson referred me to Linnell v Channel Seven Sydney Pty Ltd at [22]-[25]:

""[22] The real difficulty for the existing pleading is that the amendment granting it was not supportable under s 65(2)(c) of the Civil Procedure Act such that the amendment does not obtain the benefit of s 65(3) and does not date back to the time when the proceedings were commenced.

[23] The essence of a claim in defamation is, of course, the making of the relevant (defamatory) publication. For the purposes of s 65(2)(c) the facts that give rise to the existing cause of action are in this case the fact of the publication in the form of the broadcast of the programme on 30 November 2011. The new cause of action, being an interview with each of the third to sixth defendants, involves a different publication to a different person.

[24] Questions as to whether the new cause of action arises from the same or substantially the same facts as those giving rise to the existing cause of action are always matters of fact and degree. However, at least in the context of defamation, the authorities indicate that the fact of a different publication to a different person tells, apparently decisively, against any favourable conclusion for the plaintiff (see Rossen v Airey [2012] WASCA 26 at [31]ff).

[25] In this case at the time of the filing of the Amended Statement of Claim the proposed amendments did not have the benefit of s 65(3) of the Civil Procedure Act so that those amendments could not be said to have taken effect from the date on which the proceedings were commenced, namely 30 November 2012. It follows therefore those amendments were out of time, even if it can not be demonstrated as a matter of fact that the interviews were conducted before 30 November 2011. Accordingly, I will order that those parts of the Amended Statement of Claim be struck out as well.""

23The same is the case here. No case was ever pleaded by way of publication against the first and second defendants, prior to the expiry of the limitation period. All that was stated in the original pleading was that the second defendant chaired a meeting of the first defendant at which these allegations were made. No connecting factor between those events is pleaded. Accordingly, claims against the first and second defendants have not been pleaded until after the expiry of the limitation period and must be struck out as time-barred.

24The claims against the fourth, fifth and sixth defendants (and the third defendant in its capacity as their employer) fall into a different category. There is sufficient material (although very barely) in the pleadings of particulars in the original statement of claim to identify that they were carrying out duties as security staff. This is sufficient for the claim to survive summary dismissal, although whether it is sufficient to establish publication at the hearing will be another issue.

25The claim against the third to sixth defendants will therefore survive the summary dismissal application. However there are other difficulties in relation to certain of the imputations pleaded, and to the claim for aggravated compensatory damages, to which I now turn.

Application to strike out imputations and particulars

26The statement of claim in its current form contains irrelevant material (I note the plaintiff has agreed to strike out paragraph 8), and the imputations are infelicitously drafted. I shall first deal with each of the imputations which are challenged.

Imputation (e): ""A murder threat is an act of violence.""

27It is self-evident from the structure of this imputation that this is neither an act nor a condition (Singleton v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 20 February 1980)). This ""imputation"" must be struck out.

Imputation (f): ""The Plaintiff uses threats of violence to intimidate other people.""

28The matter complained of gives a statement that the plaintiff said he was going to ""murder us all"". However, there was no suggestion that these threats were made for the purposes of intimidation. To the contrary, they were statements of what he intended to do. Accordingly, this imputation is not conveyed.

Imputations (g) and (h): ""The Plaintiff is being investigated by Police for making murder threats"" and ""The Police are going to charge The Plaintiff with making murder threats""

29Mr Richardson also objected to the form of imputations (g) and (h).

30While these imputations are poorly drafted, I am conscious of the assistance McCallum J afforded to the self-represented plaintiff in Bodenstein v Hope Street Urban Compassion (Supreme Court of New South Wales, McCallum J, 2 December 2013), where her Honour excused him from pleading any imputations at all. Accordingly, I am of the view that the terms of these imputations, each of which is conceded to arise, are sufficiently precise to survive an objection as to form. These imputations are capable of being conveyed.

Aggravated damages

31I have struck out the particulars of aggravated damages set out in paragraphs 14(ii), 14(iii) and 14(iv) by reason of their failure to comply with the requirements explained by Levine J in Harrigan v Jones [2000] NSWSC 814.

Costs

32The first and second defendants are entitled to the costs of these proceedings, and in view of their success, the third to sixth defendants are entitled to the costs of this argument. The first question is whether those costs should be borne on the ordinary basis or on an indemnity basis. 

33Section 98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides that costs are in the discretion of the court and may be awarded on an indemnity basis. Rule 42.2 provides that the costs will be payable upon the ordinary basis unless the court otherwise orders. In seeking costs on an indemnity basis, the defendants are asking the court to depart from its usual course: Glaser v Poole (No 2) [2010] NSWLEC 232 at [28]. 

34The court may also exercise its discretion to make such an order assessable forthwith where the subject matter of the application completes the case between the parties on a discrete issue, particularly in defamation: Oliver v Bryant Strata Management Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Levine J, 16 May 1995); Johnson v Department of Community Services (No 2) [1999] NSWSC 1251 at [17]-[19]. Other relevant circumstances include unreasonable conduct of the litigation: Fiduciary Ltd v Morningstar Research (2002) 55 NSWLR 1 at 4 - 5.

35A litigant in person is not immune from an order for indemnity costs: Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCAFC 51, or from such an order being assessable forthwith.

36UCPR r 42.5 provides:

""42.5 Indemnity costs

If the court determines that costs are to be paid on an indemnity basis:

(a) in the case of costs payable out of property held or controlled by a person who is a party to the proceedings:

(i) in the capacity of trustee, executor, administrator or legal representative of a deceased estate, or

(ii) in any other fiduciary capacity,

all costs (other than those that have been incurred in breach of the person's duty in that capacity) are to be allowed, and

(b) in any other case, all costs (other than those that appear to have been unreasonably incurred or appear to be of an unreasonable amount) are to be allowed.""

37Where there is unreasonable action by a person whom a costs order is made, such as by multiple hopeless pleadings, abandoned claims, indulged in unreasonable delay or caused multiple adjournments, orders for indemnity costs may be appropriate: Oshlack v Richmond River Council (1998) 193 CLR 72; Harrison v Schipp [2001] NSWCA 13. This may include an unreasonable approach to pleading: Bevillesta Pty Ltd v D Tannous (No 2) Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 277.

38The statement of claim as originally pleaded set out an unidentifiable but large number of pleadings for the period 29 April to September 2013. All of those claims have now been abandoned except for the publication of statements to a meeting of the body corporate at which I am informed five persons were present. Additionally, particulars of the claim against the first and second defendants were only made in the most recent statement of claim, which is well outside the expiry of the limitation period.

39The plaintiff has been given repeated opportunities both by myself and Bozic DCJ to have his pleadings corrected and to obtain legal advice. His submissions have been of no assistance to the court in that they consist largely of statements that he has a good cause of action, and that the defendants are conducting themselves in a dishonest and reprehensible fashion.

The first and second defendants

40No claim was formulated against the first and second defendants until the most recent pleading. The assertion that the second defendant spoke the words attributed to him in that pleading should have been set out in the original statement of claim; no explanation for the failure to do so has been provided. The proceedings against them are time-barred.

41The solicitors for the first and second defendants promptly drew this failure to the plaintiff's attention in their letter of 14 March 2014 (see the affidavit of Mr Creighton sworn 20 May 2014). This letter, and the other correspondence from the first and second defendants' solicitors, contained warnings about costs. 

42There was ample time for the plaintiff to amend his pleading prior to the expiry of the limitation period or, if he could not do so, to discontinue the claims against those defendants. The plaintiff's failure to do so is unexplained and these costs should be assessed on an indemnity basis.

The third to sixth defendants

43Mr Richardson submits that the plaintiff has been on clear notice from the first about the defects in his pleadings. If he was in doubt as to what was said, he could have brought a Dank application (Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2014] NSWCA 288); Mr Richardson also pointed out that the plaintiff's failure to follow up such an application in Dank led to the relevant portion of the proceedings being struck out. Conformably with the view taken in those proceedings of the need for the plaintiff to articulate the contents of the matter complained of at the first opportunity, the plaintiff in these proceedings should have been aware of the seriousness of failing to identify with precision the form and content of the publications as soon as he could. This is particularly the case with slander actions, where the nature of the matter complained of is so evanescent that prompt action is necessary.

44The successive versions of the statement of claim have required far more extensive surgery than is generally the case in defamation proceedings, where interlocutory applications generally relate to imputations or particulars arguments. In the present case, the plaintiff has produced four statements of claim in the course of an argument stood over on four occasions between May and October. In those circumstances, an order for indemnity costs is appropriate.

45I am satisfied that the dispute over the plaintiff's pleading is severable, the conduct of the plaintiff has been unreasonable and that the costs have been unreasonably enlarged by the plaintiff's repeated failures to plead the claim properly. In those circumstances, the indemnity costs order should be assessable forthwith.

(2)Note imputations (a), (b) and (c) are withdrawn.

(3)Imputation (e) is struck out.

		11 December 2014",2014-10-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704329,WorkCover Authority of NSW v OCS Fun Pty Ptd [2014] NSWDC 375,"SENTENCE


	
	The defendant pleads guilty to the charge that on 3 November 2012 at Campbelltown in the State of New South Wales, it being a business with a health and safety duty under s 92 of the Work Health and Safety Act 2011 failed so far as was reasonably practicable, to protect a child, Annalise Mitchell, from the risk of death or serious injury.
	
	
	The injury occurred when Ms Mitchell fell between two carriages on an amusement device known as the Love Express. This was known as a caterpillar ride, in which 20 connected carriages rise and fall a distance of between 25 cm and 3 metres on an undulating track. That risk could have been avoided had the void through which she fell been covered with a plate or netting.
	
	
	There is no clear explanation as to how it is that Ms Mitchell fell. It may be that she misjudged the step from the walkway onto the carriage, or it may be that, as reported by some observers, she attempted to move from one carriage to another to join her friend. In any event, even if the circumstance was the latter, it is foreseeable that children of tender years do not always behave responsibly.
	
	
	The defendant by its plea of guilty accepts that either circumstance should have been foreseen and measures taken to avert the risk. Nevertheless, the culpability insofar as the defendant departed from the standards of reasonable men is I think modest.
	
	
	The defendant company has traded since 1991 and has no prior convictions. The sole director, Mr Gary Wayne O’Neil, has been involved in operating amusement rides for 40 years. He has been personally involved in that industry all of his life, having been compelled to leave university and take over the family business when his father died.
	
	
	Mr O’Neil has always been keenly interested in safety. Shortly after taking over the business he travelled to America and Europe to learn of the safety and hazard procedures that were being used in those parts of the world. He travelled to fairs and amusement parks, reviewing safety measures and obtaining documents relevant to safe operating procedures and staff training.
	
	
	He is a member of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Rides and sits on a panel for the Global Harmonisation of Safety Standards within the industry world-wide. He is a member of the committee responsible for the formulation of Australian Standard AS 3533, which is applicable to amusement rides. The committee advises industry and helps to alter that standard.
	
	
	Mr O’Neil regularly consults with local and international amusement ride operators in relation to safety hazards. He travels regularly to conduct research and inspections, learning from safety incidents and accidents which have occurred in the industry. In 2008 he travelled to Sweden to inspect a particular machine known as a rainbow machine to enquire directly of the manufacturer as to the safety ramifications following a failure on such a machine. He also travelled to America to investigate a further incident concerning that machine.
	
	
	The particular machine involved in this offence, the Love Express Ride, was purchased by the company in 1995. The purchase included the set up and operational manual and the company used that manual in order to set up and operate the machine.
	
	
	The defendant in general implements a suite of safety and hazard identification and reduction measures in relation to all amusement rides which it operates.
	
	
	An Operations Manager is employed by the defendant to check each ride each day for the safety of its operation. The defendant has a Plant Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment checklist. As part of its Safety and Risk Identification procedures the defendant arranged for the machine to be inspected independently by Mr Malcolm Patrick prior to operation at the Fisher’s Ghost Festival where this accident occurred.
	
	
	Mr Patrick certified that all the rides to be operated at the festival were inspected, assembled and operated in compliance with the relevant Australian Standard.
	
	
	Before the incident Mr O’Neil was not aware of any accident throughout the world involving a fall through the void between the carriages of the Love Express. The machine is manufactured in Italy and is still manufactured with that void in place. Only in one place has netting been installed, and that was in Hong Kong. Mr O’Neil was not aware of this adaption in Hong Kong before the accident.
	
	
	In the circumstances this incident is not the result of a want of industry and attention to matters of safety. It is a one-off event which occurred at the limits of imagination marking the boundaries of foreseeability.
	
	
	The defendant had devised, instituted and maintained sound procedures to avoid accidents. Its subsequent conduct in, firstly, devising and installing plates to fill the void and then in removing the machine from operation altogether, indicate a responsible attitude.
	
	
	Mr O’Neil has expressed contrition and remorse in relation to the injuries suffered by Ms Mitchell. Fortuitously those injuries were not very serious. Ms Mitchell suffered a mandibular fracture to her jaw and a three centimetre laceration to that damage. She suffered tooth damage, including loss of one deciduous tooth.
	
	
	I have the victim impact statement from Ms Mitchell and I am conscious of the harm done to her and the psychological sequelae. She does not play many sports now because she finds them scary, and she sees a counsellor.
	
	
	Although the gravity of the offence did include a risk of death or very serious injury, the incident happened when the machine was stationary. The degree to which the defendant departed from the standard of a reasonable man is slight given the circumstance that the accident arises from a want of imagination rather than a want of care.
	
	
	I recognise that there is a need for general deterrence to be reflected in the penalty. I do not see that there is a need for specific deterrence given the record of this company and its response to the accident. The Fines Act directs the Court to a consideration of the capacity of the defendant to pay. I think in the present case an appropriate penalty is $80,000 before the reduction in consideration of the early plea of guilty, remorse and cooperation with the authorities.
	
	
	The defendant is convicted and fined $60,000.
	
	
	In addition to that sum the defendant is to pay the prosecutor’s costs agreed in the sum of $12,500.
	
	
	The total burden upon the defendant is then, in addition to its own costs, $72,500. This is 40% of the pre-tax operating profit of the company in the year ended June 2014. In that sense it consists of a pretty heavy penalty.
	
	
	While this penalty is relatively high compared to similar cases to which I have been referred it is significant that the legislature has seen fit to increase the maximum penalty to $1.5 million.
	
	
	The defendant is to pay the prosecutor a moiety of the fine.

2704332,R v Emerson [2014] NSWDC 326,"Judgment


	
	When Darren Emerson received some news about his daughter being assaulted, he was shocked and angry. But he was also fuelled by alcohol. He set out to find the culprit. His judgment was impulsive and obviously affected by the alcohol. But that judgment also extended to who the culprit was who perpetrated the crime on his daughter. Mr Emerson took it upon himself to select the culprit and administer the punishment by invading the home of a woman. He had a knife. The police and the legal system go to a lot of trouble to determine who the perpetrators of crimes are. Not so Mr Emerson. He took it upon himself to select the culprit and administer a very serious shock to her.
	
	
	I am sentencing Mr Emerson for the crime known as aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. It is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament regards the crime very seriously. One can tell that by the fact that Parliament has not only fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime, but has also fixed a standard non‑parole period of five years to the crime.
	
	
	Mr Emerson has asked me to take into account, when I am sentencing him for this crime, three other offences which were committed at the same time. They are break and enter and steal, another break and enter and commit serious indictable offence and destroying and damaging property. I will take those three offences into account when I am sentencing him for the one crime that he has pleaded guilty to and I have signed a certificate to that effect.
	
	
	First I should say something about what happened. This is important because a judge needs to keep firmly in mind the facts of a crime as well as the personal circumstances of the offender.
	
	
	It was a Saturday night 30 November 2013. Mr Emerson was enjoying his evening at home over a couple of beers. Of course there is no harm in that at all. However, at about half past 7 he got news that his daughter had been subjected to an assault. He and his partner went to see her. They saw that indeed she had some very nasty injuries. I have some photographs of the injuries which included bite marks. They drove her to the accident and emergency department at Albury Hospital where she was treated.
	
	
	Mr Emerson and his partner went back home. He had a few more beers and then at about 10 o’clock he received information, the agreed facts say “from his daughter’s boyfriend in relation to the identity” of whoever it was who assaulted his daughter.
	
	
	Mr Emerson drove to a friend’s house in Lavington where he had a few more beers. Then he drove to an address which he had been told the culprit lived at. It was in Lavington. He parked nearby and knocked on the door but no-one answered. So he went back to his friend’s place and drank more. By this time it was the early hours of the Sunday morning, 1 December 2013.
	
	
	He went back to the address in Lavington where he thought the offender lived and knocked on the door again. This time he walked down the side and got into the back door by climbing over a wall. He broke through a window beside the back door and opened it up and went in. He walked through the house looking for the people he thought were the offenders. He did not find anyone so, as the facts say, he “decided to smash it up, turn a number of items inside the unit including a kitchen table, refrigerator, glass cabinet, dining room table and chairs and a ceramic pot”. That is the malicious damage that I am taking into account.
	
	
	There was a flat screen television. He unplugged it and carried it away, back to his friend’s house. That is the break, enter and steal offence that I am taking into account when I am sentencing him.
	
	
	Not satisfied, Mr Emerson went back a third time at about 2 in the morning. A woman had returned to the unit in the meantime. She had found the state of the unit and phoned the police. So when Mr Emerson knocked on the door, she thought that the police had arrived. Instead, when she opened the door only slightly, Mr Emerson was there and he “forced the wooden door open the rest of the way and entered the house”. He was carrying a knife in his hands. He “threatened the victim, demanding to know who resided at the unit”. That threat with the knife amounted to the aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence that I am taking into account when I am sentencing him.
	
	
	Mr Emerson asked the woman “if the people he was told had assaulted his daughter lived at the unit” and whether they were there. The woman told him that they were not at home. He walked outside and she closed the front door and called the police again.
	
	
	Still not satisfied, Mr Emerson went back a fourth time. The woman saw him standing in the kitchen. He was still holding the knife. She was on the phone to the police. He walked through the kitchen “and into the dining room towards the victim, holding the knife in his hand”. Understandably, the woman was very concerned for her safety and she grabbed a tyre lever, all the time staying on the phone to the police. The facts record that Mr Emerson “walked towards the victim and then turned away from the victim and walked down the hallway towards the front door”. This time he left for good.
	
	
	The police were obviously alert to what was going on and they intercepted Mr Emerson. They found a knife and a TV in his car. They also breath tested him and his reading was 0.16 which is in the high range of prescribed concentration of alcohol.
	
	
	Mr Emerson was arrested and interviewed and admitted what he had done. He agreed that he had gone to the place to confront the woman about identifying the people that assaulted his daughter. He agreed that he had gone there to assault whoever it was but “agreed that he did not know the identity of the persons who assaulted his daughter and that he did not know the victim”. He agreed that she did not match the description of those who he had been told assaulted his daughter.
	
	
	Anyone can see from that account of what happened how serious the crime is and why Parliament regards a crime such as this so seriously.
	
	
	Mr Emerson has been in custody since his arrest on 1 December 2013 and his sentence will date from then. I formally convict him of the offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence.
	
	
	Part of the material which a judge has to take into account in sentencing an offender is whether the offender has a criminal record. A person may come before the Court with a clean record. On the other hand, a person may come before the Court with a record of prior offences. Mr Emerson’s record is long and various. He has spent a good amount of time in gaol. As long ago as 1988 he was sent to gaol for break, enter and steal and malicious damage to property. The same happened in 1993 including a breach of a community service order. Yet again he was sent to gaol in 1997 and again in 1999, and most recently in 2007. He is a person who, by his criminal activity, has inflicted a good deal of harm on the community.
	
	
	It is also important for a judge to take into account factors which are personal to the offender when sentencing the offender. Mr Emerson is well supported in his family environment. He is in a relationship with a woman, Tanya Faulkner, who has provided a helpful affidavit which became exhibit 1. She is the mother of eight children. Two of them are Mr Emerson’s children. All of them regard him as their father.
	
	
	When he was last released from custody in 2007, Ms Faulkner said that “he got a job almost immediately”. Things were going well, he was happy, not drinking much, and the relationship within the family grew “and we became very close”. He was a very good partner and father. Ms Faulkner has been visiting him regularly in custody. He became redundant in a job in the past and re-educated himself, obtaining a certificate in cleaning operations. He is very houseproud.
	
	
	The daughter who was injured was Ms Faulkner’s daughter but Mr Emerson “has been very close” to her for many years and she regards Mr Emerson as if he were her own father. She said how upset Mr Emerson became when he learned about the assault on his daughter. When they saw her they could see that her arms were swollen and she “had a number of bite marks on her arms that looked like dog bites and had broken her skin”. There were welt marks. There is a police statement tendered by Ms C Mendes, who appeared for Mr Emerson, confirming the injuries.
	
	
	After Mr Emerson disappeared, Ms Faulkner tried to track him down but the next she heard of him was a distressed and remorseful call from the Albury Police Station.
	
	
	Ms Faulkner related some problems that Mr Emerson had had in his upbringing with an alcoholic father and violence. He was the oldest child and he, said Ms Faulkner, “took on the role of protecting his mother and siblings”. That has to be seen in the context, of course, that he is now 45 and no doubt other judges and magistrates have in the past taken that into account. Ms Faulkner was hoping for “a lengthy parole period when he is released from custody” this time. She said that “he really struggles when things go wrong for him and the community. He just isn’t resilient.” They attend a church whose members are very supportive. Indeed, there is a reference from a Ms Schubert dated 3 October 2014 confirming that.
	
	
	Mr Emerson himself gave evidence before me on Tuesday. He apologised for the way that he had behaved and acknowledged that he should not have done what he did. He confirmed the loving and supporting family that he has with his partner and the children. In custody Mr Emerson holds down a trusted position and also provides a peer support role for younger inmates. He is prepared to undergo counselling. He no longer uses prohibited drugs. In 2007, the offence he committed involved violence against his brother. He said that he “wants to fit in with the community” again when he is released.
	
	
	Ms Mendes provided some very helpful written submissions which became MFI 1 and Mr A Thomas, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, addressed me verbally about the factors to take into account.
	
	
	I agree with Ms Mendes that the action was impulsive and that Mr Emerson’s judgment was affected by alcohol. To that extent it was unplanned. It was also an action or behaviour which was affected by strong emotions generated by seeing the injuries on his daughter. The behaviour did occur over a relatively short period of time and in that sense it was a continuing course of conduct. But still, one has to appreciate that he entered the house three times, and on a fourth occasion, which was the first in order of time, approached the house and knocked on the door.
	
	
	Ms Mendes asked me to find that Mr Emerson “did not confront” the victim of his offence. I disagree with that. I think he did confront her. He walked towards her with a knife. I think it is fair to say that he did not threaten her with the knife, although she was obviously intimidated which is part of the offence which I take into account already. So I am not satisfied that he threatened the victim but he certainly did confront her. It must have been a terrifying experience for the victim of his offence.
	
	
	Mr Emerson has shown some remorse. I cannot describe his prospects of rehabilitation as good because of his record and this crime which he has committed. But I think that his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable given the strong support he has at home and within the community including his church. Also, as Ms Mendes pointed out, he does not have a drug addiction. He obviously has a problem with alcohol and the criminal justice system, having committed this crime under the influence of alcohol, including driving. Mr Emerson accepts responsibility for his criminal conduct and his rehabilitation prospects are illustrated by the trusted position he holds in custody.
	
	
	Ms Mendes submitted that this particular offence “could be appropriately categorised as being of low objective seriousness”. Mr Thomas, on the other hand, submitted that it was not at the bottom of the range. I think he is right. I do not regard it as low. I think Mr Thomas in correct in arguing that it is just under the middle of the range of objective seriousness when compared to other examples of this kind of crime.
	
	
	I also accept Mr Thomas’ submission that specific deterrence is very important in this case. Mr Emerson has inflicted himself on the community by breaking and entering in the past. This cannot be tolerated. The sentence I impose has to take into account that he needs to be stopped from doing those sorts of things. As Mr Thomas also submitted, general deterrence is important in this case. It is very important for members of the community to know that they cannot simply go about committing very serious crimes because they feel, rightly or wrongly, that they have been aggrieved or that a crime has been committed against them or against one of their loved ones.
	
	
	Ms Mendes submitted that there were special circumstances for adjusting the normal non-parole period. Normally a non-parole period is 75% of the head sentence. It can be adjusted down in special circumstances. Ms Mendes points to Ms Faulkner’s affidavit and to the support which her client needs in the community. I agree with that and in due course I am going to reduce the non-parole period from the normal 75%. I have also been provided with some statistics from the Judicial Commission.
	
	
	There are four particular factors which count against Mr Emerson in this sentencing exercise. One is the significance of deterrence, both deterring him and other members of the community. The second is that in sentencing him for the one crime, I have to take into account three other crimes. The Court of Criminal Appeal has made it clear that that must be reflected in an increase in the sentence. The third is that he has a criminal record which includes similar offences. That places additional weight on the aspect of specific deterrence and also on the need to protect the community by the sentence which I impose. Finally, the offence was committed in the home of the victim. Parliament regards somebody’s home as so important that it has specified that it is an aggravating factor for a crime to be committed in their home. The victim of this crime was entitled, particularly in the early hours of the morning, to feel safe in her house. Instead she was confronted by a drunken man who had broken into her house and was holding a knife.
	
	
	Bearing all those factors in mind, I would regard an appropriate starting place for an overall sentence as being six and a half years imprisonment. However, Mr Emerson has pleaded guilty to the offence. He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. That means the law allows him a 25% discount on that sentence. I am going to reduce the sentence by that amount and a little more to round it off to four and a half years.
	
	
	For a sentence of four and a half years, the normal non-parole period would be about three years and four months. That is about 75%. But because of the special circumstances referred to by Ms Mendes, I am going to reduce the non-parole period to two and a half years. That represents about 55% of the overall sentence. So the sentence will be one of four and a half years with a non-parole period of two and a half years.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Mr Emerson, I am going to sentence you now. If you would stand up please?


	
	I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to commence on 1 December 2013 and that expires on 31 May 2016. The balance of the term is two years. That commences on 1 June 2016 and concludes on 31 May 2018.
	


HIS HONOUR: So your overall sentence commenced last year when you were arrested, 1 December 2013, and your overall sentence expires four and a half years later on 31 May 2018. The first date on which, on the information I have, you will be eligible for parole is 31 May 2016.

2704336,R v Glare [2014] NSWDC 298,"Judgment


	
	A young man was settling into family life here near Albury with his wife and daughter.  They were planning on having another child.  He had a good job. He described it as the best job he had ever had.  A year later he was emaciated and had been charged with no fewer than seven very serious crimes under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	The precipitous fall in this young man's lifestyle commenced casually.  He casually shared drinks and stories with friends but they introduced him to the drug commonly known as ice.  As the young man said, it grabbed him immediately and he was then chasing it until he was finally detained in custody. 
	
	
	The young man's name is Christopher James Glare.  He is 30.  He is married with now two daughters, aged three and a half and 11 months.  He comes from a strong, supportive family but I have to sentence him for seven serious crimes that he has pleaded guilty to. 
	
	
	It is important to list the crimes and to say briefly what happened for each of them.  I should add that all of the crimes were related to breaking and entering and trying to secure money in order to support the drug habit which had a vice like grip on him.
	
	
	On 12 October 2013 Mr Glare and an accomplice took themselves to the Corowa Golf Club.  Mr Glare kept watch whilst the accomplice broke in.  The accomplice raided some poker machines, causing about $60,000 in damage.  He got about two and a half thousand dollars in cash.  Mr Glare was so reckless by that stage in his drug habit, that he and his accomplice left behind an iron bar which had been used to break in, and the iron bar retained Mr Glare's DNA profile.  I repeat that Mr Glare was the lookout although he is charged with the same offence as the man who broke in.  That is an aggravated break, enter and steal which is an offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act.  Parliament regards that offence as so serious that it has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to it.  It has also fixed a standard non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	Next in time were two break-ins, both at the Tocumwal Golf Club.  They were committed on 18 and 19 October last year.  Again he was with an accomplice.  They climbed onto a roof but the accomplice fell through and they left the scene.  Their expertise in these crimes was such that they returned to the same scene the following morning.  Police were waiting.  They broke in again and the police arrested them.  At that stage Mr Glare admitted his offences.  He was put on bail. 
	
	
	Because those two offences did not involve any actual theft, he was charged with aggravated break and enter with intent to commit a crime.  That and the first offence I spoke about were aggravated because Mr Glare was in company.
	
	
	Returning to the break and enter with intent, Parliament has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to that offence but no standard non-parole period.  One of his accomplices - there were apparently two - received a prison sentence of 18 months with a non-parole period of six months.
	
	
	About six months later, Mr Glare was at it again.  On 6 March 2014, he and another accomplice turned up at the Oaklands RSL Bowling Club.  They used a jemmy bar to prise open the door and get into the kitchen.  They found nothing of value so they decided to leave.  That resulted in another charge of aggravated break and enter with intent, under s 113(2) of the Crimes Act.  Again they decided to return to the same scene a day later on 7 March 2014.  They broke in and walked around again. This time all that they were able to find was a tub of ice cream, to which Mr Glare helped himself.  That gave rise to a charge of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act.  That is one of the crimes to which, as I mentioned, Parliament has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment and five years standard non-parole period.
	
	
	Mr Glare has asked me to take into account, when sentencing him for that crime, four other offences all committed in March 2014.  They are offences of possessing housebreaking implements, receiving stolen property, larceny and entering a building with intent to commit an indictable offence.  I will take those additional offences into account when I am sentencing him for that crime and I sign a certificate to that effect.
	
	
	Over the evening of 9 -10 March 2014, Mr Glare and an accomplice broke into the Redlands Cafe in Redlands Road, Corowa.  They cut security bars off the window and forced the window open.  The owners found that over $800 of goods had been stolen, mostly snack food and confectionary.  This too resulted in a charge of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The final and seventh offence is a further aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence against s 112.  That is a crime that Mr Glare admitted to committing when he was being interviewed about other crimes.  He said that he had broken into the Rennie Football Club with someone else and they stole some equipment and some beer as well as even a heart defibrillator.  That resulted in another charge against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act. 
	
	
	Again Mr Glare asks me to take into account, when I am sentencing him for that offence, a long list of 12 offences which are mostly receiving stolen property and dealing with proceeds of crime.  Those charges arose when police visited his home and found a good deal of property.  I will take into account those offences when I am sentencing him for the aggravated break, enter and steal into the Rennie Football Club and I have signed a certificate to that effect.
	
	
	Mr Glare has a negligible criminal record with only a handful of traffic offences and I regard those as having no impact on the sentence. In fact I sentence him as a person who does not have a criminal record for offences anywhere near as serious as the ones he has now committed. 
	
	
	I repeat, Mr Glare comes from a strong family background and has on-going support.  I heard evidence from his wife, Belinda Glare and his mother, Karen Anne Collins, both of whom were very impressive and made it clear that their husband and son had their full support.  Mr Glare has very good employment qualifications.  He spent a couple of years in the navy and qualified as a mechanic after an honourable discharge and has secured a number of jobs and has been promoted in those jobs.
	
	
	Mr D Barron, who appears for Mr Glare, called his client to give evidence.  Mr Glare made it very obvious that he is very remorseful for the crimes which he committed.  It was also apparent that he had commenced some form of rehabilitation before he was finally arrested on 1 April 2014, the day that his home was searched and the stolen goods were found.  There is a note amongst the papers to the effect that he had spent two days in custody, so the sentence I propose to date from 30 March 2014.
	
	
	Mr Glare pleaded guilty at what Mr A Thomas, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, agreed was the earliest opportunity.  Because that facilitates the course of justice and enables other people's cases to be heard sooner and uses up less in resources, it attracts a discount of 25% on a sentence which would otherwise be imposed.  In addition to this, there is a further discount acknowledged in this case relevant to s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). Mr Barron proposes and again, Mr Thomas agrees, that the overall joint discount should be 40% off the sentence. 
	
	
	There is a pre-sentence report which confirms much of the material which I have referred to.  It confirmed, for example, that, ""his entire history of illicit substance abuse encompassed a period of just under 12 months.""  He acknowledged with incredulity ""the hold methamphetamines had gained over him in such a short period of time and the significant impact of same resulting in the current situation.""  He is regarded as a low to medium risk of re-offending. 
	
	
	Interestingly, he himself acknowledged that when he commenced the habit he found himself in the company of people who, as he said, were thieves, bludgers and criminals.  With a good deal of insight, he said in evidence that he ""became one of those"" because he became like his friends.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Glare had commenced rehabilitation, with the support of his wife, some time before his final arrest and in fact had a clean drug analysis certificate dated 25 March 2014. 
	
	
	He is highly regarded as an employee and as a member of the community by people who have provided references for him.  He wants to take the opportunity to continue some rehabilitation whilst he is in custody, again realistically and insightfully acknowledging that he needs the tools to deal with this strong addiction.  He wants to get back to his family life and employment and would be prepared to undertake a residential rehabilitation program, including counselling, when he finishes in prison.  Again with a good deal of insight, he said that he could acknowledge ""never again"" but he needs the tools and the skills to rehabilitate himself.
	
	
	Mrs Glare, his wife, described the impact of ice on her husband as watching him disappear.  She could not even trust her children with him.  He now looks much healthier when she and her daughters visit him in gaol because he has remained off drugs whilst in custody.  His mother also noticed his downhill spiral and whilst not wanting to interfere, realised that she had to step in when she was at her wits end.  She described how her son probably found it very hard to say no to the seedy characters he was mixing with who also were quite frightening.  She confirmed her son's obvious remorse.
	
	
	In his submissions, Mr Barron floated the idea of a release on parole at this stage or even by Christmas.  I am not going to do that because it would be releasing Mr Glare before he has served enough time in prison to account for the extent of his criminal behaviour within the community.  But in his favour, I take into account his remorse and his lack of a relevant criminal record, his good character and the commencement of his rehabilitation, including being drug free in prison. 
	
	
	Against him is the fact that a number of these offences, those committed after 19 October 2013, were committed whilst he had been afforded liberty within the community by being on bail.  Mr Thomas agreed with Mr Barron's submission that individually each offence was towards the lower end of the scale in seriousness. That must be so because the offences are mostly break, enter and steal which is an example of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence.  There are far more serious indictable offences than stealing that one could commit after breaking and entering.  That is not to condone the offending but to put it in its context.
	
	
	Mr Barron submitted and Mr Thomas accepted that there were special circumstances for adjusting a non-parole period.  Normally the non-parole period for a sentence is 75% of the head sentence.  I accept that submission.  Mr Glare needs additional time to undertake residential rehabilitation and to get himself out of the acknowledged grip of this most dangerous drug.
	
	
	Although Mr Barron suggested that his client was a low risk of re-offending, I prefer the pre-sentence report's assessment of low to medium.  One has to be realistic about the impact that this drug can have on people's behaviour. 
	
	
	Mr Thomas, whilst acknowledging the lower seriousness of individual crimes, made the point, appropriately in my opinion, that I had to take into account the impact of the sheer number of offences which had been committed by Mr Glare.  I have to bear in mind the question of totality.  It is not a matter of simply adding up individual sentences but of assessing sentences which are appropriate for the crimes.
	
	
	I do not propose to make any order for compensation.  I think Mr Barron and Mr Thomas are right; that can be pursued in a civil court because the most serious damage which was inflicted in breaking into the Corowa Golf Club was in fact the result of his accomplice's efforts rather than Mr Glare's. 
	
	
	At my invitation, Mr Barron made some submissions to me about which sentences should be concurrent, that is run together, and which ones might stand alone.  I broadly accept those submissions and I will refer to them in a moment.
	
	
	What I propose to do is to fix one sentence as an aggregate sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. But I also need to indicate what I would regard as the appropriate individual sentences.  I have also borne in mind the statistics provided for me from the Judicial Commission's statistics database.
	
	
	In respect of the first offence committed in the Corowa Golf Club on 12 October 2013 and given that Mr Glare was a lookout and his strong subjective case, I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of three years imprisonment.
	
	
	The two offences committed at the Tocumwal Golf Club, for those two offences I would regard penalties of one and a half years imprisonment for each of them to be appropriate.  I would direct that those two sentences be served at the same time but accumulated by six months on the first, so that there would be total so far of three and a half years.
	
	
	The fourth offence of break and entering with intent at the Oaklands RSL Bowling Club, I would regard as being punishable with two years imprisonment which should be concurrent with the fifth offence committed at the same place. However, the fifth offence is the aggravated break, enter and steal.  The stealing was only ice cream, but I am required to take into account the offences he has asked me to take into account regarding those.  I would regard an appropriate sentence for the fifth offence as being three years imprisonment, to be concurrent with the two years for the offence at the same place, but they should be accumulated by another six months on the previous sentences. So the total so far is four years imprisonment.
	
	
	For the aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence at Redlands Cafe on 9 -10 March this year, an appropriate sentence, in my opinion, is three years imprisonment.  That too should be accumulated by six months. So the total is four and a half years imprisonment.
	
	
	The final offence of breaking, entering and stealing at the Rennie Football Club, for that I need to take into account the numerous matters which he has asked me to take into account.  Bearing that in mind, I would regard an appropriate sentence as being one of a four and a half years imprisonment.  Again, I would accumulate that by six months. 
	
	
	I can indicate, therefore, that the total sentence which would be appropriate would have been five years imprisonment but I need to apply the discount of 40%, which I have already referred to, so that the overall final sentence would be one of three years imprisonment.
	
	
	Normally a sentence of three years imprisonment would be accompanied by a non-parole period of two years and three months, being 75%.  In this case I propose to reduce that significantly to 50% so that the non-parole period will be 18 months imprisonment.
	
	
	The formal orders are these. Under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all of the offences. That aggregate sentence is three years imprisonment commencing 30 March 2014 and expiring on 29 March 2017. The non-parole period is 18 months commencing 30 March 2014 and expiring on 29 September 2015.
	
	
	Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I make an order directing your release on parole at the end of the non-parole period on 29 September 2015.
	


HIS HONOUR: Just have a seat for the moment, Mr Glare, I will explain that all in a moment.  Mr Barron and Mr Thomas, first the sums, please.

THOMAS: Yes, I agree with the dates your Honour indicated.

HIS HONOUR: Good, right.  Are the sums correct?

BARRON: I agree as well.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, now conditions of parole, please?

THOMAS: Certainly rehabilitation has loomed large in the submissions that we have made.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, he should be supervised.

THOMAS: Certainly supervised and obey any direction as to rehabilitation and counselling and the like.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, do you agree?

BARRON: Yes, definitely.


	
	The conditions of parole are these:
	



	
	that he be of good behaviour;
	
	
	that he notify the Registrar of this Court of his address and any change of that address;
	
	
	that he attend court if he receives a notice to do so;
	
	
	that he accept supervision from Community Corrections and follow all reasonable recommendations and directions of officers of that service, particularly regarding referral to a job network, referral to community health, drug and alcohol counselling and any residential rehabilitation.
	


HIS HONOUR: Anything else?  Any other formalities?

THOMAS: Two formalities are the s166 matters.  One is on exhibit B which is the possess housebreaking implements 0166.  I would simply ask your Honour for a s 10A conviction, no other penalty.

HIS HONOUR: Exhibit C?

THOMAS: B.  That one offence wasn't on a form 1, it was a related offence.  Possess housebreaking implements.


	
	In respect of the possess housebreaking implements offence, the subject of a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 contained in exhibit B, under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I convict Mr Glare and I dispose of the proceedings without imposing any other penalty. 
	
	
	Indeed, I should add that I convict Mr Glare of all of the seven offences that I sentenced him for as well.
	


HIS HONOUR: What is the other formality?

THOMAS: The other is on exhibit D, there is a matter on the 166. It is a backup offence, so I would seek that matter just be withdrawn.

HIS HONOUR: You seek leave to withdraw it, is that what we do?

BARRON: No objection.

HIS HONOUR: Okay.


	
	I grant leave to the prosecutor to withdraw the backup offence contained in the certificate pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 s 166 in exhibit D.
	


HIS HONOUR: Is that it?  Are they all the formalities?

THOMAS: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Okay.  Mr Glare, you have got a three year prison sentence.  I backdated it to 30 March this year, so it finishes on 29 March 2017.  Normally, your non-parole period would be two years and three months, but I have reduced it to 18 months because of the support you will need in the community when you get out, so you have got a longer parole period to get on with your rehabilitation.  As I said, it is a vice-like grip, as you well know more than I do.

I have directed your release on parole on 29 September next year and the conditions of your parole are you have got to stay out of trouble.  If you breach parole, then you are back before me or the Parole Authority.  When you get out, you have got to let the Registrar of this Court know where you are living and if you change your address you tell them as well.

If you get a notice to turn up to court, you have got to turn up rather than have the Sheriff and the police chasing after you.  And the most important condition is that you allow the Community Corrections Service to supervise you.  They are the old Probation and Parole.  They know what they are doing and they are used to dealing with people like you.  You are well-motivated and well supported, so I imagine they will be able to offer you a lot of help and they will send you in the direction of job networking, drug and alcohol counselling and particularly perhaps residential rehabilitation.  Or they will support your own efforts in doing all of that as well.  They will help you integrate back into the community and they will do a good job too.  I will give my associate the exhibits.  Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour, I do.

HIS HONOUR: All right.  I am confident that you will get on with your life and that you won't have any trouble from here on.

3The imputations challenged in this publications are imputations 4(a), 4(b) and 4(e).

4The following imputations are pleaded to arise (in paragraph 6 of the statement of claim) from the second matter complained of.

(a)The plaintiff is the world's most deluded woman (paragraphs 1, 7, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 33, 35, 36, 37, 43, 44, 45, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59).

(b)The plaintiff is deluded because she believes convicted killer Simon Gittany is innocent (paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 43, 44, 45, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59).

(c)The plaintiff is a ridiculous person (paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 43, 44, 45, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59).

(d)The plaintiff is stupid (paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 43, 44, 45, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59).

5The imputations the subject of challenge are imputations 6(c) (which is identical to imputation 4(e) and 6(d).

The relevant principles to apply

6I briefly note the principles relevant to the court's task in determining a capacity objection as a separate question, and on a strike out application under r 14.28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), as explained by the Court of Appeal in Younan v Nationwide News [2013] NSWCA 335 at [20].

7The question to be determined is whether, on the balance of probabilities, each of the plaintiff's imputations objected to on that basis is reasonably capable of being conveyed to the ordinary reasonable reader: King v Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd [2014] NSWSC 490. Where the basis of the objection is one of form, the requirement is that the imputation must specify the act or condition allegedly attributed to the plaintiff by the matter complained of with sufficient clarity to enable the defendants to know the case they have to meet: Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135.


Imputations 4(a) and 4(b)

8Counsel for the defendants submits that these imputations cannot arise at the same time and should be permitted only as alternatives. Counsel for the plaintiff submits that these imputations are not mutually exclusive and not alternatives, in much the same way that a person who is a lawyer or doctor can still be called a lawyer or doctor, even after they have ceased to practise, or been struck off; similarly, it is argued, a person who is married will ""not forever have the status of being married"" (submissions, page 1).

9In Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 148B - C Gleeson CJ noted the longstanding rule, set out in Feros v West Sydney Radio Pty Ltd (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 22 June 1982, unreported) that a plaintiff may not in pleading allege two inconsistent or contradictory imputations, affecting the capacity of the imputation pleaded to convey a defamatory meaning (see also Tingle & Anor v Harbour Radio Pty Ltd & Anor (No 2) [1999] NSWSC 414 at [17]).

10I am satisfied that the imputations are inconsistent, in that the jury cannot find that both imputations are conveyed. Either the plaintiff is a stripper, or she is a former stripper. Similarly, a person cannot be a doctor and a former doctor at the same time. While it is possible to marry more than once and to be both divorced and married to some other person at the same time, this analogy is of no assistance. Being a former stripper is inconsistent with being a stripper and, in accordance with the principles explained by Hunt A-JA in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [75], they must be pleaded as alternatives.

11Is being called a former stripper less defamatory than being called a stripper? Should the imputation of being a former stripper be pleaded as a fall-back imputation? There is still utility in having fall-back imputations of lesser severity: see the discussion of this issue in King v John Fairfax Media Publications at [15] - [16]. Although I raised this issue with Mr Rasmussen, there is no need for me to make such a ruling; I shall leave it to the plaintiff to determine which of these two imputations should be pleaded first, and whether one is a fall-back for the other or only an alternative.

12I have accordingly made orders for these imputations to be pleaded as alternatives to each other.

Imputations 4(e) and 6(c): ""the plaintiff is a ridiculous person"" 

13The defendants do not challenge the concept of ridicule as not being actionable (as to which see the line of authority running from Villers v Monsley (1769) 2 Wils 403, 95 ER 886 to Boyd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 449), but object to the form of the imputation, in that its imprecision is such that no act or condition is identified.

14Both parties referred to Scali v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 15 July 1993), where the matter complained of made a derisive reference to a particularly garish interior design as being ""like Nick Scali on acid"". The plaintiff, a respected manufacturer of furniture of an Italianate style, brought proceedings for defamation and pleaded the following imputation:

""(e) That the First Plaintiff, by reason of his lacking in good taste in respect to furniture and interior decorations, is deserving of being held up to public ridicule.""

15Levine J struck out the imputation, stating that the phrase ""is deserving of being held up to public ridicule"" was, absent clear words in the publication, an unwarranted ""appendage"" (at page 2) as well as a rhetorical flourish (at page 3). 

16Contrary to the plaintiff's submissions, his Honour did not consider that an imputation that the plaintiff was ridiculous, absent the appendage of ""deserving"", could arise. His Honour's complaint (which he illustrated by referring to a similar attempt to avoid pleading the facts of the publication), was:

""... I was referred to a recent decision of Mathews J in George Polatidis v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd, Friday, 4 June 1993, in which her Honour was dealing with, inter alia, an imputation in relation to a comment upon a restaurant, ""the plaintiff conducts a cafe which is unfit to be patronised"" in which her Honour, with respect correctly in my view, held that it was a far cry from saying that the plaintiff's establishment serves sub-standard food, or that some of the cutlery it supplies is grubby, to saying that it is in the general sense unfit or undeserving to be patronised (p4).

17The imputation does not ""reflect"" the stings in the article, as claimed by the plaintiff in her counsel's submissions (page 2), but seeks to hide from them, in much the same was that the restaurant owner referred to above sought to avoid the factual allegations of serving sub-standard food, or having grubby cutlery, by an imputation that his café was unfit to be patronised.

18Mr Rasmussen also referred to Hanson-Young v Bauer Media Pty Ltd [2012] NSWSC 1850 at [13] - [25] where McCallum J allowed an imputation ""the plaintiff is a joke"" to go to the jury, but in the ""unique circumstances"" where the matter complained of was clearly constructed as an attempt at humour. 

19That is not the case here. The first matter complained of is a news report on the murder trial in which the plaintiff's boyfriend was convicted and her ""bizarre protest"" outside the sentencing in which she and others held up placards outside the court protesting his innocence and questioning evidence in the trial; it is illustrated with photographs of the plaintiff holding up those signs. The second matter complained of is an account of the plaintiff visiting her former boyfriend in prison after his conviction and describes statements she had made in a media interview, as well as to how she ""bizarrely"" re-enacted the crime for the media cameras.

20Each of the matters complained of contains a series of factual statements or opinions about the plaintiff. For the reasons explained by Levine J in Scali v John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd, the plaintiff should distil the sting of this imputation from the contents of the matter complained of rather than avoid them by pleading what both Levine J and Mathews J called a rhetorical imputation. Additionally, as the Court pointed out in Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200 at [31] (set out below), the defendants should not be called upon to defend such an imprecise and wide imputation. 

21It is easy to demonstrate how a factual statement in the matter complained of can import ridiculousness and how the imputation to that effect should be pleaded. For example, in Boyd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (where the plaintiff was a well-known footballer), the article, headed ""BOYD IS FAT, SLOW AND PREDICTABLE"", describes the journalist's astonishment as the portly plaintiff ""waddled into the sunshine"" to play for the Sea Eagles against South Sydney. The imputation pleaded was that the plaintiff, a footballer, was so fat as to appear ridiculous when he came onto the field to play, which imputation arose from the word ""waddled"" and the incredulity of the author at the plaintiff's appearance. 

22Whether the plaintiff is able to extract such an imputation from either of the matters complained of in these proceedings is a matter for the pleader.

23Imputations 4(e) and 6 (c) are struck out. Leave to replead is not appropriate, as any imputation that some act or condition of the plaintiff made her appear ridiculous will be so different in form and content as to be an entirely new imputation.

Imputation 6(d) 

24The objection to this imputation is that it does not arise, as well as being defective in form.

25The matter complained of clearly conveys the imputation that the plaintiff is deluded in her belief in Simon Gittany's innocence (imputations 6(a) and 6(b)). Mr Rasmussen's written submissions state that an imputation of stupidity is also conveyed because ""[a]ny person who believes in the innocence of Gittany in the face of those assertions must be stupid"", adding that a person can ""wake up"" from a delusion, while ""stupid is forever"" (plaintiff's submissions, page 2). 

26The statement of claim reveals that the same passages in the matter complained of are asserted to give rise to the imputations of being deluded as well as stupid. Judging by Mr Rasmussen's submissions, he considers ""stupid"" is a more permanent state of being ""deluded"".

27This argument suffers from two vices. First, this is contrary to the dictionary definition of ""stupid"", which generally connotes intellectual limitations rather than being deluded on a permanent basis. Secondly, if what is intended is a form of delusion rather than the plaintiff's intellectual imputations, the imputation is ambiguous.

28The plaintiff relies upon Toben v Milne in support of his entitlement to plead this imputation. However, the careful analysis of potentially ambiguous imputations by the Court of Appeal in Toben v Milne supports the defendants' contentions, and not those of the plaintiff. The imputation the Court found to be ambiguous in Toben v Milne was that the plaintiff ""fabricated history"". This was because, as the Court noted at [31], the imputation was ""too vague and imprecise"":

""In our view, imputation (a) in its present form is too vague and imprecise. The comment, ""people like [the appellant] engage in fabrication of history"" was made in the context of a condemnation of ""holocaust denials"", or anti-Semitism, or both. It was not made in the broad and general sense that imputation (a) presently conveys. The respondent should not be required to defend such an imprecise and wide imputation. If the appellant wishes to rely on an imputation relating to the fabrication of history, he ought to be required to plead the imputation having regard to the context of the article as a whole.""


29The ambiguity of ""fabricated history"" arose in Toben v Milne because of the potential to include holocaust denials and/or anti-Semitism (or both). The broad and general sense of the imputation meant that it could connote other historical fabrications, such as a false history of a war (at [28]) or of other holocausts (although I note, in passing, that the similar facts of other holocausts must present a conceptual problems to holocaust deniers generally).

30That same ambiguity is present here. The matter complained of does not convey an imputation that the plaintiff is stupid in the sense of having intellectual limitations, and any imputation that her continued belief in Simon Gittany's innocence is deluded is caught up by imputations 6(a) and 6(b). Conformably with my findings concerning imputations 4(e) and 6(c), imputation 6(d) is struck out.

(7)Stripper girlfriend stages bizarre protest as her killer boyfriend is sentenced for hurling ballerina fiancee from balcony

(8)- Girlfriend who is lookalike of murdered Lisa Harnum stages bizarre protest outside sentencing of killer Simon Gittany- Former stripper Rachelle Louise and murderer's family protest at Sydney courthouse- Placards outside court where judge could give killer life without parole- Gittany about to be sentenced for throwing his fiance from their luxury Sydney apartment after she threatened to leave him- New girlfriend is 'dead ringer' for Canadian-born Harnum murdered in 2011- Rachelle Louise takes court stand to declare killer 'best boyfriend I ever had'

(10)The girlfriend of convicted murdered Simon Gittany has staged a bizarre protest outside a Sydney courthouse where a Supreme Court judge is preparing to sentence him for throwing his fiancee to her death from the balcony of their luxury Sydney apartment.

(11)Rachelle Louise, who bears a striking resemblance to Gittany's murdered financee, Canadian-born ballerina Lisa Harnum, stood among the killer's supporters and family members as they held up placards protesting his innocence and questioning evidence heard in his murder trial last November.

(12)After the protest, Louise took to the stand inside the court to pronounce her love for 'romantic' and 'caring' Gittany, declaring the killer is 'the best boyfriend I have ever had'.

(13)And in a further twist, a last minute witness has given evidence inside the sentencing, saying Gittany had threatened to kill Harnum 'and make it look like suicide'

(17)Dead ringer: Rachelle Louise (right) who resembles the fiancee murdered by her boyfriend, Simon Gittany, stages a strange protest outside the Sydney court where a judge was about to pass sentence on the convicted killer

(18)[Picture]

(19)Lookalike: Rachelle Louise last year arriving with boyfriend Simon Gittany at the trial which convicted him for murdering fiancee Lisa Harnum, who Louise closely resembles

(20)Louise began a dramatic day arriving at court amid a group carrying protest placards.

(21)She was heavily made up, sporting a new shoulder length haircut and wearing a close-fitting black dress.

(22)One of the placards read 'Why didn't the police examine the awning?', a reference to Gitanny's [sic] defence that Harnum, 30, fell from the balcony in a state of 'distress' rather than having been flung by him, which is what Justice Lucy McCallum ruled had happened.

(23)Louise personally held up a placard which read, 'How do you render some1 unconscious in 65 sec without any sign of trauma to body'.

(24)One placard questioned the evidence of the murdered girl's psychologist, Michelle Redmond.

(25)Another listed Australians - including Lindy Chamberlain, of the infamous 'the dingo's got my baby' case - who have been found guilty of murder, only to have their convictions overturned.

(26)Justice McCallum convicted Gittany after a judge-only trial last year which heard evidence of his violent temper and controlling nature.

(27)The onetime Australian businessman has been incarcerated in the nation's largest remand prison, the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre, in Sydney's western suburbs awaiting today's hearing.

(28)It is understood Ms Louise and Gitanny's [sic] family have visited him at the jail, where for at least some of his imprisonment he has been held under suicide watch.

(29)Gittany, 40, has always denied murdering Harnum, an aspiring model, following a bitter row during which a security camera showed him dragging her back into the apartment with his hand across her mouth.

(30)Evidence given at his murder trial showed that just over a minute after the video footage was recorded, Harnum plunged to her death.

(31)During the trial, in a damning assessment of Gittany's character, Justice McCallum said she did not believe his account of how his fiancee had fallen from the balcony.

(32)Following delivery of the verdict in the New South Wales Supreme Court, Rachelle Louise put on a public display of her distress.

(33)She screamed at the judge, burst into tears and was taken from the court while Ms Harnum's family members, who had flown out from Canada for the trial, smiled and embraced.

(34)Outside, standing amid a crowd of press photographers and television cameras, Louise smoked a cigarette and continued weeping.

(35)Ten weeks later, it has emerged Louise has allegedly accepted a six-figure sum for a television interview in which she will protest Gittany's innocence, to be aired on the Seven Network this Sunday.

(36)Gittany's four-week-long trial, which gripped the nation, heard he was 'controlling, dominating and, at times, abusive' of Ms Harnum.

(37)Gittany lied 'with telling ease' and distorted the truth, Justice McCallum found.

(38)'At many times in his evidence the accused struck me as being a person playing a role, telling a story which fit with the objective evidence but which did no more than that,' Justice McCallum said in her judgement [sic].

(39)'His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail.

Second matter complained of

(1)A day in the life of world's 'most deluded' woman. Visiting her killer boyfriend in jail and playing dead to prove he didn't murder look alike fiancée... but can she REALLY believe balcony killer is innocent?

(2)Rachelle Louise visits boyfriend Simon Gittany in Parklea Prison, Sydney- He has been sentenced to 26 years for murder of fiancee Lisa Harnum- CCTV footage showed him dragging her back into flat before death- Ballerina was hurled from the balcony of their luxury flat - Ms Louise played dead on TV and challenged interviewer to lift her- Claimed this proved that Gittany would have been unable to kill Ms Harnum
(3)By CANDACE SUTTONPUBLISHED: 06:43 GMT, 17 February 2014 | UPDATED: 09:01 GMT, 17 February 2014
(4)With her hair pulled back and dressed for a workout, Rachelle Louise visited her murderer boyfriend in prison on Monday, a day after declaring she would only wait five years for him.

(5)It has been less than a week since Simon Gittany was sentenced to a maximum 26 years behind bars for throwing former girlfriend Lisa Harnum off a high-rise balcony in 2011.
(6)The MailOnline was at the prison gates of Sydney's Parklea Maximum Security jail when Ms Louise arrived just after midday on Monday for a scheduled visit to the killer. 
(7)Despite overwhelming evidence that 40-year-old Gittany had killed his fiancee, she continues to protest his innocence and has given two TV interviews in which she claimed there is no way he could have murdered Ms Harnum. Her actions have sparked a torrent of debate in the media and among the Australian public.

(11)[Picture]

(12)Supportive: Despite overwhelming evidence that Gittany had killed his fiancee, Ms Louise still maintains his innocence

(13)Dressed all in black, Ms Louise wore her hair up in a demure style, reminiscent of the strict hair and dress rules Gittany had made for the girlfriend he murdered.

(14)At his trial, the court heard he had ordered Ms Harnum to dress and wear her hair in a way that would not attract undue attention from men.

(15)Ms Louise passed through metal detectors to spend 90 minutes inside the prison with her lover in a visits room with other convicted inmates and men accused of crimes like robbery and rape.

(16)Their visit was observed by prison officers in a room lined with security cameras.

(17)Gittany was dressed in a white prison jumpsuit, which is backzipped to reduce the chance of visitors smuggling in drugs and other contraband to loved ones behind bars.

(23)Composed: She has also denied having a similar appearance to Gittany's victim

(24)Gittany was moved from Silverwater remand centre to Parklea last week following his sentence. Ms Louise declined to attend court on the day Gittany learned his fate.

(25)'I think he will be so upset that I didn't go,' she told Channel Seven's Sunday Night programme. 'But, you know what, I supported him every single day I went. Just today was for me. I didn't want to go.'

(26)Ms Louise also said that while she wanted to support Gittany, she would not wait around forever.

(27)'I do want to start a family of my own one day, so I mean I'm not going to wait that long,' she said.

(28)Asked how long she would wait before moving on she said: 'Right now I said he's got five years. Because 29, you know, going into 30s ... '

(36)Simon Gittany leaves the Supreme Court in Sydney in March 2013. Gittany was sentenced to 26 years in prison on February 10, 2014 for throwing Lisa Harnum to her death from a balcony.

(37)'Simon would be the best father ever. He really would. He would be such a brilliant father,' she said.

(38)The prison, surrounded by razor wire and patrolled by sniffer dogs, houses more than 800 adult male inmates.

(39)Ms Louise made the visit along with Gittany's father, mother and two sisters.

(40)She arrived in a green four wheel drive, the Gittanys driving up in two separate cars.

(41)One of Gittany's sisters emerged first from the visit, followed by Gittany's parents, and lastly Ms Louise and another of the murderer's sisters.

(42)The visit comes the day after Ms Louise's second paid interview was aired on Channel Seven, for a reported $150,000.

(43)In Sunday's program, Ms Louise dismissed as 'rubbish' an eyewitness account of Ms Harnum's fall from the balcony of the luxury apartment she shared with Gittany. 

(44)She bizarrely re-enacted for the cameras how she believed would not have been possible for Gittany to throw her over the railing.

(45)Ms Louise is allowed to visit Gittany at Parklea only twice a week, compared with the relative luxury of every day visits when he was awaiting sentence at Silverwater.

(46)Gittany is unpopular among his fellow inmates, according to a Triple M radio report, in which an unidentified prison guard is recorded as describing the killer as 'a very disliked inmate'.

(47)'He walks around like he didn't do it, ' the guard said.

(48)The guard said that on the night Channel Seven played its first interview with Ms Louise protesting Gittany's innocence, maximum security prisoners in cells near Gittany's had hurled abuse at him.

(49)Gittany 'kept to himself' in prison and is being held in a protection wing of Parklea, away from the main jail population where he might be at risk of being attacked because of the current publicity over Ms Louise's interviews.

2704347,R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 10) [2014] NSWSC 1482,"ex tempore Judgment


	
	On 22 October I gave judgment dismissing a no case submission made on behalf of one accused, Mr Issakidis, in respect of counts one and six on the indictment: R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 9) [2014] NSWSC 1460 (Dickson (No 9)). The other accused, Mr Anthony Dickson, also made such an application but, as explained in Dickson (No 9), his application was wholly dependent upon the outcome of the application made on behalf of Mr Issakidis.
	
	
	Following my rejection of Mr Issakidis’ no case submission, and in the absence of the jury, Senior Counsel for Mr Issakidis, Mr Byrne QC, made an application that I give to the jury a Prasad direction in respect of count one concerning his client (see R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161).
	
	
	Implicit in Mr Byrne QC’s submissions is that the case against his client does not have great strength. For the purposes of deciding this application, I will act upon that premise. It derives some support from the judgment in Dickson (No 9), in that the only substantial evidence directly connecting Mr Issakidis to the lodgement of the false tax returns, which is at the heart of the conspiracy the subject of count one, appears to have been certain communications that he was a party to with an accountant who prepared financial statements on behalf of NeuMedix Health Australasia Pty Ltd, and his signing of two versions of the financial accounts for that company in respect of the financial year 2007.
	
	
	As a general matter, given the very specific nature of the agreement the Crown must prove to establish count one, then the more removed the alleged co-conspirator is from involvement in the preparation and lodgement of false tax returns, the harder it is for the Crown to prove their participation in any such agreement by means of inference.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I decline to give the Prasad direction. Such directions are usually reserved for simple cases in which the critical evidence against an accused appears to lack credibility or reliability (see Seymour v R [2006] NSWCCA 206 at [58]) (“Seymour”). Thus, in R v Pahuja (1987) 49 SASR 191, a Prasad direction of seventeen pages in length was criticised as being too long (at 218). In Seymour, the giving of a Prasad direction by the trial judge was criticised because it occurred in a case of joint criminal enterprise, but in circumstances where the jury received no assistance on what that concept meant (Seymour at [64] to [65]).
	
	
	In this case the giving of a Prasad direction would occasion a serious injustice to the Crown. The judgment in Dickson (No 9) illustrates that the principal evidence against Mr Issakidis is documentary. Yet the Crown has not yet had the opportunity to fully put its case about what the documents show as to Mr Issakidis’ involvement. An opening to a jury is not the proper place for the Crown to argue an accused person’s guilt. While the evidence of various witnesses has addressed the contents of a number of the documents that have been tendered, there are obvious restrictions on what they can state about documents and their contents, especially in respect of documents in which they were not the author or recipient. It is not the function of witnesses to tie together documents which, together, might implicate an accused. Otherwise, as in Seymour, this case involves extended criminal responsibility, and a jury cannot properly consider such a case without receiving appropriate directions.
	
	
	Thus the only possible fair manner in which a Prasad direction could be given in that respect at this point would be to effectively stop the trial and provide a relatively detailed mini summing up. Such a process is implicitly disapproved of in the authorities to which I have referred.
	
	
	Accordingly, I refuse the application.

2704348,Haouchar v R [2014] NSWCCA 227,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Rothman J.
2ROTHMAN J: Haouchar Haouchar, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to the charge that between 26 August 2009 and 30 March 2012, he facilitated a car rebirthing activity that was carried out on an organised basis knowing it was a car rebirthing activity and it was carried out on an organised basis, contrary to s 154G(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
3There were two Form 1 offences, being two counts of dealing with property suspected to be proceeds of crime, contrary to s 193C(1) of the Crimes Act and the sentence imposed, taking into account the Form 1 offences, was a non-parole period of 1 year and three months, commencing 11 October 2013 and expiring 10 January 2015, with a remainder of term of 1 year and 3 months expiring on 10 April 2017. 
4The plea of guilty was entered on 1 August 2013 at Parramatta District Court and the applicant was sentenced on 11 October 2013. The maximum penalty for the offence for which the applicant was sentenced is 14 years' imprisonment and the legislature has established a standard non-parole period of 4 years' imprisonment. 
5The grounds of appeal are:
1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the absence of evidence as to the conditions in which the appellant was to be held in custody;
2: The discount for assistance to authorities was not an adequate reflection of the level of assistance, including consideration of the resulting onerous conditions the appellant would have to serve as a result of giving that assistance.
Facts and Remarks on Sentence
6On 30 March 2012, police executed a search warrant at the applicant's premises in South Granville, a suburb of Sydney. At the time, the applicant and a co-accused, Marwan Akkouch, were working on a black Nissan Navara. There were a number of other intact vehicles and car parts, panels, engines and accessories throughout the yard and inside the garage. 
7The applicant provided the premises for storing and dismantling stolen vehicles and also provided assistance to his co-accuseds, Mr Akkouch and Khaled Bikai. The applicant also utilised parts obtained from Mr Akkouch and Mr Bikai to repair his own vehicles. 
8The Agreed Facts outlined 28 vehicles as the subject of the illegal activities, most of which were stolen. The applicant facilitated the activity by providing the premises, carrying out work on the vehicles and also registering the vehicles ""no doubt for disposal"" (Remarks on Sentence, 2).
9On 17 July 2012, the applicant was arrested and granted bail. The sentencing judge noted the above facts, which were summarised in his Remarks on Sentence, generally at pages 1 to 2 thereof. The sentencing judge also remarked on the subjective circumstances of the applicant and treated the applicant generously in dealing with the findings of fact on subjective circumstances. I summarise the subjective circumstances noted by the sentencing judge.
10The applicant was born in 1971, is married and has eight children aged between four and seventeen years. His Honour noted the remarks in the pre-sentence report that the applicant had difficulties with his family surviving financially at times, because of his lack of employment and the large number of children (ROS, 3). 
11The applicant was ashamed of the embarrassment he had caused to his family by his offending and expressed a willingness to undertake a community-based sentence and continue to address his mental health issues (ROS, 3). The sentencing judge accepted an assessment of the applicant as being a low to medium risk of re-offending (ROS, 3).
12The sentencing judge also noted the applicant's mental health and that it was currently managed by his general practitioner and, as a consequence, generally stable. However, the existence of those issues rendered the applicant as being unsuitable for a community service order, noting s 86(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (ROS, 3). 
13Two psychiatrists reports were tendered, one from each of Dr Nielssen and Dr Allnutt. His Honour noted each of the reports and summarised a number of aspects of the report of Dr Nielssen, in particular, to the benefit of the applicant. Those matters included the applicant's panic disorder, initially relating to the death of his uncle, which was described as ""chronic and disabling"" and rendered him unable to seek employment (ROS, 4).The sentencing judge noted that, as a consequence of the mental health issues to which Dr Nielssen referred, the applicant would find the experience of imprisonment far more onerous than would be usual and would find it difficult to adjust to being detained in a confined space. Dr Nielssen also expressed the opinion that the applicant would be unlikely to receive his medication (or at least medication of a particular kind) as a consequence of which he may suffer uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms. 
14Dr Allnutt's report, dated 6 December 2005, was redacted. While it does not affect the circumstances of this case, much care must be taken in accepting a redacted expert opinion, where the judge is not apprised of the material that is deleted because the deleted material may qualify other matters that are then before the Court. Nevertheless the redacted material was tendered by agreement and the report, after redaction, was relied upon by the sentencing judge (ROS, 5). Dr Allnutt recommended a program of ongoing treatment. 
15The applicant was called in evidence in the sentence hearing and confirmed the effect of his panic disorder and his fears for spending time in confined spaces due to his psychiatric condition (ROS, 5). The applicant agreed that a full time sentence of imprisonment would not be absolutely unbearable, but that it would be very difficult (ROS, 7). 
16While the applicant accepted that the charge to which he had pleaded was a serious matter and the offending had taken place over a long period of time (ROS, 5), the applicant maintained that he was not the planner or organiser (or ""the brains behind"") the illegal endeavour and the applicant was regretful of the mistake he had made (ROS, 6).
17While the applicant conceded that he had, on previous occasions when being sentenced for criminal conduct, given evidence of his remorse and the lack of any likelihood of criminal re-offending, he suggested that, this time, his Honour should believe his evidence to that effect because of the age of his children and his own age diminishing the possibility for criminal activity. 
18His Honour, in a thoughtful and well-reasoned set of remarks, noted that the evidence established that the applicant had not acquired the vehicles, but did establish that there were a large number of them and that the applicant had facilitated this illegal enterprise over a long period of time (ROS, 10). The rebirthing took place on the applicant's premises, as noted above. The applicant brought skills he had learnt to the work involved and his involvement was not just labour. The applicant was also involved in the re-registration and disposal of the vehicles over a long period of time (ROS, 10). 
19The sentencing judge referred to the principles of sentencing and, in particular, sentencing for this kind of offence, none of which principles are the subject of criticism in these proceedings. 
20After noting the subjective matters, a number of which are recited above, including the anxiety disorder, his Honour noted overseas trips that involve air travel in very confined spaces over a long period of time (which qualifies the alleged disability and its effect). 
21The criminal offending was part of a planned and organised activity. 
22Further, the sentencing judge did not accept the applicant's evidence that he tried to stop his involvement in the illegal activity. There was no evidence of any such attempt (ROS, 13). 
23His Honour found that there were no exceptional circumstances based on the subjective features of the case (ROS, 9) and noted that the applicant had a number of prior offences for dishonesty (ROS, 2-3 and ROS, 13). 
24His Honour noted that this would be the applicant's first time in custody and, in finding special circumstances, noted that the applicant would be in protective custody in prison, that he would require treatment and medication for his anxiety disorder, and that, in due course, the applicant will need to undertake rehabilitation processes in the community (ROS, 14). As a consequence, his Honour fixed a lower non-parole period, being 50% of the total term of imprisonment. 
25Lastly, not in the order of his Honour's remarks, but for the purpose of these reasons, his Honour noted the assistance to police and referred to the affidavit tendered in that respect outlining the ""full co-operation and assistance"" that the applicant had provided to police. The sentencing judge noted that the assistance provided was ""significant and useful"" (ROS, 6) and that the applicant provided evidence that his assistance will continue in respect of other proceedings (ROS, 12). 
26His Honour allowed a combined discount of 50% for his plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities (ROS, 12). While noting the need for parity, proportionality and avoidance of double punishment, referring, in particular to Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45], his Honour noted that the shorter non-parole period imposed upon the applicant would not create any issues in that regard, because there are rational bases for any shorter sentence to be imposed on the applicant. 
Ground 1: A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the absence of evidence as to the conditions in which the appellant was to be held in custody. 
27This ground of appeal, or application for leave to appeal, is manifestly unarguable. The sentencing judge was informed the applicant would be imprisoned in the Special Protection area at Long Bay as a consequence of the assistance he had rendered to police. 
28There is no suggestion that a judge of the District Court dealing with sentencing would not be familiar with the Special Purpose Centre to which the applicant would be confined. Moreover, his Honour accepted that the applicant's conditions of custody within the Special Purpose Centre were generally to be more onerous than those experienced by the general prison population. 
29In effect, the applicant now seeks to put before this Court, on appeal, additional evidence of particular circumstances that are experienced in the Special Purpose Centre, which evidence could have been adduced at sentence, if thought appropriate, and which material, frankly, would be well known and is well known to judges of the District Court dealing with criminal sentencing and judges of this Court with like duties. 
30Sentencing proceedings are not a first step in a process that is intended to be finalised on appeal. Parties are not permitted to enhance their cases on appeal by introducing new or different evidence, particularly evidence that was, or would have been, available at the sentence hearing. 
31His Honour expressly took into account the conditions of custody that, in his Honour's view, were more onerous than would ordinarily be experienced. 
32This ground of appeal must fail. Further, the ground has no basis in the Remarks on Sentence. Nor is there any basis for assuming his Honour was unaware of the onerous conditions that he expressly took into account. 
Ground 2: The discount for assistance to authorities was not an adequate reflection of the level of assistance, including consideration of the resulting onerous conditions the appellant would have to serve as a result of giving that assistance. 
33To some extent, at the oral hearing, there was a degree of double counting in relation to this ground of appeal and the matters raised in support of ground 1. The applicant sought to rely upon his mental health issues in support of the issues associated with ground 2. Nevertheless, ground 2 is a quite separate issue from that raised by difficulties associated with the mental health issue. 
34His Honour fixed a combined discount of 50% for the plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. Judgments of this Court have long established the principles to be applied in dealing with such issues: see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [81]; Bland v R [2014] NSWCCA 82 at [88]; R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (1996) 172 A Crim R 151 at [5]; R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38 at [67]; (2012) 219 A Crim R 415; LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70 at [62]. 
35Two general propositions must be stated. First, sentencing is not an arithmetic exercise. A sentencing judge does not simply calculate discounts without regard to the purposes of sentencing prescribed by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the need to impose a sentence that carries out such purposes, including punishment, deterrence (both general and specific), the protection of the community, the promotion of rehabilitation, denunciation and reform: see s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
36The discount to be provided for the combined effect of a plea of guilty and assistance to authorities has been outlined on a number of occasions. The history and development of the principles were discussed by me in FS v R [2009] NSWCCA 301 (Campbell JA and Howie J agreeing). I recite the following more relevant extract:
""[17] The matters associated with a level of discount were discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19, in which the Court made it clear that a combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance should not normally exceed 50% and that discounts exceeding 50% should be reserved for very exceptional circumstances.
[18] In SZ v Regina, Buddin J, with whom Simpson J and Howie J agreed, said:
[52] I acknowledge, as did Latham J in Sukkar (supra), that there will be cases in which a combined or composite discount of more than 50% is called for. There may well be a case in which the assistance proffered is of a quite extraordinary kind. Alternatively there may be a case in which the offender is entitled to an additional discount, in accordance with the principles enunciated in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, on account of having disclosed information which was otherwise unknown to the authorities. Indeed, composite discounts in excess of 50% have been allowed on several occasions when this Court has proceeded to re-sentence following a successful appeal by an offender. See, for example, R v NP (supra); R v OPA [2004] NSWCCA 464 and R v AMT [2005] NSWCCA 151.
[53] However, in light of the authorities to which I have referred and particularly given the statutory mandate contained in s 23(3) of the Act, it is my opinion that a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for an exceptional case. Counsel for the applicant went so far as to suggest that a combined discount of 75%, comprising a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty to which would be added a further 50% for assistance to authorities, may be available in an appropriate case. In view of the matters to which I have referred, I regard such a submission as being simply untenable. Apart from any other consideration, the aggregation of discrete discounts is at odds with the observations of Gleeson CJ in Gallagher (supra) which are recited in the extract from El Hani (supra) which appears at par 31 of this judgment. See also R v NP (supra) at pars 30 and 47.
[19] In the same judgment, in separate comments agreeing with Buddin J, Howie J said:
[7] Counsel for the applicant argued that a proper application of both the guideline in Thomson and Houlton as to the effect of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty and the acknowledged range of the discount available for assistance meant that it was legitimate in an appropriate case to discount a sentence by up to 75 per cent. It was argued that, as the discount for the plea and the discount for assistance reflect two different policies and did not overlap, because the utilitarian value of the plea had nothing to do with contrition, the court should give them both their full effect. But the argument simply overlooks the fact that it is impossible to see how a sentence that is only 25 per cent of what would otherwise be appropriate could not be 'unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence'.
[8]I accept that what is 'unreasonably disproportionate' is not simply determined by the objective facts of the offence and has to take into account matters such as the threat posed to the offender by reason of the assistance given and the nature and extent of the assistance: R v C (1994) 75 A Crim R 309. But this does not relieve the judge from the primary task of imposing a sentence that reflects the objective circumstances of the offence: R v WHS (NSWCCA, unreported, 27 March 1995). The decision in York v R [2005] HCA 60; (2005) 221 ALR 541 does not suggest otherwise.
[20] It is with those principles in mind that one must analyse the comments of the sentencing judge as to the deduction that has been applied in this case.  Citing, as he did, the comments of Howie J in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151, which citation is referred to at [8] above, his Honour the sentencing judge referred to a ""standard deduction"" of 40%, unless there were exceptional circumstances.  Such a statement does not emerge from the principle espoused by Howie J in Sukkar.  
[21] There are two quite distinct circumstances that arise.  The first is a circumstance where the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of the sentence, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population.  The second circumstance is where the offender will not suffer more onerous conditions of imprisonment for a substantial portion of the term of imprisonment.  In the latter case, unless one can show exceptional circumstances, the reduction for the plea of guilty and assistance should be no more than 40%.  In the earlier case (i.e. where there will be more onerous conditions of imprisonment) the 40% figure is inapplicable.  In the latter situation the reduction for the plea of guilty and assistance is no more than 50%, unless very exceptional circumstances are disclosed.  Onerous conditions of imprisonment are not exceptional circumstances.  They are often a corollary of the assistance granted.  
[22] Moreover, there is no ""standard deduction"".  There is a percentage deduction to obtain a result, below which sentencing judges should not reduce a sentence, unless there are exceptional, or very exceptional, circumstances, because, inter alia, a ""discount"" of such magnitude would usually take the sentence to a level lower than could properly reflect the objective circumstances of the offence.""
37Particular attention, in the above lengthy citation, must be given to the encapsulation of the previous matters in [21] of FS, supra. Where there will not be more onerous conditions of imprisonment, the reduction for the combined effect of plea of a guilty and assistance should be no more than 40%, other than in exceptional circumstances. Where, as here, there will be more onerous conditions of imprisonment, then the combined reduction for the plea of guilty and assistance should be no more than 50%, unless very exceptional circumstances are disclosed. In that latter aspect, onerous conditions of imprisonment are not exceptional circumstances, they are part of the process by which a sentencing judge fixes a figure up to 50% and are, as stated in FS, a corollary of the assistance granted. 
38The judgment in FS related to sentencing under Commonwealth legislation, but the Court applied to the Commonwealth legislation, with some qualification, the principles that have been applied under the State legislation for some period. 
39Ultimately, the process upon which a sentencing judge embarks is not a process of arithmetic calculation or the blind application of percentage discounts. It is a process by which a proper sentence is fixed that takes account of all the purposes of sentencing to which, in this case, the sentencing judge referred. There is a point at which, regardless of the need to take proper account of assistance to authorities, a sentence does not reflect and would not reflect the seriousness of the offence for which it is being imposed. 
40The sentencing judge remarked that the cooperation with authorities and assistance thereto was ""full"". His Honour received a confidential affidavit. There were no Ellis factors (R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603). Nor was the assistance, even though at a high level, exceptional, such as where persons have risked themselves with violent offenders to wear a wire. 
41In my view, the applicant has shown no arguable error in the approach of the sentencing judge. The applicant has not shown ""very exceptional"" circumstances. Nor has the applicant shown any of the well-known bases upon which an appellate court will interfere with the exercise of discretion by a sentencing judge in fixing and imposing an appropriate sentence. 
42The sentencing judge is engaged in a process of intuitive synthesis. In my view, the sentence imposed could not legitimately be lower and still impose a sentence that is appropriate for the offending and the offender in question. This ground of appeal is not arguable. 
Conclusion
43Neither ground of appeal is arguable. No error has been disclosed that would warrant interference by this Court with the exercise upon which the sentencing judge embarked. 
44Moreover, even if there were an arguable ground of appeal and if it were to be considered error, the applicant has not satisfied the condition imposed by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, namely, the applicant has not satisfied the Court that a less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been imposed.  
45I would propose that leave to appeal be refused.

2704349,Dries v R [2014] NSWCCA 228,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Rothman J.
2ROTHMAN J: Shannon Dries, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal a sentence imposed upon him following a plea of guilty. The effective sentence imposed was a non-parole period of three years' imprisonment, commencing 31 July 2012 and concluding 30 July 2015, with the remainder of term being a period of three years and six months expiring 30 January 2019. 
3A plea of guilty was entered on 26 April 2013 at the Local Court and confirmed before the District Court at all stages. 
4The applicant was sentenced, in the District Court, following his plea, for the following offences: 
Sequence 6: Supply prohibited drug, 122 grams cannabis leaf, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (for which the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000 and for which there is no prescribed standard non-parole period);
Sequence 7: Supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 477.9 grams of methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985;
Sequence 8: Supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug, 192.3 grams of 3, 4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (ecstasy) contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
[Sequences 7 and 8 above each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and/or $385,000 fine and have a prescribed standard non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment].
5Further to the above, the applicant was sentenced, in relation to Sequence 7, bearing in mind two charges notified on a Form 1, which were:
(1)Two counts of supply prohibited drug, cannabis leaf, pursuant to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 for which a maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment and/or $220,000 fine;
(2)Three counts of unlawfully obtained goods on premises, motor vehicle parts, pursuant to s 527C(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which is prescribed a maximum penalty of 12 months' imprisonment and/or a $1,100 fine. 
6The sentencing judge imposed an aggregate sentence, which is set out below, together with the indicative sentences:  
Sequence 6: Conviction, but, pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 the imposition of no other penalty;
Sequence 7 (Indicative Sentence): Taking account of the Form 1 offences, imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years and six months with a remainder of term of a further two years and nine months;
Sequence 8 (Indicative Sentence): Imprisonment for a non-parole period of two years and six months with a remainder of term of a further two years and six months. 
Pursuant to the provisions of s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, an aggregate sentence was imposed of a non-parole period of three years' imprisonment, commencing 31 July 2012 and expiring 30 July 2015 with a remainder of term of a further three years and six months expiring 30 January 2019. 
7The applicant raises one ground of appeal, which, as filed, was in the following terms:
(1)His Honour was led into error by a statement of facts which erroneously recorded the purity level of a prohibited drug, causing the sentencing judge to take into consideration the purported very high purity level of the drug in imposing sentence, where that purity level was in fact unknown. 
8During the hearing, on questioning from the Court, the applicant sought, and was granted leave, to amend the ground to the following: 
(1)The sentence proceedings miscarried by reason of an error in the statement of agreed facts which erroneously recorded the purity level of a prohibited drug, causing the sentencing judge to take into consideration the purported very high purity level of the drug in imposing sentence, where that purity level was in fact unknown. 
Facts
9On 22 April 2012, the applicant engaged in a telephone conversation with an unknown person and agreed to supply that person with an amount of cannabis. This is one of the offences notified on the Form 1. On 2 May 2012, the applicant engaged in a further telephone conversation with another person, a male, and agreed to sell and supply cannabis (the second supply offence notified on the Form 1). 
10On 28 May 2012, the applicant engaged in a further telephone conversation with a male that was intercepted by police. The applicant was subsequently stopped by police while driving to a townhouse in Penrith, where the other person involved in the telephone conversation resided. Police found 122 grams of cannabis leaf in four bags in the applicant's car. This is the charge preferred, and described above, as Sequence 6. 
11On 24 July 2012, police executed a search warrant at the home of the applicant and found a box containing four clear plastic bags in his bedroom. Subsequent analysis found two of the bags contained a combined total of 477 grams of methylamphetamine (Sequence 7) and the other two bags contained a combined total of 192.3 grams of ecstasy (Sequence 8).
12In the course of the sentencing proceedings a statement of Agreed Facts, which the Crown tendered set out the purity of the prohibited drug found in each bag. Both bags containing methylamphetamine were said to have a purity of 14%. The bag containing 129.3 grams of ecstasy was said to have a purity of 17% and the smaller bag containing 63 grams of ecstasy was, in the Agreed Facts, stated to have a purity of 63%. No Analyst Certificate was tendered to the Court. 
13The Analysts' Certificates were provided to the applicant as part of the police brief of evidence, but were not tendered. The Analysts' Certificates demonstrate the correctness of the Agreed Facts in relation to the purity of each of the bags containing methylamphetamine and the larger bag containing 129.3 grams of ecstasy. However, the Analysts' Certificates show the purity of the smaller bag of 63 grams of ecstasy was not tested. 
14It seems that in compiling the Agreed Facts, the weight of ecstasy in the smaller bag was repeated, mistakenly, as the purity of the ecstasy in that bag. None of the Analysts' Certificates was before his Honour, as already stated, and his Honour was unaware of any issue as to purity other than that stated in the Agreed Facts. 
Remarks on Sentence
Objective Circumstances
15I do not repeat all that was the subject of comment by his Honour in describing the objective circumstances. The facts giving rise to the offences have already been set out and were repeated by his Honour in his Remarks on Sentence. His Honour referred (ROS, 6) to the purity of the ecstasy, but it was in the context of a passage that referred to there being little or no indicia of actual supply. His Honour said:
""During the course of his evidence, the Offender said he had it [the methylamphetamine] for his own use and to give to nine or ten mates without profit. He may well have had the funds to make the purchase of these drugs via the combination of his payout and the sale of his dogs that he bred and trained. His own usage, however, would mean that these drugs would have lasted him a long time. Apart from what is referred to as a debt ledger, there is no indicia of supply. The facts, which the Offender signed, referred to this debt ledger as being consistent with a tick list recording supplies of prohibited drug. His signing of the facts is no more than an acknowledgment that it is consistent with that and does not amount to an acceptance or admission on his part that that is what it was. During evidence, he said it was a reflection of people paying him for the dogs that they had bought from him after he bred and trained them.""
16Generally, his Honour came to the view, to the advantage of the applicant, that the applicant was using the supply to his nine or ten mates as a means of covering the outlay for his own use, which the Court remarked ""explains but does not excuse his offending behaviour"" (ROS, 7). 
17The sentencing judge came to the conclusion that, while the acts of supply to his mates must have been intended to be on a very regular basis, it was ""not in the higher echelons of the drug trafficking hierarchy"" and accepted that the applicant ""was trafficking drugs to a relatively small group of individuals whom he knew were users for the purposes of funding his own habit"" (ROS, 7). 
18Understandably, even though the sentencing judge made reference to the purity of the drugs, the reference was very much a passing reference and, the entirety of the Remarks on Sentence (at least in relation to objective circumstances) referred to the usual factors to conclude that the objective circumstances of the offences were ""below the middle of the range of objective seriousness but not at the bottom of the range, indeed far from it"".  
Subjective Circumstances 
19His Honour allowed a discount for the plea of guilty of 25%, the plea having been entered at the earliest opportunity. His Honour took account of the applicant's relatively young age although, correctly, remarked that 24 years of age, the age of the applicant at the time the offences were committed, was at the ""very upper echelons of what might be regarded as young"", and, notwithstanding that comment, gave slight weight to deterrence and greater weight to rehabilitation (ROS, 8). Consideration was also given to the applicant's substance abuse issues and mental health issues. However, due to their lack of causal connection, his Honour did not give less weight to deterrence because of these issues (ROS, 8). 
20His early years, noted by the sentencing judge, were affected by his mother's mental health issue. The applicant was the middle of three children, but also lived with four younger foster children. The applicant was diagnosed with ADHD and oppositional defiance disorder and prescribed medication as a child for those conditions. Schooling was intermittent and employment was casual and irregular.
21The applicant has a son, born in 2008, and the applicant separated from his child's mother, and was separated at the time of his arrest. An allowance was made, as a subjective factor favouring the applicant, that he was responsible for the care of his son for three or four days per week and would have full time custody of the child when released (ROS, 3). 
22The applicant was given the benefit of the fact that he was a victim of a glassing when he was 21 and lost some sight in one eye. He was also given the benefit of medical conditions discovered, at or just prior to, his incarceration. The applicant has a substance abuse problem that commenced when he was about 12 years of age. 
23The sentencing judge also gave the applicant the benefit of an assessment that he suffered PTSD and high levels of anxiety and stress, which had been described by experts as extremely severe, while his level of depression was described as moderate. 
24The sentencing judge found, due to the requirement that the applicant be in protective custody (ROS, 4) and his physical and mental health issues, that the applicant's time in custody would be more burdensome (ROS, 4). 
25The sentencing judge also found that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were very good and the likelihood of reoffending very low, particularly if the applicant addressed his substance abuse problems and treated his mental health issues (ROS, 7). 
26Lastly, the sentencing judge gave the applicant the benefit of leniency, extended to first offenders as a consequence of a criminal history that consisted only of traffic offences (ROS, 5) and found that the applicant was remorseful (ROS, 2). 
Consideration
27The applicant concedes that the Analysts' Certificates were not tendered at sentence. His Honour relied upon the Agreed Facts, which was the evidence before him. In so doing, his Honour committed no error. 
28Rather, the agreement between the parties as to the relevant facts occasioned, it is said, a miscarriage in the sentencing proceedings. 
29In effect, the applicant submits that this Court should go behind the evidence adduced in the proceeding, because the evidence may have led his Honour into error, or, as last framed, led to a miscarriage. 
30Significantly, the applicant does not argue that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive (or excessive, at all). 
31The Crown concedes that the Agreed Facts upon which his Honour relied were, to the extent that it specified a purity of 63% for the smallest bag of ecstasy, not based on any source evidence and ought not to have been put to his Honour. 
32His Honour came to the view that the objective seriousness of the offence fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness (ROS, 7), but not at the bottom of the range. It is not suggested that such an assessment was wrong, manifestly or otherwise. Nor is it suggested that, were the purity of the smallest bag of drugs stated as ""unknown"" in the Agreed Facts (as should have been the case), the assessment would have been different. 
33While the sentencing judge referred to the purity of the drugs in the smallest container on three separate occasions in the course of his Remarks, at no stage did he expressly link the purity of the smallest of the quantity with the assessment of criminality. As earlier stated, the sentencing judge expressly accepted, albeit with some reluctance, that the drug supply was to persons whom he knew and who, he knew, were drug users and effected by the applicant for the purpose of funding his own drug abuse. 
34It is not absolutely clear, from the submissions of the applicant, that which is said to be the error into which his Honour was led (as originally agitated) or what the miscarriage was. Sentencing is an intuitive synthesis which in part seeks to reconcile sometimes conflicting goals. This Court will intervene in a sentence only where one of the specified and narrow bases for intervention has been established. 
35It is not an error for the sentencing judge to rely on the only evidence before him. When the High Court remarked that an appeal court will intervene in the sentence only on grounds, which include that the sentencing judge ""mistakes the facts"", it was referring to the facts that have been adduced in evidence before the Court: see House v R [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. 
36In truth, the ground of appeal is that the sentence proceedings miscarried. Both the Crown and the applicant's counsel had the Analysts' Certificates, which formed the basis for the Agreed Facts. 
37As is conceded by the applicant in his submissions to this Court, the sentencing judge did not differentiate, in terms of the assessment of objective seriousness, between the offence described in Sequence 7 and the offence described in Sequence 8. Yet the error in relation to purity affected only the circumstances of Sequence 8 and only a minority of the drugs subject to Sequence 8. 
38There is no necessary nexus between the purity of a drug and the offences under the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act. There exists no legislative requirement to connect purity with the applicable statutory maximum penalties. Nevertheless, purity is a factor considered when determining whether an offence falls into the mid-range of seriousness: R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; (2005) 152 A Crim R 462 at [56]. 
39The indicative sentence for Sequence 7, as has been stated, takes account of Form 1 offences. Each of those offences involves supply of small amounts of cannabis or possession of stolen goods. No one submits that any of those offences would have had an effect (or substantial effect) on the sentence, particular in light of the judge's attitude to Sequence 6. 
40Where, as here, the sentencing judge does not differentiate between the objective seriousness of two different offences, coupled with the absence of a legislative requirement connecting purity with the maximum penalty imposed for particular offences, it becomes difficult to maintain a proposition that an error of fact applicable to only one part of one of them has affected, or significantly affected, the assessment of objective seriousness of that offence. 
41In this instance, the maximum sentences for each of the offences for which a custodial sentence was imposed was 20 years' imprisonment. Yet, the sentencing judge imposed an indicative sentence of a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months for each, and a further 2 years and 9 months or 2 years and 6 months respectively. 
42An aggregate sentence of 3 years non-parole period with a further 3 years and 6 months as the remainder of sentence, compared to a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment for each offence is hardly reflective of a proposition that the sentencing judge has imposed a sentence that is too high (or higher than it should or could be) because of a misrepresentation to him by counsel of the purity of the smallest amount of drugs in one of four bags. On the contrary, if the sentencing judge has taken into account, to any significant degree, the level of purity of the 63 gram bag of ecstasy, the sentence is extraordinarily light. 
43No error was committed by his Honour. His Honour sentenced on the basis of the evidence before him. If error were to have occurred in the process, it is error by counsel that has led to a miscarriage or an irregularity in the proceedings. Unless the error renders the sentencing process or the result irregular, the foregoing kind of error can only give rise to interference by this Court if it can be shown that the error had an effect, or substantial effect, on the sentence imposed and the sentence is, on that account, inappropriate. 
44The objective seriousness of the offence described in Sequence 8 could not have been different from that assessed by the sentencing judge, even adjusting any possible assessment for the correct (or unknown) purity of the small ecstasy bag. The applicant has failed to establish any difference, or likely difference, in the assessment of objective seriousness, nor in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. 
45Further, any arguable error would impact on only one of the two indicative sentences and no submission has been made as to how that would have impacted on the aggregate sentence imposed. Indeed, counsel for the applicant conceded that, if error were to be found, this would not affect the non-parole period set by his Honour, but only possibly the remainder of term. 
46The objective error in the facts admitted into evidence before the sentencing judge has not been shown to have given rise to any substantial effect and has not been shown to have resulted in a sentence that is, on the true facts, inappropriate, or unwarranted. 
47Even if it were otherwise, the applicant has, in my view, failed to satisfy the threshold in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 that a less severe sentence is warranted. 
48In my view, the appeal must fail and I propose that the Court make orders granting leave to appeal and dismissing the appeal. 
49RA HULME J: I agree with Rothman J.

2704366,Willis v R [2014] NSWDC 325,"Judgment


	
	Christopher Charles Willis has been charged with some very serious offences. Specifically they are assault occasioning actual bodily harm, stalking or intimidating somebody else and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. They all attract imprisonment as penalties.
	
	
	Mr Willis has a criminal record which includes previous periods of imprisonment. A conviction on the current charges therefore means that a further period of imprisonment is on the cards.
	
	
	He was charged with these offences - which are domestic violence related - when he was arrested on 31 December 2013. He spent about a week in custody before getting bail on 6 January 2014.
	
	
	Mr Willis intended to defend the charges and they were listed for hearing on 4 April 2014. However he did not turn up on that day and was convicted in his absence.
	
	
	Mr Willis applied to the Local Court for those convictions in his absence to be annulled. The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 allows a person to ask the Court to annul a conviction in certain circumstances. In fact s 8(2) provides that the Local Court “must grant an application for annulment” if the Court is satisfied that the “defendant was otherwise hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation” to the missed hearing, or that “having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice to do so.”
	
	
	Mr Willis’ application came on for hearing before his Honour Magistrate Murray in the Local Court here in Albury. His Honour refused the application and Mr Willis has exercised his right to appeal to this Court against that refusal.
	
	
	The reason given by Mr Willis for missing the hearing is that his life was in disarray between his release on bail in January and the hearing date because of his addiction to the prohibited drug ice. He had lost the bail slip which contained the date. In fact he was regularly reporting as he was required to do by the bail conditions. His father accompanied him in this. But as soon as he realised that he had missed the date, as he said, he left town. He was concerned about being arrested. He was eventually arrested and is presently in custody.
	
	
	Ms C Mendes of counsel, who appears for Mr Willis, drew my attention to a decision of Judge Bennett SC in Boulghourgian v Ryde City Council (2008) 8 DCLR (NSW) 314. His Honour, by reference to Supreme Court authority, discussed the wide and vague words of s 8(2)(b) which refer to “accident, illness, misadventure or other cause.” Judge Bennett went on to observe at [79] (325) that the Court of Appeal “has made abundantly clear” that “the legislation was not intended to produce injustice. Those accused who wish to defend the charges brought against them must be permitted to do so.” His Honour went on to observe in the following paragraph that the failure of an accused “wishing to defend the charges against them to attend court, through mere oversight, should not result in a finding of guilt and conviction as a matter of course.”
	
	
	Mr A Thomas, who appears for the respondent to the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions, does not take issue with the question of the injustice of a person not having their case heard, but submits that this case may not be one that would fall within the “accident, illness, misadventure or other cause” provision.
	
	
	Minds may differ over whether a disordered life brought about by self‑induced addiction to a powerful drug of addiction should qualify as a hindrance by way of illness or misadventure. I am inclined to think that it would.
	
	
	I agree with his Honour Judge Bennett where his Honour said as [77] (324-325) by reference to the Court of Appeal, that there is a “proposition that the word ‘hindered’ meant something less than prevented, namely, making something more or less difficult but not impossible, or alternatively, affecting to an appreciable extent the activity in question.” Self-induced drug intoxication could well be regarded as an illness or a misadventure and certainly as an “other cause.”
	
	
	I am satisfied by the explanation of Mr Willis that although his missing his court appearance was culpable in the sense that it was his own fault, it resulted from “illness, misadventure or other cause.” In any event, I would also be of the opinion that “having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice” to allow the application in this case.
	
	
	For those reasons I propose to allow the appeal.
	
	
	My formal order is this. Under 16K of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, I determine this appeal by granting the appeal, and I remit the matter to the Local Court.
	


HIS HONOUR:   Now they are the formal orders that I make. Was your client sentenced?

MENDES: Your Honour, he has not been sentenced.

HIS HONOUR: No, okay. So I don’t need to--

MENDES: There was a stay--

HIS HONOUR: --I don’t need to stay any sentence, okay.

MENDES: No your Honour, there’s only just a question with respect to bail.

HIS HONOUR: Yeah.

MENDES: Your Honour, bearing in mind the time, also there being other proceedings that I indicated to your Honour earlier, whether or not it’s more appropriate that bail be determined on 28 October in the Local Court or whether we consider bringing an application before your Honour. If you would allow the indulgence until tomorrow morning so I can get those instructions?

HIS HONOUR: I will, yeah.

MENDES: Your Honour will see from the paperwork that rehabilitation to a residential - or a residential rehabilitation was something that was canvassed in those proceedings. I need to also make inquiries as to bed availability and so forth.

HIS HONOUR: I guess you do, but also he’s going to get another hearing date and he’ll come back and defend the charges hopefully and if he’s acquitted then he goes back to his residential rehab. If he’s convicted, we don’t know what the sentence will be but it’s on the cards, as I said, that he could get a gaol term which would put an end to his participation in the course. But that’s speculation.

MENDES: And the intervening factor of a sentence presumably on 28 October with respect to two other matters and how that will play out. So your Honour, there are a few matters that I need to get instructions now in light of your Honour’s decision.

HIS HONOUR: All right. I’ll hang onto the papers--

MENDES: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: --and - so what, tomorrow morning--

MENDES: Your Honour has matters listed at 9.15 or 9.30 - is it 9.30?

HIS HONOUR: I’ll list it at 9.30 if you like. Thanks for making that case available. I think I might direct that a transcript be taken out of my judgment as well so we can add to District Court jurisprudence on this topic.

MENDES: Thank you your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: All right.

		11 May 2015",2014-10-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704367,R v SH [2014] NSWCCA 218,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  This is an appeal by the Crown under s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) against the acquittal of the respondent of an indictable offence.  The acquittal followed the trial judge, in a trial by judge alone, directing himself to return a verdict of not guilty.
2On 12 February 2013 SH, the present respondent, was found by police to be in possession of four pieces of cardboard, perforated into 696 squares.  Thirty-two of the squares, weighing 0.29 grams, were found on analysis to contain lysergide which is a prohibited drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) (see s 3 and Schedule 1) (the ""Drug Act"").  A government analyst, Ms Vanessa Shaw, was not able to determine the amount of lysergide contained in the cardboard.  On the basis that the 32 squares which were analysed were selected at random, she issued a certificate under s 43 of the Drug Act certifying that the four pieces of cardboard perforated into 696 squares weighed 6.43 grams in total and contained lysergide.  
3Subsequently the respondent was charged on indictment with supply of lysergide in the amount of 6.43 grams, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug (see Schedule 1 of the Drug Act).  The indictment referred to s 29 of the Act which, subject to exceptions, deems possession of not less than the traffickable quantity of a drug to be possession for the purpose of supply.
4Prior to his trial, the respondent sought from the trial judge, Jeffreys DCJ, an order quashing or staying the indictment on the basis that the evidence proposed to be called by the Crown was incapable of proving the elements of the offence with which he was charged. 
5Ms Shaw gave evidence at the hearing of the application, first, that the government laboratory at which she worked did not have the means to determine the amount of lysergide within the cardboard that she tested and, secondly, that the lysergide was embedded within ""the paper fibres"" of the cardboard (27/5/14, p 4; 28/5/14, p 8).  When it was put to her in cross-examination that ""if lysergide is sprayed onto a cardboard sheet it's not a mixture"", she responded ""I personally don't consider it a mixture"".
6In support of the indictment the Crown submitted that the effect of s 4 of the Drug Act was that the cardboard containing lysergide was itself an admixture of the prohibited drug and that the weight of the cardboard therefore determined whether the applicant was in possession of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.  Section 4 is in the following terms:
""Admixtures
In this Act, a reference to a prohibited drug includes a reference to any preparation, admixture, extract or other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug.""
7Section 3 of the Act contains a ""definition"" of the word ""substance"" which does not define its ambit but specifies certain matters intended to be included within it:
""substance includes preparation and admixture and all salts, isomers, esters or ethers of any substance and all salts of those isomers, esters and ethers.""
8Jeffreys DCJ decided on the application that it was in the interests of justice for the trial of the respondent to proceed but stated that at the conclusion of the Crown case he intended to direct the jury to acquit.  His Honour said:
""The Crown's position is that the evidence of the analyst is that normally, as she understands it, a liquid is either sprayed onto paper or cardboard and that liquid contains Lysergide.  And then, because it is a liquid, it becomes, according to the analyst, embedded within paper.  The analyst says that in her view the paper and liquid do not become a mixture, but that the liquid becomes embedded in the fibres of the paper.
When one considers the legislation, it seems to me that the only part of the legislation which assists the Crown case is that part of s 4 that reads 'substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug'.  It is quite clear that the Parliament was aware of discrete dosage units and it would be very easy in my view for the Parliament to have said that the weight of a substance such as Lysergide would include the medium, that is the cardboard or other piece of paper, upon which it was contained or in.  I have been referred to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v R2 19 NSWLR 513.  In my view that is not of any particular assistance.  I am told that there are no decisions in relation to the matter. It seems to me as a matter of statutory construction that it cannot be said that the prohibited drug which is within the cardboard square that the paper is contemplated within the legislation to be a substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug [sic].""  
9On 29 May 2014 the trial proceeded before Jeffreys DCJ as a judge alone trial.  At the conclusion of the Crown case, his Honour referred to his earlier judgment and said, relevantly:
""The evidence that has now been given is no more detailed in relation to weight than the evidence, which was before me at the time of the application.  
Accordingly, in my view, there is no evidence that is capable of satisfying a tribunal of fact beyond reasonable doubt as to the amount of the lysergide as being in excess of .002 kilograms"" (2/6/14, p 1).
10His Honour accordingly directed himself to acquit the respondent, which he proceeded to do.
11On 5 June 2014 the Director of Public Prosecutions filed in this Court a Notice of Appeal under s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.  The appeal was stated to be on grounds ""to be filed upon receipt of his Honour's reasons"".  Delay in transcription of his Honour's reasons should not however have prevented the Crown's identification of its ground or grounds of appeal within the period of 28 days after the acquittal specified by s 107(3) as the time within which an appeal is to be lodged.  The Crown was represented when his Honour delivered his short judgment at the trial and when he had delivered his judgment of 28 May 2014 on the application to quash or stay the indictment.  Its representatives should have notes of the oral judgments from which the ground or grounds of appeal could have been formulated.
12The Crown subsequently identified the ground of appeal upon which it intended to rely by a document filed on 6 August 2014, stating the ground as follows:
""His Honour erred in finding that, in order to establish the element 'the amount of substance was not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug' no regard is to be 'had of the weight of any preparation, admixture, extract or other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug' as provided by s. 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.""
13In its written submissions on appeal, the Crown reiterated that the ground of appeal was as quoted in [12] above but added:
""31. Underlying his Honour's determination in the present case were the following legal propositions:
(a) That the Crown was not able to establish the quantity element of the offence in circumstances where no assessment could be made of the lysergide alone;
(b) That the Crown was not able to establish the quantity element of the offence by relying on the combined weight of the drug and the perforated cardboard; and
(c) A conclusion that there was no evidence as to the weight of the drug being greater than any nominated quantity.
32. These are 'separate and distinct' legal propositions which his Honour applied to the facts in this case (PL at [72]).  As such, they constitute errors giving rise to grounds of appeal involving questions of law alone.""
14It concluded its submissions with the following:
""45. The ultimate Crown submission is that there is no basis in fact or through process of reasoning, for a cardboard tab with embedded lysergide not to be considered an admixture ...
46. The Crown submits that the court would be satisfied that the essential element 'the amount of substance was not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug' has been established.""
15The respondent's written submissions on appeal included the following:
""6. There is no question of law alone formulated with precision by the Director:  cf JS [R v JS [2007] NSWCCA 272; 175 A Crim R 108] at [75].  The 'ground' of appeal filed does not raise a question of law alone, and is, in any case contentious as the quotations attributed to his Honour are not to be found in his Honour's judgment entering a verdict of not guilty (or his earlier judgment declining to quash the indictment).
...
13. As stated above, the ground of appeal does not reflect the judgment of the primary judge.  It is 'embarrassing' and the appeal should be refused as the jurisdiction of this Court under s107 [of the Crimes (Appeal and Review)] Act has not been invoked.
14. The respondent refutes the submission of the Director as to what are said to be the 'legal propositions' underlying the determination in the case, and in any case they are mixed questions of fact and law:  AS [31].""
The Crown's application for leave to amend
16After the Crown's address at the hearing of the appeal on 8 September 2014, and during the respondent's address, the Crown sought a half hour adjournment to enable it to consider whether it wished to seek leave to amend or supplement its ground of appeal.  The adjournment application was granted and when the Court resumed the Crown sought leave to add or substitute the following ground of appeal:
""His Honour erred in his statutory construction of s 4 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, in particular by not including cardboard (paper) as a substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug in terms of s 4 of the Act"".
17The respondent opposed the application.
18For the following reasons I consider that the Crown's application for leave to amend should be refused.  
19First, the Crown's existing ground of appeal was notified only well after the expiration of the period specified by s 107(3) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act for the Crown to appeal (see [11] above).  Whilst of itself only of limited importance, that is a factor that should nevertheless be taken into account.  
20Secondly, by his written submissions the respondent gave the Crown clear notice before the appeal hearing that he contended that the existing ground of appeal did not reflect the judgment of the trial judge and that the ""legal propositions"" referred to in paragraph [31] of the Crown's submissions were in fact mixed questions of fact and law (see [13] and [15] above).  The Crown took no action in response and persisted in its address at the appeal hearing with its existing ground of appeal.
21Thirdly, the Crown's application for leave to amend was not made at the outset of the appeal hearing, nor even during the Crown's address, but only in the course of the respondent's address.  It was therefore by any standard exceedingly late and was made only shortly before the appeal hearing would otherwise have concluded.  
22Fourthly, the respondent would be prejudiced in terms of his ability to respond to the new ground of appeal unless the Court fixed a further hearing to occur at a later date.  The respondent's counsel indicated in the course of argument on the amendment application that if the amendment were granted, she would not be in a position to respond immediately.  That was not an unreasonable position to adopt as the submissions on appeal to that point had demonstrated that identifying the precise basis upon which his Honour directed the respondent's acquittal and therefore the appropriate formulation of any question of law which might form the foundation of the Crown's appeal was not a simple task.  It would not have been appropriate simply to grant the respondent leave to lodge a written submission as this would have deprived him of the opportunity of having his counsel address the Court orally and respond to any questions it might have.
23Fifthly, it is, for the following reasons, a relevant consideration that the Crown's appeal was one from an acquittal in criminal proceedings.
24As Mason and Brennan JJ remarked in Williams v The Queen [1986] HCA 88; 161 CLR 278 at 301 in relation to a Tasmanian statutory provision relevantly comparable to s 107 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal to allow a Crown appeal against acquittal is of an exceptional character and constitutes an exception to the right of an accused person ""to be spared the jeopardy of an appeal from an acquittal after a hearing on the merits of a criminal charge by a court of competent jurisdiction"" (citing Thompson v Mastertouch TV Service Pty Ltd (No 3) (1978) 38 FLR 397 at 413, as approved by the High Court in Davern v Messel [1984] HCA 34; 155 CLR 21).  Whilst, as Gibbs CJ pointed out in Davern at 33, there may be a question as to when a hearing can properly be described as one ""on the merits"", that which took place before Jeffreys DCJ can in my view aptly be so described because the whole of the Crown case was led before the respondent was acquitted.  In Davern at 55, Mason and Brennan JJ described the ""main foundation"" for the ""Mastertouch principle"" as ""the rule against double jeopardy, though the principle may also be based more generally on a notion of justice and fairness to the accused as the weaker party to criminal proceedings"".  
25Likewise in R v PL [2009] NSWCCA 256; 199 A Crim R 199, Spigelman CJ (with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and R A Hulme J) referred to s 107 as being a statutory provision ""which overturns a fundamental principle of the criminal law"", that is, the principle against double jeopardy (at [24]).  His Honour considered this principle again in R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7.  That decision was concerned with s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act which precludes the principle of double jeopardy being taken into account in Crown appeals against sentence.  The section does not however apply to an appeal against acquittal such as that with which this case is concerned.  
26In JW at [56] and [57], his Honour cited observations of Black J in Green v The United States 355 US 184 (1957) at 187-188 (quoted in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 at [10]) as follows:
""The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.""
27In light of these authorities, the Court should be slow to afford any indulgence to the Crown which would have the effect of prolonging or expanding the Crown's appeal where the need for indulgence arises out of the Crown's failure to frame and pursue its appeal in a careful and timely fashion.
28Sixthly, the proposed new ground of appeal does not clearly raise a relevant question of law.  Contrary to the suggested ground (in its allegation of error in ""not including"" cardboard within s 4), it was not his Honour's role to include or exclude cardboard, paper or any other matter from the ambit of s 4 of the Drug Act.  What may have been a relevant question of law on this topic, depending upon the view taken as to the basis of his Honour's decision, is whether cardboard containing an unascertained proportion of a prohibited drug listed in Schedule 1 to the Act embedded within its fibres is capable of being a ""substance"" within the meaning of s 4 of the Act.  This would be a question of law because the question ""can be stated and considered separately from the facts [in the case] with which it may be connected"" (Williams at 287).  To put it another way, a question of law would be raised because the inquiry is whether a postulated fact (possession of cardboard containing an unascertained proportion of a prohibited drug within its fibres) was necessarily outside the statute (Landsman v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWCA 369 at [22] citing Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 138; OV v Members of the Board of the Wesley Mission Council [2010] NSWCA 155; 79 NSWLR 606 at [47]).   
29Identification of a relevant question of law suffers from the difficulty that it is not entirely clear upon what basis the trial judge reached his decision.  The respondent submitted that he determined that the cardboard in question was not a ""substance"" within the meaning of s 4 as distinct from determining that cardboard could never be that.  Although I am inclined to a different view, the point is arguable.
30Whether the cardboard with which the present case is concerned was in fact a ""substance"" within the ambit of s 4 would be a question of fact, or at least a question of mixed fact and law (Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36; 186 CLR 389 at 395-7).  The answer to that question would involve consideration, inter alia, of whether the cardboard in fact ""contain[ed]"" any lysergide (see s 4 of the Act) or whether, as the respondent submitted, consideration of the whole of the evidence of Ms Shaw demonstrated that that had not been proved to be the case.
31It would also involve consideration of the respondent's argument that the Crown had not proved that the cardboard was any more than a container or other vehicle to facilitate use of the drug and that it was not therefore itself a ""substance"" within the meaning of s 4.  In support of this submission, he contended there was no evidence before the trial judge that the cardboard squares were designed to be swallowed, the only relevant evidence on this topic (""Usually the tab is placed inside the mouth, either on or under the tongue"") suggesting that they were not.  The effect of the argument was that if the cardboard was simply intended to be put in the user's mouth until the lysergide was withdrawn and then to be discarded, the cardboard served no different function than a container or syringe from which the user extracted a drug.  
32Seventhly, the importance which the law attaches to the statement of charge against an accused person is relevant.  There is an analogy between a statement of charge and the notice of appeal in this case.  The respondent had been acquitted and the notice of appeal (as supplemented by the subsequently notified ground of appeal) constituted the Crown's identification of the reason or reasons why the respondent should be put on trial again.  The respondent was in those circumstances entitled to have the ground or grounds of appeal identified with some precision and in a timely fashion (compare Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531, particularly at [24]-[28]).  
33Eighthly, it is well-established that a party who exercises a right to appeal on a question of law (whatever be the precise statutory description of that right) must ""identify with a degree of precision the decision with respect to a matter of law which is sought to be challenged on the appeal"" (HIA Insurance Services Pty Ltd v Kostas [2009] NSWCA 292 at [104]; reversed on other grounds in Kostas v HIA Insurance Services Pty Ltd [2010] HCA 32; 241 CLR 390; see also Fletcher International Exports Pty Ltd v Lott [2010] NSWCA 63 at [23]).  The proposed new ground of appeal would not do this.  Nor would the ""legal propositions"" as stated by the Crown in [31] of its written submissions (see [13] above) which, as the respondent submitted, were questions of mixed fact and law.
34Ninthly, the principles applicable to applications for amendment in civil cases may be applied by way of analogy.
35In Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27; 239 CLR 175 at [5], French CJ made the following observation in the context of an application for leave to amend a statement of claim in civil proceedings:
""[5] ... [b]oth the primary judge and the Court of Appeal should have taken into account that, whatever costs are ordered, there is an irreparable element of unfair prejudice in unnecessarily delaying proceedings.  Moreover, the time of the court is a publicly funded resource.  Inefficiencies in the use of that resource, arising from the vacation or adjournment of trials, are to be taken into account.  So too is the need to maintain public confidence in the judicial system"".
36His Honour's comment concerning inefficiencies is as applicable to the need for a further appeal hearing as it is to the vacation or adjournment of trials.  In the same case, the plurality observed at [100], by reference to authority, that ""a judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain ... litigation imposes upon litigants"".  As Allsop P said in Richards v Cornford (No 3) [2010] NSWCA 134 at [42], ""[t]he reality of the personal strain of litigation is now clearly recognised by the Courts"".  These observations are applicable a fortiori to an accused in criminal proceedings (or, as here, a respondent who has been acquitted but is at risk of retrial and conviction of a criminal offence).
37In light of these factors and in the circumstances that I have identified, the Crown's application for leave to amend its ground of appeal should be refused.  A grant of leave would require a further appeal hearing.  The Crown has had ample opportunity properly to define and notify its case to the respondent.  It has not done this, through no fault of the respondent who clearly and in a timely fashion drew the below-mentioned deficiencies in the Crown's appeal to its attention.  As was found to be the case in R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45 at [42], there would be an element of unfairness and oppression in allowing the Crown to change its case on appeal at this late stage.  As with Mr Carroll, the present respondent ""might be thought to be entitled to a modicum of stability in what is put against him by the Crown"" (at [42]).
THE EXISTING GROUND OF APPEAL
38This ground is set out in [12] above.  It does not reflect any finding made by the trial judge.  The trial judge did not, as the ground suggests, find that s 4 of the Act was inapplicable to the determination of the amount of a drug that is the subject of an offence.  This would have been contrary to the clear language and intent of s 4.  To the extent that there may have been a doubt as to whether s 4 applied in the case of a deemed supply under s 29, it was removed by the decision of this Court in R v R2 (1990) 19 NSWLR 513.
39In these circumstances, the question posed by the ground of appeal must be answered ""does not arise"" because the trial judge did not make the finding that he allegedly erred in making.  As a result, the appeal should be dismissed.
40FULLERTON J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

2704368,R v Robertson; R v McArthur [2014] NSWSC 1401,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The deceased died on 5 December 2011 at industrial premises in Minchinbury where he conducted a business called ""HB Automotive"". He was aged 15 years at the time of his death. He died at the scene when he was unexpectedly confronted, attacked and stabbed by Darren McArthur in the early hours of the morning just before the workshop opened for the day. Mr McArthur had been driven to the scene by Darren Robertson.

2Each of the accused was indicted upon a charge alleging that on 5 December 2011 they did murder the deceased. 

3Mr Robertson pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased following his arraignment, but well before the commencement of the trial, which the Crown only accepted in complete satisfaction and discharge of the indictment on the first day of the trial. The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.

4Mr McArthur pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased on the first day of the trial. The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 

5There was an agreement concerning the facts for sentencing purposes in the case of Mr Robertson. No such agreement was reached concerning Mr McArthur.

Mr Robertson - agreed facts

6On the day of the incident, Mr Robertson and Mr McArthur drove from the Central Coast area of New South Wales to Minchinbury in western Sydney. Mr Robertson drove the car, which belonged to his then partner Chelsea James. Mr McArthur travelled in the front passenger seat. If Mr McArthur carried a knife with him at that time, there was no evidence that Mr Robertson was aware of that fact.

7Mr Robertson and Mr McArthur drove to an industrial complex that contained the premises of HB Automotive. CCTV footage captured at the time shows the car arriving at about 5.40am. Over the course of the next two hours, the vehicle is seen to be driving around in the area and past the premises of HB Automotive.

8The deceased and his father arrived at the premises at about 7.50am that day. After opening the business, the deceased's father drove away, leaving the deceased alone in the workshop. At about 8.13am, Mr McArthur left the car and walked into the factory complex. He entered the workshop and assaulted the deceased. About six minutes later, Mr McArthur walked out of the factory complex and back to where Mr Robertson was waiting in the car, around a corner and out of view of the premises. The two men then drove away from the area.

9At about the same time as Mr McArthur was walking away from the premises, Mr Wayne Quinnell, an employee of HB Automotive, arrived at work and found the deceased lying on the floor of the workshop severely injured. Despite Mr Quinnell's attempts to assist the deceased, and later those of attending ambulance personnel, the deceased died from his injuries.

10The direct cause of death was a stab wound to the deceased's chest that penetrated his left lung and thoracic aorta. The deceased sustained a series of other injuries, including a cluster of non-lethal sharp force injuries to his right lower leg.

11An examination of the clothing worn by the deceased contained DNA material matching that of Mr McArthur. In particular, such material was found on three areas of the lower right leg of the deceased's trousers, one area on the lower left trouser leg, on both of the deceased's work boots and on a band worn by the deceased on his right leg. None of Mr Robertson's DNA was located on the deceased or at the scene.

12At the time of the incident, the offender was in a relationship with Ms James. On the day before the offence, Mr Robertson and Ms James had the following conversation:

""Robertson: I have been offered to do a job tomorrow for a mate for good money.

James: What sort of job?

Robertson: All I have to do is go to Minchinbury to rough up and scare some bloke that owed some money to a friend and has ripped off some people.

James: What the hell, no way, don't be stupid. Where did all this come from? Who is the friend?

Robertson: Nobody. Don't worry about it. I could get $2,500 for doing it. It will be fine. I have been down there and scoped it all out. He is a big bastard but I won't be alone. It's in an industrial area in a shed up the back of Minchinbury...""

13Mr Robertson does not agree that he said that he could be paid $2,500.

14In the days following the death of the deceased, Mr Robertson told Ms James that he had organised for Mr McArthur to do the job with him and that a person known as ""Macca"" was to pay him for the job. Mr Robertson disputes that he organised for Mr McArthur to do it.

15Mr Robertson was part of a joint criminal enterprise involving an unlawful and dangerous act, namely to ""rough up"" or assault the deceased in return for payment. In doing so, Mr Robertson was aware that he was exposing another person to an appreciable risk of really serious injury.

Mr McArthur - factual findings

16There was no agreement with respect to the facts for sentencing purposes in the case of Mr McArthur. It was necessary in those circumstances for evidence to be led on matters of significant dispute. Those matters were the identification of the particular implement used by Mr McArthur that caused the death of the deceased and the related issue of whether or not Mr McArthur came armed with it, as well as whether or not Mr McArthur intended to kill the deceased or merely to cause him really serious injury. 

17Dr Matthew Orde is a forensic pathologist who gave evidence by video link from Canada. Dr Orde is the medical specialist who carried out the autopsy upon the deceased on the day following his death. He prepared a report dated 23 May 2012 that was tendered without objection. 

18Dr Orde gave the following evidence concerning the question of what implement may have caused the fatal injury to the deceased:

""Q. You have described the edges of the wound, in the last sentence of the second paragraph under 'torso', 'the inferior edge was somewhat shallow and the top edge was slightly undercut'. Firstly, might you explain that and also indicate what that could mean, what conclusion it is possible to draw as to a knife with a sharp edge and the other side of the knife being the blunt side? 
A. I looked at this injury carefully, looking for signs which may point to a particular weapon. And there are difficulties in attempting to do that because we know that various weapons can produce various pattern injuries. There is not always a correlation. 

In this case, I noted the one end was somewhat squared and the other end was what more pointed which, to me, suggests that the weapon, probably a knife or similar, would have had one cutting edge and probably one relatively noncutting edge. The shelving is probably, for the purpose of this, neither here nor there. It just reflects the underlying trajectory of the wound path into the tissues.""

19Dr Orde was also asked about the grazing type wounds to the deceased's leg. He said the following:

""A. [Photographs] 115 and 116, so we can see there in those photographs, towards the back of the lower part of the leg, the lower part of the calf, there are multiple fairly parallel scratches or shallow cuts to the leg. The spacing of these cuts suggests to me that these cuts would have been made by a serrated edge, as may be seen on a knife...""

20Dr Orde was cross-examined on this issue as follows:

""Q. Now the wound to the chest, could that be caused by something like a screwdriver being forced into the chest? 
A. It is always difficult to make certain conclusive comments about the object which caused an injury like a stab wound. The shape of the wound to the skin and to the deep structures depends upon many variables, not least the speed at which the object was thrust into the person's body but also the relative angle and movement between the weapon and the victim. Having said that, I think the injury to the left upper part of the chest was characteristically that of a cutting weapon such as a knife. I certainly wouldn't favour a screwdriver. I think the width that went into the skin would be too long to be accounted for by such a mechanism, so I simply favour a cutting object for that injury. As to the injuries to the right lower leg, again I would favour a cutting object with a longer, broader cutting edge, rather than something like a screwdriver. 

Q. You use the term 'like a knife' some object that at least has one edge that is somehow sharpened is what you think would cause those two injuries, is that right? It needs one sharpened edge? 
A. There may be two sharpened edges, I can't be certain? 

Q. But at least one? 
A. At least one sharp edge. I would favour something like a knife and looking at the deeper aspect of the stab wound to the chest, the injury gradually tapered to a smaller width as it went deeper, so I would favour a knife which had a pointed, tapered end. But again, it is difficult to be certain as to that sort of aspect of these injuries. 

Q. The difficulty is, it is much easier to make a conclusion about the possibility of a particular injury being caused, if you are provided with a weapon to use for comparison to the injury, is that correct? 
A. Yes, the best thing we can do is, if we are shown a weapon, obviously a pathologist will be able to say yea or nay. But it is difficult for me to describe the likely shape of any weapon, just looking at the injuries.""

21In re-examination, Dr Orde was not particularly enthusiastic about the suggestion that the fatal injury to the deceased could have been caused by a screwdriver, as the following evidence reveals:

""Q. The suggestion that it could have been a screwdriver that caused the stab wound to the chest, what differences, if any, would you expect to see from what you have seen in this if a screwdriver had been used? 
A. If a screwdriver - again, it all depends upon the nature of the screwdriver, the width of the blade, the length of the blade, its sharpness and all the rest of it. So again, many variables come into play. But assuming we are talking about a typical, fairly small diameter screwdriver with a small shaft, then one would expect a smaller injury to the skin. That need not always be the case, of course, because the screwdriver might move relative to the body and then extending the wound. But in this case, if you look at photograph 41 you can, I think, appreciate there that the edges of the injury to the skin are quite clearly cut along the whole length of this wound. So I don't think you could account for that by something like a screwdriver, which has a relatively blunt edge. This means an injury caused by a sharper edged object such as a knife, rather than a screwdriver.""

22Chelsea James gave evidence. She confirmed the terms of her conversation with Mr Robertson, referred to earlier at [13], and adhered to what she said when challenged about it by Mr Stratton SC for Mr Robertson. She was also asked about Mr McArthur, as the following passage reveals:

""Q. The other matter I wanted to ask you about is what Mr Robertson said, if anything, about Darren McArthur. Do you understand, I want to ask you about an aspect of that? 
A. Um. 

Q. I will ask you specifically. You said some things in your statement about the interactions between Mr Robertson and Mr McArthur, correct? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What I want to ask you is did he say anything about how Mr McArthur came into this job or became involved or why? 
A. From what Darren had told me is that he asked Darren McArthur to help him with it. That's he asked him to go with him.""

23Linda Sharon Monsuere gave evidence that she knew Mr McArthur, and that about three or four days before 5 December 2011 he told her that he had a job to do in Sydney. She said that on an occasion in late November 2011, Mr McArthur was at her home and told her that ""a boy had died on him"". Ms Monsuere said that she had known Mr McArthur to carry a knife in the waist of his pants.

24A couple of days after the death of the deceased, Mr McArthur again visited Ms Monsuere. She gave evidence about what was said as follows:

""Q. Did he say anything about the death of this young man? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did he say? 
A. That the kid died on him, that he wasn't supposed to die. 

Q. The following week, did he come around to your house and did he talk about money? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did he say? 
A. He was wanting the money that he was owed for doing the job.""

25It would appear that following this conversation some phone calls were made to Mr Robertson from Ms Monsuere's mobile phone.

26Mr McArthur gave evidence. He maintained that what had happened was a mistake. He said: ""I was just told to ask for the owner and to punch him in the mouth."" He said that he was asked to do the job by someone called Macca, and that he would be paid in drugs. He was using ice at the time of the offence and had been regularly using illicit drugs. As he said, ""I was a bad junkie at the time."" Mr McArthur said this in evidence:

""Q. How you came to go down to Minchinbury in Sydney and entered this factory? What led you to do that? 
A. I was just asked to give someone a hand. 

Q. Who asked you? 
A. Darren asked me. 

Q. And what did he say? 
A. He just said, 'Give us a hand. We are just going down to Sydney to talk to someone'. 

Q. Was there anything other than talking to someone suggested? 
A. No, I just thought it was just to bash someone or something.""

27Mr McArthur was asked about what happened when he entered the premises. He said this:

""A. I couldn't see anybody in there. I didn't think there is anybody there but the roller door was up. I went outside, I was on the driveway a bit and I went back and I heard something. When I walked in there was someone down the back of the factory. I started walking towards the person. I said, 'are you the owner?' They said, 'yeah'. I tripped over something just before I got to the person. I tripped and landed on them. The person pushed me back like that and I just freaked out. Because I landed on him, the way I walked towards him he must have thought something was up and he started lunging at me and I spun out. I didn't know what was going on. I was just going to hit somebody. So as I am falling over, I am trying to get back out, I was thinking of running out. Trying to get to my feet, I tripped over something, I grabbed something and I was just lunging at him. He was coming towards me, I had hold of him and he had hold of me. He went flying over, he went over my head, sort of thing, as I tripped over. He hit the ground. His legs was up this end of me. I slashed at his leg. He didn't move. I just shit myself and then I left, walked out and just ran down the road.""

28Mr McArthur denied that he entered the premises armed with anything, including a knife. He said that he stabbed the deceased with something that came to hand on the floor of the premises as he was struggling with the deceased. His evidence was as follows:

""Q. You say you took hold of something. Do you know what it was you took hold of? 
A. Um, it was like a saw or something like that. I am not sure, it was just like sharp. It was a piece of metal about [30cm] long.""

29Mr McArthur admitted that he took hold of the item in order to stab the deceased. However he was unable with any particularity to describe the implement. He said that he threw it from the car as he was driven away by Mr Robertson. He agreed that he slashed at the deceased's legs with the implement. He described it when cross-examined as ""a long piece of metal"". 

Mr Robertson

Subjective circumstances 

30Mr Robertson was born in April 1970 and is now 44 years old.

31Mr Robertson tendered a report from Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, dated 24 August 2014. Dr Nielssen took a history from Mr Robertson that included the fact that he has been held as a non-association protection prisoner since his arrest on 6 September 2012. His classification had been determined by prison authorities who had received advice that he was in danger because the family of the deceased were associated with the Lone Wolves Outlaw Motorcycle gang.

32Mr Robertson told Dr Nielssen that a person named Jamie McAndrew had asked him to drive Mr McAndrew to a certain location so that he could speak to Gary Burnes [the father of the deceased], who Mr Robertson had been told had kidnapped a friend and had stolen some money. Mr Robertson understood that there would or could therefore be a confrontation. Mr Robertson told Dr Nielssen that Mr McAndrew ""went there to have words with him...it was 8.30 in the morning...I just stayed in the car.""

33Mr Robertson told Dr Nielssen that he did not know that a person had been killed until that evening. He said that ""when they [sic] came out of the shed where the offence took place, they [sic] were 'cool as a cucumber', and there were no signs that any violence had taken place."" Mr Robertson told Dr Nielssen that he only discovered what had actually happened after reading the brief of evidence.

34Mr Robertson did not report any notable or relevant medical history of physical or psychiatric illness. He grew up in Maroubra and attended Daceyville Public School and South Sydney High School. He left school in Year 9 to start an apprenticeship as a spray painter, but would have preferred to pursue a career as a professional footballer.

35Mr Robertson married for the first time at the age of 22 to a policewoman, but they separated in 1995 after five years and had no children. After the separation, he moved to England where he lived and worked for four years. Upon his return to Australia he worked as a security guard at the Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club. He also worked in a houseboat hire business.

36Mr Robertson met his second wife in 1998 and they have three sons. He maintains regular contact with his wife and children.

37Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr Robertson with a substance abuse disorder that was in remission and an anxiety disorder (PTSD) apparently related to an assault in 2011. Mr Robertson was reactive in his emotional responses and did not appear to be pervasively depressed. There were no odd usages or abnormal speech patterns suggesting any underlying psychotic illness or brain injury. Mr Robertson was found by Dr Nielssen to be alert with intelligence in the normal range. There were no historically based or other indications of future dangerousness.

38Mr Robertson has only one prior conviction, for rebirthing motor vehicles. He has no convictions for matters involving violence.

Mitigating factors

39In my opinion, Mr Robertson is unlikely to reoffend and has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. This is because he has no history of violence, his historical drug use does not ever appear to have been chronic or entrenched and he appears otherwise to have good family and community support.

Aggravating circumstances

40The offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence. Even though the offence also involved the actual use of a weapon, there is no evidence to suggest that Mr Robertson was aware of this and so this factor does not aggravate his offence. The offence was also part of an organised criminal activity.

Objective seriousness

41Mr Robertson was part of a joint criminal enterprise to assault someone who turned out to be the deceased. As already noted, there is no evidence that Mr Robertson was aware that his accomplice Mr McArthur was armed with a knife or indeed with any weapon at all, or that he contemplated that Mr McArthur would attack another person with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm upon that person. His account of what occurred given to Dr Nielssen is, however, somewhat difficult to reconcile with what is otherwise agreed or established. For example, Mr Robertson spoke of driving ""Mr McAndrew"" to the location to collect a debt and so forth. Mr McAndrew has never been identified as a person present when the offence took place. Secondly, Mr Robertson speaks in terms suggesting that more than one person returned to the car following the assault upon the deceased, when only Mr McArthur did so. Mr Robertson did not give evidence and these unexplained inconsistencies remain unexplained.

42Mr Robertson's role was one that kept him removed from the commission of the actual violence that led to the death of the deceased and otherwise passively unconnected to Mr McArthur's lethal actions. His liability for the death of the deceased is, to that extent, generated in circumstances where he was not immediately present when the death occurred and where he did not see what happened or participate in the performance of actions that directly caused or contributed to the death of the deceased. He was, however, acutely aware that Mr McArthur was proposing to inflict some kind of violent assault upon a person within the workshop premises of HB Automotive and he actively participated in and facilitated the execution of that disastrous plan. It is trite to observe that, but for the active assistance given by Mr Robertson in transporting Mr McArthur to Sydney, and delivering him to the Minchinbury premises, the senseless and tragic death of a young man most certainly would not have occurred. Mr Robertson's liability and criminal responsibility for the death of the deceased must necessarily be considered and assessed having regard to these circumstances.

43The death of the deceased is a definitively serious matter, and the offence of manslaughter is an unquestionably serious offence. The range of circumstances that are capable of establishing the offence of manslaughter is, however, wide and effectively unconstrained. For present purposes, I am only concerned to place the offence committed by Mr Robertson in some meaningful comparative context by reference to its objective seriousness. It seems to me that Mr Robertson's offence falls at about the mid-range of objective seriousness for offences of this type.

Deterrence

44Having regard to Mr Robertson's prospects of rehabilitation, and to the insignificant likelihood that he will offend again, there seems to me to be little need to factor into his sentence any notable element of special deterrence.

45I consider that a quite different view needs to be taken concerning general deterrence. The particular circumstances of this case indicate that Mr Robertson was given or took a measured approach to his involvement in the events that caused the death of the deceased. The offence did not occur in the heat of the moment, or in a rush of passion or revenge, or in response to a direct personal attack upon him or where he had otherwise little time to reflect upon or to consider his actions. Indeed, quite the opposite is true. Whatever might be said about the utility or wisdom of general deterrence in those circumstances, such criticisms are less relevant where the offence in question is the product of a calm and considered, albeit entirely misguided, approach.

46It is entirely inimical to life in a civilised society for any member of the community to assume to himself or herself the role of a violent enforcer or settler of scores. A measured and considered decision to rough someone up or to teach them a lesson, or whatever other insidiously euphemistic description one chooses to adopt for such conduct, is obviously entirely unacceptable. Even the slightest consideration by any right thinking and reasonable person would make that clear. I am entirely satisfied that Mr Robertson was aware that what he proposed to do was dangerous and criminal. He made a conscious decision to proceed with the plan notwithstanding. To the extent that sentences for violent crimes are capable of educating and deterring similar conduct by others, the sentence that Mr Robertson should serve seems to me to offer considerable scope for general deterrence.

Plea of guilty

47Mr Robertson formally pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the deceased on 8 July 2014. This was what turned out to be the first day of the trial. He had previously offered to do so some weeks beforehand but that offer was not originally accepted by the Crown. It is accepted that the relevant date for sentencing purposes is therefore the date of Mr Robertson's first offer to plead guilty. There is a suggestion that Mr Robertson's plea was the precipitating event for Mr McArthur's plea of guilty to the murder of the deceased. I have no direct evidence of that fact, although it seems to me to be a not unreasonable inference in the particular circumstances of this case.

48There is a considerable utilitarian value to Mr Robertson's plea. I consider that he is entitled to a discount of 15 percent for that plea.

Remorse

49Although Mr Robertson pleaded guilty, and is entitled to be given credit for what that plea says as an admission of his guilt, Mr Robertson did not express any remorse in his interview with Dr Nielssen and did not do so in evidence before me. There is evidence to suggest that he was physically ill when he learnt of the death of the deceased. However, a reaction of that type does not appear to me to have anything to do with remorse as much as it does with Mr Robertson's concern for his own position. 

50There may be forensic reasons why Mr Robertson chose not to subject himself to the prospect of cross-examination, had he chosen to give evidence concerning any feelings that he has concerning the death of the deceased, or his role in the events that led to it, or to express any regret for what he has done or sympathy for the family of the deceased. It is difficult in the circumstances to conclude that Mr Robertson has any feelings of genuine remorse for his role in the death of the deceased. It is not therefore possible for me to take it into account as a relevant matter: see s 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

Special circumstances

51There does not appear to be any material before me upon the basis of which it is appropriate to vary the statutory ratio of parole to non-parole periods. I have considered Mr Robertson's likely custodial conditions separately.

Mr McArthur

Subjective circumstances 

52Mr McArthur was born in September 1975 and is 39 years old. He has a 14 year old son from a former relationship. He is a cabinet maker and builder by trade. Mr McArthur was unemployed at the time of his arrest, last having worked about four years ago. Mr McArthur has been in custody solely referable to this offence since 2 October 2012.

53Mr McArthur tendered two reports prepared by Dr Richard Furst dated respectively 3 March 2014 and 15 August 2014. Dr Furst is a psychiatrist. Mr McArthur reported to Dr Furst that he was born in New Zealand and migrated to Australia as a child. He attended Woy Woy High School to Year 10. He underperformed at school and was suspended on a couple of occasions. There are no indications that he suffers from an intellectual disability.

54Mr McArthur's parents separated when he was very young and he grew up with his mother before moving to live with his father on the Central Coast. He reported regular beatings from a series of stepfathers.

55Mr McArthur fell into drug use, including amphetamines, heroin and methadone from the age of 16 or 17 years. He had previously sniffed glue and smoked cannabis from an early age. Mr McArthur continued to use ""ice"" and amphetamines into his thirties, as well as drinking and using heroin. His drug use was excessive in the year prior to his arrest. He denied any history of serious mental health problems and has never been admitted to a psychiatric facility. He once presented to hospital after taking an overdose of heroin. Dr Furst considered that Mr McArthur had an unstable personality structure. He takes antidepressant medication since being incarcerated. Mr McArthur is hepatitis C positive.

56Mr McArthur told Dr Furst that ""[the offence] should never have happened"". He said that he was sick and using drugs. He said, ""It was the wrong person"". He told Dr Furst that all he did was ""ask if the person was the owner and [the deceased] said 'yes'."" He told Dr Furst that he tripped over and generally gave an account of what occurred that was also given in evidence before me. He told Dr Furst that Mr Robertson asked him to go. He said ""there was no offer of money"" and ""I was there to back him up."" He also said, ""I was hanging out. I wanted to get on. Get some heroin."" Had been drinking and using ice.

57Mr McArthur expressed remorse to Dr Furst. He said, ""I've ruined so many lives. I should be dead myself. I feel terrible. I only agreed to go because I needed drugs and that. I wasn't living anywhere. I was just backing [Mr Robertson] up."" He also told Dr Furst that ""[the deceased] was only 15"". He said, ""I can't imagine how his family feels. Their son was taken away from them for no reason at all.""

58Mr McArthur also added that, ""It all feels like a dream."" He said that he did not understand why it had happened or why he even went there. He said, ""I was that messed up.""

59Mr McArthur told Dr Furst that he has had no contact with his family and no visits while in gaol. He has been threatened and expects to be killed in custody because of the deceased's father's connections with a motor cycle gang. He holds these fears despite the fact that he is in protective custody.

60Dr Furst did not observe any indications of severe depression, mania or psychosis. Mr McArthur was not suicidal or threatening. His thought form was organised and his attention span was good. He concluded that Mr McArthur did not appear to suffer from a major mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. However, his anxiety, low mood and insomnia would appear to warrant ongoing prescription of antidepressant medication. Dr Furst considered that Mr McArthur would require community psychiatric follow-up and drug and alcohol counselling with a focus on relapse prevention, together with supervision through the Probation and Parole Service.

61Dr Furst considered that Mr McArthur's risk of reoffending could be reduced if he abstained from drugs of abuse and engaged in psychiatric and psychological treatment programs.

Mitigating factors

62Mr McArthur expressed his remorse both to Dr Furst as well as in the witness box at the sentencing hearing. He said many times that ""it should never have happened"". He said that he did not know why he did what he did. He thought every day about what he had done and was sorry for his actions. He also said this:

""Q. Is it the case that you have a son of a similar age? 
A. Yeah, that's right. I've ruined so many people's lives through stupidness, you know. I want to apologise to the family and that but I, I don't feel I even have the right to even speak, like to insult them by even saying sorry, like. 

I understand why, why threats have been made against me. That's what I deserve, you know. I deserve, I shouldn't be here today. I should be dead, you know. I never had any intentions, never had any intentions for hurting your son or anything like that. I didn't even have any idea at the time. I was messed out, like, on drugs. Those few years leading up to that I hardly ever slept. Just, like I shouldn't even have been walking around."" 

63I think that it is important, in an appropriate case, to recognise and acknowledge the very real difficulty of confronting the relatives of the deceased in a case such as this, with admissions of such terrible conduct. Indeed, it is not uncommon that the victims of a crime most directly affected by what has occurred are themselves emotionally and physically unable to present their own statements to the court without assistance. Mr McArthur chose to offer his apology in a room that was crowded with people who clearly despised him. He said what he had to say in those circumstances.

64Mr McArthur has not had the benefit of a comprehensive education. He clearly was not used to public speaking or to the expression of remorse or quiet emotion. It is, however, a mistake to conflate an infelicity of expression or public humiliation with insincerity. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act makes specific provision with respect to the circumstances in which an offender's remorse can be treated as a mitigating factor. I am satisfied that Mr McArthur has expressed remorse that can be used in that way.

Aggravating circumstances

65The offence involved both the use of violence and a weapon. The offence was also part of a planned criminal activity. It is unclear whether or not the offence was committed for financial gain. While some evidence suggests that Mr McArthur expected to receive payment in the form of drugs, the evidence about this is wholly unsatisfactory. It does not permit me to conclude that the relevant aggravating factor applies in this case.

Objective seriousness and intention - factual findings

66It is at the centre of Mr McArthur's plea in this case that he was neither armed with a knife when he entered the deceased's workshop premises nor that he went there with the intention of killing anyone. I note in that last respect that Mr McArthur concedes that he went to the premises with the intention of confronting the owner of the business, and that he had been told or assumed that the owner was the father of the deceased. Accordingly, any intention that he may have had when he entered the premises is to a certain extent informed by that fact. However that may be, the important intention for present purposes is that which Mr McArthur had at the time when he committed the act or acts that caused the death of the deceased.

67Mr McArthur killed the deceased by stabbing him. Photographs tendered in these proceedings clearly depict a wound in the deceased's left upper anterior chest. It is tempting to conclude from the size and shape of that wound that it was caused by the blade of a knife. There are two reasons why that conclusion cannot be based upon the photograph. First, Dr Orde was himself unable to say so, armed as he is with specialized knowledge in the field. Secondly, it is not open to me to form my own opinions and conclusions from photographs without the benefit of expert guidance in what the photographs depict. I am able to conclude that the deceased sustained a penetrating wound to his chest, but I cannot by simply viewing the same photographs ascertain the precise nature of the object that caused it.

68The deceased sustained other injuries. Mr McArthur accepted that they were inflicted by him. He said:

""I don't know how he got that. Like obviously I've done it, but it was when I was trying to get away and I've slashed at his leg and he didn't move.""

69Dr Orde opined that the scraping-type injuries to the deceased's leg could have been caused by a knife with a serrated blade. There is no evidence or other suggestion that Mr McArthur armed himself at any time with more than one weapon or implement. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the implement or weapon that caused the injuries to the deceased's leg is the same implement or weapon that caused the fatal penetrating wound to his chest.

70Mr McArthur's description of the item has been referred to already. It was notably general and entirely lacking in detail. He also gave this evidence about it:

""Q. There seems to be two wounds to the bottom of his right foot. Do you see that? 
A. Yeah. 

Q. I suggest you were using a knife to do that. What do you say about that? 
A. No, I don't know. 

Q. Could you have been using a knife? 
A. No. 

Q. Why do you say that? 
A. I might have been, I don't know, whatever I picked up. I thought it was a piece of metal, just jagged metal.""

71Mr McArthur gave other evidence about this as well:

""Q. So I suggest that under those circumstances you consciously took your knife in with you. What do you say? 
A. No, not at all. 

Q. Definitely not? 
A. No. 

Q. You don't know what you held in your hand? 
A. Yeah. It was like a piece of metal like a handle thing on it. 

Q. Like what?
A. I don't know, it had something. I don't know, I just chucked it when we left.""

72Mr McArthur gave evidence that he still had possession of the weapon when he returned to the car to re-join Mr Robertson. That is clear from the fact that he said he disposed of it by throwing the implement out of the car somewhere along the highway. Allowing for the fact that Mr McArthur is likely to have been in an agitated state at the time, he appears to have had, on his own account, the presence of mind to dispose of something that was likely to inculpate him in some way if he retained it in his possession. It is curious at least, in those circumstances, that Mr McArthur is unable to provide a considerably more detailed description of precisely what he used to kill the deceased.

73I listened very carefully to Mr McArthur's description of what occurred. He repeated the version of events that had him tripping over and falling into or upon the deceased. He said that he ""freaked out."" It was in the course of the struggle, as described by him, that Mr McArthur reached for and somehow acquired the mysterious item that he then used to injure and ultimately kill the deceased.

74I reject this version of what happened. One of the significant features of the incident is that Mr McArthur went alone in search of the owner of the business. Whether or not that was the original plan, or whether Mr Robertson was supposed to accompany him as ""back up"" is now beside the point. Mr McArthur went into premises unaccompanied to assault someone with whom he was unfamiliar. That is clear from the fact that, on his own account, he asked the deceased if he was the owner. Mr McArthur clearly had no idea of the size or characteristics of the person he was there to confront. Mr McArthur was himself slight. I do not accept that Mr McArthur went into the premises unarmed in those circumstances.

75The particular nature of the wounds inflicted upon the deceased also gives some guidance on the issue of what may have been used by Mr McArthur to cause them. I think that it is important to record precisely what Dr Orde had to say about these wounds in his autopsy report:

""Around the posterior and lateral aspects of the distal right lower leg there was a collection of complex sharp force injuries extending from between 130 and 200 mm above the heel, and extending from the dorsomedial aspect of the anterolateral aspect of the circumference.

Posteriorly these injuries comprised two broad transverse bands of obliquely aligned, from 11-5 o'clock, discontinuous linear superficial incised defects consistent with having been caused by a serrated edge or similar. There was a zone of discontinuity measuring some 19 mm in width between the two bands of injury. The superior posterior band of these oblique incised defects measured 9 mm in width, and the inferior posterior band measured predominantly 45 mm in width, though on the dorsomedial aspect of the leg one of the oblique incised defects was seen to extend over 78 mm in length. The approximate interval repeat distance between these probable serrated marks varied between 3 and 5 mm in width.

To the lateral aspect of the lower leg, in line with the previously described bands of injuries, there were two essentially transversely aligned fairly deep gaping somewhat irregular incised defects. Fat and muscle tissue and focally tendinous tissue was present at the depths of these defects, though the tendons appeared essentially intact, with the anterior part of the main lateral tendon passing posterior to the lateral malleolus (peroneus longus) having been only focally cut through its anterior part, up to 2 mm in depth. The adjacent deep muscle tissue was also focally incised at this point.""

76I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McArthur armed himself with a knife that had a serrated blade. I have reached that conclusion in light of the fact that the uniform scraping wounds on the deceased's leg are consistent with the use of a knife with a serrated blade and not otherwise consistent with or explained in any way by Mr McArthur's own description of what he used to cause them. The deep slicing wounds on the deceased's legs appear to me necessarily to have been caused by a sharp implement, and do not sit easily with Mr McArthur's somewhat anodyne and limited description of ""a piece of metal"". 

77I am unable to determine whether or not the deep wound to the deceased's scalp says anything at all about whether or not Mr McArthur was armed with a knife. Dr Orde described it as ""a deep laceration... with a forked anterior end"" with ""unequivocal tissue bridging across at least part of the wound."" It would not appear that this injury was caused by the implement that caused the death of the deceased.

78It will be apparent that my finding that Mr McArthur was armed with a knife that he brought to the premises does not also automatically dispose of the question of his intention at the time he killed the deceased. Having entered the premises alone, it is conceivable that Mr McArthur took the knife for his own protection and nothing else. I do not, however, consider that that is a proper analysis of why he was so armed. Having concluded that Mr McArthur used his own knife in carrying out his attack upon the deceased, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he used it at least with the intention of inflicting really serious injury. The extent and location of the chest wound is inconsistent with any other conclusion.

79I am unable to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McArthur attacked and wounded the deceased with the intention of killing him. I accept immediately that the relatives of the deceased may feel that the fact that death resulted from the wound that was inflicted itself generates such a finding as a matter of common sense. It does not. The evidence does not support the existence of a plan to journey to the premises in order to kill the deceased. For example, there is no independent electronic surveillance material or recovered telephone product that assists in this regard. Nor is there any later material, either by way of formal admissions or secretly recorded conversations that point to such a conclusion. Any such finding must be made beyond reasonable doubt. Mere suspicion is not enough. I am however satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr McArthur stabbed the deceased with the intention of causing him to sustain really serious injury.

80I have on several occasions referred in the past to the significance of such a finding in any event. In my opinion there is, or ought to be, little difference for sentencing purposes. The crime of murder is committed in circumstances both where the intention was to kill as well as where it was limited to an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. Mr McArthur has pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased. 

81Mr McArthur has correctly said on a number of occasions that this death should never have happened. The plan to attack the deceased, and the carrying out of that plan, were both senseless acts of vicious and tragic stupidity with terrible and permanent consequences. The deceased was young and blameless. He was innocently going about the ordinary business of his working day. He had no grievance with his attacker and his attacker had none with him. The deceased was unarmed and unsuspecting. The suggestion that the deceased was assaulted by mistake for his father cannot be easy for his surviving family to accept.

82I consider that this is an objectively serious case of the crime of murder. In my opinion it falls to be determined as a crime somewhere above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for crimes of this type.

Deterrence

83The same general considerations apply in this context with respect to Mr McArthur as apply in the case concerning Mr Robertson. This was an offence planned at a temporal and physical remove from the crime. It was neither spontaneous nor reactive. It amounted to a considered, albeit ill considered, plan to perpetrate a violent assault. Such conduct must be unequivocally and emphatically denounced and deterred. To the extent that the sentence that I impose upon Mr McArthur is capable of having that general effect, it should be structured to do so.

84There is in my opinion no present requirement for special deterrence over and above the need to punish and denounce Mr McArthur for his crime. In this respect I note that I am mindful of the terms of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I intend to give effect to them in sentencing Mr McArthur. However, Mr McArthur's prospects of reoffending are likely to be a function of his age at the time of his release to parole and correspondingly diminished for related and obvious reasons. 

Plea of guilty

85Mr McArthur pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial. The plea is therefore of limited utility. However, I acknowledge that the trial was listed with an estimate of approximately four to five weeks. The community has therefore been saved the expense of a trial and the several witnesses have been spared the ordeal or inconvenience of attending court and giving evidence. I consider that Mr McArthur is entitled to a discount of ten percent for the utilitarian value of his plea.

Special circumstances

86Based upon the findings and recommendations of Dr Furst, I consider that Mr McArthur is likely to require considerable supervision and assistance in the community upon his release. Having regard to the likely length of his parole period, however, there do not appear to be any indications for adjusting the statutory ratio to any significant extent. I have also considered Mr McArthur's likely custodial conditions separately.

Custodial conditions

87Both offenders contended that they were entitled to favourable consideration upon the basis that they had been and were likely to remain incarcerated in some form of isolation or protection and that their time in custody was likely to be more onerous than otherwise would be the case if their sentences were served as members of the general prison population. Mr McArthur gave evidence about this and Mr Robertson made submissions without evidence. In the events that have occurred, these contentions are controversial.

88The sentencing proceedings were reopened on 13 October 2014 in order for further evidence to be received. The Crown relied upon an affidavit sworn by Melanie O'Connell on 24 September 2014 that was read without objection. Ms O'Connell was not cross-examined. In addition, the Crown called Michael Hovey, a senior officer in Corrective Services New South Wales. His statement dated 7 October 2014 was also tendered. Mr McArthur read an affidavit of Daniel Pace sworn 10 October 2014. That affidavit was read without objection and Mr Pace was not cross-examined. This evidence now establishes the following.

89Section 11 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999 authorises the Commissioner or a General Manager or delegate to direct that an inmate be held in protective custody if he or she is of the opinion that the association of the inmate with other inmates constitutes, or is likely to constitute, a threat to the personal safety of the inmate. Section 11(3) of that Act authorises the General Manager or delegate of a correctional centre to place an inmate in protective custody at the written request of the inmate. The General Manager or delegate must revoke the protective custody direction if requested by the inmate.

90Special Management Area Protection, or SMAP, is a location or area within a correctional centre where a protective custody inmate is housed following an assessment of his or her individual circumstances. Such decisions are usually made as part of the reception process, following a change in circumstances or following receipt of a written application from the inmate. A special management area can only be created with the direct approval of the Assistant Commissioner, and where the inmates remain able to associate freely and have access to programs and services similar to normal discipline inmates at that centre.

91There are also other locations or areas within a correctional centre that can be utilised to accommodate protective custody inmates. Some of the inmates in these areas are known as Protection, Limited Association inmates or PRLA. The main difference between SMAP and PRLA inmates is that the latter have association issues with other normal protection inmates, which limits the number of people with whom they can freely associate.

92The highest level of protection available is Protection, Non Association or PRNA. These are inmates housed in single accommodation cells who otherwise cannot be accommodated in SMAP or PRLA areas. The placement of an inmate in a non-association cell is not considered automatic and such decisions are only made following a full assessment of all the factors pertaining to the inmate's circumstances.

93Mr Hovey indicated that Mr McArthur came into custody on 9 February 2012 at Wyong Court cells, on a matter unrelated to his current charge. Later that same day, he was transferred to the MRRC at Silverwater, where he was initially placed in ""D"" Block. On 10 February 2012, he was moved to ""G"" Block, in Pod 14 where he remained until his transfer to Bathurst Correctional Centre on 20 February 2012. Mr McArthur remained in general discipline until 8 August 2012 when increased media coverage relating to his current matter led to a determination that he should be placed on a PRNA order.

94On 9 October 2012, Mr McArthur's protection status was downgraded to SMAP. He remained a SMAP inmate housed at Goulburn Correctional Centre until 27 April 2013, when he transferred to Cessnock Correctional Centre and was placed on a self-initiated PRNA order for 12 days until 8 May 2013. This was due to the fact that Mr McArthur was giving evidence against an inmate held as a SMAP at Cessnock Correctional Centre. Whilst he was held at Goulburn Correctional Centre, Mr McArthur associated with an average of 56 other inmates, which is comparable to general discipline housing units at that centre. On 8 May 2013, Mr McArthur reverted to SMAP status, where he has remained. He is currently housed in F7 Pod at the MRRC, associating with 63 other inmates, which is comparable to general discipline housing units at that centre.

95Mr Robertson came into custody on 6 September 2012 at Sutherland Court cells and later that same day was transferred to the MRRC at Silverwater, where he was placed in ""D"" block. Mr Robertson has only ever been housed at the MRRC or Goulburn Correctional Centre. He is currently held as a SMAP inmate at Goulburn, where he is employed as a wing ""sweeper"". Mr Robertson has spent just under half of his current incarceration on PRNA, all at his own request. Mr Robertson signed off PRNA to be housed in the SMAP at Goulburn Correctional Centre.

96It appears that as a result of the deceased's father's membership of the Lone Wolves Motorcycle Club, Mr McArthur and Mr Robertson both hold fears for their safety in prison. They have brought these concerns to the attention of the Corrective Services officials. Their respective classifications have from time to time reflected a perceived need to separate them from the general prison population in one or other of the ways explained by Mr Hovey. There is no evidence to suggest that their current SMAP status will not continue for the indefinite future.

97To the extent that there are real or perceived threats to their personal safety arising from the particular identity of the deceased, Mr McArthur and Mr Robertson are the authors of their own destiny. Their position is to be distinguished from an inmate who provides information to police leading to the conviction of an offender whose associates also populate the prison system. By the same token, the public identification of the deceased's father as the alleged source of the threats that Mr McArthur and Mr Robertson have received or suspect must to a considerable and obvious extent ameliorate the likelihood of them materialising. 

98In the case of Mr McArthur I was also provided with two statements made by him to police in relation to another matter. Mr McArthur was a witness to certain events following the death of a woman. He was not criminally concerned with the incident but offered material to police in order to assist them with their investigation. Although the evidence that Mr McArthur was able to provide appeared to be valuable, Mr McArthur was unable or unwilling to reproduce this evidence when ultimately called as a witness at the trial of the offender charged with the woman's death.

99I am informed by Mr Austin of counsel for Mr McArthur that this material assists me in the sense that it shows that Mr McArthur was willing when at liberty in the community to offer assistance to the police but became reluctant to do so once he was incarcerated. He submitted that this was in effect a practical manifestation of Mr McArthur's concern not to be labelled as an informer, or as a person willing to assist the police, having regard to the way in which such people are often treated within the prison system when that information is known. Mr Austin emphasised that Mr McArthur did not actually provide assistance and was not seeking a discount for having done so. The material was prayed in aid of a contention that Mr McArthur was a contributing member of society and accordingly entitled to be considered to have good prospects of resuming such a role following his release. 

100In all of the circumstances I accept that both Mr McArthur and Mr Robertson will for some time at least be classified as SMAP prisoners, thus limiting their movements and associations while in custody. However, to the extent that their access to rehabilitation programs and educational courses is thereby restricted, the effects upon them will not be severe. In the case of Mr Robertson, his employment history and family support in the community suggests that he will require little intensive assistance for reintegration upon his release. In the case of Mr McArthur, he will in my view inevitably be reclassified over the several years of his non-parole period in a way that will expose him to the benefit of rehabilitative programs well before he returns to the community.

Victim impact statements

101Victim impact statements from the deceased's mother and grandmother were read aloud to the Court by a family friend. They spoke in measured terms of their own personal reactions to the death, including the continuing consequences for them and the rest of the family. These people would all appear, quite understandably, to be labouring with the burden of grief in various and personal ways. The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for all of them. Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of his family and the friends who will always remember him. 

102Section 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applies to the present proceedings. That section is relevantly as follows:

""28 When victim impact statements may be received and considered 

(1) If it considers it appropriate to do so, a court may receive and consider a victim impact statement at any time after it convicts, but before it sentences, an offender. 

(2) .... 

(3) If the primary victim has died as a direct result of the offence, a court must receive a victim impact statement given by a family victim and acknowledge its receipt, and may make any comment on it that the court considers appropriate. 

(4) A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community. 

(4A) Subsection (4) does not affect the application of the law of evidence in proceedings relating to sentencing.

(5)...""

103I remain however mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and Bollen v R (1998) 99 A Crim R 510. The conclusions to which I have come, and the sentences that I consider are appropriate, are the conclusions that I would have reached and the sentences that I would have imposed even without the benefit of the very helpful and informative statements to which I have referred.

Conclusions and sentences

104Mr Robertson has been in custody on remand for this offence since 6 September 2013. 

105Although Mr McArthur was arrested for this offence on 6 August 2012, he was then serving a sentence for a previous offence. The non-parole period of that sentence expired on 1 October 2012. Even though his parole for that offence was revoked upon his arrest for the murder of the deceased, he has effectively been in custody solely referable to the current offence since 2 October 2012.

106Darren Stewart Robertson, for the manslaughter of xxx you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 10 years and 8 months commencing on 6 September 2013 and expiring on 5 May 2024 with a non-parole period of 8 years expiring on 5 September 2021.

107Darren James McArthur, for the murder of xxx, you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 25 years and 2 months commencing on 2 October 2012 and expiring on 1 December 2037 with a non-parole period of 18 years and 10 months expiring on 1 August 2031.

2704372,Hasapis v R [2014] NSWCCA 216,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  Based on my independent assessment of the evidence at the trial I agree that, for the reasons given by Fullerton J, the appeal should be dismissed.
2FULLERTON J:  On 2 November 2012 the appellant was convicted after trial of one count of robbery in company laid contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The indictment named the appellant's stepbrother, Michael El Soussi, and BW, a friend of his aged 13, as the people with whom he was in company when the complainant (Arvind Teluchina-Appadu) was robbed of his mobile telephone whilst he was waiting at a bus shelter in Ermington at approximately 10.45pm on 1 July 2011.  
3On 26 April 2013 the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 18 months which was suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
4The appellant challenges his conviction under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the sole ground that the verdict is unreasonable having regard to the nature and quality of the evidence.  
5There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.
6The principles to be applied in determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act are well settled and can be shortly stated.  This Court is obliged to make an independent assessment of the evidence led at trial, both as to its efficacy and its quality, in order to determine whether, notwithstanding the fact that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, that it would nonetheless be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand (see M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487; 76 A Crim R 213, MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; 135 A Crim R 361, and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400; 209 A Crim R 433).  
7In Kurdi v R [2011] NSWCCA 179 Bathurst CJ said at [8] that in order to comply with M v The Queen (and the decisions that have subsequently accepted the statements of the Court as authoritative) this Court does not conduct its own trial.  Rather, the Court is required to review the whole of the evidence before the jury for the purpose of determining whether it was open to them to have returned a verdict of guilty, that is, whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant's guilt has been proved or whether they ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to guilt.  The evidence led at trial is not viewed piecemeal but in its totality.  This involves an assessment of the direct evidence and the inferences that can be legitimately drawn from that evidence.  As the High Court emphasised in M v The Queen, a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be in most cases a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced, subject only to those cases where it can be confidently said that the advantage a jury has in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt an appellate court might have as to guilt.  
8Consistently with M v The Queen, Bathurst CJ also emphasised that it is the jury that is entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and that when this Court is undertaking its independent review of the evidence led at trial under s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, full regard must be afforded the fact that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the evidence. 
9The appellant's trial extended over three days.  It was the Crown case that the appellant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with his stepbrother to rob the complainant, an agreement which, on the Crown case, was capable of being inferred from the circumstances in which the robbery took place and the appellant's participation in it. 
10The complainant was the principal witness in the Crown case.  The jury were given a direction in accordance with R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12; 30 A Crim R 315 that they should exercise caution when assessing his evidence in order to satisfy themselves that they could safely act upon it before returning a verdict of guilty.  The jury were also invited to consider whether there was other evidence in the case which supported the complainant's account.  In that regard, the Crown relied upon photographs of the scene and CCTV footage of the appellant, his stepbrother and BW earlier in the evening at a bus interchange depot.  The Court was provided with the CCTV footage on the appeal.  
11The complainant's evidence can be summarised as follows.  He described the assailants as comprising a group of three ""guys"" (consisting of two adults and a child) who approached where he was seated at a bus stop.  He said the child was aged between 12 and 14 and around 40kg in weight and 150cm in height.  He said he was wearing a pale cream jumper (the CCTV footage showed BW to be wearing a light green jumper).  He said that the child was the first of the three to interact with him.  He said that the child blew smoke into his face and insisted on being given a ""high five"".  He said the boy attempted to grab his mobile telephone but that he stood up, put the telephone in his pocket and said he was going to call the police.  He said it was at that time that the man with the black jumper approached him and aggressively demanded that he hand over his telephone.  The complainant walked away but the man came after him and punched him to the face.  After the delivery of a second punch the complainant tried to get his telephone out of his pocket to give it to the man.  He said he was then grabbed from behind with an arm and an elbow hooked around his neck.  He said that he then threw the mobile telephone to the man who was standing in front of him.  He said his neck-hold was then released and the men ran away. 
12Aside from his insistence that ""the boy"" (BW) was not involved in the robbery (in the sense that he did not strike him from the front and did not grab him from the rear) he also described the two older males as similar in appearance, to the extent that he thought they might be brothers.  He said one of the adults was wearing a black jumper and cream track pants.  He said that person was 1.72m tall (referable to his own height), medium to well built, about 85kg in weight.  He said this person appeared to be 16 to 17 years of age.  He thought the person was either wearing a black beanie or had black hair.  The complainant said it was this person who punched him twice while aggressively demanding that he surrender his mobile telephone.  He said he did not pay very much attention to the other older male but when he saw all three running away that person was wearing the same clothes as the man who he described as wearing the black jumper. 
13In his evidence in chief, when asked what the person behind him did as the other man punched him, he gave the following evidence:
Q.  What did this person do, if anything, after putting his arm around your neck?A.  He didn't hit me, he just hold my neck so that I gave the mobile to the other guy, but I threw the mobile.
Q.  You threw the mobile.A.  Yes.
Q.  Now you said this was the third guy who did this, did you actually see the person who put their arm around you from behind?A.  No, because he came from behind.
Q.  So why do you say it was the third person who did it?A.  Yeah, because the child was in front of me and the child was short, so obviously he cannot hold my neck.
Q.  He couldn't reach, is that what you're saying?A.  Yeah.[Emphasis added.]
14The complainant said that whilst he was dazed as a result of being punched he was not disoriented.  He rejected the suggestion put to him in cross-examination that he reeled backwards as a result of the punch delivered by the person in front of him.  He insisted that he maintained an upright stance.  He also rejected the proposition that he bent forward as a result of being punched.   
15The complainant was recalled for further cross-examination by leave.  He was taken by counsel to his police statement given within a couple of hours of the robbery.  He confirmed when speaking to police that he chose his words carefully and that he took his time in recounting to police what had occurred.  
16He was then taken to the following passage in his statement and asked questions about it:
Q.  Now at paragraph 15 of that statement I'll just read what it says - you noted this in your statement:""As I pulled my mobile out the other male came from behind and stretched out his whole arm around my neck and pulled me straight backwards towards him.  I did not actually see this male though but I knew it was the third male as the kid was too short and the male with the black jumper was still in front of me"".That's what you relayed to the police.A.Yes.
Q.  A couple of hours after the incident took place.A.  Yes.
Q.  Now what I'm suggesting is that you assumed it was not the kid because to your mind he was too short to pull you from behind.A.  Yes.
Q.  It's not the case that you actually saw the kid.A.  No, I didn't see the kid.
17The effect of the cross-examination was to confirm that the complainant did not see BW in front of him (contrary to his evidence in chief), and that he was merely assuming that it was not BW who grabbed him from behind because of the sense he had of the height of the person that did grab him.  In my assessment, the overwhelming effect of the complainant's evidence was to inculpate the appellant as the person who was behind him at the point of the robbery, given the appellant's height relative to BW's (as confirmed by the CCTV footage), and the complainant's evidence that he did not lose his balance or lean forward as a result of the punch to his face. 
18The CCTV footage is relevant in three ways:(1)It shows the appellant as part of a cohesive group of three over a number of hours before the robbery.  
(2)It shows the clothing of each and, significantly, the similarity in the clothing of the appellant and his stepbrother.  The appellant was wearing a black hoodie and distinctive cream-coloured cargo style pants extending well below the knee which had a black stripe running down both sides while his stepbrother was wearing black track pants.  BW was wearing a green jumper and jeans.
(3)Of critical significance is that the footage shows that the appellant and his stepbrother are of similar height, with the appellant of a more solid build.  They are both clearly adolescents.  In contrast BW, aged 13, is of the height and general body proportions of a young boy.  He appears to be about chest height to the appellant.  In one segment BW stands in front of the appellant and reaches up, putting his hand on the appellant's shoulder and, standing on his tip toes, appears to swipe at the appellant's face. 
19The appellant did not give evidence.  He did participate in a record of interview with police upon his arrest in which he admitted being in the company of his stepbrother and BW and in the immediate proximity of the complainant when he was robbed but denied participating in the robbery. 
20The applicant told police in the ERISP that on the early evening of 1 July his stepbrother, in company with BW, collected him from his home in Epping.  (Later in the interview he agreed that BW looked like an 8 or 10-year-old boy.)  They travelled first to Parramatta, then on to West Ryde where they purchased food from McDonalds on Victoria Road.  He said they then sat at a nearby bus stop where there was an Indian man who was seated alone.  He said his stepbrother sat next to the man and that BW was standing in front of him ""in his face half the time"".  He said BW started ""acting like a smartarse to the guy"", asking for the time, talking to him and pretending to take his telephone.  The appellant said he did not sit down but paced backwards and forwards near the bus stop sign.  On the third occasion that BW tried to grab the man's telephone, the man slapped him lightly on the face with an open hand at which point his stepbrother jumped up and demanded the man's telephone, hitting him with a closed fist to the jaw.  He said whilst this was happening BW was standing three or five steps away from the man, watching and laughing.  The appellant said that he was 8 or 9 metres away from the confrontation.  He said after the man was punched he threw his telephone to the ground, his stepbrother picked it up and they all ran off.  The appellant said the entire incident was over within 10 to 20 seconds.  He told police that the man appeared to be stunned after he was punched.  
21The police read some parts of the complainant's statement to the appellant for his comments.  He agreed that he was the person who the complainant described as wearing the black jumper and cream-coloured track pants and his stepbrother was the man the complainant described as wearing the black jumper and the man who demanded his telephone and punched him.  The appellant again asserted that he saw this happen from a distance and that he was not involved in the assault or the robbery which followed.  He denied putting his arm around the complainant's neck and pulling him backwards.  He said that it was BW who jumped up and grabbed the complainant by the neck.  He said he ran off with the other two boys because he wanted to be ""out of there"" after realising what the other boys had done.  
22At the end of the trial, the single issue left for the jury's consideration was whether the Crown could establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant and his stepbrother, as the two older males, who were physically involved in the robbery (with the appellant either punching the complainant to the face and demanding the mobile telephone or grabbing the complainant around the neck with his arm from behind - with the latter being the Crown case as ultimately left to the jury) as distinct from the appellant's stepbrother being the person who punched the complainant and BW who grabbed him from behind.  It was the appellant's case at trial that the Crown had not discharged the onus of proving guilt because it had failed to exclude the reasonable possibility that it was BW who had grabbed the complainant from behind and, accordingly, the reasonable possibility that the appellant, while present, did not participate in the joint criminal enterprise.  It remained his case on the appeal that on an independent review of the evidence this Court would be left with a reasonable doubt as to the identity of the person who grabbed the complainant from behind.  
23I have read the evidence of the complainant with care and given appropriate and deserving weight to the position of the jury in assessing the complainant's demeanour under questioning.  I have also considered the CCTV footage, in particular the relative heights of the appellant and BW.  I am firmly of the view that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's participation in the joint criminal enterprise in the role attributed to him by the Crown or, to put it another way, that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied there was no reasonable possibility that it was BW who grabbed the complainant from behind in the course of the robbery.
24The order I propose is:The appeal against conviction is dismissed.
25HAMILL J:  I agree with Fullerton J.  I agree with her Honour's analysis of the evidence in the case and with her conclusions as to inferences that could properly and safely be drawn from that evidence.  
26I have reviewed the evidence that was before the jury and concluded that it was open to the jury, in the sense discussed in cases such as M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 and SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400, to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.  The material does not leave me with a reasonable doubt in spite of some inconsistencies concerning the descriptions of the assailants given by the complainant and his ability to make relevant observations.  
27The CCTV footage is particularly telling as it shows the vast difference in height and stature of the group of three people who were involved.  It was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was correct when he said that it was not the boy who assaulted him from in front or grabbed him from behind.

2704407,R v Zhang [2014] NSWDC 331,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Could you stand up please Mr Zhang.
	
	
	I return these verdicts in relation to the counts on the indictment. Firstly, in relation to count 1 on the charge alleging that you on 5 August 2013 at Burwood in the State of New South Wales used an offensive weapon namely a 6 millimetre blank fire calibre BBM manufactured a model Olympic 6 blank fire revolver with intent to commit an indictable offence namely intimidation. I find you ‘not guilty’.
	
	
	In the alternative count alleging that you at the same date and place assaulted Constable Peter Driscoll a police officer acting in the execution of his duty, I return the special verdict of ‘not guilty on the ground of mental illness’.
	
	
	In relation to count 3 which alleges at the same date and place you possessed a prohibited pistol particularised in count 1, without being authorised to do so by license or permit. I return a special verdict of ‘not guilty by reason of mental illness’.
	
	
	In relation to count 4 which alleges that you at the same date and place possessed a prohibited pistol which is particularised as set out in counts 1 and 3, which was not registered, I return a special verdict of ‘not guilty on the grounds of mental illness’.
	
	
	Just take a seat sir, I have to give a judgment.
	
	
	I have just read onto the record the counts in the indictment that was presented by the learned Crown Prosecutor last Tuesday. I will not repeat the details of those counts for the purposes of this judgment. I have as is my practice in trials by judge alone already given the verdicts.
	
	
	This was a trial by judge alone pursuant to s 132 Criminal Procedure Act (1986), the relevant election was signed by the accused on 1 October 2014 acknowledging that he had sought and received relevant advice and apparently that election was consented to by a representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions either on that date or on 2 October 2014. The election was filed on 2 October 2014 and any deficiencies in notice or other irregularities were waived by the learned Chief Judge before the trial was allocated to me last Tuesday morning.
	
	
	A trial by judge alone in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act requires the trial judge, not just to state the bare principles of law which are applied and the findings of facts that are made, but also to expose the reasoning process justifying the findings of fact and ultimately the verdict.
	
	
	All principles of law which are relevant and required to be applied and considered should be identified in the judgment including any necessary warnings that the trial judge is required to apply in the assessment of the evidence.
	
	
	In this regard I apply the principles that were set down by the High Court in Fleming v R (1998) 197 CLR 250. In a trial by judge alone even where the issue of mental illness is raised as it is here as a defence, requiring proof by the accused on the balance of probabilities, the prosecution bears the burden of establishing the relevant elements of any particular charge alleged against the accused. That burden or onus rests upon the prosecution throughout the trial, the accused bears no onus of proof in relation to matters concerning proof of the elements of the relevant charge.
	
	
	In considering matters where there are matters on an indictment, where they are charged separately, each count must be considered separately in the context of the burden being upon the prosecution to establish all essential elements or ingredients of the particular charge under consideration.
	
	
	In this particular matter the accused did not give evidence himself, although evidence was adduced by the production of reports from a psychologist and a medical practitioner on his behalf solely directed at the issue of the special verdict sought in respect of some of the counts in the indictment.
	
	
	An accused person, of course, bears no onus of proof except in relation to matters such as the raising of a defence required to be proved by the accused. An accused person cannot be compelled either in court or in particular circumstances out of court to say anything in defence of himself. All persons facing trial by judge and/or judge and jury are entitled to remain silent in court and to put the prosecution to proof in relation to the matters where it bears that burden. 
	
	
	I cannot draw any adverse inference against the accused because he exercised his right to silence. I cannot interpret it in any way as being an acknowledgment on his part as to the accuracy, veracity or strength of the prosecution case, I cannot be tempted to reason that the accused has remained silent because he believes he is guilty. Such reasoning is prohibited I am not permitted to engage in it and I do not.
	
	
	It is not for the tribunal of fact to speculate as to why an accused person has not given evidence and I cannot treat the accused’s election not to give evidence as filling any gaps in the Crown case to seek to exist.
	
	
	In order to establish the relevant elements or ingredients of a particular count under consideration the Crown must prove each and all of essential ingredients or elements beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	So far as the elements of the counts in the indictment are concerned I need only deal with those briefly, given the way the case has been conducted. In relation to count 1, putting aside the particulars as they are not essential elements of what the Crown needs to prove, the Crown must prove, firstly, that the accused used an offensive weapon and secondly that he did so with the intent to commit the indictable offence of intimidation. I pause for a moment to note from the expert evidence that was adduced in the prosecution bundle of material that was tendered and from the way the case was conducted by the defence that the relevant weapon that was ultimately seized from the accused or recovered from him after he threw it to the floor in circumstances I will outline later and particularised in each of the counts in the indictment to which it is referred, that is counts 1, 3 and 4 is relevantly an offensive weapon.
	
	
	With regard to the element of intention to intimidate or particularly commit an indictable offence, to wit intimidation, I note that in the Crimes Act where the offence of intimidation is referred to and in the Crime (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act, 2007 to which the word “intimidation” is referred and defined for the purposes of that Act, there are, it would seem slightly different definitions. As I would understand it the relevant definition of intimidation that I am concerned with is the intimidation defined in the latter Act as set out in the Crown’s written submissions. S 13 of that Act provides that a person “Intimidates another person with the intention of causing the other person to fear physical or mental harm where that person intends ‘cause fear or physical or mental harm, if he or she knows that the conduct is likely to cause fear in the other person’, the prosecution is not required to prove that the person alleged to have been intimidated actually feared physical or mental harm.
	
	
	The word ‘intimidation’ also is further defined in s 7, of that Act where it states that the meaning of ‘intimidation’ includes “Conduct amounting to harassment or molestation of the person”, or “an approach made by the person by any means that causes a person to fear for his or her safety,” or “any conduct that causes a reasonable apprehension of injury to a person or persons with whom a person has a domestic relationship or of violence or damage to any person or property.” The court may have regard to a pattern of behaviour to be satisfied of intimidation having been committed.
	
	
	It is clear that having regard to the character of this matter that parts of that definition obviously have no applicability here bearing in mind the accused had no relevant domestic relationship with the victim or the alleged victim and there is no relevant pattern of violence.
	
	
	With relation to count 2, the alternative count to count 1, the prosecution must prove that the accused acted intentionally or recklessly causing another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence.
	
	
	There are four elements which constitute an assault. They are, firstly, an act by an accused person which intentionally or recklessly causes another person to apprehend immediate and unlawful violence, secondly that such conduct was without the consent of the alleged victim, thirdly that such conduct was intentional or reckless in the sense that the accused realised that the complainant might fear that he or she would then and there be subject to immediate and unlawful violence and none the less went on and took the risk and, fourthly, that such conduct be without lawful excuse.
	
	
	In relation to counts 3 and 4 they each commonly allege against the accused that he possessed a prohibited pistol. ‘Possession’ means in this context that the accused relevantly had intentional control or custody over the pistol. There is absolutely no dispute about the accused being in possession of the prohibited pistol, having regard to both the filmed evidence contained within the CCTV footage and of course the evidence of eye witnesses to relevant events contained within the statements that are tendered.
	
	
	In relation to count 3 the Crown must prove that the accused was not authorised to possess the pistol by license or permit. There is no need to strictly define those words and I point out that within the Crown’s brief of evidence there is relevant certificates produced stating firstly that the pistol was not one for which the accused had any licence or permit that authorised his possession of it and also that the pistol itself was “unregistered”, which is a requirement to be established by the prosecution in relation to count 4 having established the accused’s possession of the relevant firearm.
	
	
	There is in the circumstances of this case, having regard to the way in which the case has been conducted, little else that requires specific direction to myself upon. There are no particular warnings that I am required to give myself, although many of the witnesses are of course professional witnesses in the sense they are police officers so no issue arises as to their credibility in this case. I do not think it is a matter that requires any warning that might ordinarily be given where there is challenge to police evidence, such as set out by the High Court in cases such as McKinney and Judge.
	
	
	With regard to the issue of mental illness as has been pointed out in the submissions of the parties the accused bears the burden of establishing on balance that he was relevantly mentally ill at the time of the alleged commission of the offences. In this regard I note the terms of s 38 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. In essence what the defence must establish in relation to the relevant charge is that the accused was
	


“labouring under such a defective reason from disease of mind as not to know the quality and nature of the act that he was doing, or if he did know it that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.”


	
	This is the classic formulation of the decision of the House of Lords in R v McNaghten from 1843/4. Although the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, hereinafter referred to as “the Act”, does not give a definition of mental illness it is accepted that the McNaghten test is the test applicable to consideration of the operation of s 38. The section itself refers to a person who was mentally ill “so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made.
	
	
	The section also states,
	


“If it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charge but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness”.


	
	Of course the references to “the jury” encompass a reference to a trial by “judge” as provided under the Criminal Procedure Act. 
	
	
	By reference to what I have outlined there is in the elements of the charges with which I am concerned, particularly counts 1 and 2, a requirement by the court to consider, in respect of count 1, the element of intention required to be established by the prosecution. When one is referring to intent or intention one is not talking about a reasonable person or a test that involves any form of objective assessment. One is concerned with an examination of the state of mind of the accused and what the accused himself or herself in the appropriate case desired or wished to achieve or gain by the relevant actions.
	
	
	In this matter there was an “agreed facts on sentence” as it was stated although that would appear to me to be a statement of the relevant purpose of the document, setting out a summary of what is clearly shown in the various statements that have been provided in the bundle to the court.
	
	
	I propose largely to rely upon that agreed “statement” but I need to refer to some additional material that emerges from the bundles of documents produced, having regard to some of the issues that were foreshadowed at the commencement of this trial and have concluded the trial in the submissions of the respective parties. I note amongst the statements prepared and tendered in this court without objection there are three statements from what might be called civilians who were present as is clearly the case from the CCTV footage. I viewed the CCTV footage that is part of the Crown bundle.
	
	
	There are also a number of statements from relevant witnesses including Constable Driscoll, the victim of the accused’s actions, who particularises at paragraphs 8 to 12 specific events at the heart of, particularly the allegations in counts 1 and 2, but also obviously of relevance to counts 3 and 4. There are statements from a number of other constables of police who came upon the scene that is shown in the CCTV footage, almost immediately after the accused had thrown the firearm to the floor. There are the police who were involved in the subduing of the accused, police who conducted an interview with the accused which is part of the tender, the transcript acting as an aide memoir. There are police who attended upon Concord Hospital in relation to requests for an assessment of an alleged mentally ill or mentally disturbed person.
	
	
	There is the statement from the Custody Manager and some records produced by him. There is the opinion expressed by Senior Constable Andretti, concerning his examination of the firearm, his opinion that it is a prohibited pistol in accordance with s 4C Firearm’s Act 1996. There was some evidence concerning a search of the accused’s residence after his apprehension which ultimately revealed the identification of a crystalline substance later assessed to be 0.19 grams of methylamphetamine. There are statements from Dr Russell Cook and Sister Beverley Conlan who treated the accused at Concord Hospital after he had come into custody of police. Certificates from the Commission of Police as I said earlier that the accused was not licensed to possess a pistol or a firearm, nor was the relevant firearm registered as is required.
	
	
	Finally there is the evidence from Dr Bruce Westmore, who had been retained by the defence to assess the accused’s relevant mental state, a report from a psychologist Anna Robilliard and a report in reply to the reports of Ms Robilliard and Dr Westmore prepared by Dr Stephen Allnutt.
	
	
	From this material emerge the following matters. The accused came to the Belmore Police Station on Monday 5 August at 6.14 pm. He entered the police station and walked into the foyer area. There were at that time a number of members of the public present. Police were variously going about their duties assisting those citizens with their inquiries. He paced around the foyer area and was holding in his hand a black “revolver pistol” which is the relevant firearm particularised in counts 1, 3 and 4. He purchased a can of soft drink from a vending machine and variously can be seen in particular positions around the foyer area.
	
	
	At about 6.20 pm Constable Peter Driscoll exited a door directly to the right of where the offender was located. Constable Driscoll was a general duties officer, he was in full police uniform, there could be no mistaking the fact that he was relevantly in the process of that evening going about fulfilling his lawful duties.
	
	
	When Mr Driscoll came through the doorway and entered the foyer area as the CCTV footage makes clear, the accused without warning raised his right hand holding the black revolver by the stock and pointing it directly at the chest area of Constable Driscoll. Constable Driscoll spoke of hearing a clicking sound as the accused was pulling the trigger over and over. I point out as it transpired of course the firearm was not relevantly loaded.
	
	
	Mr Driscoll was standing approximately a metre to the right of the offender and he said in his statement that he felt “ambushed” and “confused” about what was happening. He reached down to his hip where one can see on the film his police issued firearm was located in a holster. He stepped backwards behind the open door and pulled the door almost closed, as he stepped away and out of sight of the accused, the accused still had the revolver held by his hand with his arm out straight and according to Constable Driscoll pulling the trigger. The aiming of the firearm at the direction of the police officer is confirmed by at least one of the civilians present, Young Cha. When Constable Driscoll had his firearm out, as is stated in his statement, he retreated with serious concerns for his safety and the safety of members of public in the foyer. The door was pulled almost closed for a relatively short period of time. I have not counted it on the CCTV clock but it would appear to me to be closed for a period of at least five seconds. The accused when the door was pulled to, threw the gun down on the ground, a matter about which Mr Driscoll might not have been immediately aware.
	
	
	Mr Driscoll in his statement said that he said words to the accused at one point and it is not clear when these were said having viewed the film “Are you serious?” And he said the accused replied “Yeah, yeah”. This account is supported by one of the civilians. The statement of facts suggest that in fact these words were said by Mr Driscoll as he retreated through the door away from the reception area into the secure area of the police station. It must be said the confrontation between the accused and Mr Driscoll where the gun was pointed at him could not have been more than ten seconds and perhaps was shorter. Again I did not take the liberty to time it from the timing device on the close circuit television. Mr Driscoll called out saying words “Gun, guys, gun in the foyer,” obviously alerting his colleagues that there was an armed man in the foyer. By the time he burst back into the public area, very bravely it has to be fairly said, to confront the accused he had thrown the revolver away. Mr Driscoll said he in fact saw the revolver travel through the air and heard the sound of metal contacting or sliding along the tiled floor but again he would have heard and seen this as he was making his way back into the room, he had little time to react.
	
	
	The statement goes on to say that Mr Driscoll and other police officers entered the foyer, the accused was pulled to the ground and I have seen him subdued by the police. One can see Constable Driscoll picking up the relevant firearm from the ground. He was wearing gloves at this time and the firearm was rendered secure although the firearm had empty chambers. As I have earlier said there is clear evidence of the status of the firearm both by reference to its description as a pistol or revolver and also its status as an unregistered firearm for which the accused was unlicensed to possess.
	
	
	The accused was taken into the care of the custody manager and assessed. He made admissions about having smoked methylamphetamine previously that day. He said that he had a small amount at his premises which was confirmed by subsequent police search at his unit at Elsie Street, Burwood. The facts state that the drug was weighed and registered a weight of .56 grams. The certificate says something different. I do not think a great deal turns upon this.
	
	
	The accused gave an electronically recorded interview. I have read the transcript of that and I have tried to view it. I viewed some of it watching the reactions of the accused but could barely hear what was said. But no issues taken by the parties that I cannot hear clearly what the accused or the interviewing officer said.
	
	
	The accused gave an account that is not consistent with the objective facts, but this is a matter really of no moment given other evidence as to his state of mind at the relevant time. He told the police that he had taken possession of the gun with the intention of surrendering it. He said he had no intention of hurting anybody. He said that he had obtained the gun from a friend which I understood lived at Auburn. He smoked an amount of Ice or methylamphetamine after he had taken possession of the gun. He said he walked around the Burwood central business district in possession of the gun, openly showing members of the public. He said that he caught a taxi from Dean Street in Burwood to the police station which is a distance of a mere four hundred metres according to the statement of facts. He said that he had shown the taxi driver the firearm. He said the he knew that the firearm was not loaded. He said that while in the police station he was waiting to be served and he tried to call Triple-0 but he could not get through to the police. Whether that is so or not, I do note that from a film of him that it were one point particularly, shortly before the victim came into the foyer, the accused was either speaking or waiting to speak on his mobile phone. He denied that he intended to threaten the police and he made other statements which reflected some bizarre thinking at the time of the interview.
	
	
	The accused’s mobile phone was accessed with the assistance of the interpreter who was present during the interview. There were bizarre text messages obviously recorded by the accused, amongst other things saying “kill the government”.... “benefit the common people, common civilians”. “You take it along and then kill, kill” and, “No one come, I’m claiming the honour all by myself.”
	
	
	The accused was ultimately conveyed to Concord Hospital for a mental health assessment. It was clear from the character of the interview with the accused, his behaviour in the foyer observed on the CCTV footage the observation of him by the uniformed police officers and the observation of him through the course of the electronic interview, that he was ”mentally disturbed”.
	
	
	The accused was held at the Concord Hospital for a period of some days. In relation to his treatment at the Concord Hospital I have a statement from Dr Cook, he saw the accused on 12 August 2013 having been brought in in the early hours of 6 August 2013. He could not give a coherent account of his behaviour on admission. He had grandiose delusions at that time saying that he was “the leader”. He reported auditory hallucinations and he was thought disordered. He admitted to regular use of methylamphetamine as it is described in the statement. He had a poor insight into his conduct. He improved significantly with medication and discharged back to the police on 12 August.
	
	
	The opinion of Dr Cook was the accused had “psychosis in the context of chronic methylamphetamine use” and it was recommended that he continue to take the medication Olanzapine. I also have a report from Ms Conlan a registered nurse who saw the accused on 12 August. According to her statement she reported he was suffering from “drug induced psychosis”.
	
	
	The accused was seen, firstly as I understand the chronology of events, by Ms Robilliard who took some history of him when she interviewed him on 5 February 2014. I note the various histories the accused has given which I need not read onto the record. He had only a scattered recollection of events surrounding his initial treatment. His account of how he came into possession of the gun and why he would take it to the police station made it difficult for the psychologist to identify from his account any particular motivation. She formed an opinion that the matter needed to be progressed by Justice Health records, being assessed given his history of drug use. She thought that much of what he said during their interview seemed “delusional” but he did not present in a condition that suggested he was substance affected. She thought there might be a dual aetiology of mental illness and substance dependence.
	
	
	That led to the accused being seen by Dr Bruce Westmore a respected forensic psychiatrist retained by both the Crown and the defence from time to time, over the last 30 years from my experience. The accused was seen by Dr Westmore on 9 March 2014. He took, as I said in relation to the psychologist, a history. He noted on presentation that the accused was neat and tidy, pleasant and cooperative, maintained good eye contact, spoke mainly in response to questions and then reasonably expansively, his mood and affect were both intense and restricted, but generally appropriate and he could demonstrate some limited “smiling behaviour”. He did not have a major depressive disorder and he denied having any type of psychotic symptoms at the time of interview.
	
	
	He went through the available records available to him including records of the accused reporting on 6 August that he believe that there was a government conspiracy against him because he believed his “friend is the lead of it all”. He verbalised delusional ideation on 6 August 2013.
	
	
	A medical assessment completed by a Psychiatric Registrar on that date offered the view that he probably suffered a drug induced psychosis and a further assessment of him on 8 August 2013 diagnosed him as suffering from a “amphetamine psychosis (schizophreniform)”. Another assessment was made by another psychiatrist on that date coming to the same conclusion. On 8 August the accused was still delusional but not thought disordered. He was diagnosed on 12 August by some other medical practitioner as suffering from a “paranoid psychosis”.
	
	
	There were forms filled in as required under the Mental Health regulation noting that the accused suffered numerous persecutory and grandiose ideas. He needed containment and treatment to prevent harm to others at that point and he was considered under the “Act” as being “currently a mentally ill person”. There are other nursing entries that he took into account.
	
	
	His diagnosis was: “My provisional diagnosis is that Mr Zhang suffered a drug induced psychosis at the time of the offending behaviour that condition currently appears to be in remission”. A secondary Axis 1 diagnosis was “poly-substance abuse (currently in remission)”. He deferred any opinion in relation to his personality and he made other observations about him that I need not concern myself with.
	
	
	Noting all that was available to him he said in his report, in his final opinion of the matter:
	


“Based on this information Mr Zhang was, on the balance of probability, suffering from an acute episode of drug induced psychosis at the time the offending behaviour occurred. His behaviour appears to have been impulsive and to some extent disorganised. While there appears to be some inconsistency in the history that he took the gun into the police station intending to hand it over to the police his reported statements while at the police station appear to be bizarre and reflect his acute drug induced mental illness at that particular time.”


	
	He went on to say:
	


“Mr Zhang could raise a mental illness defence in relation to the matters now before the court doing so on the basis that at the time the incident occurred he was suffering from an acute drug induced drug induced psychotic illness. That illness would have deprived him of the capacity to know his actions were wrong, certainly from a moral perspective and his mental illness would have prevented him from considering his actions in a rational and composed way.”


	
	He said further,
	


“Whilst there does appear to be a transient quality to his psychotic illness, at least in terms of the most acute symptoms it will be essential that Mr Zhang remain in complete sobriety from all illicit drugs as further use of illicit drug is likely to precipitate a further acute psychotic illness in this man.”


	
	Dr Westmore’s report is somewhat silent as to the aetiology of the of the condition the accused presented himself in at the time of his presence at the Burwood Police Station.
	
	
	That issue is addressed in a greater detail by Dr Allnutt who was retained by the Crown and reported by report of 22 May 2014, he goes through matters of history. He notes the accused is fit to be tried. He said so far as his psychiatric diagnosis was concerned:
	


“In my opinion he manifests ongoing symptoms consistent with delusional beliefs of a persecutory and grandiose nature. He believes that there is an ongoing fight in relation to the government involving a person named Jackie who he believes is his adopted father. He continued to believe that cameras were monitoring him. The symptoms appear to have ameliorated somewhat since the alleged offending but persist never the less. In the absence of auditory phenomena and referential ideas a differential diagnosis would include delusional disorder and paranoid schizophrenia along with drug induced psychosis. It is difficult to clarify a diagnosis because methylamphetamines can induce a psychosis that can present in a very similar way to schizophrenia and methylamphetamine - induced psychosis tends to last longer. It remains therefore unclear whether or not he continues to present with a drug induced psychosis or if in fact he has an underlying paranoid schizophrenia. Not-withstanding this the persistence of his psychotic symptoms remains a significant vulnerability.”


	
	Reflecting upon his processes of thought and mental state at the time of the alleged offending he said:
	


“I believe that the defendant would be regarded as suffering ‘a disease of the mind’ at the material time that the alleged offending occurred. That is that he was manifesting active symptoms of a psychosis in the form of persecutory and grandiose delusional beliefs (believing that there was some form of argument or battle between two people that related to the government which involved him but provably also involved testing him to become “the boss of New South Wales”). He was also thought disordered and thus his thinking process was likely disorganised”.


	
	He said it was difficult to provide a complete understanding of his thought processes given the way in which he produced relevant information. He said psychotic symptoms eight months after the alleged offence and the absence of evidence of ongoing substance abuse is suggestive of a persistent rather than a transient mental state and he would regard this as being “a disease of the mind”. He was incapable of reality testing. It was said that his motive was derived from this irrational thought process which resulted in highly unusual behaviour that put himself and others at serious risk of harm.
	
	
	The doctor said:
	


“In my view as a consequence of his “disease of the mind” (thought disorder and delusional belief system) he would have been incapable of reasoning about the matter with a moderate degree of sense or composure about (his) behaviour at the material time having regard to the commonly held standards. While he might have been aware of the illegality of his actions - he knew that he would be arrested and sent to gaol - his moral capacity was compromised by delusional beliefs and irrational reasoning processes.

On this basis I believe he has available to him a defence of mental illness.”


	
	I have been favoured by the learned Crown Prosecutor’s helpful written submissions which address the legal issues arising in respect of the issue of proving the element of intimidation as it is required to be established as being the accused’s intent and his actions in respect of count 1. The Crown’s helpful written submissions also deal with the provisions under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 particularly Part 4, sections 37 to 39, s 38, as I earlier indicated being concerned with the special verdict of mental illness. There are other submissions made in relation to the issue of disposition, the Crown’s oral submissions briefly are that the court would be satisfied at least that the elements in relation to count 2 were made out, but does submit the court could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the elements that are required to be proven in relation to count 1 may be made out. It submits that the elements in relation to counts 3 and 4 are clearly made out. It submits, however, that the defence on balance having regard to the totality of the medical evidence, including the contemporary observations of the accused by both lay people and medically qualified people, has established the defence of mental illness in relation to relevant charges.
	
	
	In respect of the helpful submissions of learned counsel for the accused, his written outline addresses, firstly, the question of whether the Crown has established the appropriate elements to be established in respect of count 1. It notes in the written submissions the description of the demeanour of the accused, including a reference to him “appearing quite blank” as appears in one of the civilian statements, the various bizarre statements made by the accused during his arrest, messages contained within his text message memory on his mobile phone, the opinions of those who saw him on the evening of 5 August and the early morning of 6 August appearing to be “mentally ill” or requiring police to invoke powers under the relevant legislation for dealing with mentally ill people. He relies upon the assessments of Dr Westmore, Dr Allnutt and Ms Robilliard.
	
	
	The defence submits that even if the accused’s onus to establish a relevant defence of mental illness failed, the court would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of count 1, that the accused acted with the relevant intent or with the relevant recklessness required to be established to intimidate or to commit the offence of intimidation in respect of the victim. It also submits that the surrounding circumstances of the offending do no establish the relevant intention that the Crown would be required to establish in relation to that count.
	
	
	I have given very close consideration naturally to the issue of what elements are established by the Crown in respect of the matters requiring proof by it. I can deal with counts 3 and 4 very quickly indeed. It is quite clear that the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt the possession of the prohibited pistol relevantly in each count and that it was relevantly unregistered as required in relation to count 4. I should say that the accused did not have the relevant licence or permit to possess the firearm. In respect of count 1 the features of the matter that I note in relation to the case from all the material available to me is that firstly the accused, as I would understand, it was not known to the complainant. They had had no particular dealings together. Even though the accused was delusional, I note his explanations for taking the firearm to the police station the bizarre conduct of the accused in exposing the firearm in the public area. It is clear that he pointed the firearm at the police officer and I accept the police officer’s evidence of what he said and what the accused said at that time that the complainant was exposed to the presentation of the firearm. I note that the firearm was unloaded. The accused has claimed that he knew that it was unloaded at the relevant time.
	
	
	The period of presentation of the firearm was a matter of some seconds. The accused was pulling the trigger of the firearm giving a clicking noise, it was self-evidently, at least on an objective basis with the wisdom of hindsight I hasten to say, clear that the firearm was unloaded, given the fact that if the accused was in fact pulling the trigger and nothing was happening by way of discharge. I note as soon as the police officer retreated, after a very short period of time of being exposed to the firearm, the accused threw the firearm away and at the time of being subdued was unarmed.
	
	
	Noting what was put by the defence in relation to matters pertinent to his state of mind at that time, his motivation for doing what he claimed he did, his lack of relationship with the victim and noting as I have said earlier what the relevant elements are of proof of guilt of this particular charge, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused on the facts of the case had an intent to commit an indictable offence, namely intimidation by his actions.
	
	
	However, I am satisfied that the accused assaulted the police officer, even making allowance for his claimed motivations, but noting what might be inferred to as relevant to the proof of intent in the charge set out in count 2. From his actions in presenting the firearm and putting the victim in fear of safety, as his retreat itself eloquently establishes, this count is established.
	
	
	There is a fine line between the different offences, it must be fairly said, when one examines the elements of intimidation and the elements of assault. But particularly compelling in the context of what is required to be established beyond reasonable doubt in respect of count 1 is, as I said earlier, the character of the relationship, if it could be called that, of the accused with his victim at the time of his actions occurring over a relatively brief time. Certainly the nexus and time is sufficient to establish the elements required in respect of count 2, but not ultimately in respect of count 1.
	
	
	The having been said on the basis of the totality of the material and primarily the last view of the matter of Dr Allnutt, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defence of mental illness has been made out in respect of the remaining counts the relevant elements of those counts having been established by the Crown. I am satisfied that the accused did not know that what he was doing was wrong. I am satisfied that there was a relevant disease of the mind which produced the relevant defect of reason.
	
	
	The law requires that the accused state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition which may be temporary or of long standing, whether curable or incurable. Such condition may have been caused by some physical deterioration of the brain cells but need not necessarily be so caused. It may arise from some mental malfunction with no apparent organic basis or where the cause of the disease may be unknown, provided in all cases that it results in the function of the reason, memory or understanding being thrown into a state of derangement or disorder. The distinction is to be drawn between a defence of reason from an underlying mental illness, as distinct from a reaction of a healthy mind to some extraordinary, external factor, that is transient, that is passing, and not prone to reoccur. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing that what he was doing was wrong but wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community or because he did not know the physical nature or quality of the act that he was performing. It is the former that has been established on the balance not the latter. Thus in those circumstances I have entered the special verdicts in respect of the three counts that I have identified.
	
	
	I have gone to some length into the material that is available because of the need, in light of the verdicts, for the Mental Health Tribunal to review this matter. It would not have been appropriate for me simply to deal with the medical reports in a cursory nature.

		27 May 2015",2014-10-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704408,R v Crispe (No 4) [2014] NSWDC 211,"Judgment

1Tricia Oi Foong Crispe was charged with a very serious offence. On 29 July 2014. I returned a special verdict that she was not guilty by reason of mental illness of that offence. I gave reasons for that verdict. It was in compliance with s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. I adjourned the proceedings to today and released Ms Crispe into the community subject to conditions, again under s 39 of the same Act.

2Today I need to determine what final orders I make under s 39 of that Act. It provides that I ""may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate."" Importantly, s 39(2) goes on to provide that I am ""not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody"" unless I am satisfied ""on the balance of probabilities, that the safety off the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release.""

3Mr Schaudin, who appears for Ms Crispe, has asked me to make an order releasing his client from custody subject to conditions. Those conditions are contained in a report from a consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst. The report was commissioned after the last adjournment. Dr Furst had given earlier opinions and is familiar with Ms Crispe.

4Dr Furst is a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Long Bay Correctional facility. He saw Ms Crispe on 16 September 2014 and provided a report dated 7 October 2014, which became exhibit 3. Dr Furst was aware of the requirement that I cannot make an order unless I am satisfied about Ms Crispe's safety and any member of the public's safety.

5Dr Furst reviewed Ms Crispe's recent progress including living in stability with her mother and attending a Buddhist temple in Berala daily and engaging in very positive activities. Significantly, Dr Furst made this observation,
""Ms Crispe has not taken any medication since November 2012, opting for supportive therapy and work in the Buddhist temple as an alternative to antidepressant and other psychotropic medications. Although this is unusual for someone with a severe depressive illness, Ms Crispe appears to have benefited and is no longer depressed.""

He noted that she had earlier reported adverse side effects from medications.

6Dr Furst noted that there were problems with respect to compliance with treatment recommendations including Ms Crispe not taking anti-depressant medications in his review of documents from the Auburn Community Health team. Dr Furst confirmed his diagnosis of major depressive disorder adding that there were ""signs her condition is largely in remission"". He also thought that she had ""dependant and obsessional personality traits"".

7Having reviewed Ms Crispe's progress, including her attendance at the temple and engagement with a Community Mental Health team, a lack of previous significant violence apart from the violence which this case is about along with the current support of her mother, Dr Furst concluded ""that neither Ms Crispe nor any member of the community would be seriously endangered by her conditional release."" Dr Furst went on to recommend a treatment plan containing seven components, adding that her treatment in the community should be reviewed on a regular basis by the Mental Health Review Tribunal.

8Dr Furst concluded that Ms Crispe ""has gained considerably through her engagement and attendance on a daily basis"" at the Buddhist temple and went on to express the opinion that ""her risk of reoffending is low and she has a good long term prognosis.""

9There was a report from the Auburn Community Mental Health team dated 4 September 2014. It referred to a community treatment order which had expired on 18 May 2014 ""due to Ms Crispe's refusal to commence anti-depressant medication despite the psychiatrists' recommendation"" but added that she ""appears to have engaged well in maintaining a therapeutic relationship with her care coordinator"" at the Mental Health team.

10The report noted that her care coordinator was on leave. It now appears that she no longer works at the facility. In any event, the report added that ""Ms Crispe has been given contact names and numbers in case she requires support"" over the following period of time.

11Evidently Ms Crispe had been seeing one or two psychiatrists as part of her community treatment order imposed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal on 19 November 2013, although Ms Crispe says not the one, Dr Kuljic, who is named in the order.

12Mr Schaudin says that his client has no difficulty accepting six of the seven conditions in Dr Furst's proposed treatment plan. She still baulks at any requirement to take psychiatric medication. She explained today, partly herself and partly through Mr Schaudin, that she does not trust putting the pharmaceuticals into her body. That is clearly an available point of view and one which may well be consistent with the lifestyle which she has very positively embraced through the Buddhist temple.

13However, the condition proposed by Dr Furst is compliance ""with psychiatric medication as prescribed by her treating psychiatrist"". She appears not to have a treating psychiatrist because the community treatment order has expired. She will be allocated one by the community mental health team. 

14I regard it as important she comply with any requirement of a qualified psychiatrist that she should take medication. She of course may discuss the need for such medication and the effects upon her with such a psychiatrist and may persuade him or her that it is not required. The legislation under which I am required to determine this case today leaves no doubt about the fact I am ""not to make an order under this section"" releasing Ms Crispe unless I am satisfied there will be no serious danger to her safety or the safety of any other members of the public. 

15I have to realistically bear in mind two factors here. One is there has been a history of mental health issues and mental instability with Ms Crispe, obviously at the time of this offence but before then as well. The second factor is that acting with a very compromised mental health condition she stabbed her estranged husband a number of times. That clearly raises the question of the safety of members of the public. 

16If a psychiatrist treating Ms Crispe forms the opinion she must take some medication, then I would regard it as important that she comply with that condition. For those reasons I am going to include Dr Furst's recommendation in a conditional release order. Dr Furst does not direct that she must take medication, only that she complies with any psychiatrist's prescription of medication. 

17Mr Thompson, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, also asks that a condition of her release be that Ms Crispe continues to comply with an apprehended violence order issued against her and for the benefit of her estranged husband and two children. He also proposes a condition that Ms Crispe continue to reside with her mother and she not approach or attempt to approach her estranged husband or either of her children except in compliance with any order made under the Family Law Act 1975. 

18I regard those proposed additional conditions as reasonable; indeed they promote consistency between my orders and orders made by other courts sitting in other jurisdictions. I checked with Mr Schaudin regarding the requirement that she continue to live with her mother and he said that is an acceptable condition. 

19For the reasons I have given I make an order under s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 releasing Ms Crispe from custody subject to the following conditions: 
(1)She remains under the care of the Auburn Community Mental Health Service or such other community mental health service which succeeds that service with a view to ongoing case management. 
(2)She attends appointments with any allocated case manager or delegate on a regular basis, probably fortnightly in the first instance. 
(3)She attends appointments with any allocated treating psychiatrist or delegate on a regular basis, probably second monthly in the first instance. 
(4)She complies with psychiatric medication as prescribed by any treating psychiatrist, possibly a further trial of a suitable antidepressant medication such as Valdoxan (Agomelatine), 25 milligrams orally at night. 
(5)She complies with psychological therapy to deal with her adjustment to the breakdown of her marriage, lack of access to her children and her offending behaviour.
(6)She continues to receive support from the nuns and other mentors at the Lingyen Mountain Temple. 
(7)She engages in social, occupational and vocational rehabilitation as deemed necessary by her case manager, preferably with a view to helping her re-enter the workforce as a music teacher.
(8)She complies with the terms of the apprehended domestic violence order made at the Local Court in Burwood on 13 August 2014.
(9)She continues to live at [home address].
(10)She not approach, attempt to approach or contact Phillip Crispe, Ronan Crispe or Quinton Crispe except in compliance with any order under the Family Law Act 1975.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Schaudin would you just check the names of the children, the spelling, Ronan and Quinton?
SCHAUDIN: Yes.
HIS HONOUR: Mr Schaudin, Mr Thompson, what else do I need to do?
SCHAUDIN: Subsection (3), I don't know if you need to make the order that the Registrar notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal.
20In accordance with s 39(3) of the Act, I direct the Registrar to notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of order.
SCHAUDIN: I don't know if it's necessary but perhaps a copy of Dr Furst's October report could go with your order to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.
HIS HONOUR: Also exhibits 3 and 4. Mr Schaudin's suggested it and I think it's sensible Mr Thompson.
THOMPSON: I agree your Honour, thank you.
21I direct my associate to provide a copy of exhibits 3 and 4 to the Registrar for the Registrar to include copies of those in the Registrar's notification to the Minister for Health and the Tribunal. 
HIS HONOUR: I will give the papers to my associate to put in the Court file.
Ms Crispe, you have heard the orders which I have made, I don't expect you to agree with all of them but you have heard the reasons I have given for making the orders. What I will do is this; my associate will type up the orders over the next half hour. I will impose on Mr Schaudin to come back at an agreed time and he will be given to pass on to you, a copy of the orders and one for Mr Thompson as well. You have heard me read them out; I don't think I need to say any more. Dr Furst is very optimistic about your progress, you are obviously making a very good effort toward your rehabilitation and healing and I congratulate you on that and encourage you to keep going. I have had to make orders in accordance with the law and the public interest about medication and I have given my reasons for having to do that. I am confident you will continue in your very satisfactory progress, so good luck. Mr Schaudin, it's a long list to type out for my associate, so not before 12.15. Thank you both for your assistance in this case, I've been greatly assisted.

		09 December 2014",2014-10-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704416,R v Ballantyne [2014] NSWSC 1381,"Judgment

1R A HULME J: George Robert Ballantyne has pleaded guilty to the murder on 10 March 2013 at Aberglasslyn of Ms Clare Weston.

2Clare Weston was 23 years old. She was an active, happy, outgoing and sporty person. She had two children: a daughter aged 6 and a son aged 4. She had 6 sisters and 4 brothers. Victim impact statements provided by Christine, Robert, Katrina, Tamica and Christopher eloquently describe the loving family from which she was taken and the extreme grief that has been caused by this terrible crime. Again, I extend my sincere condolences to all who knew and loved Ms Weston.

Facts

3There is no dispute about the facts of the crime. 

4The offender and Ms Weston had been in a relationship for about three months. They met when she was down from Queensland visiting her family in Rutherford. A couple of weeks before Christmas 2012 she moved with her two children into the offender's family home at Greta. They became engaged in February. However it was noticed that they argued on a daily basis and on a couple of occasions he was seen to raise his hand towards her, although without striking her.

5The offender has a problem with anger. In January 2008 he was convicted of a number of offences including assault occasioning actual bodily harm that emanated from an incident involving a woman with whom he was then in a relationship. It involved him threatening her with a knife and forcing a pillow down over her face causing her to struggle to breathe. 

6The living arrangement at the offender's family home was temporary. In late February his father told him that he had two weeks to find alternative accommodation. On 8 March they moved to live at Ms Weston's mother's home at Rutherford. The relationship was shaky by this stage. Ms Weston told her stepsister that she was considering leaving him because he was moody and abusive towards her and the children. An incident occurred while they were camping at the foot of the Barrington Tops on Saturday 9 March which resulted in the offender becoming angry with her. He packed up the camp site and they returned to her mother's home.

7The statement of facts recounts a series of conversations and text messages with various people during the evening of 9 March in which both the offender and Ms Weston spoke about the relationship ending. She mentioned that she was concerned about the possibility that she was pregnant. She also said that he was not happy about the fact that she had two children. However, he told a former boyfriend of Ms Weston that he loved the children. He was advised to talk with her and try and resolve their differences. 

8There was a series of text messages exchanged between the offender and Ms Weston between about 11.00pm and 2.00am. Ultimately it was arranged that he would come to her mother's home. He arrived at about 2.20am. She sat in his car and they talked for about an hour. He then drove her to Aberglasslyn, about 20 km away and stopped beside the Hunter River. They continued talking about their relationship and her children. She indicated she wanted to go home. There was a ""scuffle"" outside the car. He later told a friend, Matthew Blackler, that she was trying to get out of the car and he held her with both arms. 

9The offender put Ms Weston over his shoulder and carried her about 200m down to the river. There was another ""scuffle"". He later told Mr Blackler that he killed her by choking her. 

10The body of Ms Weston was found the following morning by a couple who were out walking their dogs. It was almost naked, face down in a pool of water in a shallow indentation between two sandbanks by the side of the river. DNA material consistent with being the offender's was found beneath her fingernails. It was established that he had engaged in intercourse. 

11The offender confessed to Mr Blackler late in the afternoon of 10 March to having killed Ms Weston. He said, ""I just lost it"" and ""I fucken snapped and killed her"". Mr Blackler encouraged him to turn himself in and agreed to give him a lift to the police station. During the journey, the offender said:

""We went for a drive, we were at the river. I was trying to work stuff out and she got angry.""

""I grabbed hold of her around her body because she was trying to get out."" (And he demonstrated holding her with both arms.)

""She started biting me, and then I lost it. ... I choked her.""

""I am not a bad guy. I just made a fuckin terrible mistake.""

12Mr Blackler said that the offender was crying. When detectives came to speak with him at the police station they found him with his head in his hands, crying. He told them the identity of the body that had been found earlier that day by the river and described her as his ""ex"". He was asked whether he had killed her and he replied, ""out of rage, yes"". 

13The offender agreed to return to the scene and answer police questions there. However, in relation to a number of significant matters he exercised his right to silence. For example, he declined to respond to questions about having intercourse with her and the state in which he had left her body.

14An autopsy performed by Professor Timothy Lyons revealed that Ms Weston had sustained a number of bruises and abrasions. She had a bruise and laceration to the back of the head with an underlying skull fracture suggestive of blunt force trauma. Injuries in and around her mouth indicated she was choked in some fashion. 

Personal circumstances of the offender

15The offender did not give evidence at the sentence hearing but I heard evidence which I consider to have been genuine and impressive from his father, Mr Gary Ballantyne, and Mr Matthew Blackler, the friend and former work colleague I have mentioned. I also received a report by Dr Jonathon Adams, forensic psychiatrist and a number of testimonials.

16The offender's personal circumstances are fairly unremarkable. He was born in 1983 and so he was aged 30 at the time of the offence. His parents are in their early 60s and live in Greta. He has a younger sister who is married with children. He enjoys a loving and close relationship with his family. 

17He completed Year 12 and attained the Higher School Certificate. He has a history of employment and what seems to be a strong work ethic.

18There is no history of abusing alcohol and no indication of any relevant mental condition. He has used prohibited drugs but not to any damaging extent and not in recent years.

19Aside from driving offences the only entries of note in his criminal history were those associated with the event involving his former girlfriend in 2007 that has been mentioned. The outcome involved fines and good behaviour bonds. The record is one that disentitles the offender to the leniency that could be extended if there were no previous convictions.

20The testimonials convey the impression of the offender being happy, friendly, well-mannered, even-tempered but somewhat immature for his age. 

21The offender is fortunate to have retained strong support from friends and family which augurs well for his rehabilitation. 

22Dr Adams offered the opinion that ""it appears Mr Ballantyne's offending behaviour is inconsistent with his past behaviour and personality structure"". This finding was likely influenced by the offender's portrayal of the facts of the 2007 incident involving his former girlfriend which was inconsistent with the statement of facts. He told Dr Adams that it involved some ""pushing and shoving""; there was no mention of holding a pillow over her mouth and restricting her breathing. The inconsistency was considered to be ""out of character"" by the offender's father but it prompted discussion about the offender getting help in relation to anger management.

23Dr Adams mentioned an account by the offender of having contemplated suicide soon after going into custody. He suggested there be ""close monitoring"" after sentencing. For this reason I will be asking that a copy of Dr Adams' report accompany the papers forwarded to Corrective Services NSW. 

Assessment

24The starting point in the assessment of sentence is to recognise that murder is the most serious of crimes. In this case it involved the taking of the life of a young woman in quite horrific circumstances and callously leaving her semi-naked body face down by the riverside.

25Aside from the statements made by the offender that I have mentioned in my account of the facts of the offence, there has not been placed before me any account as to precisely what he did to Ms Weston. The report of Dr Adams includes a version under the heading ""Discussion of the Offence"" but I was told by Mr Rosser QC that it was not relied upon. I conclude that the offender has not been prepared to give an honest, full and frank account of what he did. He exercised his right to silence in responding to some of the police questions and in electing not to give evidence in the sentence proceedings. No adverse inference may be drawn from the exercise of that right. He should be given credit for turning himself in to the police relatively soon after the event. I accept that he is sad and regretful but in all the circumstances I am not prepared to find that he is genuinely remorseful.

26The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the offence is within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It was accepted that the killing of Ms Weston was something that occurred spontaneously but the act(s) causing death were carried out with the very intention of killing, as opposed to just causing serious harm. And there was significant violence over a period of time. She was trying to get away from him but he somehow physically overcame her, carried her 200m to the riverside where he choked her to death. No submission was made that I should reject this assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. In short, I accept it.

27It was submitted that I could find that the offender engaged in intercourse that was non-consensual. However, Mr Rosser urged that this was a finding that was adverse to the offender that would require proof beyond reasonable doubt. I have reflected on the submissions on this topic and conclude that I cannot be satisfied of it to the required standard. Having said that, the fact that the offender told police that Ms Weston was fully clothed when he carried her to the river bank and her body was found almost naked indicates that he probably did have non-consensual intercourse but I do not think it adds anything to what is already a killing of significant seriousness and attended by a subsequent callous disregard of her dignity.

28The offender appears to be a person who is immature for his years and he has issues coping with relationships and anger management in their context. I accept Dr Adams' assessment that he ""would benefit from engaging with psychological services to better understand the offending behaviour and aspects such as emotional recognition and ... regulation"". I have mentioned the strong support he has in the community. I consider that his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable.

29He has been in custody since his arrest on 10 March 2013 and his sentence should be back-dated accordingly. 

30The plea of guilty was entered in the Local Court. In accordance with customary practice I should reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by 25 percent to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea entered at that early stage.

Sentence

31Convicted.

32Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 14 years 3 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years 9 months. 

33The sentence will date from 10 March 2013 and the offender will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period.

34I direct that a copy of the report of Dr Jonathon Adams accompany the warrant with attention invited to the penultimate paragraph.

		10 October 2014",2014-10-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704435,Budrodeen v R [2014] NSWCCA 332,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2ROTHMAN J:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of R A Hulme J. I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour. I also agree with the reasons for judgment of his Honour, but add the following additional comments. 
3The reasons for judgment of R A Hulme J refer to question trails, which is common practice in some jurisdictions, including other States and Territories of Australia, and is becoming more commonplace in this jurisdiction. Such question trails can be of great use in complex trials but, as Hulme J has pointed out, extreme care must be taken that all issues are covered and that there are no gaps in the findings necessary to establish guilt (or otherwise). 4In the reasons for judgment of R A Hulme J, reference is made to the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact exemplified by the judgment in Proudman v Dayman [1941] HCA 28; (1941) 67 CLR 536. His Honour refers to it as a ""defence"", utilising quotation marks, because it is not in any real sense a defence but a matter which must be negatived by the Crown, once the accused has established the evidentiary onus of raising the ground: He Kaw Teh v R [1985] HCA 43; (1985) 157 CLR 523 at 534-535; CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25; 236 CLR 440 at [8].
5This is not the occasion to discuss, at length or otherwise, the necessary requirements for an honest and reasonable mistake to arise, nor the manner in which the Crown is required to negative it. 
6It is essential to understand that an honest and reasonable mistake as to fact must be a mistake which, if the facts that were honestly believed were true, would render the act innocent, not simply one that rendered the accused guilty of a different criminal offence: R v Reynhoudt [1962] HCA 23; (1962) 107 CLR 381 and, in particular, the Dixon CJ at 385-386. The fact that Dixon CJ was in dissent in R v Reynhoudt does not detract from the statement of principle.
7In CTM v The Queen the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) postulated the question particularly relevant to the current proceedings at [15] in the following way:
""[15] We have referred to Sir Samuel Griffith's Draft Code as a convenient reference point to illustrate certain considerations that might reasonably be expected to be present in the mind of anyone framing legislation on this topic. Legislation making it an offence for a male to have sexual relations with a female under a certain age commonly has differentiated between females of various ages, ranging through degrees, from infants of tender years, to people who might be mature adolescents. (Concepts of maturity themselves vary over time. There was a time when the age at which a female could marry was 12; hence the need to distinguish ""unlawful"" carnal knowledge.) We leave to one side, for the moment, the way in which such laws differentiated between heterosexual and homosexual activity. In dealing with conduct involving sexual relations with a female at the higher end of whatever range is chosen, such legislation typically addressed the possibility of an honest and reasonable mistake as to age. This is a problem inherent in the nature of the issue with which such legislation is concerned. When Parliament stipulates that, regardless of any question of consent, it is a serious crime for a male to have sexual relations with a female under a certain age, it is impossible to ignore the case of an alleged offender who honestly and reasonably believes that the female is above the specified age. It would be absurd to suggest that honest and reasonable mistakes of that kind are never made. When they occur, how is the law to deal with them? A similar (but not identical) answer was given in almost all examples of legislation on this topic in Australian jurisdictions, and in countries of a similar legal background.""
8The fact that in the current proceedings the sexual contact was male upon male makes no difference to the question posed and the answer implicitly provided. As a consequence, in the current proceedings, if the jury were to have determined guilt on the basis of lack of consent, which may have been the result of following the question trail supplied, even if there were an honest and reasonable mistake as to the age of the victim, the lack of consent would result in the appellant being guilty of a different offence to that which was charged and not rendering the accused innocent. 
9In the foregoing scenario, even if, as R A Hulme J has noted, the jury may have determined guilt without answering the fundamental question as to reasonable and honest mistake as to the age of the victim, the accused would be guilty of the offence charged. This results from the fact that the victim was under the age of 16 and the defence of reasonable and honest mistake of fact, in circumstances where the sexual conduct was not consensual, does not relieve the accused of criminal conduct. In those circumstances, even if the defence of reasonable and honest mistake were not determined, one would be minded, with one major qualification, to exercise the power reposed in this Court by the proviso. 
10As Hulme J has most eloquently stated, the fundamental difficulty with the foregoing approach is that the essential issue in the trial, namely, whether the Crown has negatived the existence of a reasonable and honest mistake as to the age of the victim, may never have been determined by the jury. 
11Further, if one were to rely on the non-consensual nature of the conduct in question, as distinct from the age of the victim, one must then ask the further question whether there was an honest and reasonable mistake as to whether the victim was consenting. This was not put to the jury and, therefore, reasonable and honest mistake may still have been available, but not answered by the jury. The proviso cannot, in those circumstances be utilised. 
12For those further reasons, together with that contained in the reasons for judgment of R A Hulme J, I join in the orders proposed by R A Hulme J. 
13R A HULME J:  At the conclusion of the hearing of this matter on Wednesday 1 October 2014 the Court pronounced orders allowing the appeal, quashing the applicant's convictions and remitting the matter for retrial.  These are my reasons for joining in the making of those orders.
14The applicant, Adam Wayne Budrodeen, was tried before her Honour Judge Hock and a jury in the District Court at Newcastle in February 2013 in respect of two counts of aggravated indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse with a person between 14 and 16 years of age.  He was found guilty of each offence and on 23 August 2013 was sentenced to imprisonment for an aggregate term of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.
15The applicant sought leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence.   He formulated 19 grounds of appeal which were supported by written submissions.  They were characterised in the written submissions for the Crown as raising matters of the applicant's personal opinions about the evidence led against him at trial and making unsubstantiated accusations of impropriety against prosecution witnesses and lawyers.   They also raised matters that were not the subject of complaint or were not in issue at the trial at all.  They are all matters concerning which leave  was required, either pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) or r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.
16The Crown, however, identified a more fundamental difficulty which was brought to the attention of the Court and to the applicant in compliance with its general duty to act with fairness and in the interests of the administration of justice.  Mr Adams, counsel for the Crown, is to be commended for this.  The matter concerns the way in which the trial judge directed the jury as to the essential elements of the offences; in other words, the matters the Crown was required to establish beyond reasonable doubt before the jury could return any verdict of guilty.
17The offences in question were sexual intercourse with a person who is of or above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years (s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)) and indecent assault upon a person under the age of 16 years (s 61M(2)).  The factual basis of the prosecution case can be described briefly. It is convenient to quote from the Crown submissions.
""The complainant was a male aged 15 years.  On the afternoon of 23 October 2011 he attended the bistro at the Gateway Hotel with his family.  Around 7:00pm his parents left the hotel on their motorbike.  It was intended that the complainant catch a taxi home.  A taxi was called and arrived at the hotel around 7:30pm.  The complainant got into the taxi, which was driven by the applicant.  
The applicant drove off and he and the complainant started conversing.  The applicant put his hand in the complainant's lap and rubbed his penis through his clothing [Count 1].  The applicant pulled over in a street near the applicant's home.  He got into the back of the taxi and suggested that the complainant do the same.  The complainant complied.  The applicant pulled down the complainant's jeans and underpants and sucked the complainant's penis, while holding it [Count 2].  The applicant then tongue kissed the complainant [Count 3].  The applicant continued to suck the complainant's penis until he ejaculated.  The complainant pulled up his pants and went back to the front seat.  
The complainant directed the applicant to drop him at a laneway near his house.  He arrived home at about 7:50pm.  He went with his family to the cinema that night.  When they got home he went to bed but could not sleep.  Late that night he told his mother about what had happened.  The police were contacted.""
18The defence case involved acceptance that the sexual activity as described by the complainant occurred.  However it was his case that the complainant had told him that he was aged 16, thus raising an issue about whether the Crown could disprove beyond reasonable doubt that, whilst he was in fact mistaken as to that fact, it was a belief which was honestly held on reasonable grounds.  Generally as to the ""defence"" of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, see Proudman v Dayman [1941] HCA 28; 67 CLR 536 and CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25; 236 CLR 440.
19Aside from the mistake as to the complainant's age, the applicant's case also involved a claim that the complainant was a willing participant in the sexual activity.  But s 77 of the Crimes Act provides that the consent of the child to whom a charge relates shall be no defence to a charge under, inter alia, ss 61M(2) and 66C. The section has, relevantly, been in this form since amendments were made by the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2003 (NSW) which took effect on 13 June 2003.
20The judge directed the jury, both in writing and orally, to the effect that consent was an element of each offence.  She directed that if the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent to the sexual activity of the applicant, then provided the jury were also satisfied that the complainant was under the age of 16 and that the applicant committed the physical act alleged, then the jury should return a verdict of guilty.  She directed the jury that if they were satisfied of the age and physical act elements but not of the consent element, only then should they consider whether the Crown had established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not have an honest belief on reasonable grounds that the complainant was aged 16 or above.  
21To illustrate, the following is from the written directions concerning the sexual intercourse (s 66C(3)) offence (quoting only relevant parts):
Questions for the Jury
1. Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had sexual intercourse with [the complainant], that is, the accused sucked the complainant's penis?
If yes, go to question 2.If no, find the accused not guilty.
2. Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant was under 16?
If yes, go to question 3.If no, find the accused not guilty.
3. Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual intercourse was without the consent of the complainant?
If yes, find the accused guilty.If no, go to question 4.
[Some definitions of ""sexual intercourse"" and ""consent"" were set out.]
4. Are you satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either:
(a)  the accused did not honestly believe that the complainant was 16 or above the age of 16 years? or (b)  the accused did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the complainant was 16 or above the age of 16 years?
If yes, find the accused guilty.If no, find the accused not guilty. 
22Similar written directions were given in relation to the aggravated indecent assault offences.  The written directions were replicated in the oral directions.
23Directing the jury in this way was erroneous in that it required the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt about an issue that, having regard to s 77, was entirely irrelevant.  But in directing the jury as to the essential elements of the offences in the form of a question trail, the jury were given a prescriptive chain of reasoning to follow.  The directions left it open to the jury to by-pass the single critical issue in the case (honest and reasonable mistake as to the complainant's age) and to convict the applicant on the basis that they were satisfied of the irrelevant fact that the complainant did not consent.
24None of this should be seen as criticism by this Court of the practice of using the question trail approach to directing a jury as to the elements of an offence.  This case simply serves to illustrate that particular care is needed when prescribing a sequential process of reasoning.  It is trite to observe as well that care is required in the identification of the elements of the offence; a matter about which the trial judge was not well served by the trial advocate for the Crown and the experienced counsel who appeared for the applicant.
25The Crown fairly conceded that the misdirection was so fundamental that there was no occasion to consider applying the proviso (that there was no substantial miscarriage of justice) and dismissing the appeal.  It was conceded that orders should be made in the terms mentioned at the beginning of my judgment.

		19 December 2014",2014-09-30 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704455,State of New South Wales v Brooker [2014] NSWSC 1349,"Judgment

1Pursuant to a summons filed on 5 June 2014, the plaintiff seeks an extended supervision order (an order) pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act) against the defendant. Counsel for the defendant, a barrister very experienced in the criminal law, expressly concedes that the statutory preconditions for the making of an order, including the fact that one can be satisfied that ""the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision"" (s 5B(2) of the Act), have been made out on the evidence tendered before me. However, he rejects the proposition of the plaintiff that the order should be made for five years from today. In contrast, he submits that the evidence would lead me to impose an order that expires no later than three years from today.

2In short, there are two issues calling from my determination. The first is whether I should adopt the joint position of the parties with regard to the making of an order, on the basis that I myself am satisfied that the necessary matters in the Act have been established. The second is, if so, the length of any such order.

3The matter was heard on 29 September 2014. Counsel for the plaintiff explained that the interim supervision order to which the defendant was then subject would expire at midnight on 1 October 2014. In light of the exigencies arising from that fact, and the joint position of the parties with regard to the question of the making of an order, my analysis of that first question will be somewhat more concise than if there had been a full-blown dispute about it.

Summary of evidence

4The evidence in the hearing was placed before me by way of a number of affidavits and reports, many of them bearing voluminous annexures. The import of the evidence is as follows.

5The defendant was born on 5 August 1943 and is therefore 71 years of age. The most noteworthy aspect of his disrupted and unhappy life is that he has committed sexual offences against children between the years of 1962 and 2011 inclusive; that is, over a span of almost 50 years.

6Raised in the Sydney suburb of Glebe in difficult circumstances, the defendant was sexually assaulted by two men when he was aged around 12 years old. At the age of 16, in 1960, he was found to be living rough in Nyngan in the west of New South Wales, and was declared uncontrollable. At the age of 18, in January 1962, he sexually assaulted a young paperboy and was sentenced to 3 months hard labour.

7Thereafter the defendant committed many criminal offences of various kinds, with the result that he has spent much of his life either in gaol or subject to conditional liberty. He developed a serious dependence on alcohol from an early age, and at one stage was reduced to drinking methylated spirits. He has been homeless on many occasions. Although not unintelligent, the defendant has only spasmodically applied himself to work.

8His proclivity for sexually assaulting children is well-established. As I have said, it first manifested itself in January 1962 when he was aged 18. In July 1989, whilst aged 45 and in Queensland, he had sex with a girl who was aged 15 years; the claim of the defendant is that she was only a few days short of her 16th birthday. As a result, he was ordered to undertake 100 hours of community service.

9In October 1989, the defendant was aged 46. Whilst staying with friends at a home in Queensland, he entered a bedroom of four children whilst they were sleeping. He fondled the breasts of two young girls, and placed his penis in the mouth of a 12-year-old boy. Thereafter he pulled the pants of the boy down and attempted to have sexual intercourse with him. At the time the defendant was grossly intoxicated. He received a remarkably lenient sentence of imprisonment for six months with three years of probation, and an order that he seek help with regard to his problem with alcohol.

10In November 1994, when aged 51 years, the defendant committed the offence that is said to found the jurisdiction of this Court to make the order sought (the index offence). The defendant was drinking in a hotel at which a woman arrived with her four-year-old daughter. The defendant engaged the mother in conversation, and later that evening travelled to her home with her and her male friend. The mother and her friend left the home to obtain more beer, thereby leaving the defendant alone in the premises with the four-year-old. He took the opportunity to enter the child's bedroom, and digitally penetrated her genitals with brutal force. The result of that assault was that the child bled profusely and was hospitalised for five days. The child immediately complained on her mother's return. The defendant was sentenced to imprisonment by his Honour Judge Viney QC in the District Court of New South Wales at Penrith. Pursuant to a Crown appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the defendant's sentence was significantly increased. The result was a head sentence of imprisonment for seven years with a non-parole period of four years and six months, to date from 17 November 1994.

11In his remarks on sentence Judge Viney QC described the offence as ""very serious"" and a ""dreadful attack"" that would no doubt cause the victim ongoing psychological problems. His Honour emphasised the importance of affording the defendant the chance to work towards rehabilitation while on parole. On appeal, Gleeson CJ (with whom Ireland J agreed) accepted the Crown submission that, in light of the very serious objective features of the case and the criminal history of the defendant, this was ""one of the more serious cases of the kind dealt with"" pursuant to the relevant section of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The Chief Justice stated:

... whilst it is true that this appears to have been an impulsive act on the part of the [defendant] while substantially affected by alcohol, nevertheless the evidence shows that he took the occasion to commit the offence whilst the victim's mother and the only other adult person there were absent from the home. He had to go up to the child's bedroom and evidently remove her nappy.

12The defendant was released to parole on 16 May 1999. He promptly breached parole by absconding, and travelled to Western Australia. It is true that for many years he did not come to the notice of the criminal justice system; that came to an end when he was accused of touching the breasts of a girl under 13 years of age in 2011. Eventually sentenced for that offence to time served, he was extradited to New South Wales to serve the balance of parole owing as a result of his breach many years before. He was released to parole on 14 March 2014, but was promptly breached again because he failed to inform police that he had obtained a mobile phone, as required by the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (NSW). He nevertheless remained in the community until his head sentence fully expired on 2 July 2014. By that time he was subject to an interim supervision order that had been imposed by this Court on 24 June 2014.

13In short, over 49 years the defendant has been convicted of a large number of sexual offences against a number of children: in 1962, against a young boy; in July 1989 against a 15-year-old girl; in October 1989 against a young boy and two young girls; and in 2011, against a young girl in Western Australia. There have also been a number of unproven allegations against him; pursuant to s 9(3)(i) of the Act, I have had regard to them, but give them less weight than matters that have either been admitted by way of a plea of guilty or proven beyond reasonable doubt.

14Turning to other relevant matters, the defendant is now an elderly man in very poor health. He suffers from a serious problem with regard to his lungs (the condition is exacerbated by his inability to give up smoking); his heart and circulation (he suffers from angina, has experienced two heart attacks, has high cholesterol, and is at elevated risk of a stroke); and his liver (he has cirrhosis, I infer caused by his abuse of alcohol, and also hepatitis B). There is also a suggestion that the defendant suffers from a cognitive deficit, caused by alcohol-induced brain damage and his cardiovascular difficulties.

15Since his release, the defendant has resided at a halfway house run by the Department of Corrective Services next to Long Bay Gaol. He has generally been compliant with his strict parole conditions and the conditions of the interim order. In particular there has been no hint of him drinking alcohol detected by those who supervise him. Having said that, his response to supervision has not been entirely satisfactory: there has been a flavour of him dissembling and hiding his activities from his supervisors. In particular, the suggestion is that he has secretly accessed a website called ""Cupid Filipino"" via Facebook. The plaintiff alleges, founded upon an interrogation of a phone to which he had access, that the defendant sent an adult woman whom he had met through that website the following message: ""Would love to see you in your schoolies outfit you sesy [sic] girl"".

16The risk that the defendant presents to the community by way of reoffending has been assessed by a number of persons. Mr Samuel Ardasinski, a psychologist within the prison system, applied the well-known tools of risk assessment, Static-99R and Stable-2007. In summary, he expressed the opinion that the defendant presents a high risk of reoffending compared to other male sexual offenders. Mr Ardasinski observed that although the offender was ""not expansive or spontaneous in responding"" to questions concerning his offences, he became ""progressively more relaxed and open"" as the interview progressed, and was generally compliant.

17Dr Jeremy O'Dea, a psychiatrist who specialises in the treatment of sex offenders, diagnosed the defendant with an antisocial personality disorder with significant psychopathic traits, and a substance use disorder with regard to alcohol. He also considered that there was a ""specific, if not exclusive, paedophilic focus"" to the defendant's sexuality. Dr O'Dea has expressed the view that it is imperative that the defendant remain abstinent from alcohol; whether he does or not, Dr O'Dea considers that there is a significantly high risk of him engaging in further sex offending behaviour in the community. Because Dr O'Dea regarded that risk as chronic and extending over many years into the future, he expressed the view that any order should be of at least five years' duration. Dr O'Dea stated that the defendant was fully co-operative throughout the assessment interview, but was ""somewhat superficial regarding and dismissive of his offending behaviour, general history, and predicament"".

18Dr Ellis, another forensic psychiatrist, diagnosed the defendant with paedophilic disorder, personality disorder, and substance abuse disorder with regard to alcohol, and took the view that the defendant presents a high risk of reoffending. Still and all, Dr Ellis would be content with an order of three years' duration. He observed that the account given by the defendant of his sexual offences was ""impoverished in detail"", and that the defendant questioned the benefit or necessity of the proposed conditions.

19While in custody, the defendant participated in the high intensity CUBIT program for sexual offenders between 10 December 2012 and 28 November 2013, although his participation in therapeutic sessions was hampered by the need for medical treatment. The CUBIT Treatment Report of 17 December 2013 suggests that although he participated in this program willingly, and developed an ""intellectual"" understanding of the program concepts, he had some difficulty engaging with the factors that contributed to and the consequences that have flowed from his offending. It appears that since being released to parole the defendant has participated in the community-based maintenance program administered by Forensic Psychology Services. 

20As for the future, the defendant seeks to live independently in his own apartment in due course and enjoy the remainder of his life. He gains pleasure from fishing and also has an interest in Buddhism. The evidence before me establishes that the defendant is very isolated in the community, and I am satisfied that that state of affairs will continue into the indefinite future.

Should an order be made? 

(i) The test to be applied

21Turning to the statutory preconditions, there is no doubt that the index offence committed in 1994 falls within the definition of a ""serious sex offence"" contained in s 5(1) of the Act. Nor can there be any doubt that the defendant falls within the definition of a ""sex offender"" contained in s 4 of the Act. 

22The statutory formulation of the test for risk that I must apply is as follows: 

5B High risk sex offender

(1) An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2) An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3) The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.

23As for the question of how one should approach that test, I adhere to the analysis that I undertook in R v Steadman [2013] NSWSC 170; namely: 

[65] I have approached the requirement of satisfaction ""to a high degree of probability"" as constituting an elevated standard of proof that falls between the criminal standard and the civil standard, in accordance with Tillman v Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327; (2007) 178 A Crim R 133.

[66] As for what is involved in the concept of ""unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence"" I respectfully adopt what was said by Davies J in State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276 at [90]:

""Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"". The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. That is also because s 17(3) [of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006, the predecessor of s5B of the Act] provides for the further assessment that if the Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk a supervision order will not be adequate to meet the risk.""

24As for the factors contained in s 9(3) of the Act, and which I am required to take into account, I shall not repeat them seriatim. I have reflected upon all of them, and I consider that they are adequately referred to in this judgment.

(ii) Application of the test to the evidence

25Regrettably, the defendant has had a sexual attraction to children over many decades. Furthermore, he has been prepared to act upon it. Although it is true that in the past he has identified chiefly as homosexual, it is clear that he has obtained gratification from sexually assaulting both young boys and young girls. And although he has shown himself to be open to psychological treatment in the past, I am satisfied that he has only a very limited insight into the profoundly antisocial nature of his crimes and the lasting psychological injury that they are liable to inflict upon his victims. 

26His age and state of health have not combined to reduce his libido markedly: the offence of 2011, when he was aged 68 years, supports that proposition. His response to supervision over the past several months, whilst not particularly poor, has been lacking in candour and willing compliance. In particular, his access to Facebook, contrary to the express conditions of his conditional liberty, is a cause for real concern. That is because it could well permit him either to contact a child directly over the Internet, or to inveigle himself into the trust of a vulnerable adult who could unwittingly provide him with access to a child, with disastrous results.

27To state things bluntly, if the defendant were living in the community subject to no form of conditional liberty and wholly unsupervised, I consider that there is a very real risk that he could offend again, just as he has done over the preceding five decades.

28In short, quite apart from the detailed submissions of the plaintiff and the express concession on the part of the defendant, I am satisfied that the test contained in s 5B(2) of the Act has been made out. I am satisfied that it is highly probable that, if not subject to supervision, the defendant poses a risk of committing a serious sexual offence against a child, and I consider that risk an unacceptable one. It follows that I shall make an extended supervision order with regard to the defendant, and it will date from today.

Length of order?

29I turn to the resolution of the real dispute before me. Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that there were five reasons why such an order of five years' duration should be made.

30First, the defendant has expressed a reluctance to take anti-libidinal medication. That is despite the fact that at least one psychiatrist considered that that would be the best treatment for the defendant in the future. Whilst his refusal to do so is understandable in light of his pre-existing medical conditions, and all of the other medication that he is currently taking, nevertheless that refusal could mean that his risk of reoffending in the community is significantly higher than it would be otherwise. Whatever else may be disputed by the defendant, it seems to be accepted that he has used Facebook to access a site directed towards romantic or sexual liaison. Even now, counsel submitted, that suggests that the libido of the defendant remains high.

31Secondly, in his report, Dr O'Dea firmly expressed the opinion that, due to the chronic nature of the sexual attraction of the defendant to children, any order should be for at least five years.

32Thirdly, it is true that the medical conditions of the defendant will not make his compliance with the terms of an order for five years any easier. But nor will they present significant difficulty. They certainly should not stand in the way of an order that extends to five years.

33Fourthly, if it be the case that the defendant complies with any order, one should expect it, as a matter of practicality and discretionary adjustment, to become less onerous over time. Indeed, it could be that, towards the end of five years, the conditions with which the defendant must comply will be quite lax.

34Fifthly, the primary object of the Act is the protection of the community: s 3(1). Whilst rehabilitation is also an object (s 3(2)), if it be a question of balancing the two, the former must prevail. In this case, the protection of the community calls for an order that extends to five years.

35Finally, counsel for the plaintiff accepted that, if the plaintiff wishes to do so during the currency of an order that extends for three years, it can apply for the period of the order to be extended to five years (pursuant to s 13 of the Act), or for a further order to commence at the end of that first order (pursuant to s 5I(2)(b) and s 10(3) of the Act). In that sense, he accepted that my determination of the length of the order is not a conclusive one with regard to the future. Nevertheless, he submitted that, if it be the case that I am satisfied that an order of five years duration is appropriate on the evidence before me, simply because there is a facility whereby in the future the plaintiff could seek an extended or further order should not stand in the way of me making the order for which the plaintiff contends.

36The defendant submitted that, in light of the case law on this issue, the following principles must be taken into account in determining the appropriate length of an order. 

37First, the terms of the order will significantly erode the liberty of the defendant. Secondly, three years is by any measure a significant period of time to be subject to an order that curtails one's liberty. Thirdly, a lengthy order may frustrate the defendant's prospects of rehabilitation by giving him little to work towards. That is particularly so where the defendant is compliant with treatment and the plaintiff is able to seek a further order at the end of the period of supervision in any event. He submitted that a shorter order, and the chance of unconditional liberty at its conclusion, may provide some incentive for compliance, particularly given the age and medical condition of the defendant.

38Counsel for the defendant submitted that the overall response of the defendant to the onerous conditions of his supervision since his release has been satisfactory. It was pointed out that the defendant did notify supervision officers from the Department of Corrective Services about the purchase of the mobile phone, and that the failure to notify police was better characterised as neglect than deceit. Furthermore, he submitted that there was no suggestion that in accessing the online dating agency the defendant was attempting to communicate with children, access pornographic material, or do anything otherwise inappropriate. He submitted that it could have been the result of nothing more sinister than loneliness.

39Finally, in response to the submissions of the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant noted that the reluctance of the defendant to consider taking anti-libidinal medication must be understood in the context of his medical condition, and the fact that it has not yet been determined whether it is safe to take such medication alongside the other medical treatment he is receiving. Although counsel accepted that the age and medical condition of the defendant will not prevent him from complying with an order, he submitted that the additional hardship that they will generate should be considered in determining the period of the order.

40Counsel for the defendant submitted that it is completely uncertain whether the conditions of an order will become less onerous over time, and accordingly that factor should not be given much weight in determining the period of the order. 

41To conclude my overview of the submissions made by the parties on this point, each counsel helpfully invited my attention to other judgments of this Court at first instance in which a controversy between the parties as to the duration of an order was resolved one way or another. But in discussion between the Bench and the Bar table, it was accepted that those other decisions are nothing more than a useful guide; each case must turn on its own facts.

Determination

42Over the years, the defendant has not responded at all well to conditional liberty. 

43As I have recounted, in 1999 whilst on parole for an extremely serious sexual offence against a child, he simply absconded and travelled far away from New South Wales. He was not brought to justice for many years. 

44On his release to parole this year things have not proceeded smoothly. Indeed, as I have said, he was breached for failing to notify police that he had purchased a mobile phone, although not returned to custody. There is a distinct flavour of him being deceptive with his supervisors whilst he has been on conditional liberty this year. 

45Whether or not it be the case that he has indeed sought to see an image of a woman dressed as a schoolgirl and thereby to obtain sexual gratification (a question that I am unable to determine on the evidence before me), his flagrant determination to use Facebook contrary to an explicit order gives rise to a real concern in my mind. 

46As I have said, I am not satisfied that the defendant has anything other than a superficial insight into the damage that he has done over the past many decades. Nor, on reflection, do I have confidence that this man will comply faithfully with the conditions of the form of conditional liberty that I will shortly impose. More broadly, he has been prepared to break the criminal law repeatedly, not only generally, but also in order to satisfy his sexual attraction to children.

47I accept that even the lesser period for which the defendant contends will constitute a serious curtailment of his liberty for a period of many months. Nevertheless, having reflected on the question, seeking to balance the rights and interests of both parties, and keeping in mind the primacy of the protection of the community, I have come to the view that the defendant should be subject to an extended supervision order for a period of four years.

Orders

48I make the following orders:

(1)Pursuant to s 5C of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2007, the defendant is subject to an extended supervision order that commences today, 1 October 2014, and expires after four years.

(2)The conditions of the extended supervision order are those contained in the schedule to the summons filed by the plaintiff, and annexed to this judgment.

		01 October 2014",2014-09-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704458,Commissioner for Fair Trading v Rixon (No.3) [2014] NSWSC 1279,"Judgment

1On 9 May 2014, I found that the defendant, Mr Matthew Rixon, was guilty of contempt of court in that by his conduct in the periods, and with respect to each of the five properties specified in the Statement of Charge, he was in breach of the Court's orders dated 17 April 2013, in 24 specific instances.

2My reasons for reaching that conclusion are contained in Commissioner for Fair Trading v Rixon (No.2) [2014] NSWSC 431.

Procedural Context

3After delivery of judgment, on three occasions, 16 May 2014; 26 June 2014; and 29 August 2014, the Court dealt with the question of what penalty ought be imposed. On the first day, when the matter was adjourned by consent, procedural directions were made: Mr R Keller of counsel appeared for the defendant. 

4On the second day, evidence and written submissions were taken: the defendant appeared in person. On the third day, Mr A Martin, a solicitor, appeared for the defendant.

5On the second day, 26 June 2014, when the matter came before the Court for the hearing of evidence and submissions with respect to penalty, the plaintiff placed a number of affidavits before the Court. No objection was taken to those affidavits and the deponents were not required for cross-examination. The defendant, who was at that stage appearing for himself, chose not to put any evidence before the Court. Both parties made submissions.

6Because the plaintiff submitted that it was open to the Court, and the Court should, impose a penalty which involved the defendant serving a term of imprisonment, the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, made it was necessary for the defendant to be assessed for an alternative to imprisonment, such as an Intensive Corrections Order or Community Service Order, by the NSW Probation and Parole Services.

7Accordingly, without objection from the defendant, I adjourned the proceedings on penalty and ordered a pre-sentence report. 

8An assessment was undertaken by the Community Corrections section of Corrective Services and a pre-sentence report dated 28 August 2014, was tendered to the Court when it resumed the hearing on 29 August 2014. 

9On that day, Mr Martin, the solicitor for the defendant, sought to put additional submissions to the Court in response to the submissions which had been previously made by the plaintiff, and which had already been answered by the defendant. That course was permitted. 

10During the course of these submissions I was informed by counsel for the plaintiff, without demur from the solicitor for the defendant, that on the day prior to the hearing, namely 28 August 2014, the defendant had provided two cheques to the plaintiff, one addressed to Mr Snushall in the sum of $550, and the other addressed to Mr B Dedich in the sum of $700. These were bank cheques and I was informed that the plaintiff was intending to pass those cheques on to the named individuals.

Punishment for Contempt

11In Commonwealth of Australia v Salvato (No.4) [2013] NSWSC 321, I had occasion to discuss the legal principles relevant to the punishment of an individual for contempt of court. They are to be found at [26]-[30]. I will not repeat here what was written there. 

12In Salvato (No 4) at [20], I said that I was not persuaded that the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act would apply when the Court was imposing a penalty for contempt. Neither Counsel in that case drew my attention to a number of cases in this Court which have held that the Act does apply in the present circumstances. I acknowledge that, although irrelevant to the actual outcome in Salvato (No 4), my statement about the irrelevance of the statute was erroneous. 

13It is clear that as a matter of principle, punishment of a person for contempt should take into account the same principles as are applicable to punishment for crime: Registrar of the Court of Appeal v Maniam (No 2) (1992) 26 NSWLR 309 at 314. That includes the sentencing principles contained in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: see Attorney-General for NSW v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314; Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Jando (2001) 53 NSWLR 527 at 536-537

14The proper approach to sentencing, or imposing a penalty for contempt is for a Court, having determined the appropriate facts which relate to the conduct which constitutes the contempt, to identify all of the factors that are relevant to the penalty in this case, identify their significance with the particular circumstances of the contempt and then to make a value judgment as to what is the appropriate penalty to be imposed having regard to the purposes for which such penalty is to be imposed: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51] per McHugh J; Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [26].

15It is appropriate to draw attention to the decision of the High Court of Australia, in Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46; (1986) 161 CLR 98, where at [106], Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ said:

""Punishment for contempt serves two functions: 

(a) enforcement of the process and order of the Court, disobedience to which has been described as 'civil contempt'; and

(b) punishment of other acts which impede the administration of justice, such a obstructing proceedings in Court while it is sitting or publishing comments on a pending case, which have both been described as 'criminal contempt' ...""

16At [112], their Honours said:

""... we would add the comment that lying behind punishment for a contempt which involves wilful disobedience to a court order, is the very substantial purpose of disciplining the defendant and vindicating the authority of the Court.""

17In addition, the objects of sentencing as set out in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act are relevant. They are as follows:

""3A Purposes of sentencing 
The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 

(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
(c) to protect the community from the offender, 
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""

18In summary, punishment for contempt which involves wilful disobedience of a court order serves substantially all of these purposes. As these purposes may be in tension, each case which necessitates the imposition of a penalty, will be an individual exercise of the intuitive synthesis approach to sentencing.

19The common law principles of sentencing are preserved by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In summary, the principles include:

(a) proportionality, namely that the sentence should be proportionate to the gravity of the offences: Veen v R (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at [8] per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ;

(b) parity - namely, that any difference between sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence, ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, and to give the appearance that justice has not been done: Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 per Dawson J, Gibbs CJ and Wilson J agreeing,

(c) totality - namely, that when a person stands for sentence for a number offences, the Court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and determine what the appropriate sentence is for all of the offences: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ;

(d) avoidance of double punishment - namely that a person should not be punished twice for the same conduct: Pearce v R (1988) 194 CLR 610.

20In imposing a penalty for contempt, the Court is not limited with respect to the orders which it can impose but rather, has a wide range of orders available to it. 

21Matters which are relevant to the imposition of a penalty for contempt include; the nature and circumstances of the contempt, the impact or likely impact of the contempt on the administration of justice, the extent of the contemnor's culpability for the conduct in question, and whether the contemnor has demonstrated genuine contrition and proffered a full and ample apology. 

22The aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act need also to be considered.

23Clearly, where any fine is to be imposed, regard must be had to the contemnor's financial means and their personal circumstances. Of course, what is always of particular importance in imposing a penalty for contempt, is the need to deter the contemnor specifically from engaging in similar conduct again, and to deter anyone else from being in breach of a court order.

24Ultimately, these matters all assist in the formulation of a sentence which vindicates and upholds the authority of the Court.

Nature of the Contempt

25The nature of the conduct giving rise to the contempt is fully described in Rixon (No.2). What that judgment shows is that, in 2013, the Court made, with his consent, orders against Mr Rixon which prohibited him directly or indirectly from engaging in any capacity whatsoever in performing residential building work whilst ever he did not hold a valid contractor licence. That order came about because of a claim by the plaintiff that Mr Rixon had been engaging in residential building work without a licence. 

26The judgment in Rixon (No.2), and the findings which I made there, demonstrate that notwithstanding the orders made by consent in 2013, Mr Rixon, with respect to five properties, set out to, and did, breach the Court's orders in respect of the five different properties, in 24 different respects. 

27I concluded the judgment in Rixon (No 2) with the following summary:

""149. All of this material suggests that, after the orders came into effect, Mr Rixon set about creating a network of companies to undertake residential building work, in circumstances where unless proper investigation was undertaken, his connection with those companies would not be obvious. He used a number of false names to deal with customers, on behalf of these companies. Generally the work was not done and the deposit which was given was lost. 

150. I am well satisfied that the facts, matters and circumstances prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Rixon intentionally set out to avoid the consequences of the Court's orders by creating the network of companies to undertake the work of providing fencing and decks to residential premises, in circumstances where Mr Rixon did not hold any contractor's licence and none of the companies were licensed.""

28It is to be remembered that Mr Rixon did not attend at the hearing about whether he was or was not in contempt, and put no submission contrary to the finding of contempt. 

29I regard, as is apparent from the reasons which I delivered, the contempt as being a very serious one because Mr Rixon, within a relatively short period after the orders were made, which were orders based upon his breach of the legislation with respect to carrying out residential building work only when there was an existing and valid contractor's licence in place, deliberately erected a network of companies with the intention of having those companies carry out residential building work without appropriate contractor licences, and using that network of companies to conceal his involvement in the residential building work.

30In truth he was the prime mover of those companies. He carried out much of the work for them. He concealed the fact that he was undertaking residential building work without a valid contractor's licence by giving false names and pretending, when he arrived at various residential properties and when he spoke to people about the jobs, to be different people.

31He set out to, and succeeded, in preying on unsuspecting home owners who at all times thought they were dealing with a properly licensed, and insured, residential builder who was entitled to be carrying out his work. He also preyed upon them because, as is obvious from what he did, he was not in a position to, and did not, finish the jobs which he undertook.

32The conduct involved in the contempt is extensive, persistent and very serious. 

Evidence on Penalty

33The plaintiff put before the Court evidence of Mr Rixon's criminal and offending history. 

34It is necessary to examine that history with care. It consists of the following:

(a)Mr Rixon's criminal history record in NSW and the ACT records convictions for a number of relatively minor offences concerned generally with driving motor vehicles, and minor dishonesty such as impersonating a police officer. I do not regard these histories as being of any relevance to the issues about penalty which I have to decide;

(b)Between March 2010 and April 2012, the Office of Fair Trading issued a total of 28 infringement notices to Mr Rixon with respect to conduct in which he had engaged in 2010 and 2011 concerned with residential building work. The infringement notices imposed fines on Mr Rixon for seeking and undertaking residential building work without a valid licence, demanding money by way of payment for residential building work contrary to the provisions of the legislation, and entering into contracts for undertaking residential building work which did not comply with the legislation. These infringement notices imposed fines totalling $19,000. 

(c)On 18 March 2013, Mr Rixon appeared before the Local Court at Newcastle where he was convicted of 21 offences against the Home Building Act 1989 which regulates residential building work. These convictions related to his conduct in the period from 1 February 2012 to 9 May 2012. It was conduct which was generally later in time than that which had been the subject of the infringement notices.

35In respect of those offences, he was fined a total of $52,500 and ordered to pay compensation totalling a little less than $4,000.

36It will be necessary to consider the significance, if any, of the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) above.

37In addition to Mr Rixon's past criminal and offence history, the plaintiff also relied upon the affidavit of Mr Kevin Michaelis, sworn 13 May 2014. The contents of that affidavit were not challenged by Mr Rixon when it was read on 26 June 2014. I accept the evidence of Mr Michaelis.

38The affidavit satisfies me of some further instances of breach of the Court orders by Mr Rixon, which have occurred since the commencement of the contempt proceedings and before the Court made its finding of contempt. 

39The first of these occasions was on Tuesday 21 January 2014, when five advertisements appeared in the Newcastle Herald, in the classified advertisements pages. They each advertised for residential building work. The words in each advertisement were:

""1. Builder. Specializing in renovations, extensikons, decks, bathrooms, all aspects of building, fully licensed and insured. Call Now 0455 945 792

2. Fencing. Full, Decorative, Color, Timber, Custom Made, Security, Free quotes. Lic 178431C Ph 0455 945 792

3. Handyman. Free quotes, painting, carpentry and maintenance. Prompt and reliable service. 0455 945 792.

4. Builder. Specializing in Decks, Bathrooms, Renovations, extensions and all of Building Aspects. Fully Licensed and insured. Lic. No. 179431C Ph 0458 066 393.

5. Fencing. Colorbond, Timber, Decorative, Security, Custom Made, Free Quotes. Li. No. 179431C. Ph 0458 066 393""


40Enquiries made by Mr Michaelis established that Mr Rixon had placed and paid for the advertisements, was the subscriber of the mobile telephone numbers, and had used licence numbers which belonged to other businesses without the knowledge and consent of the owners of those businesses. 

41The second occasion was on Thursday 13 February 2014, when two advertisements appeared in the Newcastle Herald in the classified advertisements pages. They were in the same terms as the fourth and fifth advertisements placed on 21 January 2014, except that a landline number was given in lieu of the mobile number.

42Further enquiries made by Mr Michaelis established a clear link between that number and an organisation which in the past had provided office services to Mr Rixon. I am satisfied that each of these advertisements was placed by Mr Rixon.

Evidence of Apology

43It is relevant to a consideration of what penalty ought be imposed for contempt of court to consider whether the contemnor has demonstrated contrition and proffered a full and ample apology.

44On 26 June 2014, when he appeared for himself, Mr Rixon made submissions to the Court and put various arguments. At the conclusion of those arguments he said:

""In closing, your Honour, I am deeply sorry and apologise to the Court for breaching these injunctions ...""

45In addition, immediately prior to the final occasion when the matter was before the Court, Mr Rixon delivered two bank cheques to the plaintiff to pass on to two of the consumers with whom he had dealt, repaying amounts of money which he had obtained from them.

46As is apparent, the apology was expressed at the very end of submissions and was not contained in an affidavit. Mr Rixon could not be cross-examined about it, and the payment of money was only made the day before the matter was back before the Court, and was limited in its extent.

47Whilst some weight must be given to the statement of apology, and the tendering of the bank cheques, they both happened so late in the proceedings, and were so minimal in extent, that it is difficult to be persuaded that they represent a demonstration of genuine contrition, nor the proffering of a full and ample apology. 

Fine

48Where a fine is to be imposed, it is necessary to consider the contemnor's financial means: s 6 Fines Act 1996.

49There is nothing specific in the evidence put before the Court which would enable a reliable assessment of the financial means of Mr Rixon.

50However, the evidence does show that on 21 May 2014, the Office of State Revenue, acting pursuant to s 100 of the Fines Act 1996, issued a ""Time to Pay Order"" with respect to a total sum of $69,126. That Order requires Mr Rixon to pay the sum of $150 per fortnight. It continues for the next 17 years until 16 January 2032. I infer from this Order that, at the time it was made, Mr Rixon did not have the financial means to pay the fines which had been imposed, and could only afford the fortnightly payments fixed in the Order.

51According to the report prepared by the Community Corrections officer, at the time of that report, Mr Rixon had secured employment undertaking work in office fit-out and air conditioning installation. Mr Rixon informed the Community Corrections officer that this work did not place him in breach of any court order. 

52Whilst there is no direct material in that report indicating the extent of the personal circumstances of Mr Rixon, it does not appear that his financial position generally is such as he would be able to afford a significant fine. 

Other relevant matters

53It is clear that the conduct which gave rise to the finding of contempt was undertaken by Mr Rixon for financial gain. That is an aggravating factor to be taken into account by the Court: s 21A(2)(o) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

54Although there are a series of mitigating factors to which reference is made in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, none of those factors have been identified as being relevant here. In particular, I am not satisfied that Mr Rixon has demonstrated any contrition or remorse, nor that he is unlikely to re-offend.

Past History and Conduct

55I have earlier referred to Mr Rixon's past history of offending and his conduct in further breaching the legislation at [33] - [41].

56I specifically note that I am not imposing any punishment in respect of that conduct. Mr Rixon has already been punished by the imposition of fines. That conduct did not form part of the facts upon which Mr Rixon was found guilty of contempt. However, the conduct is relevant to be considered in imposing a penalty for the contempt which I found because it demonstrates that weight needs to be given to the concept of specific deterrence, because it cannot be said that Mr Rixon's conduct was an isolated occurrence, nor that his prior character and conduct, entitles him to any leniency in the penalty imposed.

Endorsement

57Mr Rixon submitted that the plaintiff had not complied with the provisions of r 40.7 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (""UCPR""), and accordingly, in the circumstances, the Court was restrained from imposing a term of imprisonment for any breach by him of the Court's order. 

58Rule 40.7 of the UCPR is in the following form:

""40.7 Service of copy of judgment before committal or sequestration 

(1) A judgment is not enforceable by committal or sequestration unless: 

(a) a sealed copy of the judgment is served personally on the person bound by the judgment, and 
(b) if the judgment requires the person to do an act within a specified time, the sealed copy is so served within that time or, if that time is extended or abridged, within that time as extended or abridged. 

(2) ... 

(3) The sealed copy of the judgment must bear a notice (naming the persons concerned) that the person served is liable to imprisonment or to sequestration of property: 

(a) ..., or 
(b) ..., or 
(c) where the judgment requires the person to abstain from doing an act, if the person disobeys the judgment. 

(4) If a person liable to committal or sequestration by way of enforcement of a judgment has notice of the judgment: 

(a) by being present when the judgment is directed to be entered, or 
(b) by being notified of the terms of the judgment, whether by telephone, telegram or otherwise, 

the judgment may be enforced against that person by committal or sequestration without service having been effected in accordance with this rule. 

(5) The court may dispense with service under this rule. 

... ""

59Mr Rixon submitted that he had not been served with a sealed copy of the Court's orders which contained any endorsement of the kind described in r 40.7(3). 

60Counsel for the plaintiff accepted that the orders which were served on the defendant did not contain a notice of the kind to which r 40.7(3) referred. 

61I found in Commissioner for Fair Trading v Rixon (No.2) that Mr Rixon had received a copy of the Court's orders both before the Court made the orders, at which time he specifically indicated his consent, and then after the Court made the orders. As I there found at [9], there was no confusion at all in the mind of Mr Rixon as to what the Court had done and as to what he was, or was not, permitted to do.

62However, it is not insignificant that previously when being dealt with for breaches of the Home Building Act 1979, Mr Rixon was confronted only with a fine. 

63The infringement notices only imposed fines upon him. When he was dealt with in the Newcastle Local Court in 2013 for breaches of various provisions of the Home Building Act, the maximum penalty which could be imposed was a monetary fine of 1,000 penalty units. That is to say, $110,000 per offence. His fine for each offence did not approach the maximum which could have been imposed. 

64As I have earlier said in Rixon (No.2), I have not the slightest doubt that the conduct of Mr Rixon was deliberate and intentional, and was done with knowledge of the Court's orders. After all, he made an amateurish attempt to conceal his personal involvement in undertaking work which was unlicensed, and in other ways prohibited by the Court's Orders.

65However, the absence of the endorsement meant that Mr Rixon was not on clear notice that his conduct in breaching the orders, which were in effect to restrain a breach of the Home Building Act, could result in him receiving a term of imprisonment. 

66It is open to the Court to make an order that Mr Rixon be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, notwithstanding the absence of the notice: r 40.7(4). 

67However, as the authorities show this is a discretion which ought not be exercised lightly, and particularly as it involves the deprivation of Mr Rixon's liberty, good cause would need to be shown as to why the Court would exercise its discretion. 

68The evidence which demonstrated that the orders had been brought to Mr Rixon's attention did not suggest that although there was no endorsement of the kind required by r 40.7(3) of the UCPR, the fact that Mr Rixon was at risk of a term of imprisonment if he failed to comply with the orders, was brought to his attention in any other way.

69It was not submitted to me by the plaintiff, there was any suggestion of the risk of Mr Rixon being imprisoned contained in any covering letter, or email. Nor was there any suggestion that the issue was discussed or mentioned in any telephone conversation between officers of the Office of Fair Trading and Mr Rixon after the Orders were made.

70This is not a criticism of those involved. It simply indicates that there was no other basis for Mr Rixon to have known that being in breach of the Court's orders might result in a term of imprisonment. 

71In those circumstances, in the absence of any warning, in light of the fact that criminal offences for breaching this legislation result only in a fine, I would not be prepared to exercise my discretion to waive the requirements with respect to endorsement under r 40.7 of the UCPR.

72In so deciding, I keep firmly in mind that the plaintiff, the Office of Fair Trading and its lawyers, are well experienced in these matters, and are well experienced in what is required to comply with the UCPR. 

73However, the absence of the endorsement does not prevent the imposition of sentence which falls short of a term of immediate imprisonment: see NCR Australia Pty Ltd v The Credit Connection Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 1118 at [65] per Campbell J.

Subjective Considerations

74There is very little evidence about Mr Rixon's present subjective circumstances, except what may be gleaned from the Pre-Sentence Report of Community Corrections. He was born in 1984, and so was not yet 30 at the time he breached the Court's Orders. He was a relatively young man. He is unmarried and apparently in a stable relationship of relatively recent origin.

75I have taken all of that material into account in weighing up the penalty which is to be imposed. However, it is necessary to remark that there is nothing in Mr Rixon's subjective circumstances which explains, let alone justifies, the conduct in which he has engaged.

76The Community Corrections report recorded that he had been assessed as ""... suitable, with reservations for a Community Service Order ..."".

Appropriate Penalty

77Mr Rixon has been found guilty of contempt of court because in 24 separate ways, he has breached the orders of the Court which called upon him to refrain from conducting himself with respect to residential building work in a way which was prohibited by the legislation.

78On any view, as I have earlier pointed out, this is a most serious contempt.

79Had Mr Rixon been on clear notice of the risk that a breach of the orders may have resulted in him being sent to jail, I would have no hesitation in imposing a term of imprisonment upon him.

80However, that punishment is not available for reasons which I have earlier explained.

81Nevertheless, the significant and ongoing breach of those orders across a period of time by Mr Rixon does suggest a real need for specific deterrence. As well, the nature of the conduct is such that the principle of general deterrence is also of importance.

82However, fundamentally, Mr Rixon must be punished for deliberately breaching the Court's orders. Conduct which flaunts a court's authority is deserving of significant punishment.

83I take into account all of the matters to which I have earlier made reference. I take into account matters which may mitigate or aggravate all of the circumstances. I have determined that the appropriate way to proceed is to impose a single penalty for the whole of his contempt, including as it does 24 instances of breach of the Court's Orders. In this way, Mr Rixon will have a clear demonstration of the seriousness with which the Court regards his conduct, what will happen to him if he again conducts himself in a way which is in breach of the Court's Orders, which remain in place, until the Court otherwise orders, and so that the denunciation of his conduct and the vindication of the Court's authority can be made manifest.

Orders

84I make the following orders:

(2)I impose on Mr Rixon a term of imprisonment for a period of 18 months to commence on 19 September 2014 and to conclude on 18 March 2016.

(3)I suspend the term of imprisonment upon the following conditions:

(a)that throughout the period of the term, that Mr Rixon is of good behaviour;

(b)that throughout the period of the term, that Mr Rixon complies with the orders of the Court made on 17 April 2013;

(c)that throughout the period of the term, that Mr Rixon undertakes 300 hours of community service, which must be completed in accordance with the directions of, and to the satisfaction of, Hornsby Community Corrections Office.

(4)I direct that Mr Rixon is to report to the Hornsby Community Corrections Office at 61 Hunter Street, Hornsby no later Wednesday 24 September 2014.

(5)I order Mr Rixon to pay the plaintiff's costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis.

		19 September 2014",2014-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704461,R v Wood [2014] NSWCCA 184,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912  against a sentence imposed upon Daniel Wood (the respondent) by King SC DCJ in the District Court at Sydney on 22 November 2013. 
2The respondent seeks leave to appeal in one respect against the sentence. 
3The respondent pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial to the charge that on 22 May 2010 he did feloniously slay Mary Touma.  This is an offence of manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act contrary to s 18(1)(b) Crimes Act 1900 .  The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.  There is no standard non-parole period. 
4Proceedings on sentence commenced on 19 April 2013 when the Crown bundle which included a statement of agreed facts, was tendered and marked as the first exhibit.  They resumed before the Judge on 17 May 2013 when Sue Wood, the respondent's mother gave evidence and other material was tendered.  Mr R Jankowski of counsel appeared on both occasions for the respondent.  The proceedings were further adjourned to enable the Crown to obtain the sentencing remarks for some of the respondent's prior offences and for the respondent to file further material.  On 16 August 2013, Mr Jankowski was granted leave to withdraw as he had no further instructions. On 4 October 2013, the Judge was told that the respondent wished to withdraw his plea. 
5On 15 November 2013, Ms C Davenport SC appeared for the respondent.  Ms Davenport told the Judge that there would be no application to withdraw the plea.  Further material was tendered and after addresses, the matter was adjourned for sentence on 22 November 2013.
6After making an allowance of 5 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty, the Judge sentenced the respondent to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 10 November 2011 and to expire on 9 November 2016, with an additional term of 1 year 8 months to date from 10 November 2016 and to expire on 9 July 2018. 
7The Crown's amended notice of appeal identifies the following grounds: 
""Ground 1:  His Honour erred in his treatment of the sentencing statistics for manslaughter.
Ground 2: His Honour erred by failing to take into account the need for general deterrence. 
Ground 3: His Honour erred by failing to take into account the need for specific deterrence of the respondent. 
Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to make a finding in accordance with Veen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 that the respondent's prior criminal record meant there was a greater need for retribution, deterrence and protection of society.
Ground 5: The sentence is manifestly inadequate.""
8The respondent seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence upon the single ground that: 
""The learned sentencing Judge erred in not finding that there were 'special circumstances' permitting a variation in the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.""
Further Submissions in the Appeal 
9At the conclusion of oral submissions in this Court, the parties were granted leave to file and serve supplementary written submissions addressing the then pending judgment in the Crown appeal of R v Loveridge within 14 days of the delivery of that judgment.  Judgment was delivered on 4 July 2014: R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120. 
10Written submissions were subsequently received from both parties. As emphasised by the Crown and the respondent, the decision in Loveridge was not a guideline judgment.  However, the judgment raises matters of legal principle that are of relevance to this appeal.  
Facts
11During the sentencing proceedings, an agreed statement of facts was tendered which the Judge recited in his remarks on sentence.  A convenient summary of the facts is included in the Crown's written submissions :
""In short, the deceased, Mrs Touma (aged 71 years) left her son's delicatessen business ... at Rosebery shortly after 3:30pm on Friday, 21 May 2010 to walk to her local shopping centre to pick up a few things before walking home. The respondent (then aged 30) was riding his push-bike along the same footpath on Gardeners Road, Rosebery when he came upon the deceased who was walking in the same (easterly) direction on the footpath.  
Whilst approaching the deceased from behind the respondent was heard by witnesses to be yelling at the deceased.  He then rode past the deceased (without incident). After overtaking her, the respondent was seen to drop his bike to the ground about 10 metres further down the road, and walk back to the deceased whilst loudly swearing at her and using aggressive words. At that point the deceased had stopped walking and was just standing on the footpath.
The respondent then pushed the deceased with two open hands to her upper chest area, causing her to immediately fall backwards, striking the back of her head on the concrete footpath.  
The respondent walked back to his bike, leaving the deceased on the ground. Whilst walking back he was asked by a witness what had happened and the respondent replied, 'The bitch got in my way'.  
The respondent then got on his bike and rode off continuing on his easterly path.  
Witnesses went to the aid of the deceased, but she was unable to speak, unable to get up without assistance and vomited on several occasions.  She was also bleeding from the nose.  She lapsed into unconsciousness and was taken to hospital by ambulance but died the following day.  
Neurosurgeons opined that she had suffered ""unsurvivable brain injury"". Post mortem examination determined the cause of death as blunt force head injury.  She had sustained a large area of bruising on the middle of the back of her head, consistent with having fallen backwards and striking the back of her head.  There were extensive fractures of both orbital grooves in her head; a fractured skull at the back of her head; two bruises on her buttocks; and small abrasions on her hands.""
12It was an agreed fact that the respondent was under the influence of alcohol that he had consumed earlier on that day. 
Subjective Circumstances 
13The respondent who is of Aboriginal and Irish descent was born on 17 November 1979 and was 30 years old at the time of the offence.  The respondent's mother gave evidence before the Judge and reports from Dr Olav Nielssen, a psychiatrist, and Tim Watson-Munro, a psychologist, were tendered together with a pre-sentence report and two character references. 
14The Judge extensively considered the respondent's subjective case in his sentencing remarks.  The respondent's parents separated when he was young. The high schools he attended included Chevalier College where he was a boarder.  The respondent's mother in her evidence said her son had been subject to intense bullying that included racist remarks while at the college but he was a good student who obtained the Higher School Certificate.  The respondent's employment after he left school included working as a prison officer with the Department of Corrective Services for about four years.  The respondent told Dr Nielssen that he had been employed for 90 per cent of the time since leaving school and his employment at the time of the offence was delivering junk mail. 
15Dr Nielssen reported that the respondent began drinking alcohol at around the age of 18 and said that his pattern had become one of ""binge drinking"" over several days, followed by a week or two of abstinence.  He confirmed that ""complications of alcohol use were the role of alcohol in two of the three confrontations with the police, and the high range drinking charge"". 
16Dr Nielssen made a diagnosis of recurrent depressive illness in remission, possible bipolar mood disorder, and alcohol abuse disorder in remission. Dr Nielssen reported that the respondent had an episode of depression in the months before the offence but by the time of the offence, he had recovered and was not affected by persisting symptoms of depression. 
17Mr Watson-Munro noted the respondent's complex clinical history in the context of a complicated family dynamic, an absence of contact with his natural father until the age of 18 years with him consequently being deprived of his father's support during his difficult adolescence at Chevalier where he was a boarder and the description of a protracted Depressive Illness and an Anxiety Disorder according to DSM-IV TR criteria.  Mr Watson-Munro observed that the respondent had also self-medicated over the years and since about the age of 21 to 22 his primary drug of addiction had been alcohol. He was of the opinion that all of these issues had contributed to the respondent's offending over the years including the current matter before the court. 
18Mr Watson-Munro reported the respondent's description of having a ""nervous breakdown"" which led to him leaving his job as a prison officer. He noted that the respondent's depression and anxiety had escalated whilst in total isolation on remand due to his former employment.  He reported that the respondent had been prescribed Zoloft (200 milligrams) but required more intensive treatment than merely taking anti-depressant drugs.  Mr Watson-Munro stated that the respondent expressed considerable remorse for his actions which he believed to be genuine.  The psychologist considered that the respondent would benefit from supportive psychotherapy, in addition to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy focussed upon impulse control training and systematic desensitisation for his anxiety. 
19Graeme Banks, the author of the Probation and Parole Pre-Sentence Report, noted that the respondent appeared reluctant to discuss any details pertaining to the offence and it had been difficult to ascertain his attitude to it. Mr Banks stated that the respondent was a 33 year old man who appeared to have benefited from a supportive upbringing despite the absence of a fraternal influence in his formative years.  Mr Banks observed that the respondent appeared to have been well educated completing his schooling to Year 12 level and undertaking further studies at tertiary level.  Mr Banks recounted that the respondent indicated he had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was currently prescribed Zoloft 200mg daily. 
20The references that were tendered include a reference from the respondent's most recent employer, Richard Lord, who was the General Manager of Macarthur Pamphlet Distributors.  Mr Lord wrote that the respondent had been working for the company since December 2012 ""doing letterbox deliveries"".  Mr Lord described the respondent as being friendly, reliable and punctual and said that he worked unsupervised.  Also included in the material before the Judge was a Certificate of Service from the Department of Corrective Services which stated that the respondent had been employed by that Department from 3 July 2000 to 1 March 2004, when he had been terminated. 
21The respondent's prior criminal history includes three counts of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty and one count of common assault in 2003 for which he was fined; assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2005 for which he was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment which was suspended upon his entering into a good behaviour bond under s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999; resisting an officer which attracted a fine; wilfully obstructing an officer in the execution of his duty in 2006 for which he was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment which was suspended upon his entering into a good behaviour bond under s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; three counts of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty and resisting an officer in 2007, with 12 month good behaviour bonds being imposed under s 9 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
22His record also disclosed an offence of driving with high range PCA in January 2009.  He was ordered to perform 350 hours community service by the Local Court at Walgett for this offence on 28 July 2009. 
23The Crown tendered the facts of some of the respondent's prior offences. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2005 involved the respondent who was riding a bicycle overtaking very closely the victim who was standing on a railway platform.  The respondent was questioned by the victim about his conduct.  After maintaining he had not done anything wrong, the respondent punched the victim in the face a number of times.  He then rode off.  The victim suffered cuts to the face, severe swelling to the left side of the face and a broken nose. 
Some Findings by the Judge 
24Having viewed the CCTV footage, the Judge found that as the respondent approached the deceased from the rear, it is likely he would have been aware that she was an elderly female.  His Honour said that if the respondent did not realise that fact at that point ""it must have been patently evident to him when he alighted from his bicycle and walked the ten metres back to confront her"".
25The Judge's remarks included that the deceased was an elderly, vulnerable female going about her ordinary daily life, who was entitled to expect that she would not be confronted or assaulted in the manner that she was.  The Judge found that the respondent's conduct was unprovoked, callous and gratuitous and of such sufficient force that it caused the deceased to fall backwards and strike her head on the concrete.  
26The Judge noted that 
""[t]here have been a significant number of matters before the courts in recent years involving injuries, whether it be from a punch or some other particular application of force, which has caused victims to fall to the ground and hit their heads, occasioning such significant injuries that they have died either then or later"".  
27His Honour observed that 
""coverage of those matters by all forms of the media for such a protracted period means that any reasonable person must have realised that the act of applying sufficient force to a 71 year old female that would cause her to fall backwards was exposing her to an appreciable risk of serious injury and more serious consequences, as indeed followed"".
28His Honour remarked that the agreed facts referred to the respondent as being ""under the influence of alcohol that he had consumed earlier on that day.""  His Honour referred to a passage in Dr Nielssen's report, in which he relates being told by the respondent that he ""was going back home to get drunk but [he] hadn't started yet.""  The Judge said that according to that statement, the respondent was not likely to be affected by alcohol, however, he was bound by the agreed fact.  His Honour referred to the CCTV footage of the respondent riding his bicycle before the offence and noted that the respondent was ""entirely capable of riding a bicycle that day"".  
29The Judge determined that the respondent had a high level of moral culpability in relation to his conduct which was not diminished in any way by the agreed fact that the respondent had consumed some unknown quantity of alcohol prior to the offence. 
30His Honour found as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed against a vulnerable 71 year-old female.  He determined that there were no underlying mental health, alcohol or other issues that were in any way relevant to cause or reduce the respondent's moral culpability for a very serious incident of violence resulting in the deceased's death. 
31His Honour referred to the Victim Impact Statement that was read to the court by Mrs Soraya Thomas, a daughter of the deceased.  He said that 
""at 71, [Mrs Touma] was entitled to expect that she might live out the balance of her life with the comfort and support of her extended family for whatever period remained to her"" . 
32The Judge said that Mr Watson-Munro's report indicated 
""that despite [the respondent's] unhappy experience of bullying at Chevalier College, the [respondent] had obtained an entry score of 64 which enabled him to matriculate to the University of Western Sydney..."" (AB 27).
33In referring to Mr Watson-Munro's report of the respondent's expression of remorse, the Judge observed that the psychologist did not provide information as to how the respondent expressed ""considerable remorse."" The Judge said that the court was
""not in a position in the absence of appropriate information to make any assessment for itself as to whether the [respondent] was at the time genuinely remorseful"". 
34The Judge said that a further difficulty with the issue of remorse was that the respondent did not enter a guilty plea until the first day of the trial, which was some two and a half years from the commission of the offence and had subsequently indicated that he wished to withdraw the plea.  His Honour said that although the respondent did not eventually make such an application, this indication was inconsistent with genuine remorse. 
The Respondent's Appeal 
35It is convenient to first consider the respondent's appeal which consists of a sole ground, namely: 
""The learned sentencing Judge erred in not finding that there were 'special circumstances' permitting a variation in the statutory ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.""
Argument
36The respondent submitted that there were a number of matters which could constitute special circumstances permitting a variation between the non-parole period and the head sentence.  It was the respondent's first time in custody and there was also evidence that he had been on protection from 20 May 2013 which could be considered a special circumstance. 
37The Crown argued that the Judge considered the issue of special circumstances which was a discretionary matter.  The Crown contended that the Judge was not obliged to find special circumstances neither for the reasons advanced nor for any other reason, and the Judge's discretion had not miscarried. 
Consideration 
38During his remarks on sentence, the Judge gave careful consideration to the respondent's custodial conditions. 
39His Honour observed:
""The only information before the Court as to the condition or conditions in which the offender has served his time in protective custody is only those matters referred to by way of documentation provided. They do not evidence any harsher form of custody to being in the general population of a prison other than, clearly, the lack of association with other prisoners and the opportunity to mix with other prisoners, certainly when at the PRNA level. 
Harsher conditions to serving a sentence is a matter in respect of which the onus is on the offender to prove that the conditions are harsher. Except to the extent that I have referred to his more solitary existence, there is no evidence that protection is a harsher form of custody in respect of this offender. Indeed, being in protection may in fact alleviate general stresses and anxieties that would occur for all prisoners within the general prison population.""
40His Honour then went on to take into account the limited circumstances of isolation that he had referred to in determining the length of the sentence. 
41Later on in his sentencing remarks, the Judge said that he had considered the question of special circumstances but did not find any.
42It is well established that care should be avoided in counting any hardship of protective custody as a reason for discounting the total sentence and again as a factor establishing special circumstances: R v Lee [2000] NSWCCA 392 at [80]. 
43The respondent bore the onus of establishing that his custodial conditions were more onerous than usual. The Judge took into account the respondent's more solitary existence which he found proved in fixing the length of the sentence.  It would have been an error for the Judge to take this factor into account once again in finding special circumstances. 
44As to the respondent's first time in custody, it has often been said that this factor alone would not ordinarily constitute special circumstances: Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [36]; Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [12].  In any event, a finding of special circumstances is a discretionary finding of fact and this Court will be slow to intervene: Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 at [83]; Hudd v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 57 at [171]. 
45In the present case, no error in his Honour's approach or in the exercise of his discretion has been demonstrated.  This ground of appeal fails.  There is no other basis for the Court to uphold the respondent's appeal.  It must be dismissed.
The Crown Appeal 
46We turn now to the Crown appeal. 
Ground 1: His Honour erred in his treatment of the sentencing statistics for manslaughter.
Argument 
47The Crown submitted that the Judge erred by treating the sentencing statistics for manslaughter as constraining him in the exercise of his sentencing discretion.  The Crown contended that his Honour failed to recognise the extremely limited assistance that could be given by the statistics he had obtained.  Instead, his Honour expressly stated that he ""particularly had regard"" to what was shown in them.  The Crown further referred to the Judge's remarks ""but the Court is also constrained to provide a sentence as guided by the overall pattern of current sentencing"".  The Crown noted that the undiscounted starting point of the sentence was 7 years, which happened to correlate with the Judge's observation that for all offenders the statistics showed a mean sentence of 7 years. 
48It was submitted by the Crown that his Honour's erroneous treatment of the manslaughter statistics provides some explanation as to how a manifestly inadequate sentence was ultimately imposed.  
49The respondent contended that the Judge was clearly aware of the limitations of Judicial Commission statistics when he referred to them as a ""blunt instrument"".  The respondent submitted that in a Crown appeal, the relevant issue was whether or not the sentence is consistent with an existing pattern of sentencing.  The respondent argued that there is a very well recognised group of cases where a single punch or push has resulted in a death.  Those cases were generally characterised by the fact that there is no evidence of an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm.  The respondent submitted that the Judge was not in error in taking into account sentencing statistics for manslaughter in considering the appropriate range of sentence for this offence.
Consideration 
50The Crown's complaint focuses on the Judge's treatment of the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics and not upon his consideration of decisions in previous cases which he correctly found to be of limited assistance ""as each case turns on its own individual facts"". 
51When referring to the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics his Honour's remarks included: 
""I have referred myself to the statistics available through the Judicial Information Research System in respect of sentences imposed for manslaughter. It has often been said, particularly in the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the statistics are a blunt instrument, but they do at least provide an overview of sentencing ranges. One of the reasons why statistics are a blunt instrument is that they cannot be researched to determine what effect varying degrees of utility discounts may have had, or varying degrees of discounts given for assistance may have had. However, in respect of the 189 instances recorded in the statistics from April 2006 to March 2013, in respect of all offenders, 80% of offenders dealt with for the term of the sentence received a full term of four and a half years to ten years.  The mean was seven years."" (italics added)
52And further:
""In determining sentence, a Court must have regard to the maximum term that is provided by the legislation, but the Court is also constrained to provide a sentence as guided by the overall pattern of current sentencing. It is for that reason that I have particularly had regard to the overall pattern as shown from the available statistics"". (Italics added).
53In the passage of the sentencing remarks quoted at [51] above his Honour appears to recognise some of the limitations in use that can be made of Judicial Commission sentencing statistics.  In Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 the plurality (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) stated at [48] that sentencing consistency:
""... is not demonstrated by, and does not require, numerical equivalence. Presentation of the sentences that have been passed on federal offenders in numerical tables, bar charts or graphs is not useful to a sentencing judge. It is not useful because referring only to the lengths of sentences passed says nothing about why sentences were fixed as they were.""  
54However, it is our view that his Honour was incorrect when he said in the passage quoted at [52] above that ""the Court [was] also constrained to provide a sentence as guided by the overall pattern of current sentencing.""  Sentencing statistics do not act as a restraint in sentencing an offender but in appropriate cases may act as a yardstick against which a proposed sentence may be examined:  Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 at [41].
55Contrary to the respondent's submission, we do not consider that there is a well recognised group of cases where a single punch or push has resulted in death. As was said by the Court (Bathurst CJ, Johnson and RA Hulme JJ) in R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120 at [226] - [227]:
""There is, in truth, no range of sentences for offences of manslaughter which may be said to have a single common component relating to the mechanism of death (such as the victim's head striking the ground after a blow to the head). To the same effect, there is no range of sentences for manslaughter offences said to have been committed by use of a knife or a rock or some other implement. 
The myriad circumstances of manslaughter offences render it unhelpful to speak in terms of a range of sentences, or tariff, for a particular form of manslaughter. Gleeson CJ made this clear in R v Blacklidge (see [193] above), in a passage cited regularly in cases such as R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520 at 530 [40]."" 
56The limited assistance that may be derived from Judicial Commission sentencing statistics is diminished in the case of manslaughter because the offence covers such a wide variety of circumstances.  The use of statistical information in manslaughter cases has been described as not illuminating in any decisive manner the decision to be reached: R v BW [2011] NSWCCA 176 at [61]; Goundar v R [2012] NSWCCA 87 at [44] - [45].  Reliance on such data has also been said in manslaughter cases to be ""unhelpful and even dangerous"": R v Vongsouvanh; R v Namalauulu [2004] NSWCCA 158 at [ REF _Ref398109954 \r \h 38]. 
57In the present case, the Judge analysed the sentencing statistics for manslaughter and arrived at a mean of 7 years for a full term of imprisonment.  The starting point of the sentence that his Honour ultimately imposed was 7 years after allowing a discount of 5 per cent for the plea of guilty. 
58In our view, the particular regard that his Honour had to the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics was an error.  His sentencing discretion was neither constrained nor guided by an overall pattern shown from the statistical material for manslaughter. 
59We consider that sentencing statistics for manslaughter offences are of such limited assistance to sentencing Judges that they should be avoided. 
60We would uphold Ground 1 of the appeal. 
Ground 2: His Honour erred by failing to take into account the need for general deterrence. 
Ground 3:  Honour erred by failing to take into account the need for specific deterrence of the respondent. 
Argument 
61It is convenient to deal with these grounds of appeal together.  The Crown contended that at no point in his sentencing remarks did the Judge refer to the need for general deterrence and that the bare reference to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was insufficient in the circumstances of the case.  The Crown submitted that the Judge did not give any weight to general deterrence, nor did his Honour recognise the need for general deterrence. 
62The Crown pointed out that the Judge did not refer to the need for specific deterrence which the Crown said was a very significant consideration.  The Crown referred to the respondent's lack of remorse, to his history of reacting to situations with aggression and violence, and to his well established alcohol consumption issues. 
63The respondent argued that the lack of reference by the Judge to general and specific deterrence did not mean that it had not been taken into account.  The respondent referred to his Honour's regard to s 3A which includes both specific and general deterrence.  The respondent contended that the undiscounted starting point of the sentence was towards the top of the range for an offence of this kind.  The respondent submitted that if that argument was accepted, it provided further support that his Honour took into account general and specific deterrence. 
64When referring to the decision in Loveridge on the issues of specific and general deterrence, the respondent submitted that the remarks of the Court were directed to 'alcohol-fuelled violence' and in the present appeal the Judge had placed considerable weight on the respondent's history of violence. 
Consideration 
65This Court has observed on many occasions that 'single-blow' manslaughter cases (by unlawful and dangerous act) are not rare in this State and need to be addressed by sentences that reflect the element of general deterrence: R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; (2010) 77 NSWLR 45; Loveridge at [103].
66The need for general deterrence is not confined to alcohol fuelled violence but includes gratuitous, unprovoked violence on the streets, whether in city centres, or residential areas.  People have the right to expect that their streets will be safe:  Attorney General's Reference No 60 of 2009 (Appleby and Ors) [2009] EWCA Crim 2693; [2010] 2 Cr App R(S) 46 cited with favour in Loveridge at [209]-[210]; R v McKenna [2007] NSWCCA 113 at [2].
67This expectation gathers importance as the number of aged and vulnerable persons in our community increases.  It must be clearly understood that violence towards the elderly will not be tolerated. In the circumstances of the present offence, a strong element of general deterrence was called for. 
68His Honour did not expressly refer to general and specific deterrence but stated that ""... he must have regard to s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999"". 
69Section 3A relevantly includes as a purpose of sentencing:
""(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences. 
...
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender.""
70Although it appears that his Honour acknowledged the principle of general deterrence in a general way by referring to s 3A, the sentence, in our view, did not make any allowance for this significant sentencing principle. 
71As to the issue of specific deterrence, the Judge was unable to conclude that the respondent was remorseful or contrite. No finding was made that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation. The respondent had callously walked away from Mrs Touma after she struck her head on the ground and he told a witness that ""the bitch got in my way"".  In these circumstances, specific deterrence could not be ignored. The impact that the respondent's prior criminal history might have on specific deterrence is considered in Ground 4. 
72The facts of this offence required the Judge to emphasise the importance of general and specific deterrence, rather than make an oblique reference to s 3A. 
73In our view, the sentence imposed does not reflect the significance that general and specific deterrence ought to have played in the proper exercise of his Honour's sentencing discretion.  The Crown has established error in accordance with the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505 as his Honour failed to properly take into account these material considerations. 
74We would uphold Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal. 
Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to make a finding in accordance with Veen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 that the respondent's prior criminal record meant there was a greater need for retribution, deterrence and protection of society.  
Argument 
75The Crown submitted that the Judge had before him the facts of the respondent's prior violent offending and although he noted the Crown's submission in accordance with Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; (1987 - 1988) 164 CLR 465 in his sentencing remarks, the Crown complained that his Honour erred by not making a finding that as a consequence there was a greater need for retribution, deterrence and protection of the community.  It is the Crown case that the Judge did not give any weight to this consideration. 
76The respondent contended that his prior history of offences involving personal violence needed to be kept in perspective. None of the offences carried a maximum penalty of over 5 years, all had been dealt with in the Local Court and full-time custodial sentences had not been imposed.  The respondent submitted that the Judge's sentencing remarks indicated that the Judge had taken into account the respondent's prior criminal history and the weight his Honour gave to factors such as his criminal record was a matter of discretion. 
Consideration 
77Section 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence includes:
""(d) the offender has a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences)""
78Under s 21A(6), a ""serious personal violence offence"" is a personal violence offence within the meaning of s 4 Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 that is punishable by imprisonment for life or a term of 5 years or more.  None of the respondent's prior offences fell within the definition of a serious personal violence offence. 
79Nevertheless, his Honour was entitled to have regard to the respondent's history of criminal offending so as to give more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: Veen (No 2); R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566.
80During his sentencing remarks the Judge said that the respondent's past criminal record ""certainly indicates past belligerence, aggression and violence"". When referring to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2005, his Honour said:  
""The facts on one previous occasion bear some similarity to the current offence in that the [respondent], at a railway station while taking his bicycle over an overpass, proceeded for no apparent reason to assault a traveller who had alighted from the train, the assault causing a broken nose.""
81As the Judge said, the respondent's assault on the railway traveller bore similarity to the assault upon Mrs Touma.  Both were strangers to him and were assaulted for no apparent reason.  Each of the victims were in public places and were entitled to expect that they would be safe from unprovoked violence. 
82Another matter that was relevant to the issue of specific deterrence was that the respondent had only completed the 350 hour community service order for the high range drink driving offence committed at Walgett in 2009 shortly before he committed the present offence. 
83His Honour, however, did not make a specific finding as to the impact that the respondent's prior criminal record had on the sentence. This fortifies our view that his Honour did not have proper regard to specific deterrence. The offender's prior offending provided a further reason for the Judge to emphasise the importance of specific deterrence in the sentence. 
84We would uphold Ground 4 of the appeal. 
Ground 5: The sentence is manifestly inadequate 
Argument
85The Crown submitted that the starting point of 7 years for manslaughter in the aggravating circumstance of it being committed upon an obviously elderly victim was manifestly inadequate compared with the maximum penalty of 25 years.  The Crown argued that there was little operating in the respondent's favour and that general and specific deterrence were key considerations that needed to be reflected in the sentence. It was contended that the errors identified in the grounds of appeal, both individually and in combination contributed to the manifest inadequacy of the sentence.  
86The respondent referred to the starting point of the head sentence in the order of 7 years and to what were said to be reports of similar cases that had been provided to the Judge.  Reference was also made to the Judicial Commission sentencing statistics with the median sentence being 7 years. The respondent submitted that the head sentence was at the high end of the pattern of sentences and the Crown had not established that the respondent's sentence was 'unreasonable or plainly unjust.' The respondent contended that the decision in Loveridge does not provide support for the Crown's complaint of manifest inadequacy as there were present in that case a large number of aggravating factors which did not apply to the present appeal, apart from the respondent's prior history of violence. 
Consideration 
87As previously stated, the other sentencing decisions and Judicial Commission sentencing statistics are of little assistance in this case. 
88The circumstances surrounding Mrs Touma's death make this a serious offence of manslaughter. More than a push was involved. The respondent rode past Mrs Touma on his bicycle without incident and after overtaking her, dropped his bicycle to the ground. He walked a distance of about ten metres back to Mrs Touma whilst loudly swearing at her and using aggressive words.  He knew that she was an elderly woman who had done nothing to provoke his aggression. 
89The respondent's conduct must have terrified Mrs Touma, who had stopped walking.  The respondent then pushed her with two open hands to the upper chest area, causing her immediately to fall to the ground.  He callously walked away and falsely blamed Mrs Touma for his actions. 
90Although the Judge correctly found that the respondent's moral culpability was high, we do not consider that either the objective gravity of the offence or the respondent's high moral culpability is adequately reflected in the sentence.  Furthermore, the principles of general and specific deterrence were not properly taken into account. 
91In the circumstances of this offence we are satisfied that the starting point of 7 years imposed was manifestly inadequate.  This conclusion is not founded upon the view that if any of us had been the sentencing Judge, a greater sentence would have been imposed in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; (1999) 195 CLR 665 at 671-672. The Crown has established each of the grounds of appeal including ground 5. 
Re-sentence?
92The question remains as to whether the Court should intervene and re-sentence the respondent. There is a residual discretion to decline to interfere even though the sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
93In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, the majority (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) observed at [1] that the primary purpose of Crown appeals was to ""lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"".  Their Honours at [36] described the primary purpose of laying down principles as a ""limiting purpose"" and said:
""It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion."" 
94Their Honours observed at [43] that other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown Appeal is allowed.  Their Honour's said at [43]: 
""They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of the re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.""
95The Crown submitted that in the present case, the circumstances do not require the Court in the exercise of its residual discretion to allow a manifestly inadequate sentence to stand.  The Crown said that public interest in the proper administration of criminal justice requires that the Court intervene.  Another submission was that the case potentially fulfills the criteria of laying down important principles for the governance and guidance of courts with respect to violence committed against members of the public in public places, particularly where members of the public are vulnerable by reason of age or for other reasons. 
96No specific submission was made on the respondent's behalf as to the exercise of the Court's residual discretion but three affidavits were tendered in the event of re-sentence. 
97In an affidavit affirmed on 30 May 2014, the respondent refers to the uncertainty that he has experienced since hearing of the Crown's appeal. He states that when he was in the Cooma Correctional Centre he was doing really well and had been taken off the anti-depressant Zoloft.  However, in February this year, he was starting not to feel good and had requested to go back on Zoloft, but was waiting to see the psychiatrist. He said that he was feeling manic and could not concentrate. 
98The respondent recounts that he signed himself into protection because of a threatening letter found in his cell at the Cooma Correctional Centre and was placed in segregation at the Goulburn Correctional Centre until he was transferred to Bathurst.  He refers to the support of his mother, his family and friends at Walgett and his feelings of loneliness as his family in Walgett find it too far to travel.  The respondent has recently applied to the University of Southern Queensland through the Australian Indigenous Knowledge program to study Geology or Geography in the Semester 2 intake but says that he will need to be on medication before the course starts. 
99Sue Wood, the respondent's mother, in an affidavit affirmed on 11 June 2014 states that she continues to regularly have contact with her son either by prison visists, telephone conversations or letters. She refers to the deterioration in her son's mental health after the Crown appeal.  She observed that he is depressed, the sparkle in his eyes has gone, and he has lost weight. 
100Annexed to Vanessa Carmody-Smith's affidavit affirmed 6 June 2014 is a letter from the University of Western Sydney as to the respondent's University attendance in 1998 when he was enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts - Communication Studies Course and a copy of an email confirming the assessment of the respondent's application at the University of Southern Queensland for Semester 2.  Ms Carmody-Smith is the applicant's solicitor. 
101In our view, the proper administration of justice does not support the exercise of the residual discretion. Guidance to sentencing judges that may be provided by this decision includes the need for general deterrence when elderly or vulnerable persons are attacked in public places.  Public confidence in the justice system would not be served by allowing a sentence that was manifestly inadequate to stand nor would the requirement for general and specific deterrence. 
102We have regard to the effect that the Crown appeal has had particularly on the mental health of the respondent but there has been no delay on the part of the Crown in prosecuting the appeal.  We are satisfied that the residual discretion should not be exercised and the respondent should be re-sentenced. 
103The maximum penalty for manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.  The maximum penalty is a legislative guidepost, and serves as an indication of the relative seriousness of the offence: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
104For the purpose of re-sentencing, the objective and subjective considerations to be taken into account are clear from what has been written to this point. No complaint was made by the respondent as to the Judge's finding that his high level of moral culpabilty for the offence was not diminished in anyway by the agreed fact that the respondent had consumed some unknown quantity of alcohol prior to the offence.  Furthermore, the respondent did not challenge his Honour's conclusion that there were no underlying mental health, alcohol or other issues that were in anyway relevant to reduce his moral culpability.  His Honour's determination that he was unable to assess whether the respondent was genuinely remorseful was not criticised by the respondent nor was the absence of a finding as to the respondent's prospects of rehabilition.  We adopt all of these matters in re-sentencing the respondent, save to say that the respondent has taken some steps towards rehabilitation since he has been in custody. 
105It is evident from the respondent's affidavit that he has spent only some of his time in protective custody.  It is appropriate to take into account the time spent in protective custody, as his Honour did, in determining the length of the sentence. 
106The undiscounted starting point of the sentence which this court is to impose should be 12 years imprisonment.  The Judge discounted the sentence by 5 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty.  We propose to apply the same discount.  This would provide a total sentence, rounded slightly, of 11 years and 4 months.  
107In the exercise of our sentencing discretion, and in light of the evidence now before the court, we are persuaded to find special circumstances being the need for a longer period of supervision to address the respondent's alcohol abuse and psychiatric problems.  We have determined that a non-parole period of 8 years is the minimum period that the respondent must spend in custody in order to appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [63].  The balance of term should be 3 years and 4 months.  
108Accordingly, the Court makes the following orders:
(a)Leave granted to the respondent to appeal;
(b)respondent's appeal dismissed;
(c)Crown appeal allowed;
(d)Sentence imposed in the District Court of New South Wales on 22 November 2013 is quashed; 
(e)In lieu thereof, sentence the respondent to imprisonment for 11 years 4 months consisting of a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 10 November 2011, and expiring on 9 November 2019 with a balance of term of 3 years 4 months commencing on 10 November 2019 and expiring on 9 March 2023.
(f)The earliest date that the respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 9 November 2019.

		19 September 2014",2014-09-18 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704478,R v Hunt [2014] NSWSC 1919,"Judgment


	
	On the evening of Friday, 19 July 2013, a party was held at a home in the township of Gilgandra. The hosts were Jade Hunt, to whom it is convenient to refer as the offender, and her partner, a young man to whom it is convenient to refer as the principal. I am satisfied that, by midnight, many of the guests, along with the offender, were very intoxicated by alcohol. One of the people present was John Frail, to whom I shall refer as the deceased.
	


Objective features of the offence


	
	At some stage after midnight the deceased was asked to leave the premises. He did so, but returned at about 2:40 AM and banged on the front door. He became involved in an argument with the sister of the principal. The principal came out of the house and engaged in a physical fight with the deceased. The offender was herself outside, and was in a position to observe events as they unfolded. So were a number of other persons.
	
	
	The principal re-entered the home and armed himself with a large kitchen knife. He came back out to the deceased, and, to state things bluntly, stabbed him to death. The offender saw that occur, and immediately formed the view that the injuries inflicted by the principal upon the deceased were fatal ones.
	
	
	Whilst others were seeking to assist the deceased, the offender re-entered the home. There she tidied up sundry cans of alcoholic drinks. More importantly, she also washed, scrubbed and dried the knife that she had just seen her lover use to stab a man to death. When asked by another woman what she was doing, the offender replied “[T]rying to get the blood off the knife”.
	
	
	After that, neither the principal nor the offender took any steps to flee the township. Instead, they agreed between the two of them that they would tell the police the completely false story that, at the time of the killing, they were both asleep in bed. Remarkably, having agreed upon that way forward, they remained at the scene, and went to sleep in the bedroom.
	
	
	The police confronted the two of them at about 7 AM. They arrested the principal and charged him with murder. When questioned at the scene about the events that had occurred earlier that morning, the offender told the police the planned lie that she and the principal were asleep in bed at the relevant time. And at about 8:30 AM at Gilgandra Police Station, she confirmed that lie in a written statement to police that contained the well-known acknowledgement of the truth of its contents, an acceptance of the possibility of punishment if it be false, and the signature of the offender.
	
	
	However, at the end of the statement, the offender said to the police “[I]t’s not the truth. I don’t want to get him into trouble”. She was allowed to leave but returned to the police station at about 10:30 AM on 20 July 2013. At that stage, she made a second statement and entered into a recorded interview that was in conformity with it. To state the effect of that combined version succinctly, it was that she saw the physical confrontation between the principal and the deceased, thereafter she saw blood coming from the person of the deceased, but she neither saw the principal armed with a knife nor took any steps to clean a knife. Although largely the truth, that statement was peppered with a number of outright lies.
	
	
	At that stage she was charged with being an accessory after the fact to murder, and was bail refused. She has been in custody ever since.
	
	
	A few days later, whilst in custody, the offender completed a Victim Services Counselling Form. She naively acknowledged that she had seen the deceased “stabbed in the arm and neck”, and that “she washed the knife used to stab [the deceased]”.
	
	
	Many months later, on 1 July 2014, the offender engaged in an induced interview. On that occasion, although she provided more details about the fatal events, including her cleaning of the murder weapon, at her request she was not asked any questions about the details of the assault committed by the principal. That was because her solicitor had informed the investigating detective that his instructions were that the offender was “too upset” to discuss those matters. On 14 August 2014, she engaged in an induced statement that confirmed the correctness of the contents of the induced recorded interview.
	
	
	On 22 August 2014, the offender gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence conducted before me. In cross-examination by the learned Crown Prosecutor, she gave details of precisely what she had observed the principal to do when he attacked the deceased. On the same day she signed an undertaking that she would give evidence in accordance with the induced interview of 1 July 2014, and the subsequent induced statement.
	
	
	The position of the offender on oath before me was that, although she could clearly observe the fatal actions of the principal, she could not describe in any detail the actions of the deceased at the time of the stabbing. Although at one stage I expressed to both counsel my suspicion that that claim was a lie designed to provide the principal with “room to move” at any subsequent trial, on reflection I have come to accept on the balance of probabilities that, in the sudden and violent circumstances, the offender was focused on the actions of her partner, and was in no position to observe what others were doing.
	
	
	In short, the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder is made out if a person, knowing or believing that the offence of murder has been committed, intentionally assists the murderer to evade justice. There was no dispute between the parties that, at the time she washed the knife, the offender was so acting. Nor was there any dispute that the lie told orally at the scene later that morning to police, and confirmed in the first statement to them, forms part of the particulars of the offence.
	
	
	As for the latter statement and interview of 20 July 2013, in which the offender spoke of the assault committed by the principal and of the injuries to the deceased, but deliberately failed to mention the knife, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were motivated by an intention that the principal evade justice. I therefore put them to one side as being explicit foundations of the criminality of the offender. That is because I consider that there is a reasonable possibility that that lie was told not to hide the crime of the principal in stabbing the deceased, but rather the crime of the offender in washing the knife.
	
	
	The foregoing summary of the objective features of the criminality of the offender is based upon agreed facts that were placed before me, supplemented by other materials, some of which were the subject of unsuccessful objection by defence counsel, but none of which were disputed by way of cross-examination. My approach generally to the determination of all facts in dispute is that matters of aggravation must be proven against the offender beyond reasonable doubt; matters in mitigation need only be proven in her favour on the balance of probabilities.
	


Seriousness of the offence


	
	The offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period. That maximum penalty, the greatest known to the criminal law except for imprisonment for life, demonstrates the gravity with which Parliament regards the crime of knowingly and intentionally assisting a murderer to escape justice. I regard that maximum penalty as an important guidepost in my sentencing discretion. Quite apart from that, it must be accepted that the moral culpability of any person who engages in such behaviour is extremely high.
	
	
	Having said that, it is clear that the murder committed by the principal was completely unplanned and spontaneous. The offender had no idea that it was going to occur. In a panic, she washed the knife in a primitive attempt to remove scientific evidence, but did not otherwise dispose of the weapon. Nor did she or the principal flee the scene. Instead, they simply went to sleep in the premises, perhaps somehow hoping that the catastrophe that had occurred would simply disappear. It is true that the lies she told at the scene and in the first statement later that morning were not spontaneous, and were the product of a pre-arranged plan with the principal. But in truth they were utterly futile, because five or 10 other persons had witnessed the fatal stabbing. In short, although the crime of being an accessory after the fact to murder is a very serious one, this particular example of that crime falls at the less serious end of the spectrum of objective criminality.
	


Subjective features


	
	Turning from the circumstances of the offence to the circumstances of the life and character of the offender, she pleaded guilty to the offence in the Local Court before committal. There is no dispute between the parties that she should receive a discount on her sentence of 25%, in order to reflect the usefulness to the criminal justice system of that approach.
	
	
	Separately, in the induced interview on 1 July 2014, the offender became upset on more than one occasion. Apparently whilst in custody she has conducted some sort of memorial service for the deceased. On oath she expressed her remorse for what she had done, and I consider that she was sincere in so doing. Although, in light of her proven readiness to lie to persons in authority in general and about this matter in particular, I have approached her statements cautiously, I accept on the balance of probabilities that the offender has come to understand the gravity of her actions, and bitterly regrets them.
	
	
	The offender was born on 26 December 1994. That means that, at the time of the offence, she was aged 18 years and 6 months, and she is now aged 19 years and 9 months. The evidence about her life comes from various sources, including the evidence of the offender on oath, a presentence report, and a detailed psychological report. Again, despite my caution, I accept the following on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The life of the offender up until now has been completely free from good fortune or privilege. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that this young woman has suffered a deplorable upbringing.
	
	
	The offender is the eldest of 11 half brothers and sisters. Her parents separated when she was very young, and her father was an intravenous drug user. Her mother was neglectful and abusive towards her. She would often inflict beatings with various household objects upon her daughter. Quite apart from that, her mother was dependent on prescription medication, and suffered from psychological problems. As a child the offender moved around a lot and attended more than 10 primary schools. The result was that she was unable to establish firm childhood friendships, and was the victim of bullying. When she was eight years old the Department of Community Services became involved in caring for her. At the age of 11, she was sexually assaulted by one of her mother’s partners. In due course she was placed in foster care by the Department. That was not satisfactory either; by that stage the behaviour of the offender had become defiant and aggressive, and she frequently absconded.
	
	
	She left school effectively in year eight, though it seems that she has subsequently obtained her school certificate through TAFE. Since then she has been employed very briefly in a number of roles, but was incapable of holding down a full-time job.
	
	
	At 14 years of age she was sexually assaulted by an unknown male. Shortly after that, she worked as a sex worker for several months in Sydney, when she was only a girl.
	
	
	At the age of 16 years, she moved into accommodation with the principal. The relationship was highly unstable, and featured each of them physically abusing the other. In 2013 she gave birth to a child, of whom the principal was not the father. That baby was promptly removed from her care by the Department of Community Services.
	
	
	It appears that since the age of 12 the offender has made multiple attempts to commit suicide, and has in the past harmed herself.
	
	
	Despite her youth, the offender has a long-standing problem with drugs and alcohol. She commenced drinking and smoking cannabis at the age of 12. She began using crystal methylamphetamine at the age of 14 after the sexual assault and while working as a sex worker. She has also abused prescription medication over the years. By the time of the offence, the offender was regularly drinking stupendous amounts of alcohol. I have no doubt that the abuse of all of those substances is an effort on her part to blunt the psychological pain that she suffers as a result of the events that occurred in her life when she was a child and teenager. I interpolate to say that at the time of the commission of the offence the offender was well intoxicated by alcohol; of course, in accordance with s 21A(5AA) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), I do not take that into account as a mitigating factor.
	
	
	In custody, the offender has been on strict protection as a result of threats made in the community and in gaol that are seemingly related to her offending. She informed me from the witness box that the effect of that has been to severely limit access to drug and alcohol counselling, despite her enthusiasm to seek help in that regard.
	
	
	At the time of the offences, the offender had no criminal record as an adult. When she was 14 years old a larceny charge was dismissed with a caution in the Children’s Court. When she was 15 years old she was cautioned in the same Court for driving without a licence, and received a six month bond for taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner. It seems that she has spent a short time in a juvenile detention centre in the past. In January of this year she was convicted without penalty by the Local Court of a number of driving offences arising from the one incident committed less than two weeks before the offence under discussion. In those circumstances, I am prepared to approach the sentencing exercise on the basis that the offender has no relevant criminal record.
	
	
	I have approached the background of the offender in accordance with the principles explained by the High Court of Australia in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 and Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600. In short, I regard her greatly deprived upbringing, the psychological problems to which it has led, and her prior good character as significantly mitigating the sentence that should be imposed.
	


Assistance


	
	I turn to the topic of the assistance given by the offender to the authorities about the crime of the principal. Counsel for the offender sought a discount for the usefulness of her plea of guilty, past assistance, and future assistance. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that any past assistance purportedly given was in truth worthless, and expressed caution about the value of the foreshadowed future assistance.
	
	
	I have already indicated that there should be a 25% discount for the value of the plea of guilty. As for any past assistance, I have considered all of the factors in s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I regard any assistance given in the past (and by that I mean, before the induced recorded interview of 1 July 2014 that forms part of the undertaking) as having negligible value, if not no value at all. The first version given by the offender that implicated the principal made no mention of the murder weapon, surely a crucial matter, and featured many brazen lies. Nor did the offender say a word about what she had done with that weapon. Many other witnesses saw the attack in any event. Because of my assessment of the past assistance as being of negligible or no value, I do not consider that there should be any discount for past assistance.
	
	
	As for future assistance, to the extent that it is founded on the undertaking, the induced recorded interview of 1 July 2014, and the subsequent statement, they also suffer from the defect that, at the time of the interview, the offender could not or would not give details of the nub of the prosecution case against the principal. However, things were different when the offender gave evidence before me on oath. In cross-examination, she gave precise details of what she saw the principal actually do to the deceased. As I have said, I accept on the balance of probabilities that her inability to describe the actions of the deceased at the time reflects the truth. I also accept the submission of the Crown Prosecutor that, at any trial of the principal, her evidence will be under serious attack by defence counsel, chiefly because of her lies and dishonest omissions in the past. Nevertheless, I consider that the fact that this woman, who still deeply loves the principal (a topic to which I shall return in a moment), is able and willing to give detailed evidence implicating him in the most serious criminal offence will permit the Crown to submit to a jury that her evidence should be given great weight. I have assessed the proposed future assistance as quite significant and useful in any such trial of the principal.
	
	
	I also accept on the balance of probabilities that the final version given by the offender on oath before me is truthful and complete; that by its nature and extent it has the potential to assist the Crown quite markedly in any murder trial of the principal; that, although delayed by many months, it nevertheless precedes any such trial; that, other than the discount under consideration, no benefit has accrued to the offender; that there is no evidence of the offender suffering harsher conditions of custody as a result of the assistance; that there is no evidence of any injury or danger of injury to the offender or her family; and, finally, that the assistance is to do with an offence related to the offence that the offender committed. Weighing up all of those matters, I assess the future assistance that she has solemnly promised to give as deserving of a not insubstantial discount.
	
	
	Applying what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in LB v R [2013] NSWCCA 70 (the most recent decision on this question to which my attention was invited by the parties), I have come to the view that there should be a global discount of one third upon the sentence that I would have imposed upon the offender. That discount reflects the value of her plea of guilty, any past assistance, and future assistance. To be clear, that discount is made up of a 25% discount for the plea of guilty, no discount for past assistance, and a little over 8% for the assistance proposed to be given.
	


Prospects of rehabilitation


	
	As for the future, I think that one is entitled to approach it with a very guarded optimism. In the witness box the offender impressed me as a forthright and not unintelligent young woman. She has been unable to drink to excess for well over a year, and that may perhaps be something of a circuit breaker. She is proud of her Aboriginal heritage. As I have said, the offender is not burdened by extensive prior criminality. On release, she plans to go and live with her grandmother well away from Gilgandra, and I accept that that lady is not suffering from problems with drugs and alcohol. The offender has expressed a firm desire to obtain help with her psychological condition and her substance abuse problems, and in due course regain custody of her young son. As for the longer term, the offender has begun to think that she may like to try to become a youth worker in the future.
	
	
	There is one sharply discordant note. Although they are physically separated by their incarceration, the offender and the principal are a couple. Her counsel, on my enquiry, described her as “totally in love” with the man whom she saw brutally murder the deceased. Whilst that approach of the offender is understandable in light of her psychologically battered state, itself a result of her loveless upbringing, one must seriously doubt whether the maintenance of that relationship will foster the rehabilitation of the offender over the years ahead. Having sounded that loud note of caution, I nevertheless possess a degree of optimism about the possibility that this young woman will be able to rehabilitate herself after this disastrous turn of events.
	


Sentencing for the offence of accessory after the fact to murder


	
	Both parties helpfully invited me to previous sentences imposed for this offence, both at first instance and in the Court of Criminal Appeal. I was provided with sufficient material to understand the background of the sentences imposed, and not just their raw lengths and structures. Of course, those sentences do not constitute a range that binds me in some way. Each case, of course, turns upon its own facts. That is especially the case with regard to the offence under consideration, which is well known to be committed in a multitude of circumstances. Nevertheless, that material represents the accumulated wisdom of sentencing judges of this court with regard to the offence that has been placed before me.
	
	
	There is no question in my mind that the criminal conduct of the offender calls for the imposition of a significant term of imprisonment. Her conduct in knowingly and intentionally seeking to assist a murderer constituted a heartless contempt for the fact that a fellow human being had been stabbed to death in her presence. That fact, combined with the maximum penalty created by Parliament, leads me inevitably to the view that no penalty other than a sentence of full-time imprisonment would be appropriate.
	
	
	However, this 19-year-old woman, acting spontaneously and motivated by love, effectively free of prior criminality, grossly deprived as a child, having accepted her guilt promptly, and having offered to assist the authorities to convict the man whom she loved and loves, places through her counsel a compelling subjective case before the Court. Furthermore, there is no question in my mind that special circumstances have been established that call for a significant reduction in the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period. In the circumstances that I have outlined, Ms Hunt will need a great deal of help and time and supervision to rebuild her life after her release from custody.
	
	
	I do not propose mechanistically to conclude by stating the aggravating and mitigating features that I have taken into account for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. These remarks on sentence fulfil that role.
	
	
	Without the discounts to which I have referred, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for four years.
	


Imposition of sentence


	
	Jade Hunt, you are convicted of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder. I sentence you to a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months, to date from 20 July 2013. There will be a parole period of 1 year 4 months that expires on 19 March 2016. To express my order another way, the offender is sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years 8 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months.
	
	
	The offender is to be released on parole upon the expiration of her non-parole period on 19 November 2014.

		20 April 2016",2014-09-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704483,RCW v R (No 2) [2014] NSWCCA 190,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2ADAMS J: At the hearing of the appeal, I joined in orders that the appellant should be admitted to bail. I did so on the basis that it was clear that he should not spend further time in prison. I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hulme J in draft and I agree with his Honour's disposition of the grounds of appeal, for the reasons his Honour has given. However, I would prefer to approach the resentencing exercise somewhat differently, which would result in different sentence. 

3My starting point is the distinction to be made on the one hand between the actions of the offender before he, in substance, withdrew from the offending and did all that was within his power to frustrate the object of the importation offence and, on the other, the assistance which he provided to the authorities after his arrest. In my respectful view, the former actions, taken as a whole, comprise the objective features that, together with the subjective features and the other elements of the sentencing calculus, such as general and personal deterrence, give rise to the appropriate sentence. The later assistance such as making a statement and agreeing to give evidence is, I would agree, in a distinct category warranting a utilitarian discount on conventional principles. The objective seriousness of the appellant's crime necessarily, to my mind, reflects all that the offender did in respect of the offence. This includes his attempts to ensure that the crime in which he had been complicit was unsuccessful in achieving its objective, namely the safe completion of the importation and its availability for distribution. 

4The approach of the learned sentencing judge was to derive a starting point from seriousness of the appellant's criminal activity before his withdrawal and subsequent attempts to frustrate the objectives of the offence of which he was an accessory and then apply a discount for assistance to the authorities to the resulting sentence. In my respectful view, this truncated approach to the appellant's actions was artificial and in principle wrong. It is not a sufficient answer, as I think, to propose that it is enough to give the appellant a very substantial discount (even leaving aside the limits which have apparently been placed on the extent of such discounts) on the basis that here his assistance was far greater that conventionally seen and hence derive a lesser sentence than that ultimately imposed. The discount reflects objective public policy considerations which have nothing to do with the personal desserts of the offender. Here, it is at least arguable that the applicant's assistance was somewhat less objectively necessary as the police were already aware of the importation and its perpetrators and would have been in a position, without the appellant's help, to bring it to an end before the drugs had been on supplied. Accordingly, the appellant might not obtain the fair reckoning of his criminality, looking at his offence from his point of view - he was not aware when he went to the police that they were well aware of it. Treating his withdrawal and attempt to frustrate the objects of the offence merely as an attempt, as it were, to make good the crime he had committed rather than part and parcel of the objective criminality of his offence is to draw an artificial distinction leading to the unjust consequence of overestimating the seriousness of his offence. In this case, the high starting point was not, with respect, appropriately adjusted at all events by an adequate discount (which might have resulted in an appropriately lenient sentence.) 

5So considered, the objective seriousness of the appellant's criminality was very low indeed. Looking at other considerations, general and personal deterrence are immaterial as Hulme J points out. It follows from what I have said that I am, with respect, unable to agree that the starting point, before the discounts for plea and assistance, of four years' imprisonment is appropriate.

6I would not wish to complicate too much the approach to circumstances such as the present, which seem to me to be sui generis. Perhaps it is unnecessary to be so analytical and, rather, approach the sentencing of the offender by asking simply what does the administration of criminal justice require to be done to him and accept that justice and public policy intermix in a ways that are not strictly logical and susceptible to close analysis. If this were to be done, I would find it very difficult to accept that the appellant deserved any significant gaol time at all. Amongst other things, it is difficult to see what public purpose would be served by such a sentence. In short, I would prefer to give effect to this conclusion by going immediately to the appropriate result.

7As will already have been gathered, leaving aside other issues with the sentencing process, I consider the sentence under appeal, with respect, to be manifestly excessive. The appropriate sentence at first instance would have been one of 12 months imprisonment with a direction under s 21(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) that the appellant be released immediately upon giving the requisite security. This sentence takes into account the entirety of the appellant's actions together with the relevant public policy considerations. However, we have been overtaken by events. Accordingly, I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, the sentence be quashed and the appellant sentenced to a term equivalent to that which he had served prior to his release on bail. 

8R A HULME J: RCW (the applicant) applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court at Gosford on 10 October 2013 by his Honour Judge Ellis.

9For an offence of aiding and abetting the attempted importation of commercial quantities of border controlled drugs the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years. This was after allowing a discount of 50 per cent from a starting point of 11 years for the applicant's early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. The sentence was specified to commence on 14 July 2013 in order to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 13 August 2016.

10The offence is contrary to ss 11.1, 11.2 and 307.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth). The maximum penalty is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of $825,000.

Facts

11A detailed statement of agreed facts was tendered before the learned judge. It revealed that on 30 December 2011, Canadian authorities detected the secretion of a variety of drugs within a commercial oven that was consigned by air cargo to an Italian restaurant at The Entrance on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The drugs were removed and the consignment was allowed to proceed. It arrived in Sydney on 7 January 2012. 

12The drugs comprised 3.96 kg of pure cocaine, 2.25kg of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 3.79kg of para-methoxymethamphetamine and 1.34kg of methamphetamine. The total street value of the drugs was estimated to range from about $5.1 million to $8.7 million with the wholesale value ranging from about $2 million to $3.1 million.

13The Australian Federal Police intercepted the oven once it had arrived in Australia and inserted packages of an innocuous substance. On 10 January 2012 a Controlled Operation Authority was issued to facilitate the delivery of the consignment by police officers and the freight forwarder.

14The statement of facts refers to the activities of each of the participants involved in activities relating to the importation: Reese Thomson, George Tourvas, Alan Dong and the applicant. The role of the applicant was more succinctly set out in the prosecutor's written submissions to the sentencing judge and may be summarised as follows:

(a) on 3 January 2012, the applicant attended Storage City, West Gosford and signed a lease agreement in a false name (Richard Jansson) for storage unit 1019 which would be the ultimate storage location for the consignment;

(b) on 4 January 2012 the applicant purchased a padlock for the storage unit;

(c) on 9 January 2012 the applicant, posing as ""Richard Jansson"" arranged the transportation of the consignment from the Italian restaurant at The Entrance to Storage City;

(d) on 10 January 2012, using a falsely subscribed mobile phone, the applicant telephoned the freight forwarder and confirmed the amount owing;

(e) the applicant went to a bank and deposited a cash amount of $2607 in the freight forwarder's account; 

(f) the applicant, purporting to be George Tourvas, sent a fax to the freight forwarder containing deposit confirmation and confirmation of the delivery address for the consignment;

(g) on the same day, the applicant telephoned Active Hire and arranged a forklift to be delivered to the Italian restaurant on 12 January; and

(h) on 11 January 2012 the applicant attended Active Hire at West Gosford and received a receipt for the forklift hire.

15Later on 11 January 2012 the applicant attended Hornsby police station. He informed police that he had been pressured by the Hells Angels Outlaw Motorcycle Gang to assist in the importation of 100 kg of heroin which had been secreted in an industrial oven which was to be received at a location on the Central Coast. He was informed that police would apply for a Controlled Operation Authority that would allow him to participate in criminal acts but that it would take some days to be approved. He was advised that if he committed any criminal acts in the meantime he would be held liable. However, he continued his activities (with the knowledge of police and without any intervention) as follows (again drawing from the prosecutor's written submissions):

(i) on 12 January 2012 the applicant attended the Italian restaurant and, while liaising with Reese Thomson and Alan Dong by two-way radio and mobile phone, waited almost two hours for the consignment to arrive. During this time, the applicant, posing as ""Richard Jansson"", telephoned the freight forwarder to inquiry about the delivery of the oven;

(j) the applicant took delivery of the consignment, removed the outer packaging and inspected the consignment for evidence of tampering;

(k) the applicant escorted the truck as it transported the consignment to Storage City;

(l) on 18 January 2012 the applicant telephoned Brett's Truck Parts & All Filters and arranged some straps to lift the oven; and

(m) before 19 January 2012 the applicant received from Reese Thomson a diagram which had instructions on how to cut into the oven to extract the drugs.

16Item ""n"" in the prosecutor's submissions referred to the applicant, Thomson and Dong having numerous meetings at various locations on the Central Coast in the period 3 to 19 January 2012. They also had numerous telephone conversations in which code was used to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities.

17It was on the afternoon of 18 January 2012 that the Controlled Operation Authority was varied so as to permit the applicant to further his participation, but lawfully.

18According to the statement of agreed facts, the following morning the applicant hired the sling straps required for lifting the oven. He went to a hire company and acquired an angle grinder and other tools. He met with Thomson and then went to the storage facility where the oven was removed off its frame and he commenced to cut into the frame where the drugs had previously been secreted. He was in contact with police during this time. He was also in phone contact with Thomson and reported on his progress in relation to the oven. Once he had completed cutting the frame into sections he placed some of them in his car and returned the oven to the storage unit. He then arranged to meet with Thomson but was arrested at that point. Thomson and Dong were arrested at The Entrance.

19The statement of agreed facts concludes with the following:

""Throughout the course of his involvement in the offending the Offender felt somewhat intimidated by Thomson and his behaviour. He believed that Thomson had become volatile and increasingly prone to making threats of violence. Accordingly, he felt pressured to carry out tasks as requested by Thomson so as to not upset Thomson.

He nevertheless accepts that he voluntarily carried out the tasks requested of him and willingly participated in the offending."" 

20Also tendered in the Crown bundle was a summary of conversations between the applicant and police between 11 January when he went to the Hornsby police station and when the Controlled Operation Authority was varied on 18 January. It is apparent that he provided considerable information about what was happening with the consignment and concerning the general background and activities of Reese Thomson.

Personal circumstances of the applicant

21As there is no complaint of the learned sentencing judge not having appropriate regard to the applicant's personal circumstances it will suffice to confine reference to the matters his Honour noted. 

22The applicant was aged 54 at the time of the offence. He had no relevant prior criminal convictions. There were testimonials attesting to his good character. He had suffered a number of strokes in recent years and a psychological report indicated that these may have resulted in some cognitive deficit. 

23The judge concluded that the applicant's age and medical condition would render his time in custody harsher than it otherwise would be. He referred to various subjective features which persuaded him that the non-parole period should be reduced so as to allow for a longer period on parole to assist the applicant's reintegration into the community. 

24It was the agreed position of the parties that the applicant should receive a 50 per cent reduction of his sentence on account of his early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. The assistance commenced during the investigation and continued with making statements and undertaking to give evidence in proceedings against three co-offenders. The judge accepted the Crown's concession in this respect. He assigned 10 per cent of the discount to future assistance.

25Affidavit material before this Court indicates that the applicant gave evidence in the trial of George Tourvas and Alan Dong over 7 days in October-November 2013. It was common ground that he gave evidence in accordance with his undertaking. He is not required to give any further assistance; the Court was informed that Reese Thomson had pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentence.

Grounds of appeal

1. The learned judge erred in having regard to the applicant's conduct after he went to the police on 11 January 2012 as contributing to his criminality with respect to the offence.

2. The learned sentencing judge erred in placing undue weight on the sentences imposed in other cases involving the importation of prohibited drugs.

3. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the applicant's voluntary cessation of criminal activity and his reporting the offence to the police.

4. The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to the fact the offence was committed under duress.

5. The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.

Ground 1 - Error in having regard to conduct after 11 January 2012

26It was contended that the remarks on sentence disclosed (implicitly) that the judge had taken into account all of the applicant's activities, both before and after he came forward to the police on 11 January as comprising his criminal conduct. Mr Dhanji SC mounted a persuasive argument for the proposition that the applicant could not be criminally liable for his post-11 January conduct because a necessary element of aiding and abetting is an intention to assist in the commission of an offence (s 11.2(3) of the Criminal Code). Another argument was that the applicant had terminated his involvement and taken all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence, thereby alleviating him of criminal responsibility from 11 January (s 11.2(4). 

27Because of the applicant's success in respect of some other grounds it is unnecessary to review the competing arguments. It is sufficient to say that a fair reading of various comments made by the judge during the course of submissions and of his ex tempore remarks on sentence makes it plain that the judge regarded the post-11 January conduct of the applicant as being at least neutral and probably a matter taken into account in his favour. This renders it unnecessary to determine the legal question as to whether the applicant could have been criminally liable at all in respect of that conduct. 

28I would not uphold this ground.

Ground 2 - Error in placing undue weight on sentences imposed in other importation cases

29It is in relation to this ground that I believe the sentence proceedings miscarried.

30The prosecutor's written submissions in the District Court annexed a schedule of three cases which were said to show ""the range of penalties imposed for similar types of offences which may provide some assistance"": R v Holland [2011] NSWCCA 65; 205 A Crim R 429; Chan, Lo and Nguyen v R [2010] NSWCCA 153; and N v R; AP v R [2009] NSWCCA 108. It prompted considerable discussion with the sentencing judge in the course of the prosecutor's oral submissions, most of which was concerned with the first of those cases. None was concerned with the second and there was some relatively brief mention of the third. 

31The utility of referring to previous sentencing judgments was considered by the High Court of Australia in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520, particularly in the joint judgment of French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ at [53]-[54] and more recently in Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 305 ALR 323 at [40]-[41] where French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ stated:

""The setting of bounds to the available range of sentences in a particular case must, however, be distinguished from the proper and ordinary use of sentencing statistics and other material indicating what sentences have been imposed in other (more or less) comparable cases. Consistency of sentencing is important. But the consistency that is sought is consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not numerical equivalence.

As the plurality pointed out in Hili v The Queen, in seeking consistency sentencing judges must have regard to what has been done in other cases. Those other cases may well establish a range of sentences which have been imposed. But that history does not establish that the sentences which have been imposed mark the outer bounds of the permissible discretion. The history stands as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence. What is important is the unifying principles which those sentences both reveal and reflect."" (Footnotes omitted; emphasis added)

32The prosecutor contended that R v Holland ""in terms of the role and what was done is comparable in many respects in terms of what was being facilitated but in terms of the starting point and the offending generally the Crown's submission is that this is a bit more serious than that when one looks at the quantities and what's involved"". (AB 28.5)

33Counsel then appearing for the applicant adopted an approach of trying to persuade the judge that the present case was distinguishable from the cases referred to by the prosecutor, principally because of the applicant's voluntary cessation and coming forward to police. Senior counsel for the applicant in this Court submitted that the outcomes in other cases ""had little or nothing to say about the appropriate result"" and ""they were entitled to no weight"". It was contended that there were significant features of this case that rendered reference to any other case of no utility.

34The Crown submitted that the judge was aware of the limitations on the use of past sentencing decisions and, in any event, a complaint about a judge having placed ""undue weight"" on a matter is difficult to determine in isolation. Whether there was error was a matter better left for consideration in the context of ground 5 (manifest excess). 

35What the judge said in his remarks on sentence about the cases to which he had been referred was as follows:

""I have been provided with a number of cases as reference points. I note, obviously, that the sentencing process does not involve simply looking at a case and trying to find one which is similar and then imposing the same penalty. Rather, the cases which have been considered do provide general principles and are of assistance in determining the appropriate range. ...

I have heard the Crown's submissions [as to an appropriate starting point before the application of discounts] and those of the defence and it seems to me, having regard to the starting point in the various cases which have been provided, that an appropriate starting point for [Mr W] would be one of eleven years.""

36This would tend to suggest that his Honour took an unremarkable approach to a consideration of the outcomes in the cases to which he had been referred. However, it is necessary to observe that his Honour announced that he had determined upon a starting point of 11 years before he began to deliver his ex tempore sentencing judgment. The manner in which he determined it, which was erroneous in my view, is apparent from his lengthy exchanges with counsel, principally the prosecutor. 

37Before turning to the proceedings on sentence it is worth being clear about the utility of doing so. ""Normally this Court will not find an error of principle from interchanges between the bench and counsel that indicate an apparent incorrect appreciation of the law, since those views do not necessarily reflect a considered decision"": R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [11] (Wood CJ at CL). However, there are circumstances in which there may be some utility in having regard to statements from the bench during the course of submissions; for example, when they can assist in elucidating abbreviated statements appearing in remarks on sentence: Peiris v R [2014] NSWCCA 58 at [67] (Leeming JA). In my view there is also some utility where during the course of submissions a judge exposes his or her reasoning and announces a concluded view which is ultimately maintained without any qualification of the reasoning in an immediately ensuing ex tempore sentencing judgment.

38The prosecutor contended that the ""appropriate starting point would be in the vicinity of 12 to 14"". There was some relatively brief discussion concerning N v R; AP v R but it was characterised as a case involving a lesser maximum penalty (25 years) and the offenders had engaged in less activity. It was noted that when this Court came to resentence it adopted starting points of 11 years for one offender and 10 for the other.

39The judge moved to a discussion with the prosecutor about what the starting point might be if he was sentencing the co-offender Thomson. The discussion was ""ball park stuff"" and led to an assessment of that character in the order of ""maybe ... 18 to 20 range"". 

40At that point the prosecutor diverted the discussion to the topic of duress and to the appropriate level of discounting for the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance. The judge brought the discussion back to the topic of the starting point by wondering what it might be if the applicant had not come forward to the police: for example, ""if Thomson's 20, this man not having come forward ... probably you'd be looking at a starting point more likely of around the 16. ...[T]he question then is whether I should be starting this man now at 14 or 12. I mean, with his discounts you're really talking about whether it should be 6 or 7, aren't you? ... I mean if he got six years with a 50 percent then a non-parole it would be a three year non-parole, if he got seven years it would be three and a half years."" The discussion with the prosecutor came to an end in the following terms:

""HIS HONOUR: Yes, well I think he, it does seem to me that probably he ends up in a position of around that 6 to 7 and I've got to decide exactly where within that, whether it is 7 rather than 6. I'll let Mr Fitzgerald see what he can convince me of, but I mean it's really about the establishing what the range is and making sure that the sentence is within that range.

[PROSECUTOR]: Yes

HIS HONOUR: Subjectively this man's got a fair bit going for him. But it's a serious - he's involved. His involvement is relatively, you know, sort of reasonable but the crime itself is a serious crime, that's his problem.

[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honour

HIS HONOUR: He started his criminal career at the deep end of the pool rather than the shallow end. All right. Thank you for that Mr [Prosecutor], that was helpful."" (AB 36)

41I have summarised the approach taken by counsel for the applicant earlier. When he concluded his submissions there ensued another exchange between the judge and the prosecutor about the starting point. The prosecutor sought to address an attempt by the applicant's counsel to distinguish R v Holland on the basis that the assistance there only arose after arrest. The judge interrupted to point out that the focus needed to be on the starting point before turning to consider the level of discounting. The following exchange illuminates the reasoning towards the determination of the 11 year starting point:

""HIS HONOUR: What we are talking about is the starting point, isn't that the question, because I understand - well it is easier to do it that way because each of these cases will have different merits.

[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And different entitlements to discounts but the starting point is a reflection of the level of assessed criminality, isn't it and then what you end up with is what you end up with after the particular entitlements to discount but I think the reference to Holland really was that well here was someone whose starting point was around the 12 year mark. Admittedly he had his own set of entitlements in terms of discounts.

[PROSECUTOR]: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And the bottom line doesn't matter but the distinction was well if he starts at 12 for a role which appears to be at least as high if not higher than this man in the sense that he went to the other end of the deal, he went overseas and there was some evidence of him getting money like $30,000 I think but if that is the case what is being said as I understand it is that there ought to be some reflection in the starting point of the fact that he did come forward. I would have thought that it would be of benefit to the community to encourage people to come forward. In some situations which is exampled by here the fact that he came forward probably at the end of the day did not change anything from the point of view of the police investigation of him for this importation.

[PROSECUTOR]: No.

HIS HONOUR: But in other cases it can so that there ought to be two aspects of it, one an encouragement to people to in fact come forward so that they do know they will get a better deal and two that you should actually be giving them a better deal if they do come forward because it tends to reflect less mens rea in terms of their criminal state of mind.

[PROSECUTOR]: Yes your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So if you do that I think what Mr Fitzgerald is saying is all right well if Holland starts at 12 or thereabouts this man should start lower. My view at the moment and I give you both an opportunity, my view at the moment is that the starting point for this man ought to be 11 years, with a discount that would give him five and a half and I would give him three on the bottom, that is my current thinking subject to what anybody says in terms of whether that is within the range or not but yes that is how I processed Holland and - 

[PROSECUTOR]: Yes your Honour. Your Honour can I just point to Holland briefly. In terms of what the role and the level on the assessment in terms of getting to that starting point in Holland from para 70 through to 73 Schmidt J outlined what was the role, what were the things that were done.

HIS HONOUR: That he did, yes.

[PROSECUTOR]: And it is in my submission your Honour comparable in most respects to what the offender here has done. He wasn't the organiser of the importation.

HIS HONOUR: Yes I agree with that, that seemed to be so, don't have to convince me of that. The only difference really was that he went to the other end, I am not sure what that means.

[PROSECUTOR]: Well he didn't do anything there in terms of those matters, he was acting on the direction of others who organised the importation from over there.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

[PROSECUTOR]: What he did there the setting up of the business name and the renting of the warehouse, all those things were all the things that were done at this end for the purpose of it safely being received.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, well if there is not much difference which I think you are probably right and I don't think there is much difference or the difference that might be there is not one which justifies any significant difference or approach to the penalty and if the starting point for him was 12 why wouldn't the starting point for this man be lower bearing in mind that he in fact did go to the police.

[PROSECUTOR]: And there's -

HIS HONOUR: Holland didn't."" (AB 41-42)

42There followed a discussion with the prosecutor involving a comparison of the quantities of drugs involved in R v Holland (7.244kg of cocaine) and those involved in the present case. His Honour expressed doubt about there being much difference when both cases involved significant quantities. There was also the fact that there was no evidence that the applicant knew how much was involved. The discussion continued in that vein for a short time before the following ensued:

""HIS HONOUR: Like if these two men were equal, like if you took away the come forward you would probably think the starting point for each of them would be within the same ball park notwithstanding that one has 7 and a half and one has got 10 kilos. I mean when I say the same ball park might not be exactly the same but surely the coming forward makes quite a difference to the level of criminality.

[PROSECUTOR]: It is your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Like a couple of years.

[PROSECUTOR]: And I accept the fact that his coming forward is a point of distinction and something quite different to the ordinary type of case and certainly these cases where persons have been apprehended.

HIS HONOUR: Yes well if 12 was the starting point for Holland why would 11 be wrong for the starting point for this man, why would it be outside the range is probably the better question."" (AB 44-45)

43The judge then pressed the prosecutor to respond to a question whether ""starting it at 11 is outside the range"". After some initial reluctance he conceded that he could not submit that it was outside the range. The judge further explained his starting point:

""HIS HONOUR: ... [T]he reason I have sort of come down to that is because I have given a fair amount of credit for him coming forward."" (AB 46.5)

44The judge then referred by way of analogy to the value of pleas of guilty in child sexual assault cases, saying that he thought they were ""worth a heck of a lot more than Joe Bloggs pleading guilty to break, enter and steal you know when his fingerprints are found there"". He continued:

""HIS HONOUR: ... So in a case like this when a man actually does come forward, goes to the police and then says I will continue and be part of an ongoing controlled operation but more than that I will actually even though I know I am not protected I will continue to do what I am doing until I get protection from that there ought to be some encouragement of that and some credit for that otherwise probably his starting point would be a bit higher than Holland, it might be as you say around the 13 year mark. But I do not think knocking a couple of years off that starting point for him coming forward is unreasonable."" (AB 46.20)

45The prosecutor told his Honour that he had no further submissions to make. The judge then announced that the sentence would be one of five and a half years with ""three years on the bottom"". The non-parole period would be ""55% or something ... and the reason for that is the subjective material is reflected in that decision"". 

46Prior to the sentence hearing commencing the judge had been provided with all of the documentary material relied upon by the parties except for some documentation in relation to the applicant's assistance. The defence material included a psychological report, medical reports, testimonials and written submissions by the applicant's counsel. There was little attention given to the applicant's subjective case in the course of oral submissions; the only real focus upon it was in the context of counsel's submission that there should be a finding of ""special circumstances"" in relation to the non-parole period (although that is not a concept recognised in the applicable legislation as it is in the New South Wales sentencing legislation).

47I have set out rather lengthy extracts from the judge's exchanges with the prosecutor because they clearly demonstrate that the judge's approach in determining the starting point for the sentence was to focus on the starting point in R v Holland (12 years); assess a notional starting point by comparison of the objective criminality (arriving at 13 years); then subtract 2 years (""knocking a couple of years off"") to give the applicant credit for having come forward to police; so as to arrive at a result of 11 years. He adopted the agreed combined discount of 50 per cent for the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance and arrived at a sentence of 5 years 6 months. He then took into account the applicant's subjective circumstances in arriving at a non-parole period of 3 years.

48This demonstrates an approach that has all the appearance of having been driven by a single so-called comparable case. The focus was very much confined to a comparison of the criminality in R v Holland with that in the present case. There was no process of instinctively synthesising all of the relevant objective and subjective facts and circumstances to arrive at a proposed sentence and then looking at the outcome of other similar cases that may have provided a check or yardstick: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357; Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen, supra. 

49Two further observations should be made. Arithmetical quantification of the mitigating effect of a single feature of the case (the applicant going to the police) was erroneous: Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [76]; Markarian v The Queen at [39]. And it is not at all clear that the personal circumstances of the applicant were taken into account in the determination of the starting point. In the process of determining it during the proceedings on sentence the judge made only the one fleeting reference: ""Subjectively this man's got a fair bit going for him"".

50Ground 2 should be upheld.

Ground 3 - Error in failing to have proper regard to voluntary cessation of criminal activity and reporting of the offence to the police

51For the applicant it was submitted that his voluntary withdrawal from the enterprise and his report of the matter to the police were unusual and significant matters. It was acknowledged that his Honour had referred to the report to police as being ""to his credit"" and that it was in the community's interest.

52Reference was made to R v Burns [2007] NSWCCA 228 where Harrison J (with the concurrence of Spigelman CJ and Simpson J) referred (at [29]) to the voluntary cessation of criminal activity as being relevant in a number of respects: it served a public policy in encouraging offenders to cease their criminal activities; specific deterrence could be given little or no weight; it was evidence of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation; and, in some cases, it may support the proposition that the offence was committed as a result of need rather than greed.

53It was put in written submissions by senior counsel for the applicant that the sentencing judge made no reference at all to specific deterrence, remorse, contrition or rehabilitation. (AWS [39])

54For the Crown it was submitted that the judge did properly take into account that the applicant had come forward to the police and report his involvement in the offence. The sentencing remarks indicate that it was a matter he took into account as mitigating the seriousness of the applicant's offending. As was submitted in the context of Ground 1, the Crown contended that the judge took into account the applicant's post-11 January conduct as part of his assistance, not as furtherance of his offending conduct. To the extent that this ground raised a question of ""weight"", the Crown submitted that this was a matter best assessed in the context of Ground 5.

55In the course of the proceedings on sentence in the extracts I have set out earlier it is apparent that the judge considered that it was to the applicant's credit that he came forward a relatively short time after his involvement commenced. He considered it to be in the community's interest to encourage people to do so and that it was indicative of ""reduced mens rea in the individual"" (probably meaning lower moral culpability). 

56I am not prepared to accept that the judge failed to have regard to the applicant's voluntary cessation of criminal activity, and his reporting of the offence to the police. However, it is troubling that the he did not express any finding about the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation or about the need, if any, for specific deterrence to be factored into the assessment of sentence. His Honour did say that he was satisfied of the applicant's ""genuine remorse and contrition for his involvement in these offences"" but he said that was something established by the plea of guilty. No findings as to other subjective matters or reference to various purposes of sentence were made with the exception of mention of general deterrence, no relevant prior record, good character and ill-health. 

57Section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) sets out certain matters that a court ""must take into account"" (if relevant and known to the court). One of them is personal deterrence (s 16A(2)(j)). Another is the prospect of rehabilitation (s 16A(2)(n)). But the judge simply said, ""The Court notes those matters which are set out in the Commonwealth legislation under s 16A which a court must take into account when sentencing a Federal offender and applies that section"". Later he said, ""I have taken into account all those matters set out in s 16A and I do not think it is necessary for me to go through and isolate them"". 

58Specific deterrence is one of the important purposes of sentencing. Often it is necessary for some weight to be given to it but not in every case. In my view, it warranted no weight at all in the present case. And in this case it was open to find that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Haste in delivering a sentencing judgment cannot justify the use of shorthand expressions such as ""I have taken into account all those matters set out s 16A"" which do not illuminate anything of the judge's reasoning or conclusions: see, for example, R v McNamara [2005] NSWCCA 195 at [37] (Hall J) and DBW v R [2007] NSWCCA 236 at [33] (Spigelman CJ). 

59I would uphold this ground

Ground 4 - Error in failing to have proper regard to duress

60It was part of the agreed facts that the applicant felt ""somewhat intimidated by Thomson and his behaviour"" and that he ""felt pressured to carry out tasks as requested by Thomson so as not to upset Thomson"". 

61The summary of conversations between the applicant and the police post-11 January were said to confirm the fears genuinely held by the applicant about Thomson. The statements made by the applicant were not made with sentence proceedings in prospect. That is, they were not self-serving in order to seek some benefit; they were indicative of the predicament he found himself in. For example, in his first contact with police on 11 January he spoke of having to go through with receiving the oven as he was fearful for the safety of his family. In subsequent conversations he spoke of Thomson carrying a large flick knife and being in possession of a handgun. He believed that Thomson had a connection with the Hells Angels in Vancouver. The applicant claimed that Thomson had threatened to wipe out his entire family if he ever went to the police. 

62The submissions for the applicant referred to the judgment of Johnson J in R v Tiknius [2011] NSWCCA 215 where (at [41] and [43]) his Honour identified that non-exculpatory duress may lead to findings of a reduced moral culpability, where the offending is not for greed or profit but because of threats and fear or harm, as well as a reduced likelihood of re-offending and better prospects of rehabilitation. 

63It was acknowledged in the applicant's submissions that Johnson J also identified (at [50]-[51]) that general deterrence remained important in drug importation offences given that, at times, persons with submissive or compliant personalities are targeted for recruitment. But it was submitted that the duress in the present case did not call for any greater measure of general deterrence where the applicant came forward to the police before any harm inherent in the offence was realised.

64It is well apparent from the sentencing remarks that the judge accepted that the applicant's claim of duress was credible. The fact he came forward before he was aware of any police investigation supported the truthfulness of his claim to have only become involved because of the duress applied to him by Thomson. After observing that the duress was not sufficient to support a defence, his Honour made the remark about coming forward and then participating in the controlled operation being to the applicant's credit. 

65As mentioned above, there were agreed facts on the issue of duress. The Crown had put in written submissions to the judge that the weight to be given to duress was ""slight"". Counsel for the applicant made no submission addressing that proposition. It cannot be said that the judge had no regard to duress. It really becomes a question of weight; a matter best assessed in the light of the next ground. 

66I would not uphold this ground.

Ground 5 - The sentence is manifestly excessive

67Because of my view that the applicant should succeed in relation to grounds 2 and 3 it is not necessary to determine this ground. The question under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) is enlivened: whether ""some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed"". 

Whether, and if so how, to resentence

68It is pertinent to consider the submissions that were made in the context of ground 5 as they are relevant to the question of whether, and if so how, to resentence. 

69The written submissions for the applicant identified what were said to be factors relevant to the assessment of sentence: the applicant had no role in bringing the drugs into the country; he provided limited assistance directed towards securing the consignment and recovery of the drugs; his involvement was over a relatively short period of time; he was acting under non-exculpatory duress; there was no evidence he stood to gain financially; he was 54 at the time of sentence with no relevant prior record; he withdrew from the enterprise and informed the police; he agreed to assist and in fact assisted the police with their investigation; he pleaded guilty; and he agreed to give evidence against others.

70The primary submission for the applicant was that neither starting points and discounts nor reference to other cases assisted the sentencing process. Where there was a maximum sentence of life imprisonment but no minimum sentence, the sentence should have been far more towards the latter. it was submitted that the starting point adopted by the sentencing judge of 11 years was unreasonable and plainly unjust by a significant margin.

71The Crown pointed to the seriousness with which the offence must be regarded when the maximum penalty of life imprisonment is borne in mind. The quantities of drugs attempted to be imported and their potential wholesale and street value were substantial. The role of the applicant in facilitating the shipment of the consignment after it arrived in the docks in Sydney to the Central Coast where the drugs could be safely removed was important. It was accepted that there was no evidence of any likely financial gain. It was also accepted that he was acting under duress but he was nonetheless willingly involved in a very serious, organised criminal enterprise and carried out a number of important tasks over a period of more than a week.

72The Crown acknowledged the various factors that stood in the applicant's favour. But the Crown contended that the judge was correct to take into account relevant sentencing principles summarised in the judgment of Johnson J in R v Nguyen; R v Pham [2010] NSWCCA 238; 205 A Crim R 106 at [72]. General deterrence had to be given ""chief weight"" and prior good character was of little weight. Stern punishment was warranted.

73As Mr Dhanji SC put it, this is a singular case. A man in his mid-fifties of prior good character became involved in a serious drug importation enterprise. He was not a principal or decision maker but did the bidding of the principal under duress. There was no evidence he stood to gain financially. He performed various acts that were important and directed towards (what was hoped to be) the successful conclusion of the importation. But after a relatively short period of involvement he thought better of it and went to the police. At what must have been at least an implicit risk to his personal safety he then continued his participation in the enterprise in order to assist the police investigation. 

74In the highly unusual circumstances of this case, the applicant should not have been sentenced so as to provide an example of the consequences that might befall others who may be tempted to become involved in drug importation. In fact, he should have been sentenced so as to provide an example of what might become of someone who has the good conscience to come forward and assist law enforcement authorities in order to thwart serious criminal activity. 

75There was no basis to find that the applicant might reoffend and so specific deterrence was irrelevant. There were other subjective features warranting leniency such as good character, remorse, good prospects of rehabilitation and an element of ill-health. There was also the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant would find custodial conditions more onerous than the average prison inmate.

76At the conclusion of the hearing of the application and after the Court announced that it would be reserving its judgment, Mr Dhanji SC made an application for bail which was granted: RCW v R [2014] NSWCCA 169. The Court was of the view that it was inappropriate for the applicant to remain in custody any longer.

77A sentence of 4 years is warranted but it should be reduced to the agreed extent of 50 per cent on account of the applicant's early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. Against a head sentence of 2 years there should be a non-parole period of 1 year.

Orders

78The following orders should be made:

(1) Leave to appeal against sentence granted.

(2) Appeal allowed.

(3) The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year. The sentence dates from 14 July 2013. The non-parole period expired on 13 July 2014 and the parole period expires on 13 July 2015.


**********

ADDENDUM

79Judgment was delivered in this matter on 24 September 2014. Included in the orders was that there would be a non-parole period of 1 year. The Court's attention has now been invited to s 19AC Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which, relevantly, provides that where a sentence does not exceed 3 years a non-parole period must not be fixed but a recognizance release order must be made.

80For these reasons, pursuant to r 50C(3) of the Criminal Appeal Rules, order 3 made by the Court on 24 September 2014 is set aside. In lieu it is ordered that:

3. The sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed and the appellant is sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years dating from 14 July 2013. The Court directs that on 14 July 2014 the appellant be released upon entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for 1 year until 13 July 2015 upon giving security without surety in the sum of $1.

The plaintiff's evidence concerning the accident

5The plaintiff described how she and her husband were sitting on the bus in the front seat adjacent to, rather than behind, the driver, when the bus driver suddenly slammed on the brakes:

""Q. When he put the brakes on really hard, what happened?
A. I jolted my head on the post. I tried to grab the post so I won't fall, because my husband fell on the floor.

Q. So your husband fell on the floor first, was it?
A. Yes, first.

Q. And then what did you do after your husband fell on the floor?
A. I slide from the seat from the left all the way to the right sitting half in the seat, and I grabbed the post and I hit my head on the post.

Q. Did you knock yourself out or not? Did you lose consciousness?
A. No.

Q. After the accident, did you go to the doctor or did you go to a hospital?
A. The ambulance come and took me to Robina Hospital."" (T 4)

6The plaintiff said that she had made a complaint to the police about the accident:

""Q. When did that happen?
A. I think it may be a few days later. I can't remember the date, I'm sorry.

Q. So is this the situation? You and your husband attended the police station to give some statements in relation to what happened?
A. We'd been to the hospital and then after they patched my eye and they put the glue on it, I took a taxi and we come home. And then after a few days, the pain was still very bad all over my body, and I had a terrible, terrible head ache. I went to the police station to report it because someone said to me, ""You had better go and report it.""

Q. Did you go to the police station with your husband?
A. Yes.

Q. Were you together when you gave your statements to the police?
A. Yes. Yes.

Q. I take it, you heard what your husband said to the police as to what happened?
A. My husband? I don't know.

...

A. No, no, no. Together, together. We were together.

ALLAN

Q. You see, I suggest that you heard your husband tell this to the police officer: ""As the bus was approaching the first main set of traffic lights, the bus stopped very quickly. I was lucky I was holding onto the pole at the time because I would have ended up on the floor of the bus. Rena hit her face on the glass screen in front of her. Her eyebrow was cut open and bleeding.""
A. My husband's English is very, very bad. Like, I speak better English than him. He doesn't drive, he doesn't - he's an old man, 83 years old. He doesn't speak English properly. I don't know if he said that, I don't know, I'm sorry. 

Q. I'm suggesting to you that that's what you heard your husband say to the police when you went and reported it. What do you say about that?
A. He definitely fell. If you have pictures of your bus, the bus has cameras. If you get that video, you will see my husband on the ground. My husband was on the floor where the steps come in - you know, when they come up. He might have grabbed the post but he definitely fell on the floor. On the - you know where the steps are to go to the bus, to get into the bus? That's where he fell, on the hole - well."" (T 34)

7The police interview transcript for the plaintiff, her husband and the bus driver is set out in more detail below. The description of the accident by both the plaintiff and her husband (who, it is agreed, is too ill to give evidence) is completely at variance with the description the plaintiff gave, in her evidence in chief, of the accident.

8As the photographs of the bus show, the seat on which the plaintiff and her husband were sitting was so close to the bus driver's seat that, if the plaintiff's husband had fallen to the ground as claimed, he would have had to fall on the floor beside as well as partially behind the bus driver, which would have blocked her path out of the driver seat when she stopped the bus. The plaintiff was asked:

""Q. So he fell not only to the side of his seat but he moved towards the front?
A. He fell the right way, the bus stairs, when you come up with the bus steps, to get into the bus, he fell - that's where he fell. Where you cut the tickets.

Q. So he was directly next to the bus driver. Correct?
A. The bus driver is - it's into the right.

Q. Directly to the left of the bus driver is the steps you're referring to. Isn't that right?
A. Yeah. Yeah. To the left. That's where he fell.

Q. So he fell--
A. Yes.

Q. --directly next to the bus driver. Correct?
A. Yes, he did. Yes.

Q. Do you have any recollection of the bus driver looking or seeing or saying anything to your husband as he lay on the floor?
A. No, I don't.

Q. You see, what you've just said is just not correct, is it?
A. Yes, it is, I'm sorry.

Q. Your husband did not fall onto the floor at all, did he?
A. He did fell on the floor.

Q. He remained sitting in his seat holding onto the pole that you have just referred to.
A. That's not correct, I'm sorry, that's not correct.

Q. In fact, what you did was hit your head on the glass screen which was in front of you.
A. No."" (T 36)

The ambulance officer's observations

9Ambulance officers came to the scene. The electronic ambulance report form notes:

""Patient was a passenger in a bus when the driver had to brake sharply, patient was forced forward and the patient's left eyebrow collided with the glass at the fron [sic] to the bus, patient has a small laceration to the left eyelid, which had stopped bleeding prior to QAS arrival, area cleaned and dressed, patient had no ALOC, no neck or back pain and no visual disturbance, patient a little bit upset and tearful.""

10The plaintiff's response to being read this material was as follows:

""Q. You see, I suggest this is what you told the ambulance officer, that you were forced forward and your left eyebrow collided with the glass at the front of the bus.
A. You can quote whatever you want, but my head, it hit the post.

Q. You see, you also didn't make any complaint to the ambulance officer of any pain in your left shoulder, did you?
A. You're correct.

Q. Because you didn't have any pain in your left shoulder at that time, did you?
A. I had a headache only, a really bad headache.

Q. And you also didn't have any pain in your neck or back, did you?
A. Not then, but by the night it started hitting me a terrible lot from the neck all the way down. My whole body was in pain.

Q. Because you attended Robina Hospital, didn't you?
A. Yes. 

Q. It's the case, isn't it, that while you were at hospital your only complaint was in relation to your headache.
A. That's correct.

Q. Would you agree with that?
A. That's correct.

Q. And that at that stage you had no neck pain.
A. No, that's correct."" (T 36)

11The bus driver gave evidence before me, and was interviewed by police following the complaint by the plaintiff and her husband.

The bus driver's evidence

12Mrs Agnes Tehau was called to give evidence. She described the accident as follows:

""Q. What happened?
A. Okay. When I left the bus stop the lights had changed. I came up to the lights. There was a car and a truck in front of me when I stopped. The lights changed. I was turning right, so with the traffic in front of me. As I was turning, the truck in front of me had stopped. There was road works there and it had stopped. So I put my foot on the brake and stopped.

Q. First of all, you said that you turned right.
A. Yes. 

Q. And it's not the case that you turned left. Is that right?
A. No. 

Q. As you stopped the bus, what did you observe, if anything, about the passengers in the bus?
A. Well, it's just automatic that I look in the mirror inside the bus, as well as to my left, rear and my right mirrors. And the passengers were still in the seat. I only had about, probably five or six people in the bus, so.

Q. Did you hear any noise as you stopped the bus?
A. Well, I heard a lot of talking and it kind of - it wasn't in English. I just heard a lot of talking and it just made me kind of look slightly to my left at the passengers, and the lady wasn't - she was crying, actually.

Q. What did you do?
A. Well, like I said, I had stopped. I called up operations to let them know what was going on, and I slightly came out of the traffic to go into the left-hand lane to pull over, to attend to the passengers.

Q. Did you attend to the passengers?
A. Yes, I did."" (T 58).

13She called an ambulance because the plaintiff had a cut over her eye, and the plaintiff and her husband remained on the bus while the other passengers were taken away:

""Q. What did you do?
A. Before I could do anything, operations, which is base, sent another bus out to pick up the rest of the passengers. They asked me if I needed an ambulance. I said yes because while I was talking to them I noticed the lady had slightly cut her - just under her eyebrow.

Q. Where were the lady and her companion?
A. They were in their seat that's behind the door.

Q. They were still in the seat that they had entered--
A. They were still in the seat.

Q. --when they got on the bus. Is that right? And what then happened?
A. Then I - after finishing talking to operations I hopped out of the seat and helped them to the disability seat in the middle of the bus.

Q. What, if anything, did you notice about any injury sustained by the lady?
A. Well, I just noticed the slight cut under her eyebrow and I asked if she was okay and that, and he said they're fine."" (T 58 - 9).

14She was adamant that the plaintiff's husband had not fallen to the floor at any time:

""Q. It has been suggested that when you braked, the male companion fell off his seat onto the floor in front of the steps and next to the ticket machine. What do you say about that?
A. Did not happen.

Q. You're absolutely certain about that?
A. Yeah.

Q. It has been suggested that the lady passenger slid to the aisle edge of the seat that she had been sitting on, that had been left vacant by her husband, who had fallen onto the floor. What do you say about that?
A. Didn't happen.

Q. Apart from the pole which you identified in the photograph that I showed you earlier, is there any other pole in the vicinity of the seat that the female passenger and her companion were sitting in?
A. There's one at the back, which is where they put all their luggage, and it's just at the back of the seat, coinciding with the one that's in the front.

Q. And is it, in terms of poles sitting in front of the seat, how many poles are there?
A. Just the one.

Q. Where is it located, as compared to the aisle and the window?
A. Well, it's in the aisle.""

15In cross-examination, all Mrs Tehau was asked was the following:

""Q. Just in relation to the plaintiff or Mrs Gialouris, you say, ""I realise someone hit the screen."" When did you realise someone hit the screen?
A. Well, like I said previously, they were talking and I heard - you get used to carrying a lot of passengers and just their persona about them and just the way - I just heard them talking and it sounded like something was wrong. I didn't actually see her hit her head on the Perspex, but when I got off to help them off, she had a cut under her eyebrow, her left eyebrow.

Q. So we can assume, it's an assumption that she hit the Perspex. Is that correct?
A. Yes, there's no other way."" (T 62).

16She completed an incident report form (T 60, Exhibit 4) which reads: 

""2 x senior in front seat (left side). Turning right from Scarborough St onto Queens St a truck (Roadwork) stopped suddenly. I braked firmly and the female senior hit her head on the windowpane. Under her left eyebrow was slightly cut and bled a bit. She was a bit shaken up."" 

17Mrs Tehau was an impressive witness. The consistency of her accounts in her report to her superiors and to the police was obvious. 

18The plaintiff sought medical advice after the accident. What she told her medical practitioners, between September 2011 and February 2012, is consistent with her having hit her head on the Perspex, and of having suffered no injury to her shoulder.

The plaintiff's treatment following the accident

19The plaintiff described her subsequent treatment as follows:

""Q. When you injured your shoulder, did you go and have treatment, or what did you do for treatment?
A. I went to the doctor and he send me for xrays, and then he sent me - it's still hurting after - he still send me to a new person to make an ultrasound, and they said that I've got osteoarthritis on my shoulder and nothing's broken.

Q. Did they give you any other treatment besides an ultrasound?
A. Ultrasound? Yes, they send me to a specialist to have an injection.

Q. Do you remember who the specialist was?
A. Yes, I do. Professor Morrell."" (T 7)

20The plaintiff attended Dr Fatideh, the general practitioner she consulted while staying at her holiday home at the Gold Coast. Dr Fatideh noted she attended for a ""prescription"" at 6.55pm (Exhibit 1, pp 55-56) and there is no note of any discussion of the circumstances of the accident. She returned on 10 September 2011 saying she felt ""stiff in neck"" as she had had a car accident on the Tuesday, and was a bit ""bruise [sic]"". She had been to Robina Hospital in relation to her left eye. She had a headache in circumstances where she had ""never had headache before"". An examination of her neck showed mild tenderness over the spinous process and she was noted as being ""a bit stressed"" (Exhibit 1, p 55). She returned on 13 September and was seen by Dr Day, who noted she came for a CT brain and spine result. The spine result was described as ""nil"" and it was noted ""neck movements okay, nil tenderness"".

21Returning home to see her general practitioner at Caringbah, who noted the following:

""Was involved in a bus accident in the Gold Coast, was a passenger and hit her forehead against the metal post, was taken to the hospital there. Had CT scan of the brain - NAD. X-ray of the cervical spine - showed spondylolisthesis in most levels and osteophytes, mainly degenerative changes.""

22He went on to note that she was ""still having pain in the neck and head, and lower back pain"" and that she needed a script for Endone. She was described as being ""depressed about her granddaughter, who has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, depressed, very emotional, crying"" and needing to be counselled. She said she was seeing a psychologist on the Gold Coast; I note there was a referral in August to a Dr Wood, psychologist, but the plaintiff's evidence was that she did not consult him.

23When the plaintiff consulted her general practitioner on 10 October 2011, he noted she had had an X-ray three weeks beforehand, which was normal, and that there were no sign of degenerative changes. The diagnosis ""? soft tissue injuries"" is noted. Lower back pain was noted as starting ""only during the physiotherapy"". She was not tender over the spine. She was seen again on 11 and 17 October when she reported progress and that heat pack and massage was helping. While in Moree, the plaintiff saw Dr Percival on 25 October 2011, who noted she had ""a sore neck and back ache"" but ""no leg or arm pain"" (Exhibit 1). She attended Moree Hospital, where it was noted that her neck pain was ""resolved"". An entry from her general practitioner in Caringbah Medical Centre noted she had ""no more back pain"" and that she had gone to Moree Hospital for ""severe lower abdominal pain"". A further note on 13 December from the Caringbah Medical Centre was that she had lower back and neck pain and ""has been doing hydrotherapy"". 

24An entry on 4 January 2012 noted the plaintiff had left hand numbness and tingling waking her at night, described by her medical practitioner as ""typical carpal tunnel"". No claim is made that this carpal tunnel condition relates to the motor vehicle accident. An entry on 18 January refers to the plaintiff receiving benefit from hydrotherapy and an entry on 24 January 2012 refers to her having pain from a pulled muscle in the left buttock. 

The plaintiff's report of the accident to the police

25This brings me to the description given by the plaintiff and her husband to the police shortly after the accident. This was as follows:

""Surname: GIALOURIS
G/Names: RENA
Person Type: Passenger; Victim

I was a passenger on the Surfside bus with my husband John. We got on the bus at Australia Fair and we were going to Ferry Road.

At about 11:30am just down the main road from where we got on the bus, the bus stopped fast to avoid hitting the back of the truck in front. The bus driver was going to [sic] fast and travelling close to the car in front.

When the bus stopped fast I hit my head on the glass screen. We were sitting at the front of the bus on the left hand side.

Ambulance took me to Robina Hospital. Since the accident I have had headaches [sic], neck and back pain."" (Exhibit 2)

26A description was given by the plaintiff's husband as follows:

""Surname: GIALOURIS
G/Names: JOHN
Person Type: Witness

We were travelling from Australia fair [sic] shopping centre to Ferry Road Southport on the bus. The bus driver was travelling very close to the truck in front of it. As the bus was approaching the first main set of traffic lights the bus stopped very quickly, I was lucky I was holding the [sic] onto the pole at the time because I would have ended up on the floor of the bus. Rena hit her face on the glass screen infront [sic] of her, her eyebrow was cut open and bleeding. Ambulance came and took her to the Robina Hospital."" (Exhibit 2)

27A statement was taken by the bus driver who did not see the accident but said ""I realised someone hit the screen"" (Exhibit 2). She pulled over immediately in front of a pub in a very short distance. The whereabouts of the plaintiff's husband is of importance in terms of the mechanics of this accident. It is common ground that the plaintiff and her husband were sitting in the first seat immediately adjacent to the front door of the bus (on the left), and the bus driver (on the right). Consequently, the distance between the plaintiff, her husband and the bus driver was comparatively short, as the photographs (Exhibit 1) show.

The first mention of left arm pain

28The first time the plaintiff complained of any pain in her left arm was on 13 February 2012, when her general practitioner noted her complaints as follows:

""Pain in the left arm, very limited movement due to pain.

AEL shoulder - pain is in the biceps muscle ? referred pain

No mass in the muscle, no lump

May need x-ray \ US [Ultrasound] L shoulder

Referred for such""

29On 1 March 2012, the plaintiff was described as ""still having pain in the left shoulder"". She told the doctor she had an x-ray and ultrasound done on the Gold Coast which showed a tear in one of the tendons, but the report was not brought by the patient. That tear, however, was not seen in the shoulder the subject of these proceedings. The plaintiff had had a right shoulder repair performed surgically in January 2011, nine months before the accident, and was still recovering from it at the time of the accident.

30On 5 March 2012, the plaintiff consulted Dr John Trantalis and told him she suffered an injury when a bus had to stop suddenly and she was thrown sideways. She said that she grabbed onto a pole with her left arm and felt a sudden pain in her shoulder. 

31This is the first description she had made of grabbing the pole with her left arm, although one earlier reference to her symptoms referred to her hitting her head on a pole. 

32There is no doubt that the plaintiff's rotator cuff injury is genuine, severe and inoperable. The question is its causation, given the very differing accounts of the plaintiff concerning the circumstances of her injury.

The plaintiff's description of her injury to medico-legal experts

33The description given by the plaintiff to the court and to the medicolegal practitioners retained in these proceedings differ markedly from the description she gave doctors prior to March 2012, the description of the accident in her statement of claim (including the amended statement of claim) and in her report to the police. 

34The description given to Dr James G Bodel was as follows:

""Ms Gialouris indicates that the driver of the bus was travelling too fast. She was approaching an area where roadworks were being done and she had to brake suddenly to avoid hitting the workers at that area. The vehicle also steered violently to the right hand side and Ms Gialouris indicates that her husband was thrown out of his seat and onto the floor into the area near where the tickets are sold at the front of the bus and she was thrown towards the right hand side, twisted, grabbed the vertical pole near where she was sitting with her left arm and saved herself from falling on top of her husband. She did however hit her face on the vertical pole and she had to be taken to the nearby Robina Hospital where the cut on the eye was dressed and x-rays were taken but no fractures were seen.

She states that she and her husband then travelled home to Sydney where she came under the care of her local doctor in Caringbah. She had various treatments including physiotherapy and hydrotherapy and chiropractic treatment for her neck and back and left shoulder but eventually she was referred to Dr Trantalis, an orthopaedic surgeon, and he undertook an injection of local anaesthetic and hydrocortisone which did not help but she then had that repeated under ultrasound control and that was of some temporary benefit.

She also had an MRI scan of the left shoulder which shows evidence of a ""full thickness tear involving 18 mm of the anterolateral attachment of the supraspinatus tendon with minimal medial retraction of the torn fragment"". The scans show that this is in fact an insertional injury. It is full thickness anteriorly but not across the whole width of the supraspinatus tendon.

Ms Gialouris indicates that Dr Trantalis has indicated that she really should consider surgery but she states that she cannot do that as she has to care for her husband. She is continuing to use physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and chiropractic treatment intermittently and that helps her to maintain function in the neck and the back and the left shoulder.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY

This lady suffers with hypertension for which she takes medication. She also has a raised current hearing loss level and takes thyroxine. She many years ago had a brain tumour and did have headaches for about three weeks after the bus accident but that settled and the CT scan of the brain was normal.

PREVIOUS CLAIMS

Nil.""

35Not surprisingly Dr Bodel considered there was a ""direct causal link between the episode of injury to the left shoulder in the bus accident and the aggravation to the neck and back in the bus accident"" (page 5, report 31 October 2012, Exhibit A). However, Dr Bodel has not examined the history of the plaintiff's complaint, and seen the difference between the version he has been given and that given to other doctors, or taken into account the five month delay in symptoms and diagnosis. Even the first time the plaintiff described the accident in this way, in the account she gave to Dr Trantalis, according to his report of 5 March 2012, made no reference to the dramatic claim that she was nearly thrown on top of her husband, but simply noted that she was thrown sideways and ""grabbed onto a pole with her left arm and felt a sudden pain in her shoulder"" (Exhibit A, Tab 12).

36The delay is comparatively short. It would not be surprising if there were some delay between the accident and subsequent reports of injury. It is not unknown for plaintiffs to realise for long periods of time that they have suffered an injury. On occasions, gaps of up to two years without prior complaints to medical practitioners had been considered reasonable by the New South Wales Court of Appeal: McGlen-McLeod v Galloway [2012] NSWCA 368.

37In the present case, however, I must be guided by the medical reports and reports of accident which have been tendered, and which paint a consistent picture of the plaintiff giving very different accounts at the time of the accident when compared to the account she gave months after the event. 

38If the plaintiff had suffered the injuries in the manner she described, and she had no prior difficulties with her left shoulder, the plaintiff's claim would be a straightforward one. However, not only was Dr Bodel given a version of the accident which is inconsistent with the plaintiff's contemporaneous accounts to the police and to the hospital, but omitted the plaintiff's prior history of problems with her left shoulder. As the plaintiff agreed in her evidence at T 5-6, she had torn her tendons in her other shoulder and had undergone surgery for this on 17 February 2011, about nine months before the accident. The importance of this evidence is explained in Dr Boys' report, set out below.

39Thus the plaintiff's medical reports suffer three defects: failure to observe and comment on the change in the description of events, failure to note the delay in symptoms, and failure to obtain a full history of significant other injuries. The most important of these is the inconsistency in the plaintiff's account of the injury.

The court's approach to inconsistent accounts of the circumstances of accident and late complaints of injury

40Inconsistencies in accounts of the circumstances of injury, particularly in relation to histories given to medical practitioners, are extremely common. The Court of Appeal has, on many occasions, warned trial judges not to be unduly concerned by apparent inconsistencies: Davis v Council of the City of Wagga Wagga [2004] NSWCA 34; Ferguson v McDonalds [2005] NSWCA 401; Kappadoukas v Fransepp Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 366; Container Terminals Australia v Huseyin [2008] NSWCA 320; Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227; Mastronardi v State of New South Wales [2009] NSWCA 270; Tchen v Nominal Defendant [2010] NSWCA 245; Hill v Richards [2011] NSWCA 291; Gulic v O'Neill [2011] NSWCA 361.

41Similarly, the importance of a chronology in personal injury proceedings is to highlight the commonly occurring problem of delay in reporting injuries. In Whalan v Kogarah Municipal Council [2007] NSWCA 5 and Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14 the Court of Appeal warned against uncritical acceptance (or rejection) of the plaintiff's account of events as opposed to an objective analysis of the chronology of events and in particular any delays in reporting injuries. A third commonly occurring problem is that the plaintiff's full medical history is not put to his or her own doctors. This is perhaps the most serious problem for the reasons explained by Heydon JA in Makita (Aust) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [69].

42These proceedings illustrate all three of these problems. I shall deal with each of them in turn.

Reconciling the plaintiff's different versions of the accident

43As is noted above, the plaintiff's account of her accident in the witness box is inconsistent with the description of events in both the original and amended statements of claim (filed 13 November 2013), the accounts she and her husband gave to the police and hospital, and all the medical practitioners she consulted until February 2013. 

44Where a plaintiff gives one version of the accident at the time to her doctors, or to other third parties, and another to the court, particularly in circumstances where there is delay, problems in fact-finding arise. What is necessary in such circumstances is a close examination of the factual background.

45In McGlen-McLeod v Galloway [2012] NSWCA 368, the plaintiff suffered an injury on 28 May 2008 when one of her legs fell through a hole in rotting floor boards on the veranda of rented premises. She received treatment, including an X-ray of the right leg, at the emergency centre at the local hospital that day, when her right leg was bandaged. She had her left leg bandage removed by her general practitioner a week later and a further X-ray recommended, as she had slipped and hurt her left leg a second time (McGlen-McLeod v Galloway [2011] NSWDC 163 at [12]). She did not consult any medical practitioners about leg injuries until 10 November 2009, when she told a doctor she had injured her left leg while pushing a car (at [19]). In December 2009 she commenced proceedings for damages, asserting that her May 2008 injury was to her right leg and not to her left leg. Her de facto partner, who witnessed the May 2008 accident, was not called as a witness. The NSW Court of Appeal set aside the findings that the plaintiff had not injured her right leg in the accident and remitted the proceedings to the District Court for rehearing as to causation, in part because there was no adverse credit finding in relation to the plaintiff. Tobias JA held at [103] - [104]:

""[103] In the result, it appears that the primary judge has rejected the reports referred to because they were generally based upon an inaccurate pre-accident work history provided to them by the appellant, and the failure to provide the doctors with the hospital notes and entries by the general practitioners whom the appellant consulted in 2008 and 2009. However neither of these matters can militate against the medical findings, opinions and prognoses expressed by each of the doctors concerned with respect to the injuries which the appellant asserted that she had sustained in the accident. Even if those practitioners had been made aware of the entries in the hospital notes as well as in the records of Drs Heslop, Cheney and Hertzberg, that would not have advanced the position as those doctors were not qualified to express a view as to whether it was her left leg or her right leg which fell through the floorboards. All they could do, and did do, was to express a view, which her Honour accepted, that her injuries were consistent with her right leg having fallen through the floorboards.

[104] Furthermore, the only other relevance of the reports with respect to the issue of causation (as distinct from damages) was that the appellant was entirely consistent in asserting to each of the practitioners concerned that it was indeed her right leg that fell through the floorboards and not her left leg. The issue which then arose was whether her evidence in this respect was credible and reliable. The hospital notes and the entries of the general practitioners were obviously relevant to this issue but, in my opinion, whatever inconsistencies were contained in them needed to be assessed against the credibility of the appellant in terms of her oral evidence both in chief and in cross-examination. That required an analysis of that evidence and an assessment of how it impacted upon the inconsistencies upon which her Honour relied on the causation issue. The appellant was, in my opinion, entitled to such an assessment. She was entitled to know whether she was or was not believed on her oath. Unfortunately, she was deprived of that right. It follows that there was a failure to take account of the appellant's evidence in a number of critical respects when determining the causation issue.""

46His Honour set out the submissions of the appellant at [121] and went on to agree with them.

47Tobias JA noted the dangers of proceeding on the basis of notes written by busy practitioners and delay in complaint where there was subsequent consistent report of the circumstances of injury for the purpose of medico-legal reports (at [124]). All of these factors apply here.

48However, the evidence in these proceedings is far stronger. This evidence consists of:

(a)Corroborative evidence in the form of contemporaneous statements to the police by the plaintiff, the plaintiff's husband and the bus driver.

(b)Expert evidence analysing the different explanations and the delay.

(c)Additionally, I have made credit findings about the plaintiff.

Corroborative evidence

49I have set out above the relevant corroborative evidence of the police statements by the plaintiff and her husband, the contemporaneous report of the bus driver and her evidence before me (which was of such a compelling nature that she was not cross-examined about the plaintiff's version of events; she simply denied them in examination in chief). 

50Even allowing for the Court of Appeal's reservations about the accuracy of ambulance and general practitioners' notes (which, thanks to electronic reporting and record-keeping, are hopefully less of an issue now), the ambulance report and the general practitioners' notes could not be clearer. The plaintiff did not grab the pole and did not complain of shoulder pain prior to February 2012, when there were plenty of intervening reasons (such as picking up her grandchildren, something she had to stop doing at about that time because of the pain) for this condition.

51Unlike McGlen-McLeod, where the plaintiff did not call the witness to her accident, this accident was seen by the plaintiff's husband and he reported the events to the police. Additionally, although the bus driver did not see the plaintiff injure herself, she would have seen the plaintiff's husband if he had fallen on her floor, because he would have fallen beside her.

52All of the corroborative evidence points to the accident occurring in circumstances where the plaintiff did not grab the pole or otherwise injure her arm, and in circumstances where there was no complaint of arm pain until nearly five months later.

Expert evidence 

53In McGlen-McLeod, the court did not have the benefit of expert evidence examining the inconsistent medical history; the plaintiff's medico-legal experts accepted her evidence and the defendant's expert evidence simply dismissed her claims. 

54In these proceedings, the court has the benefit of reports from Dr Peter Boys, who initially considered (report 24 April 2013, Exhibit 1) that the plaintiff's injuries corresponded with the medical history she provided, but later concluded, having examined that medical history more closely, as well as her contemporaneous accounts of the accident, as follows:

""Subsequent to your correspondence of 30 April 2014 I have reviewed my notes and report concerning consultation on 24 April 2013.

I have reviewed the Schedule of Reports received subsequent to that date:

- Photographs depicting Surfside Bus

- Patient History

- Consultation Record

- Patient Summary

- Subpoenaed materials

These documents have been examined.

It was noted at the time of consultation that Ms Gialouris did note a past history of disability referable to the left shoulder with symptoms in 2007 initiating orthopaedic referral to Professor G Murrell. This history has been confirmed by perusal of the documentation of the Caringbah Medical Centre (Dr Romeo Robles) with a report provided by Dr A Paton (Radiologist) directed to radiographs of the left shoulder performed on 16 April 2008. I note the findings at fat time:

... There is mild osteoarthritic change in the glenohumeral and AC joints, No bony lesions or rotator cuff calcifications are seen. The subacromial space is normal...

The letter of referral provided by Dr Romeo Robles to Professor George Murrell dated 16 April 2008 is noted in this context:

... She has been having pain in her left shoulder for some time. She suffers from osteoarthritis. She wants to have a cortisone injection...

In the context of this lady's left shoulder complaints experienced in the period prior to the claimed bus accident on 6 September 20111 note no contemporaneous record referable to the left shoulder and the referral by Dr S Ibrahim for an ultrasound examination of the left shoulder performed on 17 February 2012.

I have previously opined that this lady suffered soft tissue injury to the region of the left shoulder (with aggravation of pre-existing degenerative change within the left rotator cuff) as a consequence of the claimed injury of 6 September 2011. This opinion has been formed in the light of the history provided to me by Ms Gialouris that she had pain in the left shoulder region (in association with neck and low back pain) at or about the time of initial assessment at the Robina Hospital. If it is accepted as a matter of fact that this lady did have a symptomatic condition of the left shoulder subsequent to the claim bus injury my opinions are unchanged.

If it is accepted that this lady had no specific complaint referable to the left shoulder over a period of some 5 months following injury it would be my opinion that symptoms experienced in the ensuing period are likely to reflect the effects of a pre-existing degenerative condition and, in this context, the bus accident of 6 September 2011 had not given rise to specific injury to the left shoulder region."" (Exhibit 1, Tab 5)

55There is no such evidence from any expert called by the plaintiff. Either they have not noticed the inconsistencies or they have simply failed to explain them. Dr Boys' careful analysis is thus to be preferred.

Credit issues

56The plaintiff was deeply distressed about her condition, in circumstances where family problems, including her granddaughter's ill health, have crowded other issues out of her conscious mind. She wept openly as she described her distress at being unable to help in the care of her granddaughter, or even to pick her up. 

57In response to a question about the ambulance report being different to what she had said happened, the plaintiff said, ""you can quote whatever you want"" (T 36). The plaintiff's response to these pieces of evidence being put to her in cross-examination was to deny them and to repeat that her version of events was correct.

58The plaintiff has persuaded herself that her accident has happened in a certain way and responds to evidence to the contrary with a flat denial. The relevant parts of her demeanour are her level of distress and unhappiness about family matters which appears to have overwhelmed her powers of reasoning and accurate recollection. Where her evidence is in conflict with that of Mrs Tehau, I prefer to accept the evidence of Mrs Tehau. 

59I am satisfied, therefore, that the plaintiff's shoulder injury is not causally related to the injuries she suffered while travelling in the defendant's bus. 

Damages

60The plaintiff makes no claim for non-economic loss whatever my findings of causation. The claims are restricted to past and future domestic care and assistance and out-of-pocket expenses. The plaintiff claims amounts totalling $145,024.70.

Past and future out-of-pocket expenses

61The plaintiff claims $5,049.70 for past out-of-pocket expenses and a ""cushion"" of $10,000 for future out-of-pocket expenses, principally Panadol Osteo and visits to the general practitioner.

62The defendant concedes that past out-of-pocket expenses of $4,191.20 relate to the plaintiff's condition of which $2,748.40 should be credited to the defendant, resulting in a net figure of $1,442.80.

63The amount of past out-of-pocket expenses relating to the left shoulder treatment are $858.50. 

64Conformably with my findings as to the lack of relationship between the plaintiff's shoulder injury and the accident, I propose to allow $1,442.80 for the plaintiff's past out-of-pocket expenses. I note the difference in sums between the calculations of the plaintiff and defendant but prefer to err on the side of caution and accept the evidence of the defendant. The difference in amount is slight.

65The plaintiff claims $10,000 for future prescriptions of Panadol Osteo and visits to the general practitioner. The defendant submits that this figure should be $0 as the plaintiff suffered only minor soft tissue injuries which have completely resolved. Conformably with my findings as to the plaintiff's lack of injury, I do not make any allowance for future out-of-pocket expenses.

Past and future care and assistance

66The plaintiff's past care and assistance claim is mathematically agreed to be $8,280 which was paid for cleaning expenses. A future claim for domestic care and assistance of $121,695 is made.

67Conformably with my findings that the plaintiff's rotator cuff injury is unrelated to the circumstances in which she injured herself while travelling on the defendant's bus, I do not propose to make any award for past and future care and assistance. The plaintiff is currently aged 73 and is approaching old age. She has a long history of medical problems, including a repair to her other shoulder. 

68If I have erred in this regard, I note that the plaintiff would nevertheless, notwithstanding her other physical infirmities, be unable to get over the threshold. 

Concluding remarks

69The amount to be awarded to the plaintiff is $1,442.80.

70The amount awarded to the plaintiff falls below the threshold in r 42.35 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), which provides:

""42.35 Costs order not to be made in proceedings in District Court unless Court satisfied proceedings in appropriate court

(1) This rule applies if:

(a) in proceedings in the District Court, a plaintiff has obtained a judgment against the defendant or, if more than one defendant, against all the defendants, in an amount of less than $40,000, and

(b) the plaintiff would, apart from this rule, be entitled to an order for costs against the defendant or defendants.

(2) An order for costs may be made, but will not ordinarily be made, unless the District Court is satisfied the commencement and continuation of the proceedings in the District Court, rather than the Local Court, was warranted.""

71Accordingly, liberty to apply in relation to costs has been granted. However, given the smallness of the sum, I invite the parties to consider agreeing issues as to costs, to avoid further expenditure. This was a causation issue of some complexity and, without wishing to express a concluded view, it was not unreasonable to commence and continue these proceedings in this court, given the amount of time and cross-examination involved and the fact that Queensland legislation applied.

Orders

(1)Judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of $1,442.80.

(2)Costs reserved with liberty to apply.

(3)Exhibits retained for 28 days.

		11 December 2014",2014-09-18 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704497,Yousif v R [2014] NSWCCA 180,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceThe applicant pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company contrary to s97(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. 
2On 26 August 2013 he was sentenced by Craigie DCJ SC to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years 1 month and 20 days to date from 23 September 2012 and expire on 11 November 2014 with an additional term of 2 years 1 month and 20 days to expire on 31 December 2016.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following ground:
The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity in the sentence imposed upon the applicant and that imposed upon the co-offender.
Factual Background
4At approximately 11pm on Sunday 5 February 2012 the complainant boarded a train from Wynyard to Parramatta.  He was listening to music through his iPhone with headphones on and was carrying a backpack containing a number of personal items, a credit and debit card, a packet of cigarettes and approximately $180 in cash.
5At around 11.25pm while the train was somewhere between Strathfield and Lidcombe, he was approached by two males.  One stood in front of him and the other stood beside him.  The one who stood in front of him was the co-offender, Mahmoud Allam.  The applicant was the person who stood beside him.
6Allam demanded cigarettes and the mobile phone from the complainant.  When the complainant refused, he produced a knife, which appeared to be a domestic cooking knife, some 4 inches in length.  The knife was pressed against the complainant's left thigh.  At this point the complainant shouted for help and was punched, although it is not known by whom.  
7Thereafter, Allam began hitting the complainant's head with the butt end of the knife handle.  The complainant also received several punches to the front, back and side of his head with most of those blows landing on the right hand side.  Again it is not known who was doing the punching.
8While he was being punched, the complainant's mobile phone was removed from his hand by one of the offenders, who also demanded that he give up his wallet.  The complainant covered his face and head while continuing to scream for help.  He heard the words ""Give me your wallet"" repeated several times.  While this was happening, Allam started to poke the complainant with the knife point, pressing it into his left thigh, and saying that he would stab him.
9As the complainant tried to stand up and continued shouting for help, his backpack was ripped from his shoulder and one of the offenders said to the other ""There's someone let's go, go, go"".
10It was common ground that apart from the possession of the knife by Allam, it was not known which of the offenders punched the complainant.  The Crown accepted that it was unable to prove that the applicant actually struck the complainant at any time.  The Crown noted, however, that by his plea the applicant accepted responsibility for the violence which was administered to the complainant.
11When apprehended by the police, the applicant denied that he was involved in the offence and maintained that denial during the course of an ERISP.  Upon the completion of the ERISP as he was being walked outside for a cigarette, the applicant said to the officer in charge of the investigation:
""We robbed the wrong bloke, it was meant to be a bloke carrying money for the Rebels.  We thought it was him.  We got the wrong bloke.""
Despite that admission, the applicant maintained his denial of liability until the first day of the trial when he pleaded guilty to the offence.
12Allam came before Woodburne DCJ SC on 26 April 2013 for sentence.  Allam had been convicted by her Honour after a judge alone trial.  Her Honour concluded that there was a level of pre planning because Allam had a small knife held in his hand when he approached the complainant.  Her Honour characterised the offence as serious because it involved an unprovoked and unwarranted attack by two men on one who was unarmed and who was doing no more than travelling on a train.  The offence was committed for no other reason than for financial gain.
13In relation to Allam's subjective case, her Honour noted that he had been convicted on 14 September 2007 of an identical offence, i.e. robbery in company.  Her Honour also noted that Allam was on bail for the offence of resist officer in execution of duty and destroy/damage property.  Allam was aged 24 at the time of the offence and 25 at the time of sentence.  In his favour, her Honour found that he had a good employment record and that he had successfully completed a rehabilitation program.  He had also accepted responsibility for his offending which her Honour found was consistent with remorse.  Nevertheless, her Honour regarded his prospects of rehabilitation as guarded.
14When imposing a sentence for this offence, her Honour took into account an offence on a Form 1.  The facts of that offence were that when arrested Allam threatened that he would find the police officer concerned and kill him.  Her Honour regarded that as a serious instance of intimidation of a police officer.
15Her Honour found special circumstances because of the need to promote rehabilitation, particularly in relation to his poly-substance abuse and anger management issues.  The sentence imposed was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months, i.e. a total sentence of 5 years.
Proceedings before sentencing judge
16His Honour in this case had regard to the maximum penalty for this offence, which he regarded as a clear signal of Parliament's view of the seriousness of this kind of offence.  By comparison with the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 his Honour noted the following similarities - a young offender, a weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, a limited degree of planning, limited actual violence, a victim in a vulnerable position, a small amount taken and a plea of guilty.  The differences were that this applicant had a very significant criminal record, albeit sustained as a juvenile, and was on parole at the time for an identical offence, i.e. robbery in company.  Taking those matters into account, together with the late plea of guilty, this offence was more serious than that envisaged in the Henry guideline judgment.
17In relation to the late plea of guilty, his Honour determined the appropriate discount to be 10 percent.
18When considering the applicant's subjective circumstances, his Honour noted that his youth had been disrupted in that he was a refugee from Iraq and his family had suffered persecution under Saddam Hussein in the course of which his father had been executed.  His Honour also took into account that he had a truly appalling criminal record, having been convicted on 14 previous occasions of offences of robbery in company, armed robbery, and steal from the person.  There were numerous other convictions of lesser seriousness.
19His Honour took into account the pre-sentence report which stated:  ""Having displayed negative behaviour towards staff and other inmates, he incurred numerous institutional misconduct charges resulting in periods of segregation.  Whilst on parole, breach action was initiated on three occasions for ongoing illicit drug use, failure to comply with directions in regards to intervention strategies and re-offence"".  By reference to his imprisonment on this occasion, the pre-sentence report recorded 42 conduct breaches, including entries for intimidation, fighting, possessing drugs, damaging property and failing to comply with the custodial institution's routine.
20His Honour noted that the applicant was released to parole on 26 July 2011, about three weeks before his nineteenth birthday, and that this offence which was of the same kind occurred a little over 7 months later.  In evidence before his Honour the applicant admitted that he had been a party to the initial plan to rob an individual who was thought to be carrying money for the Rebels motorbike group.  He denied punching the victim, but accepted his complicity in the robbery.
21The applicant gave evidence which was consistent with some psychiatric problems, including hallucinations and depression.  The veracity of these complaints, however, was rejected by Dr Keller, a psychiatrist from Justice Health, who examined the applicant and whose report was before the sentencing judge.  His Honour rejected any psychiatric condition but accepted that the offending took place in the setting of an entrenched drug abuse habit.  His Honour considered that this explained the offending rather than excused it.
22In relation to parity, his Honour said:
""As to the issue of parity: there are a number of disparate features in relation to the co-offender.  That offender did not plead guilty, consequently he was afforded no reduction for utility that would flow from the plea and was afforded no allowance for contrition, that being inconsistent with defending the matter.  It is not disputed that it was also the co-offender who was the initiator of the offence.  There was also, in his case, a Form 1 to be taken into account and to be reflected in the severity of the overall sentence.  The co-offender was in his mid twenties and therefore older than the present offender.  His background was not disadvantaged but he, like the offender, had entries for prior robbery offences, including one robbery in company that was dealt with in this court when he was an adult in 2007.  I conclude therefore that in each of the relevant respects, the co-offender's position was distinguishable from that of this offender, who has both pleaded guilty and expressed contrition over and above that that is inherent in a guilty plea.
...
I do have regard to the degree of violence that cannot be specifically sheeted home to him and which was at a greater level as established as against the co-offender Allam, who was also the principal initiator and planner of the robbery of an intended victim and in producing the knife with which he struck Mr Singh, a target and victim of opportunity.  His conduct was certainly of a higher level.  Accordingly, this is a matter where parity, as opposed to some appropriate measure of proportion, will not be applied.""
23His Honour also had regard to the revocation of parole on 9 March 2012.  His Honour took that into account by moderately backdating the commencement of the sentence.  It was for that reason that his Honour specified the commencement date of the sentence as 23 September 2012.  Allowing for that backdating, the effective non-parole period of imprisonment to be served by the applicant directly referable to this offence was 1 year, 11 months and 20 days and the total effective sentence was 4 years, 1 month and 9 days.
Submissions
24The applicant submitted that when one looked at the starting point for the sentences imposed on each of the offenders, the starting point for Allam's term of imprisonment was 60 months and that of the applicant 57 months before the 10 percent discount.  The applicant submitted that such a comparison revealed a marked disparity which would lead an objective observer to conclude that the applicant would have a justifiable sense of grievance given the different roles and circumstances of the two offenders.
25The applicant submitted that although the sentencing judge had concluded that the conduct of Allam was of a higher level of seriousness than that of the applicant, this was not reflected in the sentences imposed in that there was only a difference of 3 months in the starting point for the head sentences.  The applicant submitted that given that Allam initiated the offence, produced a knife during the robbery, was in his mid twenties and did not have a disadvantaged background, the starting point for the sentence imposed on the applicant should have been significantly lower than the starting point for Allam so as to meet the principle of equal justice.
Consideration
26The doctrine of parity on sentencing is a norm of equal justice and an essential element of the rule of law:  Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 463 at [28].  The principle of equal justice requires as far as the law permits that like be treated alike and that differential treatment be meted out to reflect differences between those that are relevantly different:  Green and Quinn at [28]; Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 608; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540.
27In Green and Quinn, the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said at [31] and [32]:
""31 Because appeals are creatures of statute, the parity principle in appeals against sentence arises in a statutory context. The jurisdictions to entertain such appeals, conferred by statutes on courts of criminal appeal in Australia, are supported by powers to increase or reduce sentences affected by appealable error. In the exercise of those powers in appeals by convicted persons, and subject to the applicable sentencing statutes, a court may ""reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender."" The exercise of the statutory discretion is informed by the common law norm. Gibbs CJ said in Lowe v The Queen:
""the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done.""
The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.

32 A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive. Disparity can be an indicator of appealable error.  It is also correct, as Mason J said in Lowe, that logic and reality combine to favour the proposition that discrepancy is a ground for intervention in itself. Unjustifiable disparity is an infringement of the equal justice norm. It is appealable error, although it may not always lead to an appeal being allowed. If an appeal is allowed on the ground of disparity, a court of criminal appeal in re-sentencing is not required to achieve identity of punishment. It must have regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender and give it appropriate weight. In such a case, an appeal to this Court on the question whether a disparity identified in a court of criminal appeal was unjustifiable and called for intervention by that court would also involve review of a qualitative and discretionary judgment.""
28Applying those principles to the facts of this case, it is apparent that the differences and similarities are such that when looked at objectively, there is no basis for any justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.  As was said McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and Harrison JJ agreed) in  Kelso v R  [2010] NSWCCA 34 at [22] - [23]:
""22  The principles must be considered when complaint is made of disparate sentences are well understood. It is not enough that there is disparity in the sentences. Some disparities are inevitable. In Postiglione v R (1996-1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 Kirby J at 338 remarked that ""mere disparity is not enough to justify intervention by an appellate court."" Before this Court will intervene, the disparity of the sentences must be such ""as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done."" Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606. 

23  The principles were recently reviewed by Howie J in England & Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [62] where his Honour said:
""It should be borne in mind that the High Court's decisions on this area of appellate intervention speak of 'gross', 'marked', 'glaring', or 'manifest' disparity. These terms are used throughout the judgment in Lowe v R. Another way of considering the issue is to ask whether the two sentences give rise to an appearance that justice has not been done per Gibbs CJ at 610 and Dawson at 623.""""
29A comparison of the subjective features of the two offenders illustrates the point.  Apart from the fact that the applicant had a disadvantaged background and was younger, (although both offenders were young), Allam had a much stronger subjective case than the applicant.  The applicant had a significantly worse criminal record than Allam, including as it did 14 prior convictions for robbery in company, armed robbery and steal from the person, compared with 2 robberies by Allam many years before.  Moreover, the applicant was still on parole for a prior robbery in company.  The applicant had been released to parole in respect of that robbery in company only seven months before this offence.  His Honour quite correctly took this into account as ""a significant aggravating factor"".  
30Such a repetition of offending has been treated as a matter of ""major aggravation"" by this Court.  In R v Jones (unreported, NSWCCA, 30 June 1994) Finlay J (with whom Carruthers and Badgery-Parker JJ agreed) said at p 6:
""Here the applicant committed this offence while on conditional liberty following his conviction for an identical offence.  That is, undoubtedly a matter of major aggravation.  When offenders are given conditional liberty - be it on parole or when they are subject to periodic detention orders, community service orders or on recognisance to be of good behaviour or, indeed, on bail for alleged offences - the commission of additional offences is a serious matter.""
31The applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were virtually nil.  Not only did the applicant concede in evidence that he had a ""bad attitude"" and had a recalcitrant habit of consuming illicit substances, his conduct while in custody awaiting sentence, demonstrated a complete absence of any intention to change his behaviour.  As the author of the pre-sentence report observed, his behaviour while in custody was ""abysmal"".  Forty two misconduct charges while in custody before sentencing including intimidation, fight/combat, possess drug, damage/destroy property and failure to comply with prison routine is demonstrative of an absence of any intention to change behaviour.
32With regard to the objective seriousness of the offending of each offender, there is little to differentiate their behaviour during the offence.  Both were aware of a plan to rob a person associated with the Rebels motorbike gang.  While it is true that Allam had the knife, the applicant was standing next to the victim throughout the offending and in so doing, played an important role in the intimidation of the victim.  Implicit in his plea of guilty is his adoption of the criminal behaviour of Allam.
33The evidence as to the punching of the victim is not to the effect that the applicant did not punch him, rather it is to the effect that it cannot be established which of the offenders (if not both of them) struck the victim.
34Looked at in that way, the only significant point of distinction between the actions of the offenders established by the evidence was that Allam undoubtedly held the knife, otherwise there was little or no difference in the objective seriousness of their offending behaviour.  That having been said, his Honour did find that the offending of Allam was objectively more serious than that of the applicant.
35When the sentences imposed on the applicant and Allam are considered against that background, the differences between them do not demonstrate a basis for the applicant having a justifiable sense of grievance.  
36When one has regard to the backdating of the commencement date of the applicant's sentence, the difference between his sentence and that of Allam takes into account the modest difference in the criminality of their offending and the substantially stronger subjective case of Allam.  This is particularly so when one has regard to the very generous finding of special circumstances made by his Honour in favour of the applicant.  Despite there being almost no prospects of rehabilitation on the part of the applicant, the ratio of his non-parole period to the total sentence was 50 percent.
37This ground of appeal has not been made out.
38The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

		12 September 2014",2014-09-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704499,Pym v R [2014] NSWCCA 182,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2PRICE J:  I agree with Fullerton J.
3FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal out of time against sentences imposed by Sides DCJ on 4 June 2012 after he entered pleas of guilty on arraignment to one count of wounding with intent to murder contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and one count of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act.
4Both offences carry a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with standard non-parole periods of 10 and 7 years respectively.
5After allowing a discount of 10 per cent for the pleas of guilty the applicant was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 years for the offence contrary to s 27 of the Crimes Act, and 14 years and 5 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years for the offence contrary to s 33(1)(a).  The sentences were partially accumulated, resulting in a total effective sentence of 20 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 14 years.  
6The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal:Ground 1:  The omission to adduce psychiatric evidence relevant to his case on sentence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
Ground 2:  The sentences imposed are manifestly excessive.
7In support of the first ground of appeal, the applicant relied upon four reports from Dr Richard Furst, forensic psychiatrist.  The reports, dated 13 December 2010, 22 October 2011 (the first two reports), 31 May 2012 (the third report) and 6 September 2013 (the fourth report), were annexed to the affidavit of Ms Psaltis, solicitor, dated 11 June 2014.  The first two reports were available at the time of sentence but were not tendered in the sentence proceedings.  A redacted version of the third report was tendered.  Counsel submitted that the effect of the redaction withdrew from the consideration of the sentencing judge Dr Furst's opinion that it was likely the applicant was in dissociative mental state at the time he committed the offences.  It also deleted any reference to the material Dr Furst relied upon in coming to that view, together with his analysis of that material.  (A detailed comparison of the redacted and unredacted third report is set out at [68] of this judgment.)  Dr Furst's fourth report was obtained in preparation for the appeal.
8The applicant submitted that the unredacted version of the third report, and the first two reports which Dr Furst stipulated were to be read in conjunction with it, contained material essential to an appreciation of the applicant's mental state and functioning at the time of the offending.  It was further submitted that to tender the redacted version of the third report without Dr Furst's authority, coupled with the failure to tender the two earlier reports, was productive of a miscarriage of justice since it foreclosed the sentencing judge's consideration of relevant expert evidence which would likely have operated in significant mitigation of sentence.  
9The fourth report was relied upon as containing Dr Furst's settled opinion as to the applicant's mental state and functioning at the time of the offences in a form which should have been before the sentencing judge.  In that report Dr Furst expressed the opinion that the applicant had a compromised capacity to fully appreciate his conduct or to exercise proper judgment or control at the time that he committed the offences because he was in what Dr Furst described as an ""altered state of consciousness"".  Counsel submitted that had Dr Furst's opinion as to the causal connection between the applicant's compromised capacity for judgment and self-control and his offending been before the sentencing judge, it would have invoked application of settled principles as to the impact of an offender's mental illness or condition in mitigation of sentence (as to which see Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1; 205 A Crim R 1) and that the failure to seek to establish that critical causal connection in this case has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
10Although Dr Furst's fourth report constituted fresh evidence, the Crown objected to only part of the report.  Those parts were either not pressed or ruled inadmissible.  
11On the appeal, the Crown tendered, without objection, three reports from Dr Bruce Westmore, forensic psychiatrist.  The first of Dr Westmore's reports, dated 5 May 2011, and the second, dated 27 September 2011, were provided to Dr Furst by the applicant's then solicitors prior to the preparation of Dr Furst's second report.  Dr Westmore's third report, dated 27 August 2013, was obtained by the applicant's solicitors after sentence.  None of Dr Westmore's reports were before the sentencing judge.  The redacted third report made no mention of Dr Furst having been provided with Dr Westmore's reports although the second report did make reference to them.
12In Dr Westmore's third report he expressed the opinion that it was most unlikely that the applicant was suffering from any state of disassociation when he committed the offences or that he was in any state of disassociation prior to the offending.  Dr Westmore concluded that any apparent disassociation or disorientation identified by police following the applicant's arrest was most likely to have occurred because of the offending rather than being a cause of it.  
13The Crown indicated its intention to cross-examine Dr Furst as to the basis upon which he came to a contrary view and what was said to be an unexplained shift in diagnoses across the body of the reports.  Dr Furst was available on the hearing of the appeal.  In the course of oral argument it was accepted by the Crown that if the Court were persuaded that the sentence proceedings miscarried, then the appropriate forum for the parties to test the evidence of both of the forensic psychiatrists is in a newly constituted sentence proceeding in the District Court and that the appropriate order is for the matter to be remitted to enable that to occur.  Counsel for the applicant concurred.
14The applicant also relied upon an unsworn affidavit from counsel who appeared on his behalf in the sentence proceedings in which counsel detailed the advice he gave the applicant as to the weight of the evidence in the Crown case and the likely course of any trial in which the Crown was put to proof on the question of his legal capacity.  In particular, counsel gave advice that the defence of non-insane automatism was unlikely to succeed.  Counsel also recorded the applicant's instructions upon receiving that advice, including the fact that he did not wish to give evidence.  He said that the applicant instructed him that he would enter pleas of guilty, and that after some negotiations over the form of the charges, the matter was set down for sentence.
15Counsel said that his decision as to what to tender in the proceedings on sentence, including the redacted version of the third report, was based on the following factors:
[The applicant] had given instructions to plead guilty;
Those instructions had been given on the basis that the Crown would have no difficulty in proving that [the applicant] had committed the physical acts involved in the offences;
That [the applicant] claimed to have no memory of the events; 
That the ""defence"" raised by Dr Furst was unlikely to be made out as in Dr Furst's report it was based on:
(a) Dr Furst's correct view ""that there was no logical reason"" for the attack;
(b) ""The observations of the victims and police pointed to the likelihood that [the applicant] was in an altered state of consciousness at the time"";
(c) that, therefore, there were ""reasonable possibilities he was suffering from a dissociative amnestic state at the time""; and
(d) that ""he has the defence of automatism open to him"". 
Dr Furst did not state that [the applicant] was suffering from a dissociative state, only that there were reasonable possibilities that this was the case; 
...
It was [counsel's] view that in order to prove the defence of automatism [the applicant] would have to give evidence about his memory or otherwise;
[The applicant] was averse to giving evidence at trial;
Even if he did, his evidence was unlikely to be accepted by a jury particularly given Dr Furst's assessment of him as a pathological liar; 
Any trial would necessarily involve further trauma to the victims;
The sentence after trial ... would be greater than if he pleaded guilty; 
There was a risk if ""automatism"" was referred to in a report tendered on sentence the sentencing judge could consider it to be a traverse of the plea and that a trial could ensue; and 
[The applicant] was not prepared to give evidence on sentence.
16Counsel further deposed to the fact that he did not have any specific recollection of considering whether to tender Dr Furst's earlier reports, but reading them since the hearing led him to conclude that he probably did not consider that they would have advanced the applicant's case on sentence.  Counsel did not consider calling Dr Furst or relying upon his opinion that the applicant was in a dissociative state such that his mental functioning was compromised to any degree as a mitigating factor on sentence. 
17The Crown accepted that counsel's ill health prevented the applicant from obtaining a sworn affidavit for the purposes of the appeal or having counsel attend for cross-examination.  In those circumstances the Crown did not object to the unsworn affidavit being tendered.  The applicant waived legal professional privilege.
The application for leave to appeal out of time 
18The notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal was filed on 6 July 2012, four days out of time (see s 10(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)).  An application to extend time was granted and extended on five occasions by the Registrar.  The last extension expired on 23 December 2013.  The notice of appeal was filed on 5 February 2014, being 48 days out of time (see r 3B(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW)). 
19The applicant relied on a notice of application for an extension of time filed on the same date as the notice of appeal.  The Crown opposed leave being granted to extend the time for leave to appeal.  
20In determining whether to grant leave the length of the delay and whether there is any satisfactory explanation for it are essential considerations.  In addition, the interests of those involved in or affected by the application are to be considered, as is the question whether a substantial injustice would result if the application for an extension of time were refused.  In respect of that question the merits or prospect of success of the proposed appeal are to be considered (see Miles v R [2014] NSWCCA 72).  
21The Crown submitted that in this case the delay is substantial and the explanation offered is unsatisfactory.  Further, the Crown submitted that the detrimental impact of the delay on the victims in this case is particularly significant given the extent of the injuries they sustained in the course of the applicant's entirely unprovoked attack upon them with a knife in their own home in May 2010, and that they were entitled to the legitimate expectation that the matter was finalised at the conclusion of the sentence proceedings in June 2012.  The Crown also submitted that on a close examination of the reports of Dr Furst relied upon in support of the first ground of appeal, and the reports of Dr Westmore relied upon by the Crown in meeting the first ground of appeal, the application for leave to appeal is without merit.  
22Counsel for the applicant submitted that a delay of seven weeks from the expiration of the last extension of time granted by the Registrar in February 2014 is not substantial.  In reliance upon an affidavit sworn by Ms Psaltis, counsel submitted that the delay in filing the notice of leave to appeal was not through dilatoriness but through oversight in applying for a final application for an extension of time before the Registrar before the Christmas vacation in 2013.  Counsel emphasised that each of a succession of previous applications over the previous year was made in a timely fashion and granted in recognition of focused and concerted efforts of the applicant's legal representatives to assemble the material to permit an informed enquiry into the grounds for an appeal against sentence.  Where the challenge to the sentence turned upon the adequacy of the psychiatric evidence ultimately tendered in the applicant's case on sentence, counsel submitted that the need to obtain Dr Furst's third report, in the form in which it was tendered on sentence and the reports which were not tendered, and then to apply for Legal Aid funding to obtain a further report from Dr Furst was critical, and the delay in obtaining that material was unavoidable.  The two earlier reports and the unredacted third report of Dr Furst were received by the applicant's legal representatives on 21 March 2013.  In April 2013, counsel requested that further psychiatric reports be obtained by Dr Furst and Dr Westmore.  Dr Westmore advised that he would not be in a position to assess the applicant before August 2013.
23Further, it was necessary to obtain an affidavit from counsel who appeared for the applicant on sentence before the notice of appeal was settled which also added to the delay.  On the hearing of the appeal the Crown took no issue with the fact that there were difficulties in obtaining a sworn affidavit from counsel as a result of his ill health and in the result, as noted above, an unsworn affidavit was tendered without objection from the Crown.  
24In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that leave to extend time should be granted.  I am also satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so in order to allow for a close consideration of the question whether the sentence proceedings miscarried resulting in a miscarriage of justice and whether the appropriate course is to remit the matter to the District Court for a further sentence proceeding. 
Proceedings on sentence
25A statement of facts was tendered by consent together with a certificate pursuant to s 35A of the Crimes (Sentencing Proceedings) Act 1999 (NSW).  The Crown also tendered the applicant's criminal history and medical reports relating to injuries sustained by Mr and Mrs Hicks, each of whom read victim impact statements in open court.  
The facts as found by the sentencing judge 
26At approximately 2.45pm on 14 May 2010 Mr and Mrs Hicks were at their home in Castle Hill when the doorbell rang.  Mr Hicks opened the door and was greeted by the applicant, who introduced himself as a former neighbour.  Mr Hicks recalled the applicant living next door with his parents and his sister two years earlier although he had never been formally introduced to him.  The applicant said that his car had broken down and requested a telephone book to ring for assistance.  His Honour was satisfied this was a deliberate ruse to allow the applicant access to the house.
27Mr Hicks invited the applicant into the kitchen.  Mrs Hicks offered him a drink.  The applicant said he would have a cup of coffee, as did Mr Hicks, who then left the room. 
28Mrs Hicks bent down to obtain something from a cupboard when she felt a number of hard blows to her back.  The applicant was wielding a ""fold up"" knife with a blade of about five inches long which penetrated Mrs Hicks' spine and neck.  As she turned to face the applicant she received a blow to the middle of her forehead, followed by one to the left side of her face, and another to her arm.  She screamed and the attack stopped.  Mrs Hicks did not hear the applicant say anything while he was attacking her.  This conduct grounded the first count on the indictment.  
29When Mr Hicks heard his wife scream he ran to the kitchen.  He could not see her but saw the applicant standing with his right arm outstretched above his head, holding the knife in a closed fist.  The applicant then struck Mr Hicks on the left hand side of his face, breaking his glasses and causing an incised wound above and below his left eye. 
30Mr Hicks attempted to defend himself against the applicant's continued attack with the knife, in the course of which they both fell to the ground.  Mr Hicks landed on top of the applicant and began to choke him by pressing his thumb on the applicant's throat.  Mr Hicks told the applicant to drop the knife or he would kill him.  The applicant dropped the knife to the floor.  This conduct grounded the second count on the indictment. 
31At about this time Mrs Hicks was found by her neighbours screaming in the middle of the road, with blood all over her face and saying, ""He is killing Ron, he is killing Ron"".  A neighbour went into the house to assist Mr Hicks, who he found kneeling over the applicant holding him down.  The neighbour observed a wound to Mr Hicks' neck which was bleeding profusely.  He directed Mr Hicks to lie down whereupon he took hold of the applicant and rolled him over.  He saw the knife on the ground which he placed on the kitchen sink.  
32Another neighbour entered the house and saw the applicant lying on his back with a large amount of blood on his clothing.  The applicant did not respond to the neighbour's questions.  Police arrived shortly afterwards and arrested the applicant.  The agreed facts made no reference to observations police made of the applicant at that time or his response to questioning at the scene or when he was taken into custody.
33Both Mr and Mrs Hicks were taken to Westmead Hospital by ambulance and admitted to the intensive care unit where Mrs Hicks underwent emergency surgery.  She suffered multiple lacerations, including deep lacerations to her spine, the base of her neck, her right forehead and upper and lower eyelids, an intraoral injury (inside the mouth), and a laceration to the left temple.  She suffered a fractured cheek bone, a left facial nerve injury resulting in numbness over the left cheek and jaw causing a permanent facial droop, and injury to the major nerves to the left arm resulting in weakness, a ""pins and needles"" sensation and burning pain on movement.  In a statement annexed to the agreed statement of facts, Dr Maria Nittis, a forensic physician, expressed the opinion that Mrs Hicks' injuries, if not immediately addressed, were potentially fatal.  
34Mr Hicks also sustained multiple wounds, including incised wounds above and below his left eye, an incision to his right neck measuring 10cm x 8 cm x 10cm, an 8cm incision extending from his collarbone to his ear, and a 1cm stab wound to his upper left chest requiring surgery.  He also suffered a fractured nose.  The incised wound to Mr Hicks' neck was a few millimetres from the external carotid artery.  His Honour observed that the wounds to his neck, face and chest were in the vicinity of major arteries, veins and nerves.
The applicant's criminal record 
35The applicant was 23 years old at the time of the offence and 25 at the time of sentence.  He had no prior offences for violence.  
The applicant's case on sentence 
36Dr Furst's third report, dated 31 May 2012, was redacted in consultation with the Crown on the day of the sentence hearing and tendered in its redacted form.  As noted above, Dr Furst was not consulted about the redaction.  The sentencing judge did not enquire as to the reason for the redaction or the extent to which the redacted version qualified those parts of Dr Furst's opinion that were to be relied upon.  The only point of engagement with his Honour on the issue was at the commencement of the sentence proceedings when counsel informed his Honour that there was what counsel described as ""a problem which needed to be resolved"":
The matter is set down for sentence today your Honour, the Crown was requiring a psychiatrist [Dr Furst] whose report we intended to tender.  He has been tied up in a trial your Honour that was unexpected, he was expected to be available today.  My friend and myself are trying to resolve how we can deal with the matter.
37After an adjournment, the Crown prosecutor indicated that the parties had ""resolved the matter"" without the need for Dr Furst to attend.  It is clear that what was referred to as a ""resolution"" of the matter was achieved by the redaction.  
38In the redacted version Dr Furst reported that the applicant was unable to account for his actions in going to where Mr and Mrs Hicks lived and gaining entry to their home (armed with a knife) and that he was unable to recall attacking them.  Dr Furst noted the applicant claimed to think about what he had done ""every day"" and that he expressed remorse, including an appreciation of the impact of his actions on Mr and Mrs Hicks.  He was reported as saying, ""How would I have reacted if they were my parents ... it was a lose-lose scenario"".  
39Dr Furst also reported that on examination the applicant did not suffer from any formal thought disorder and there were no signs of psychosis.  He concluded that there remained what he described as ""diagnostic uncertainty"" as to the applicant's mental state at the time of the offending, in the absence of any persistent memory problems after his arrest and a history of pathological lying before his arrest.  Dr Furst was of the opinion that it was likely that the applicant suffered from a personality disorder with schizoid and antisocial traits, and that his reported episodes of amnesia, including of the assaults on Mr and Mrs Hicks, may represent ""some type of dissociative disorder"".  Ultimately, he concluded that he could discern no rational explanation for the applicant's attack on his former neighbours and, in the absence of any evidence of a persistent psychotic disorder, that his conduct could not be accounted for by a disease of the mind.  Dr Furst assessed the applicant as presenting a low to moderate risk for future violence, with the most significant risk factor being a relapse of dissociation or other mental disturbance when the applicant was under stress.  
40In the sentence proceedings the applicant's counsel advanced brief oral submissions on the question of sentence.  He submitted that the sentencing judge should find that the offences were ""relatively spontaneous"" and that the applicant's pleas of guilty evidenced remorse, confirmed by his expressions of remorse to Dr Furst.  Counsel also submitted, again in reliance upon Dr Furst's report, that the applicant had insight into his offending.  Counsel emphasised that the applicant did not have a history of violent offending and there was nothing to indicate he was likely to reoffend.  Counsel acknowledged that a lengthy sentence was inevitable having regard to the objective gravity of the offences but submitted that taking into account the applicant's youth, the lack of any history for violent offending, a lengthy period of supervision was appropriate.  Counsel did not advance any submissions directed to the applicant's mental health at the time of the offence in mitigation of sentence.  
Remarks on sentence 
41His Honour found the wounding with intent to murder, the subject of the first count, as towards the upper end of the range of objective serious, and the wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, the subject of the second count, somewhat above the mid range. 
42On the issue of premeditation, he made the following observations:
The Court is satisfied on the evidence before it that the offences were premeditated.  There is no other conclusion to be drawn, in the Court's view, in light of him going to this particular house in possession of the knife.  He gained entry ... by a ruse.  The blows were directed to vulnerable parts of the victims' bodies.  The [applicant] claims no memory of the offences themselves.  If that were accepted, it is possible that he was in a disassociated state.  It is, in the Court's view, no coincidence that the offences were committed upon a former neighbour.  According to his account he was living at Croydon.  These events occurred a long way away at Castle Hill.  There is, however, no explanation for him choosing these particular victims.  There is no evidence of any previous animosity.  Indeed the evidence discloses that he never formally met either of the victims in the past.
43His Honour observed that there was very limited evidence regarding the applicant's subjective circumstances.  He referred to Dr Furst's report but questioned the weight of the opinion he expressed as regards the applicant's mental health at the time of the offending.  His Honour said: 
The [applicant] has a personality disorder and may well have been suffering from depression at the time he committed these offences.  However, the conclusions of Dr Furst and his opinions are based substantially upon what the offender told him.  As already noted, there is a history of the [applicant] being a pathological liar.  Further, Dr Furst says that [his report] should be read with two earlier reports that he had prepared in connection with the [applicant] and that are not before the Court.  In these circumstances the Court is left in a difficult position and is not able to place any considerable weight upon the opinions of Dr Furst.  It is not persuaded that, as a consequence of any mental health or psychological issues, there is any reduction in the offender's moral culpability.
44Given what his Honour described as the applicant's history as a pathological liar and the fact that he did not give evidence, he was not satisfied that the remorse expressed to Dr Furst was genuine.  He was satisfied that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable.  Because of the applicant's relative youth, his Honour afforded greater weight to rehabilitation and less to general or specific deterrence. 
45His Honour partially accumulated the sentences with the sentences imposed in the Local Court for unrelated offences of dishonesty, and made a finding of special circumstances on that basis. 
Ground 1: The omission to adduce psychiatric evidence relevant to the applicant's case on sentence resulted in a miscarriage of justice 
46It is clear that counsel who appeared on sentence was in possession of evidence (being Dr Furst's first and second reports and the unredacted third report) which addressed the applicant's psychiatric condition at the time he committed the offences.  It was not submitted that counsel's failure to tender the three reports (the third in its unredacted form) amounted to incompetence or that any close examination of counsel's advice or reasons he gave for the forensic decisions he made is called for on the question whether the sentence proceedings gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.
47Counsel submitted that it was sufficient for the purposes of the appeal to establish that critical features of the applicant's psychiatric profile, explored by Dr Furst in the reports and foundational to his ultimate opinion that the applicant was in an altered state of consciousness at the time of the attack on Mr and Mrs Hicks, were not in evidence before the sentencing judge.  Counsel submitted that since that evidence was available and relevant to sentence, to deprive the applicant of the opportunity to have that material considered in mitigation of sentence has been productive of a miscarriage of justice.
48The Crown submitted that the decision not to tender the material was both explicable and appropriate in circumstances where the applicant had entered pleas of guilty and was averse to giving evidence.  The Crown submitted that to rely upon the redacted material from Dr Furst's third report would have effectively traversed the applicant's pleas and that there was nothing in the first two reports that added anything material to the sentencing exercise.
49It is necessary to examine Dr Furst's third report, in its unredacted form, and the fourth report that was tendered on the appeal in some detail.  It is only by undertaking that exercise that the significance of what was not tendered can be assessed and the question whether a miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated can be meaningfully addressed.  The first and second reports are not insignificant but the failure to tender them is not relied upon independently of the unredacted third report as constituting a miscarriage of justice.  
Dr Furst's Reports 
The first report:  13 December 2010
50Dr Furst was initially consulted by the applicant's then legal representatives to prepare a report in relation to the issue of fitness to be tried; whether there were any psychiatric or psychological features of the offending that may operate in mitigation of sentence and whether there were any special defences the applicant had available to him.  Dr Furst was furnished with a volume of material including an ERISP conducted shortly after the applicant's arrest, the applicant's past medical and psychiatric records and records from Justice Health after his remand, school records, and statements provided by the applicant's parents and friends.  That material was not before the sentencing judge.  It was not tendered on the appeal. 
51Dr Furst noted that the applicant had a history of lying.  The applicant's family and friends gave details of him lying in relation to matters such as the death of his parents (both of whom were alive), his financial situation, his employment status, and his name.  Dr Furst also noted that the applicant told him that he suffered a loss of consciousness after a motorcycle accident in 2007 and that he was admitted to Intensive Care with raised intracranial pressure, although medical records indicated he suffered no loss of consciousness and was fully oriented in the Emergency Department and treated thereafter in the Orthopaedic Ward.
52The applicant reported that he had been treated for depression at the ages of 19 and 22, that he often felt sad and depressed and frequently had suicidal thoughts.  He also reported periods of ""high mood"" where he was full of energy and did not need to sleep.  He told Dr Furst he was very depressed around the time of the offence and would go walking for hours. 
53The applicant told Dr Furst that he did not remember going to Mr and Mrs Hicks' home, and did not remember attacking them with a knife.  He reported that he ""woke up"" being restrained by police, and thought that he was the one who had been attacked.  He told Dr Furst that he felt no malice towards Mr and Mrs Hicks.
54Dr Furst noted that Mr Hicks told the police that the applicant was ""behaving slightly strangely"" when he invited him into the house.  The police facts (also not tendered and not reflected in the agreed facts) described the applicant on arrest as:
... disorientated and unsure of his surroundings.  He was sufficiently aware to supply police with his full name and place of residence, but when questioned about what had just occurred the [applicant] could provide no explanation as to his actions and the assaults.
55Dr Furst also had regard to an ERISP conducted on the day of the offence.  In that interview the applicant stated that he had been ""losing periods of time for up to 12 hours"", however he believed he was still able to function.  
56Dr Furst had regard to the applicant's Justice Health Medical Records which documented the applicant's social decline from around November 2009, including the demise of his relationship because of his lies, leaving his job and living on the streets until he was housed by the Salvation Army.  Upon his reception into prison, the applicant told the reception nurse that he suffered from blackouts.  He was placed in a safe cell and transferred to the Mental Health Screening Unit due to the nature of his offending, and what was described as ""inappropriate talking and laughing ... isolative and overfamiliar behaviour, mood swings and agitation"".  
57The applicant was assessed by Dr Dall, a psychiatry registrar, on 18 May 2010, within days of his remand.  He reported ""several years of memory problems"", a history of depression, and a history of lying without being able to offer any rational explanation for his lies.  Dr Dall suspected that the applicant was suffering from an underlying serious major depression with possible emerging psychosis.  
58The applicant was assessed by Dr Malik, psychiatrist, on 9 June 2010 to whom he reported ""memory problems for six months"" as well as introversion and depression.  Dr Malik was of the opinion that the applicant was suffering from major depression.  He prescribed antidepressant medication. 
59Dr Furst expressed difficulty reaching a definitive diagnosis largely due to what he considered to be the applicant's unreliability as a historian.  He noted the applicant's inconsistent reporting of memory problems, and other aspects of his self-reporting which were unreliable.  Dr Furst suggested that the presence of apparent pathological lying raised ""pseudologica fantastica, confabulation, or a Ganser syndrome"" as reasonable diagnostic possibilities.  Alternatively, he considered that the applicant may suffer from a factitious disorder or personality disorder but that further investigation was needed to confirm that diagnosis.  Dr Furst was also of the opinion that it was possible the applicant suffered from schizophrenia or a bipolar affective disorder, particularly given his behaviour on his reception to prison.
60Dr Furst expressed the following further opinion: 
There appears to be no logical reason for [the applicant's] actions in question in attacking the two victims on 14/05/10, and the initial observations by the victims and police point to the likelihood he was in an altered state of consciousness at the time in question, raising reasonable possibilities he was suffering from a dissociative amnestic state, a period of catatonia, or a delirium (secondary to Endone). 
He told police immediately after the offences that he had been losing periods of time for up to 12 hours, not recalling anything that had occurred during those periods. ... 
The presence of amnesia at the time in question makes it a reasonable possibility that the act was not willed or voluntary, which raises the defence of automatism.  Mr Pym may have an underlying mental condition that is prone to recur, such as the organic effects of a head injury or an underlying mental disorder, however this remains to be determined definitively. ...
61Dr Furst also ventured the view that the applicant appeared to have the defence of mental illness available to him, ""especially if he turns out to have a disease of the mind, such as a head injury or major mental illness"".  
Dr Furst's second report:  22 October 2011
62On 15 September 2011 the applicant's legal representatives sought a further opinion from Dr Furst following neurological testing and after receiving a report from Dr Westmore (Dr Westmore's first report). 
63Dr Furst noted that the results of the neurological testing were unremarkable and revealed no evidence of epilepsy or neurological disorder.  A neuropsychological assessment indicated that the applicant was of ""high average intelligence"" with no significant impairment in his memory or attention.  Personality testing revealed a tendency towards a schizoid personality and a fragmented personality.  
64Dr Furst noted that despite these results, there remained some diagnostic uncertainty.  He noted that the absence of any persistent memory deficits on neuropsychological testing rendered it difficult to attribute the applicant's reported memory loss prior to the incident and the incident itself to an underlying neurological disorder, although it may represent a dissociative disorder.  Dr Furst noted that in light of the test results, the likely primary diagnosis was a personality disorder with schizoid and antisocial traits. 
65Dr Furst noted that despite the limitations of the applicant's self-report, he probably still met the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive disorder, however the absence of any signs of psychosis made the diagnosis of a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia or a bipolar affective disorder, unlikely.  Dr Furst abandoned his earlier opinion that the applicant's presentation could be attributed to a disease of the mind, there being no evidence of a persistent psychotic disorder or severe depression.
66Dr Furst provided an updated opinion regarding the availability of what he described as ""psychological, psychiatric or other defences"".  He reiterated the likelihood that the applicant was in an altered state of consciousness at the time of the assaults, raising the reasonable possibility he was suffering from a dissociative amnestic state.  He maintained the opinion, expressed in his first report, that the defence of automatism was available.  
Dr Furst's third report:  31 May 2012 
58 On 17 April 2012 the applicant's legal representatives sought a further updated report from Dr Furst after the applicant entered pleas of guilty, in which he was invited to consider the risk of further offending and an updated opinion as to whether any psychiatric or psychological mitigating factors, or special defences, were operative at the time of the offending.  It was a redacted version of this report that was tendered in the proceedings on sentence.  
67Dr Furst reported that the applicant continued to maintain he had no memory of the assaults and remained unable to account for his conduct.  Dr Furst reiterated the view there was some diagnostic uncertainty as to the applicant's mental condition at the time of the offending but remained of the opinion, expressed in his second report, that the most likely diagnosis was a personality disorder with schizoid and antisocial traits.  He said:
Given the history of childhood maladjustment and pathological lying, combined with the results of recent personality testing, it is now more likely that the primary diagnosis is one of a personality disorder with schizoid traits.  In the absence of apparent substance abuse, his episodes of amnesia for events, including the index offence on 14/05/10, may well represent some type of dissociative disorder.
Despite the limitations of his self-report, he probably still meets criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.  He is being treated for depression and his condition has remained stable over the past 18 months with the antidepressant medication Avanza.  The lack of any psychotic signs of relapses over the last 18 months makes the diagnosis of a serious mental illness such as Schizophrenia or a Bipolar Affective Disorder unlikely.
(During proceedings on sentence, the parties, by agreement, amended the second sentence in the above extract to read ""... his stated history of episodes of amnesia for events"".)  
68The italicised portion of the passage that followed was redacted: 
I remain of the opinion that there appears to be no logical reason for his actions in question in attacking [the victims] on 14/05/10 at their home in Castle Hill, and the initial observations by the victims and police point to the likelihood he was in an altered state of consciousness at the time in question, raising reasonable possibilities he was suffering from a dissociative amnestic state at the time.  I remain of the opinion that he has the defence of automatism open to him; however, I understand that he is pleading guilty. 
The history of apparent episodes of dissociation prior to the events in question makes it more likely that this was a function of his underlying personality dysfunction, or an internal factor prone to recur, than from an external factor such as the Endone and antibiotics he was taking at the time.
I no longer think that his presentation can be accounted for by a disease of the mind, as there is no evidence of a persistent psychotic disorder or severe depression, which would tend to preclude a mental illness defence. 
He does not appear to have acted in self-defence or out of provocation. 
69Dr Furst analysed the applicant's risk of future violence to be low to moderate.  
Dr Furst's fourth report:  6 September 2013 
70In this report Dr Furst considered whether there was any causal connection between the applicant's mental state and his offending, not limited to the defence of automatism (which had been abandoned by the pleas of guilty) but more generally as providing some insight into what he considered was extremely violent conduct by a person without any criminal history for violence and in the circumstances in which that offending occurred.  
71Dr Furst remained of the opinion that the primary diagnosis was a personality disorder with schizoid and antisocial traits made in the second report and repeated in the third report (including the redacted version), characterised by adjustment difficulties, interpersonal problems, low self-esteem and pathological lying.  He also remained of the opinion that the applicant probably suffered from a depressive disorder which he noted had been treated with antidepressant medication since his remand.  He opined that the applicant's personality disorder and his previous reported episodes of dissociation render it likely that any dissociation he experienced at the time of the offending was a function of his underlying personality disorder. 
72Dr Furst reiterated the opinion (expressed in his first and second reports but redacted from the third report) that there was no logical reason for the applicant's actions, and the observations of Mr Hicks when the applicant spoke to him at the door and the observations of police suggest the likelihood that he was in an altered state of consciousness making it a reasonable possibility that he was suffering from a dissociative or fugue state when he committed the offences.  Dr Furst adhered to his opinion, raised in his first report and affirmed in his second and third (unredacted) reports, that the defence of automatism was open.  
73Dr Furst was ultimately of the opinion that although diagnostic uncertainties remain, the applicant's personality disorder, depression, acute medical problems (wound infection and treatment with antibiotics and Endone), and his possible dissociative state or fugue state at the time he attacked Mr and Mrs Hicks probably contributed to his offending behaviour by impairing his judgment, orientation and capacity for self-control.  His opinion concerning a probable causal connection between his mental state and the offending was more expansive than the opinions expressed in his second report and the redacted third report, where it was his view that the applicant may have been suffering from some type of dissociative disorder at the time of the offence. 
74Dr Furst observed that the applicant has largely recovered from his depression, and appears to have adjusted to his custodial environment and was not displaying any obvious signs of mental illness, psychosis or cognitive impairment at the time of assessment.  He noted that the applicant presented consistently with his earlier consultations, being quietly spoken and somewhat monotonous in tone but logical in thinking and speech with no objective signs of psychosis or major mood disturbance.  
The significance of the unpresented psychiatric evidence 
75As the Crown emphasised, it is not for sentencing courts to decide what evidence should be adduced by the parties (see Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 at [29]).  Further, this Court, as a court of error, is not a forum for the revision and reformulation of the case presented at first instance (see Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [79]-[81]).  However, in Zreika, Johnson J also observed (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing) that whilst the Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been advanced on sentence but were not, it may do so in exceptional circumstances where the Court is satisfied that compelling material was available but not tendered, or its significance not appreciated, and that a miscarriage of justice has resulted.  
76It is not necessary for this Court to resolve the question of the weight that might have been attributed by the sentencing judge to the unpresented psychiatric material.  Neither is it for this Court to consider any question bearing upon the competence of counsel in failing to place that material before the sentencing judge when no ground of appeal makes that challenge.  The sole question is whether the failure to place the entirety of the material relevant to the applicant's mental state before the sentencing judge has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  If that question is answered affirmatively, the second ground of appeal does not need to be considered.
77The applicant submitted that to dismiss Dr Furst's opinion as providing any insight into the applicant's offending, or in any way operating in mitigation of sentence, would not have been open to the sentencing judge had each of Dr Furst's reports been tendered in their entirety.  The applicant submitted that the decision of the sentencing judge to place little weight on Dr Furst's findings is not of itself in error, it being based upon the following three considerations, each of which related directly to the failure to tender available evidence: (1)  An assumption that Dr Furst's opinions substantially relied upon the history taken by the applicant;  (2)  The applicant's history of lying; and (3)  The omission to tender the first two reports. 
78With regards to (1), the applicant submitted that were the sentencing judge to have had Dr Furst's reports, he would have appreciated that the opinions he expressed were based on an extensive range of material extending beyond the history taken from the applicant, including evidence from the prosecution brief, including from Mr Hicks and the police and the account the applicant gave in his ERISP, together with the applicant's medical and psychiatric records, including the observations of medical professionals after his arrest and upon his admission to jail. 
79With regards to (2), the applicant submitted that were the first and second reports before the sentencing judge, his Honour would have appreciated the extent to which Dr Furst grappled with the applicant's history of lying, and the fact that he took into account the limitations of the applicant's self-report of having no memory of the assaults in formulating his opinion.  In his first report, Dr Furst expressed difficulty reaching a definitive diagnosis due to the applicant's unreliability as a historian noting, specifically, the aspects of his self-reporting which were inconsistent with other information or otherwise unreliable.  In his second report, Dr Furst's opinion as to the availability of a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder also took into account these limitations.  As Allsop P observed in Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 at [88], the very nature of the professional expertise and skill of a psychiatrist involves an assessment of the history provided by an offender:
It is one thing to discount admissible statements made to a psychiatrist or psychologist if the offender is not prepared to give evidence to the same effect (although care needs to be taken not effectively to exclude admissible evidence by a process of going beyond an assessment of weight); it is quite another to lessen the effect of the opinion of a professional psychiatrist, without cross-examination, when that opinion is based on history.  In most cases, a psychiatrist will form a diagnosis from what is said to her or him; that is the very nature of the professional expertise being deployed.  Part of the professional skill of the psychiatrist is the assessment of the history - how it accords with hypothesised and formed views of the professional.  To say that the applicant was manipulating the psychiatrists is to criticise the professional opinions of the psychiatrists and should be put to them. [Citations omitted.] 
80Further, the applicant submitted that it appears the sentencing judge discounted Dr Furst's view that it was possible that the applicant was in a compromised state of functioning at the time of the knife attacks because it depended upon an acceptance of the truth or reliability of the applicant's claim to amnesic episodes, and that his Honour was unaware of the extensive body of material considered by Dr Furst in considering the potential for dissociation to have been operative at the time of the offending, equally as he was unaware of the persistence of the applicant's claim that he had no memory of the incident.   
81The applicant further submitted that the effect of redacting a portion of the third report was that the sentencing judge was deprived of Dr Furst's expressed view that the applicant may have been in a dissociative amnestic state at the time of the offence, the likelihood that he was in an altered state of consciousness, in the context of his history of apparent episodes of dissociation and the probable relationship of his presentation at that time with his underlying personality dysfunction.  
82The applicant submitted that although the defence of automatism was abandoned by the applicant's pleas of guilty, that did not render Dr Furst's opinion irrelevant for sentencing purposes and that the Crown's submission to the contrary should be rejected.  The applicant submitted that Dr Furst's consistently held view that the defence of automatism was open was relevant in order to appreciate the context in which he expressed the view (in the third report) that the applicant was in a dissociative amnestic state at the relevant time, which he expressed in the fourth report as being associated with an altered state of consciousness.  It is unclear whether it is Dr Furst's view that the ""dissociative or fugue"" state is what allows for the defence to be raised or whether, even if the defence is not raised, it remains a feature of the applicant's mental functioning at the time of the offending.  As I see it, that is an issue which can only be fully explored in a focused testing of Dr Furst under cross-examination.
83In Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61, the applicant entered a plea of guilty to the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, despite psychiatric evidence that he was suffering from symptoms of a psychotic illness such that the defence of mental illness was available under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) and a special verdict on that basis.  The sentencing judge found that because the applicant had chosen not to avail himself of the defence, his mental condition would not be taken into account in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence.  On appeal the applicant submitted that although his plea precluded his mental illness from absolving him of criminal responsibility, it was relevant to establishing his compromised capacity for sound judgment at the time of the offending and, in that way, was relevant to both an assessment of the objective criminality of his offending and his moral culpability.  Beazley P (RA Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing) held that the sentencing judge erred in determining that the applicant had waived his right to have mental illness considered as a causal factor in the commission of the crime for sentencing purposes by his plea of guilty and that, consistent with established sentencing principles, an offender's mental condition, whether or not causative, is relevant to the sentencing exercise.  It follows that evidence which may be relevant to establish a defence, even a complete defence such as on the basis of mental illness (or by parity of reasoning the defence of automatism), if eschewed by a plea, may be relevant to the issues relevant to the sentencing exercise, including consideration of moral culpability and future dangerousness (see McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [27]-[29]). 
84For my part, I am satisfied that in light of the failure to tender material that addressed the applicant's mental health prior to the offending, at the time of the offending and for a measurable time thereafter, evidence which supported the opinions Dr Furst expressed in his unredacted third report, it is unsurprising that the sentencing judge was unable to afford any weight to Dr Furst's report.  I am satisfied that were his Honour to have had the entirety of that evidence before him, his findings with regards to the relevance of the applicant's mental state at the time of the offence would not have been open to him.  On any view, they were made on the basis of incomplete information.
85For that reason I am satisfied that the sentencing proceedings miscarried and that the matter should be remitted to the District Court for a fresh sentence proceeding.  I express no view as to how those proceedings might be conducted or the evidence which might be tendered or called.  That is a matter for the judgment of the parties.
86In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to resolve Ground 2. 
87Accordingly, the orders I would make are as follows: 1.  Leave to extend time for bringing the appeal granted.2.  Leave to appeal granted.3.  Appeal allowed. 4.  Sentences imposed by Sides DCJ on 4 June 2012 quashed.  5.  The matter be remitted to the District Court at Parramatta.  **********

2704503,Ivory v R [2014] NSWCCA 181,"Judgment1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J.
2ADAMSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
3BELLEW J:  On 24 August 2011 Julian Ivory (""the applicant"") appeared before his Honour Judge Robison in the District Court at Newcastle and pleaded guilty to the following offences:    
(i)on 3 May 2010, at Raymond Terrace in the State of New South Wales, whilst in company with Darren Delaney, he did demand money with menaces from NM with intent to steal that money (count 1);
(ii)on 4 May 2010, at Raymond Terrace in the State of New South Wales, whist in company with Darren Delaney, he did demand money with menaces from NM with intent to steal that money (count 2);
(iii)on 16 May 2010, at Minmi in the State of New South Wales, he did wound GS with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm (count 3).
4The offending in each of counts 1 and 2 was contrary to s. 99(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act"") and carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment.  The offending in count 3 was contrary to s. 33(1)(a) of the same Act and carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment.
5His Honour imposed the following sentences:
(i)in respect of each of counts 1 and 2, imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months commencing on 21 May 2010 and expiring on 20 August 2012;
(ii)in respect of count 3, a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment commencing on 21 August 2010 and expiring on 20 August 2015, with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months imprisonment commencing upon the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 20 February 2019.
6The total sentence was one of 8 years and 9 months, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.
7The applicant now seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.  That application is opposed by the Crown.   
THE APPLICATION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIMEThe facts8Two affidavits of the applicant's solicitor, Nicholas Paul Dan, sworn on 25 February 2014 and 5 August 2014 were read without objection in support of the application for an extension of time.  Those affidavits, along with other material before this Court, establish the following facts relevant to the application.
9The applicant was sentenced on 24 August 2011.  On 16 September 2011 his then solicitors filed a notice of intention to appeal.  In December 2011, the applicant made application for legal aid.  It would appear that at that time, the proposed appeal was based on what was said to be the manifest excess of the sentences which were imposed.  Counsel briefed by Legal Aid NSW (""Legal Aid"") advised that in his opinion the proposed appeal did not have reasonable prospects of success.  Accordingly, the application for legal aid was refused.
10On 8 November 2012 Joshua Mark Wilson (""Wilson"") and Darren John Delaney (""Delaney"") each pleaded guilty before his Honour Judge Frearson SC to an offence contrary to s. 59(2) of the Act.  The charge against each of them arose from the same circumstances which led to the charge in count 3 against the applicant. However, as discussed further below, the charge laid against each of Wilson and Delaney was different to that laid against the applicant, as were the facts relied on by the Crown for the purpose of sentence in each case. 
11On 14 December 2012 Delaney appeared before his Honour Judge Charteris in the District Court following an earlier trial in which his Honour, sitting without a jury, had found Delaney guilty of four further offences, two of which were the same as those in counts 1 and 2 against the applicant.  
12As discussed in more detail below, the sentences imposed on each of Wilson and Delaney were substantially less than those imposed upon the applicant.  As a result, the applicant made a further application for legal aid in December 2012.  Counsel was briefed to provide further advice specifically on the issue of parity, on the basis that if merit was found in an appeal based on that issue the application would be granted.  However, Delaney lodged an appeal to this Court against the convictions recorded by Judge Charteris following his trial, and the Crown lodged an appeal against the asserted manifest inadequacy of the sentences which were imposed upon him.  In these circumstances, counsel retained by Legal Aid advised that it was premature to provide any advice to the applicant, and that it would be necessary to await the outcome of the proceedings involving Delaney in this Court before doing so.  
13On 11 June 2013, this Court (Hoeben CJ at CL, Harrison and Beech-Jones JJ) heard the appeals brought by Delaney and the Crown.  Judgment was reserved.
14On 12 June 2013, the applicant requested that Legal Aid assign his proposed appeal to a private solicitor.  That request was refused, following which the applicant made a complaint to the Legal Services Commissioner about what was said to be a failure on the part of Legal Aid to properly ""attend"" to his appeal.  The Commissioner referred the complaint to Legal Aid, who responded to the applicant by letter of 24 June 2013 setting out the history of the matter as I have outlined above.
15On 26 June 2013 this Court dismissed the appeal brought by Delaney, as well as the appeal brought by the Crown:  Delaney v R; R v Delaney [2013] NSWCCA 150.  As outlined in [12] above counsel briefed by Legal Aid was awaiting the delivery of that judgment before providing the advice which had been sought.  However, at about the same time the applicant instructed his present solicitors, Bilbie Dan, to act for him in a private capacity.  
16After the applicant provided those instructions, the following occurred:
(i)Legal Aid sent the file to Bilbie Dan on 1 July 2013;(ii)Mr Lowe of counsel was briefed on 26 July 2013;(iii)Mr Lowe provided advice to Bilbie Dan on 16 September 2013;(iv)Mr Lowe provided grounds of appeal, and submissions, to Bilbie Dan on 28 October 2013;(v)documents for filing with the Court, including an affidavit by Mr Dan, were prepared on 18 November 2013 and signed on 3 December 2013, but were not filed;(vi)the offices of Bilbie Dan were closed from 23 December 2013 to 6 January 2014;(vii)Mr Dan was absent from the office on leave from 27 January 2014 to 31 January 2014;(viii)the staff member who prepared the documents in (v) above was absent from the office on leave from 17 February to 3 March 2014;(ix)the applicant contacted Bilbie Dan by letter of 21 February 2014 enquiring about his appeal;(x)the notice of application for an extension of time was filed on 26 February 2014, following which the matter was listed for call-over and then for hearing.
17The explanation for the failure to file the documents referred to in (v) above is contained in paragraph (13) of Mr Dan's affidavit of 5 August 2014 in the following terms:
""The documents listed in paragraph 12 were not lodged due to the undertaking of further research which indicated the content of the Affidavit was insufficient.  Further advice in this regard was sought"".  
18The nature of the ""further research"" was not identified, nor was there any identification of the ""further advice"" which was said to have been sought in order to allow the matter to proceed.  There was no identification of the person from whom such ""further advice"" was sought, nor was there any indication whether such advice was actually provided, and if so, by whom and when.  
The relevant principles19In Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 this Court said (at [53]):
""...When considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result. This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time.""
20Although this statement of principle was made in the context of determining an application for an extension of time where a ""Muldrock error"" was asserted (Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120) it applies to any case in which an extension of time is sought: Alpha v R [2013] NSWCCA 292 at [1]-[2], [15] and [80]-[81].  
21I note that in Kentwell v R; O'Grady v R [2014] HCA Trans 113, special leave to appeal to the High Court has been granted to challenge two decisions of this Court in which the statement of principle in Abdul (supra) has been applied.  Nevertheless, for the reasons explained by Leeming JA in WA v R [2014] NSWCCA 92 at [14] the principle remains the settled approach of this Court at the present time, and should be applied.
Consideration of the application to extend time22The applicant relies upon the two affidavits of Mr Dan to explain what is, on any view, a significant delay of more than two years.  In Winter v R [2013] NSWCCA 231, with the concurrence of Hoeben CJ at CL and Barr AJ, I observed (at [26]):
""In any case where an extension of time is sought ...there is an onus placed upon the applicant to adduce evidence which fully explains that delay.  That explanation must necessarily include a clear articulation of the steps taken to prosecute the appeal, and a comprehensive explanation for any periods of apparent inactivity.""     
23As noted, the overall period of delay in the present case is more than two years.  The period between the date on which sentence was imposed on the applicant, and the time at which Mr Dan was retained, is adequately explained, given the circumstances in which the various proceedings against Wilson and Delaney evolved.  However in my view, the 8 month delay which followed has not been adequately explained.  It must be emphasised in this context that there is a considerable difference between an affidavit which simply sets out a chronology of events, and one which properly addresses, and explains, periods of delay.  The affidavits filed in the present case do the former, but not the latter.    
24Quite apart from the fact that the delay has not been properly explained, there are two other considerations which mitigate strongly against granting an extension of time.    
25Firstly, the offences for which the applicant was sentenced involved two separate victims.  When the applicant was sentenced, references were made by Judge Robison (at ROS 5) to the fact that the victim of counts 1 and 2 was fearful at the time of the offending about what would occur if he did not comply with the demands which were made of him.  His Honour also referred (at ROS 8) to the fear expressed by the victim of the offending in count 3 of retribution from those who attacked him.  The undesirability of denying an expectation on the part of those victims that the proceedings have been concluded tends against granting an extension of time: Miles v R [2014] NSWCCA 72 at [58] per Button J, Simpson and Harrison JJ agreeing).  It is reasonable to infer that each of the victims of the applicant's offending would have such an expectation.  
26Secondly, the principle of finality tends against granting the application: Black v R [2013] NSWCCA 265 at [55] per Bellew J, Hoeben CJ at CL and Johnson J agreeing.  
27However notwithstanding these matters, it is necessary in accordance with the statement of principle in Abdul (supra) to consider the question of whether substantial injustice would result if an extension of time were not granted.  That, in turn, requires an assessment of the strength of the proposed grounds of appeal.  It is to that assessment that I now turn.
THE FACTS OF THE OFFENDING28A statement of facts was tendered before the sentencing judge.  It was not signed by the applicant but counsel then appearing for him did not object to its tender.  In these circumstances, his Honour observed (at ROS 2) that he considered it open to make findings based on the facts tendered by the Crown, unless they were entirely implausible.  
Count 129His Honour's findings in respect of count 1 were as follows:    
 ""...As to the counts of demand money by menaces in company with the intent to steal, the facts commence with a reference to the victim opening a tattoo parlour named Ink Expressions Tattoo located in a shop in William Street, Raymond Terrace.
On 3 May 2010 at about 11am three so called ""bikers"" entered that shop.  The facts reveal that they were all wearing, what the victim described as ""biker clothing"", namely black jeans, black sunglasses, jumpers or belt buckles bearing the ""Rebels"" logo. One of the males introduced himself as Julian and the other as D, the third did not introduce himself but Julian was clearly the offender who stands for sentence before me today.
The offender D approached the counter and the other two stood behind him and crossed their arms. The victim, not surprisingly, immediately felt intimidated. One of the males said ""I am D, what right do you have to be opening a store here."" The victim replied in these terms ""What are you talking about, I have done everything legal here, I have council approval and everything."" D persisted, he said ""You haven't got approval from us, we need to make an appointment."" A very threatening comment indeed.
The facts also reveal that D said ""Do you know who we are?"" Apparently D said ""I am a tattooist and you have opened a shop where I was going to open a shop."" The victim directed them to the walkway outside the store and as he had a client in the shop D stood beside him in his personal space and leant against the wall placing his hand on the wall next to the victim's head. This allowed the victim to see what he described as a heavy bladed knife up D's sleeve against his wrist. D said that he was a tattooist and what right did he, the victim, have to open a shop there. Used these words ""Do you know who we are?""
The victim must have had an idea as to who they were because he said ""I've got an inkling who you are."" D said ""We can shut you down and blow the shop up."" He was talking in an aggressive manner and then turned and walked away and the other two followed. He stopped at the top of the stairs, leading back out onto the street and said, according to these facts ""And by the way, you will be paying $200 a week, we can run you out of town if you don't pay.""
The victim said to the offender, Julian Ivory, ""What have I got to do."" The offender said this ""When I call you, you have got to come and meet us."" Then they left.
The victim later told his wife what had happened. Not surprisingly she became very scared. Later that day uniform police came to see him. He later learnt that his stepson had contacted police after learning about what had occurred from his mother. The victim told police what had happened, but told them he just wanted to pay the protection money and not get police involved as he was fearful of damage to his shop.""
Count 230His Honour's findings in respect of count 2 were as follows:  
""The facts in so far as the following day are concerned are these. The victim received a phone call that day at his shop. He recognised the caller as the person described as Julian who said ""You have got to go down to the skate park, bring the money."" The victim went down to the skate park and waited about five minutes before his wife rang him on his mobile and said that they wanted to meet him back at the shop. Once he returned to the shop he received a call from the offender again, who said ""Come and meet us out at McDonald's at Heatherbrae.""
The victim apparently complied. Not surprising due to the standover type tactics that were deployed by these individuals. In any event the facts indicate that the victim drove to McDonald's and parked his car near the driveway and got out of the car. Within a couple of minutes D turned up riding a Harley Davidson with the offender, Mr Ivory, on the back. They were wearing full Rebels colours consisting of leather vests, with the Rebels emblem on the back. The offender Ivory, walked towards the victim and the victim pulled out $200 cash and held it out so they could see. D shook his head and turned away and said ""You have no right to open a shop in the Terrace."" He pointed to his top left pocket where the words ""Raymond Terrace"" were sewn into the jacket. He said ""See this, it says Raymond Terrace, we run this area and this is our town.""
Apparently there was some small talk and then the victim tried to give the money to D and he turned away and kept his hands in his pockets. The offender, Ivory, came forward and took the money and said ""Next time put the money in an envelope, it is going to be $200 weekly, what day suits you for us to come back and pick it up.""
The victim said ""Can you come Thursdays around twelve."" Apparently the offender said ""Yeah, righto, I will give you my number. If there are ever any problems ring me, we will protect the store.""
The victim handed the offender Ivory a little black pocket diary and the offender wrote down his first name Julian and the phone number as revealed in these facts. The victim wrote down the words ""Thursday"" and ""twelve"" and D then shook the victim's hand and told him he was a ""bro"". They offered to buy him a coffee but the victim declined to do so, entered his car and returned to the store.
The facts reveal, and I have no reason to reject this at all, that the victim had to close for the day as he felt too ill to work and was shaking, no doubt due to all of these events.
The following day the police came to the shop and the victim told them he did not want police involvement, that he was very fearful about what would happen to his store and himself if he did not pay.
All of this reveals to me an insidious and threatening course of conduct on the part of those offenders who took part in these episodes. Clearly standover tactics must have been used. It almost can be compared to a Mafia style organisation of people who consider that they can enforce their will on others who would no doubt have been lawfully conducting their business.""
31His Honour's references to ""D"" both in respect of counts 1 and 2, and his references to ""DD"" in respect of count 3, were references to Delaney.  
Count 332His Honour's findings in respect of count 3 were as follows:  
""The next matter which has been subject to these facts is the wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The victim in this case was one GS, who had an association with the Rebels outlaw motorcycle club or group or however it may be described, and in May 2010 and was in the ""hang about"" stage of his bid for membership, whatever that means. In any event I move on with these facts.
At about 9.30pm on 15 May the victim picked up a male called ""Lumpy"" and took him to the Rebels clubhouse. The victim told ""Lumpy"" to tell ""them"" that he was with his father and his aunty was sick in hospital so he did not have to go in. Just before he arrived back home the victim received a phone call from ""Lumpy"" asking him to come back into the shed. He was told that they needed him there. The victim told ""Lumpy"" that he could not come and the offender then got onto the phone and told him to ""get your fucken arse in here now, you've got fucken twenty minutes.""
Apparently there is an office called ""Sergeant at Arms"" of the club. The offender, Mr Ivory, was that sergeant. And the victim knew that he had to do what he said. He went to the clubhouse and was met there by the offender, as well as JW and Dan, who is referred to in these facts as ""the head nom"" whatever that means, Lumpy and DD. The victim was asked to retrieve a firearm from his house that he was storing. He went back home, retrieved it and brought it back into the clubhouse. He was told that they were ""going to take some fucking pills off this dude."" The facts reveal that the victim waited downstairs in the clubhouse whilst the others talked upstairs.
About an hour later the victim and the offender and two others got into a white Commodore which the victim thought was the offender's car. The offender sat in the back with the victim. They drove to Stockton and into Cox Lane where there was a couple in a car. The offender said ""No, look, go somewhere else, it's too red hot.""
The facts reveal that one of the others made a phone call and organised a new location at Minmi Cemetery. The facts go on to say that they drove to a Shell Service Station at Wallsend where the driver went in to purchase some cigarettes. The unfortunate victim was not allowed out of the vehicle. On the way out to Cox Lane they had taken his keys, wallet and telephone from him and made sure he had nothing in his pockets. The victim says that theoffender smacked him in the mouth because he had some ""speed"".
Eventually they arrived at the cemetery at Minmi and it was completely dark. They all alighted from the car and all but the victim went in separate directions checking the area. The victim was standing with the offender who told him to ""stand beside me and look staunch."" With that the offender then hit the victim across the knees with something and the victim dropped to the ground. One of the others from the car then came running at him with abaseball bat and repeatedly hit the victim with it. The other male, according to these facts, from the car, started hitting him with a steel bar. All of them kicked and beat the victim, all over his body and head.
The offender, Ivory, according to these facts, had his fingers jammed in the victim's jaw so he could not scream and they had his face to the ground. According to the victim he must have lost consciousness and then awoke and he was alone. He sat there for some time in the dark before he got his vision back and he was able to crawl to a house near the cemetery. He knocked ona door and a male person assisted him and called the police and an ambulance. This apparently occurred at about 3am.The victim suffered injury. He suffered facial bone fractures which were surgically repaired and various bruises and lacerations to his body and head. A wound on his head apparently required sutures. The police visited the victim in hospital, on the morning of 16 May 2010 and he nominated Julian, W and D as his attackers. He said that the car which was used was a white Commodore, ""normally used by Julian"" and often parked outside the address in Thorsby Street, Wickham.
The victim declined to give a statement then, due to the fear of retribution from his attackers. The police attended the address in Throsby Street, Wickham and located the vehicle thought to be used in the offence.
Whilst they were out the front of that address, the offender and D exited the property. The offender approached the vehicle and removed two P plates from that vehicle and placed them onto a green Ford Festiva, parked behind the Commodore. The Commodore was registered to one, NB who was in custody at the time of the offence. The victim's vehicle was also out the front of the clubhouse.
The facts go on to say that the police received a phone call from the victim later that day, who indicated that he did wish to make a statement about the matter. A recorded interview was conducted with him from his hospital bed. W and D were both arrested in May last year and each declined to participate in an interview.
A search warrant, however, was executed at 22 Throsby Street,Wickham on 18 May 2010. Personal items belonging to the victim were located in the clubhouse. The offender, Ivory, was arrested on 21 May 2010 and declined to participate in an interview and I accept that he has been in custody since that time, bail refused.Apparently money continued to be collected on a weekly basis from the unfortunate Mr M until further arrests were made on 7 September 2010. I note the facts reveal that the offender Ivory was formally arrested on 13 September while in custody for his involvement with Mr M and declined to be interviewed.
I have spent some time dealing with those facts because of the nature of the tender of those facts and noting that there has been no objection to those facts being tendered. But after reading all of those facts it is clear to me that they are not implausible and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what the Crown asserts that took place on those days in fact did take place.""
THE APPLICANT'S SUBJECTIVE CASE33His Honour found (at ROS 9) that although the applicant had a criminal history it was not an extensive one, and that he was a person who had otherwise been of good character.  He took into account (at ROS 10) the contents of a Pre-Sentence Report which set out the applicant's background and upbringing.  He made reference (at ROS 11) to evidence which had been given in the sentence proceedings by the applicant's mother, before finding (at ROS 11) that there were ""some prospects"" for the applicant's future.  However, his Honour expressed (at ROS 12-13) what was, in my view, justifiable concern at the applicant's reported intention to resume his affiliation with the ""Rebels"" Outlaw Motorcycle Gang upon his release from custody.  Finally, his Honour found (at ROS 14) that there was no evidence of the applicant having any remorse or contrition.  
34His Honour concluded that notwithstanding the reference in the Pre-Sentence Report to the availability of community based sentencing options, the nature of the offending was such that a full time custodial sentence was the only available option.  He then proceeded to impose the sentences previously set out.
THE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST DELANEY AND WILSON 35On 8 November 2012 Delaney and Wilson appeared before his Honour Judge Frearson in the District Court.  Each pleaded guilty to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company, contrary to s. 59(2) of the Act. The offending which was the subject of those charges arose from the same circumstances as those which formed the basis of count 3 against the applicant.  However, the applicant was charged with, and pleaded guilty to, an offence contrary to s.33(1)(a) of the Act in respect of that offending.  That offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, with a prescribed standard non-parole period of 7 years.  The offence to which each of Wilson and Delaney pleaded guilty carried a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment with no prescribed standard non-parole period.  In this regard, when sentencing Wilson and Delaney Judge Frearson noted (at ROS 1):
""The plea eventuated upon trial. There had been originally a different charge but the plea eventuated the first time it was offered as I understand it"".
36The ""different charge"" to which his Honour referred was not specified although it seems likely that it was a charge contrary to s.33(1)(a) as had been laid against the applicant.  
37Importantly, Judge Frearson also noted (at ROS 4):
""Ivory pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to cause GBH and was sentenced to a non-parole of five years with an additional term of three and a half years, which seems appropriate. Of course he was charged with an entirely different offence to the current offenders.""
38In sentencing Wilson and Delaney, Judge Frearson noted (at ROS 1) that an agreed statement of facts had been tendered, by reference to which he found (inter alia at ROS 2-4) that:
(i)the applicant was the ""sergeant at arms"" at the ""Rebels""; (ii)the applicant had given the direction to drive to Minmi cemetery;(iii)the applicant retrieved a shotgun and struck the victim with it;(iv)the victim dropped to the ground, following which the applicant had his fingers jammed in the victim's jaw and had the victim's face pushed to the ground, in order to prevent him from screaming;(v)neither Wilson nor Delaney took part in the physical assault of the victim;(vi)the participation of Wilson and Delaney, and therefore their culpability, stemmed from their willingness to assist the applicant.
39It will be noted that the factual findings of Judge Frearson differ in a number of material respects from the facts determined by Judge Robison when sentencing the applicant in respect of count 3.  In particular, Judge Robison found, on the basis of the statement of facts which was before him, that all three offenders struck the victim.
40Ultimately, Judge Frearson sentenced Wilson to 200 hours of community service, and Delaney to a fixed term of imprisonment commencing on 2 August 2012 and expiring on 7 December 2012.  The latter date was that on which Delaney was required to appear before another judge of the District Court, Judge Charteris.  
41Delaney's appearance before Judge Charteris followed his Honour finding him guilty of four further offences after a trial without a jury.  The first two of those offences corresponded to counts 1 and 2 against the applicant.  The third offence alleged that on the same date as the offending in count 2 Delaney received a sum of money which was the proceeds of crime knowing that the money was the proceeds of crime.  The fourth offence alleged that Delaney demanded money with menaces on 13 May 2010.  
42In sentencing Delaney, Judge Charteris referred to the sentences imposed upon the applicant (commencing at ROS 10):
""Judge Robison in August 2011 sentenced Julian Ivory. Mr Ivory was charged effectively with two counts relating to the matter that I have to deal with. Firstly that on 3 May he was in the company of ""DD"" - I accept that DD was the offender, Darren Delaney. Mr Ivory pleaded guilty, his counsel consented to the tender of the asserted facts relied upon by the Crown but did not go so far as to say that the facts were agreed. I gather no submissions were made to the contrary of those facts and the judge sentenced on the basis that on 3 May 2010 Mr Ivory had, in the company of Mr Delaney, demanded money with menaces. The second count was also demanding money with menaces in relation to the events at McDonald's on 4 May 2010. No doubt there was some negotiation of the charges that Mr Ivory faced but he faced certainly the equivalent of counts 1 and 2 that this offender, Mr Delaney, is to be sentenced upon today. Whether I assume by way of plea negotiation, however, Mr Ivory was not charged with receiving the proceeds of crime being the $200 handed over at McDonald's (Count 3). Mr Ivory was not charged in relation to the events of 13 May.
What overshadowed, however, the sentencing exercise in relation to Mr Ivory was that he had pleaded guilty to a third count on his indictment, namely that on 16 May he wounded a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That person's initials are GS, his name was mentioned during the trial before me. He was at one stage said to be a person who was associated with the Rebels motorcycle club but not a member. His Honour described the third count as the most serious count - it attracted a standard non-parole period of seven years and a maximum penalty of twenty-five years. His Honour dealt also with the circumstances of the factual consideration upon which he would sentence the offender Mr Ivory. He noted the offender did not sign the statement of facts but that there were apparently no matters put in contradiction of the facts relied upon by the prosecution. His Honour found those facts were established. It is of interest that Mr Ivory pleaded guilty to being in company with Mr Delaney on 3 and 4 May 2010. Mr Delaney maintained in his evidence before me that he was not with Mr Ivory at the relevant time on 3 May.
43In terms of the facts of Delaney's offending in respect of the first two offences, his Honour said (commencing at ROS 11):  
""In any event the allegations concerning the events of 3 May are inaccordance broadly with the evidence given by (NM) before me. The facts found by Robison DCJ as regards the second count to which Mr Ivory pleaded guilty, are broadly consistent with the evidence given by (NM) before me and which I have found to be established. Those facts include an acknowledgement that it was Mr Ivory who required the complainant to come to meet ""us when I call you"". That also confirms that it was Mr Ivory who made the direction to the victim on 4 May to go to the skate park. It was Mr Ivory who directed the victim to go to McDonald's. At McDonald's Mr Delaney did not say much; Mr Ivory did most of the talking and also received the money. Mr Ivory had also said, as his Honour observed, ""Next time put the money in an envelope. It's going to be $200 weekly. What date suits for us to come back and pick it up?"" It was Mr Ivory who wrote his own name and telephone number in the diary of the victim. Mr Ivory, I observe, was very much senior in the Rebels Motorcycle Club hierarchy; and that is consistent with how he conducted the extraction of the what was said to be the protection money from the victim. His Honour observed the offender Ivory, in matters on 3 and 4 May, had engaged in ""standover tactics"" and compared it to a mafia style organisation.""
44His Honour then made reference to the applicant's sentence in respect of count 3 before stating (at ROS 13):
""I have taken into account (Judge Robison's) approach when I deal with matters of parity.""
45Ultimately, in respect of each of the offences corresponding to counts 1 and 2 against the applicant, Judge Charteris sentenced Delaney to a non-parole period of 10 months imprisonment with an additional term of 14 months imprisonment.  Taking into account the sentences imposed in respect of the two further offences, his Honour imposed a total effective sentence of 2 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10 months. 
46As I have noted, Delaney appealed to this Court against the convictions recorded by Judge Charteris, but not against the sentences which were imposed.  The Crown appealed against the sentences and asserted (inter alia) that they were manifestly inadequate.  The Crown submitted, essentially as a particular of manifest inadequacy, that his Honour had failed to have regard to principles of parity.  
47In dismissing both appeals, Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom Harrison and Beech-Jones JJ agreed) said (commencing at [68]):
[68] The Crown submitted that by reference to the sentence imposed on Mr Ivory by Robison DCJ, it was clear that the appellant's sentence was out of proportion and inadequate in that the punishment for the same offending was not equal. The Crown submitted that as a result the parity principle had been offended.
[69] This submission is misconceived. The parity principle is one of amelioration designed to benefit offenders. It was not developed as a means by which the Crown could have sentences increased. It is for this reason that seminal cases such as Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 express the parity principle as follows:
""3 ... It may be said that the very existence of the disparity reveals that an error must have been committed, but I would prefer frankly to acknowledge that the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done. ..."" (Gibbs CJ at 610, see also Mason J at 612, Wilson J at 616 and Dawson J at 623.)
[70] In any event, the submission does not accurately reflect the basis upon which Mr Ivory was sentenced. The most serious charge to which he pleaded was wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. That charge related to the beating which he gave to Mr Stolzenberg. The sentence imposed by Robison DCJ in respect of the two counts of demand money with menaces was almost entirely concurrent with the sentence for the more serious offence. The effective period, which Mr Ivory was required to serve for the offences committed with the respondent, was 3 months.
THE GROUNDS OF APPEALGround 1 - There is an unjustifiable disparity between the sentence of the applicant and the sentence imposed on his co-offenders, Delaney and Wilson, in relation to the offence involving the victim ""GS"".Submissions of the applicant48Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that the factual basis upon which Judge Frearson sentenced Delaney and Wilson for the offence involving GS was different to that in respect of which the applicant was sentenced.  In particular, counsel accepted that Judge Frearson had found that neither Delaney nor Wilson took part in the physical assault of the victim.  Counsel also acknowledged that the charge to which Delaney and Wilson had each pleaded guilty was not just different, but substantially less serious, than that to which the applicant had pleaded guilty, and accordingly carried a maximum penalty which was substantially less.  
49Notwithstanding these matters, counsel submitted that it was as a consequence of the exercise of prosecutorial discretion that the applicant had been charged with a far more serious offence, and that this gave rise to a disparity in the sentences imposed.  It was submitted that as a consequence, the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance which warranted the intervention of this Court.  
50Counsel for the applicant submitted that parity principles are not confined to persons who are strictly regarded as co-offenders, and that they apply to offenders involved in the same common criminal enterprise.  In advancing this submission, he placed significant emphasis upon the following passage from the decision in Green v R; Quinn v R (2011) 264 CLR 262; [2011] HCA 49 at [30]:
""In Lowe v R and in Postiglione v R, this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v R there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with difference crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""
51Counsel for the applicant submitted that this passage was to be construed as authority for the proposition that in a case such as the present, where the Crown had chosen in the exercise of its discretion to bring different charges arising out of the one set of circumstances, this Court should examine the exercise of that discretion to determine whether a justifiable sense of grievance had arisen.  In the course of oral argument, counsel for the applicant submitted that it was incumbent upon this Court to (at T8-9):
"".... lead by example and indicate to the Crown that the norm of equal justice embraces not only consistency in sentencing but consistency in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in relation to all co-offenders in a joint criminal enterprise"".  
52In advancing this argument, counsel for the applicant submitted that one of the reasons why it was incumbent upon this Court to examine the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion in the present case was because its exercise had amounted to an abuse of process.  In particular, counsel for the applicant said (at T7-8):
""...its obvious why the Crown did not take steps to have these co-offenders sentenced by the same sentencing Judge because they realised that their contradictory position about categorisation of injuries and also their conception, differing conceptions of joint criminal enterprise or common criminal enterprise were significantly different"".
53When asked to articulate the evidentiary foundation for the submission that an abuse of process was made out, counsel pointed to nothing more than the fact that the present applicant was sentenced before Wilson or Delaney, and by a different sentencing judge.  
54Whilst the exercise of prosecutorial discretion was necessarily a matter which was relevant to the argument advanced by counsel, the submission that the Crown had exercised that discretion in a way which amounted to an abuse of process had no proper basis.  That this is so is evident from the fact that when asked to explain the basis upon which the submission had been put, counsel could point to nothing more than the order in which the proceedings against the applicant, Wilson and Delaney were dealt with.  
55The fact that the proposition advanced by counsel had no proper basis is evident from counsel's own written submissions which included the following (at [15]):
""Due to an act of prosecutorial discretion, for reasons which are as inscrutable as they are unknown, the Crown accepted in full satisfaction of the indictment a plea of guilty by Messer Delaney and Wilson to an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. That was a significant advantage to those offenders as the maximum penalty was 7 years imprisonment"" [emphasis added].
56The written submissions expressly acknowledged that the reason(s) for the way in which the Crown had exercised its discretion in the present case were not known.  To submit, in those circumstances, that the exercise of discretion amounted to an abuse of process was, to say the least, inappropriate.  Indeed, it was entirely inappropriate to make such a serious allegation in the absence of any proper basis upon which it could be supported.   
Submissions of the Crown57The Crown submitted that it was not this Court's role to go behind the Crown's exercise of its discretion and that once this fundamental proposition was accepted, the applicant faced a number of practical difficulties in seeking to rely upon parity principles.  It was submitted that these difficulties included the difference in the charges, the resulting difference in the applicable maximum penalties, and the differences in the factual findings reached by Judge Frearson on the one hand, and Judge Robison and the other, regarding the involvement of the three co-offenders.  58The Crown also pointed to the significant differences in the findings which had been made regarding the subjective cases of each of the offenders, and the prospects of rehabilitation.
59Finally, the Crown relied upon the structure of the sentences imposed in each case.  In doing so, the Crown pointed to the fact that the applicant was sentenced in respect of two other matters in addition to count 3 and that accordingly, the sentencing judge was required to take into account considerations of totality in structuring the overall sentence which was to be imposed.
Consideration and conclusion60Fundamental to the applicant's argument is the proposition that where an offender has already been sentenced, it is open to this Court to examine the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in order to determine whether a legitimate sense of grievance has been made out.  In my view, there are a number of difficulties with that approach.
61Firstly, and contrary to the submissions made by counsel for the applicant, no part of the judgment of the High Court in Green (supra at [30]) is authority for the proposition that after a person is sentenced this Court is able to go behind, and examine, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  In Green, their Honours recognised the practical difficulties, in terms of the application of parity principles, which can arise when a comparison is sought to be drawn between the sentences imposed on co-offenders who are charged with different offences.  Their Honours did not make any reference at all to the issue of prosecutorial discretion.  Nothing in the judgment suggests, even remotely, that the approach which was urged on this Court is open.      
62Secondly, the fact that such an approach is not open to this Court is evident from the more recent decision in Elias v R; Issa v R [2013] HCA 31; (2013) 248 CLR 483 where the High Court (French CJ, Hayne, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ) said (at [30], citations omitted):
""Parity is concerned with the equal treatment of co-offenders. As Green v R explains, the principle is not confined to co-offenders in the strict sense. It has application in the sentencing of persons involved in the same criminal enterprise. The norm of equality discussed in Green v R is not disturbed by sentencing an offender for the offence for which he or she has been convicted and not by reference to a different, less serious, offence which the court considers to be more appropriate to the offending conduct.""
63The Court then said (at [35]):
""Prosecutors are subject to a duty of fairness in the exercise of their important public functions. In the unlikely event that the discretion to prosecute a particular charge (or at all) was exercised for some improper purpose, the Court has the power to relieve against the resulting abuse of process. The time for debate as to any claimed abuse arising out of the selection of the charge is before the entry of a plea. After an offender has been convicted of an offence it risks compromising the impartiality and independence of the court to require that it sentenced by reference to an offence of which the offender has not been convicted but which it considers the prosecution should have charged"" [emphasis added].
64In the present case, no issue was raised by the applicant at the time of being sentenced about the Crown's decision to charge him with an offence contrary to s. 33(1)(a).  The approach now urged on this Court on behalf of the applicant would clearly run the risk of compromising the impartiality and independence to which the High Court referred in Elias.  It should be noted that in the course of oral argument counsel for the applicant was invited to refer the Court to any authority which supported the approach which was being advanced.  No authority was provided.
65Once it is accepted that this Court cannot go behind the exercise of prosecutorial discretion in the manner for which counsel for the applicant contended, the proposed ground 1 falls away.  There were, as I have pointed out, fundamental differences between the position of the applicant on sentence on the one hand, and the position of Wilson and Delaney on the other.  They included, fundamentally, a difference in the charges and a corresponding difference in the prescribed maximum penalties.  They also included the fact that the offence with which the applicant was charged carried a prescribed standard non-parole period, as well as differences in the factual findings of the respective sentencing Judges.    
66In these circumstances, there is no basis on which the applicant could be said to have a justifiable sense of grievance, bearing mind that the relevant test in an objective one: see R v Chandler; Chandler v R [2012] NSWCCA 135 at [88] to [92] per Hoeben CJ at CL, Bathurst CJ and Basten JA agreeing.
67Quite apart from these matters the applicant's argument is met with a further practical difficulty.  The applicant's submissions were based, at least in part, upon the proposition that the Crown had exercised its discretion for some improper purpose which amounted to an abuse of process, and that this Court should go behind the exercise of discretion and intervene to relieve against that abuse.  As I have already noted there was no evidence to support the proposition that anything done by the Crown amounted to an abuse of process.  Leaving aside the fact that the authorities do not support the applicant's approach, its adoption would be a completely futile exercise in circumstances where there is no evidence to support the existence of the reason why this Court's intervention is said to be necessary.     
68For these reasons, the proposed ground 1 is not made out.
Ground 2 - There is an unjustifiable disparity between the sentence of the applicant and the sentence imposed upon Delaney in relation to the offence involving the victim ""NM"".Submissions of the applicant69In support of this ground, and in addition to the matters advanced in support of the proposed ground 1, counsel for the applicant relied upon a comparison between the sentences imposed upon him in respect of counts 1 and 2, and those imposed on Delaney in respect of the first two offences for which he was sentenced by Judge Charteris.  It was pointed out (inter alia) that Delaney had pleaded not guilty, yet was sentenced to a lesser term of imprisonment than the applicant.
70It was further submitted that in sentencing the applicant, Judge Robison must have started with a head sentence of approximately 3 years to which a discount of 25 percent was then applied.  It was submitted that such a starting point was a further reflection of the unjustifiable disparity which existed. 
71Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that even if this proposed ground could be made out, any potential re-sentence may not affect the overall structure of the sentences imposed.  It was nevertheless submitted that taken together with the asserted disparity in respect of the proposed ground 1, the intervention of this Court was warranted.
Submissions of the Crown72The Crown relied on its submissions in respect of ground 1 in relation to the practical difficulties involved in relying on parity principles in the circumstances of the present case, and submitted that such considerations were sufficient to support a conclusion that the proposed ground 2 was not made out.  
73Finally, and in the event that either ground was made out, the Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s. 6(3).   
Consideration and conclusion74The gravamen of the applicant's complaint in support of this proposed ground (leaving aside the matters advanced in support of the proposed ground 1 which were also relied upon) is that Delaney, having pleaded not guilty, was sentenced to a period of imprisonment in respect of the first and second offences which was only 3 months greater than that imposed upon the applicant in respect of counts 1 and 2.  
75In my view, the applicant's complaint overlooks the fact that Judge Robison was sentencing him for a number of matters including, importantly, the more serious offence contained in count 3 which was committed only a short period after the offending in count 2.  In doing so, his Honour was necessarily required to take into account considerations of totality in imposing an overall sentence.  
76For these reasons, the proposed ground 2 is not made out. 
ORDERS77I propose the following order:
1.The application for an extension of time is refused.

		12 September 2014",2014-09-11 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704508,Lau v R [2014] NSWCCA 179,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceOn 28 February 2012 the applicant was found guilty of an offence contrary to ss 11.1(1) and 307.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth), namely attempting to possess a commercial quantity of an unlawfully imported border controlled drug, namely 102 kilograms of pure heroin.  The jury verdict followed a 22 day trial in the District Court and was delivered on the same day the jury commenced deliberating.
2The applicant was sentenced by Flannery DCJ on 10 May 2012.  Her Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing 30 October 2010 and expiring on 29 October 2017, with a balance of term of 4 years, expiring 29 October 2021.
3The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s307.5(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) is imprisonment for life.
4The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to appeal against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence.
CONVICTIONGround 1 - There was a miscarriage of justice by reason of:
(a) The Crown witness, Ms Xiao Fang Chen (Ms Chen), giving evidence (expressly or impliedly) that she was accredited by a National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters Ltd (NAATI) to interpret from the Chinese language to the English language when she was not so accredited.
(b) The failure by the Crown to disclose to the accused that Ms Chen was not accredited by NAATI to interpret from the Chinese language to the English language; and
(c) New evidence which is also fresh evidence, namely that Ms Chen was not accredited by NAATI to interpret from the Chinese language to the English language.
Ground 2 - The verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
Particulars
The jury should not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant believed or was aware that what he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.
Ground 3
(a) The judgment of the court at trial should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law.
(b) Alternatively there was a miscarriage of justice.
Particulars of this Ground 3
The trial judge erred in ruling that evidence relied upon by the Crown as flight was admissible.
(i) To prove that the applicant believed or was aware that what he had attempted to possess was a border controlled drug and;
(ii) As evidence of consciousness of guilt.
The trial judge also erred in failing to refuse to admit the evidence relied upon by the Crown as flight.
SENTENCEThe difference between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentence imposed on the co-accused, Ying Ma, is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice had not been done.
Application for extension of time
5In support of the application for extension of time is an affidavit from Mr Green, the solicitor for the applicant, sworn 28 January 2014 which sets out the procedural history of the matter.  The jury handed down its verdict on 28 February 2012, the applicant was sentenced on 10 May 2012 and a Notice of Intention to Appeal Against Conviction and Sentence was filed on 1 June 2012.  Thereafter, there was delay in receiving legal advice as to whether an appeal should be pursued.
6Key dates are 28 August 2012 when the Public Defenders advised that they were not prepared to accept a brief to appeal; 4 September 2012 junior counsel was briefed to advise on merit; 15 October 2012 Legal Aid advised approval for senior or junior counsel, but not both; 19 November 2012 Legal Aid advised approval for senior counsel; 2 April 2013 a merit advice was received from junior counsel; 8 May 2013 senior counsel was retained to advise on merit; 26 June 2013 a merit advice was received from senior counsel; 20 September and 8 October 2013 Legal Aid advised approval  for additional funding for preparation; January 2014 written submissions were received from senior counsel.
7While it cannot be said that the applicant's appeal rights were pursued with particular expedition, there are inevitable delays when Legal Aid is involved and understandably, solicitors can be reluctant to take significant steps in a matter until funding has been confirmed.  Once matters are in the hands of counsel, then it is difficult for a solicitor to move matters forward in any significant way.  In this case, the most significant delay occurred between requesting junior counsel to prepare a draft advice on merit and that advice being received, i.e. seven months.  The various steps which I have referred to explain, while not fully justifying the extent of the delay.  Nevertheless, the grounds of appeal in this matter raise real issues for consideration and in those circumstances, I am prepared to grant the extension of time sought.
Factual Background and Crown case
8On 6 October 2010 a bill of lading was issued in Malaysia indicating that the consignee was Yi Xiang Trading Co of 565 Woodville Road, Guildford NSW.  The goods, the subject of the bill of lading, comprised a container 20 feet in length, containing 295 solid timber doors.  That container departed Malaysia on board the vessel ANL Windarra on 6 October.
9An email from Transcargo Worldwide of Malaysia (which issued the bill of lading) to an employee of the Australian freight forwarding agent International Cargo Express Pty Ltd (ICE) dated 8 October showed the estimated time of arrival in Sydney of the ship as 15 October 2010.
10ICE has customers who export and import to and from countries around the world and ICE Custom clears shipments for them.  One of its customers was Yi Xiang Trading Co.  ICE had dealt with Mrs Ma and her son, Bin Xiao, when acting for Yi Xiang Trading Co.
11Included in the documents relating to this cargo was an Australian Customs Entry for Home Consumption which showed that the first port was to be Sydney on 15 October and that the vessel was to discharge in Sydney on 18 October.  The ship in fact arrived in Sydney on 19 October.  A customs officer gave evidence that the vessel was initially due in Sydney on 15 October and that there was then an amended arrival date of 18 October.  He confirmed that the actual arrival date was 9.17am on 19 October.
12On 9 October the applicant, a Chinese citizen and a resident of Hong Kong, used a travel agent in Hong Kong to purchase a Cathay Pacific Airways airline ticket for travel from Hong Kong to Sydney, departing 13 October and return from Sydney to Hong Kong departing 19 October.  The flight was due to arrive in Sydney at 12.05pm on 14 October.  
13On 19 October 2010 the applicant changed his return flight to Hong Kong to a new date 9 December 2010.  It was necessary for the applicant to pay an additional $161 (AUD) for the change in the ticketing and that was a charge paid by the applicant.
14The applicant completed his Incoming Passenger Card into Australia showing his intended address as ""Sebel Surry Hills"".  After his arrest, the police found in his possession a Google search made for accommodation in Sydney, arriving 14 October and departing 15 October.  Two hotels were shown on the printout, one being Sebel Surry Hills and the other being Intercontinental Sydney.
15The applicant did not go to the Sebel Hotel but booked himself into backpacker accommodation at 790 on George Backpackers.  The records of the hotel indicate that the applicant checked in as a walk-in guest and checked out on 15 October, having paid $80 for the accommodation.
16On 15 October the applicant attended 122 Princes Highway St Peters, which was a house owned by a Mr Jiang.  Mr Jiang ran a business of renting bedrooms to tenants at that house.  The applicant told Mr Jiang that he was from Hong Kong and was not sure how long he was going to be staying.  Mr Jiang offered the applicant a room and the applicant returned later that day, moving into the room and paying a bond of $240 and two weeks rent of $240.  On 29 October Mr Jiang wrote a receipt for $240 for a further two weeks rent paid by the applicant for the period 29 October to 11 November.
17On 15 October 2010 the applicant subscribed for a mobile telephone (XXXX XXX861) in his own name, giving his address as XXX Sussex Street, Sydney.  That was the address of Sydney Residential Metro, a real estate agent, which did not have any interest in a hotel, backpacker or other budget accommodation, and whose business was not involved in short term rentals for periods of days or weeks for travellers in Sydney.
18The container was not immediately available to Mrs Ma on 19 October.  On 21 October the container was off-loaded from the ship and taken to the Cargo Examination Facility of the Australian Customs Service at Port Botany.  The container was there x-rayed and its contents were inspected.
19Each of the 295 doors was enclosed in a cardboard box.  Ten of those boxes, numbered 901 to 910, were inspected by Customs and were found to contain pieces of wood screwed together to look like a door.  When Customs removed the screws they found that in 9 of these dummy doors were 24 silver foil packages.  In the tenth, Customs found 14 silver foil packages.  Inside most of the silver foil packages were two white compressed blocks. 
20Customs carried out tests and the blocks proved to be positive for heroin.  There were 102 kilograms of pure heroin in the blocks.  Each foil package contained approximately 700 grams of gross heroin in two blocks of 350 grams.  The total estimated gross weight of the heroin was approximately 164 kilograms.  The Australian Federal Police (AFP) became involved and they removed the heroin and repackaged the blocks in silver foil with plaster of Paris.  The AFP put everything back together to make it appear that the contents of the container had not been touched.  The container was delivered to Kennards Storage at 565 Woodville Road, Guildford on 29 October.  Mrs Ma instructed two men to take the cardboard boxes and their contents from the shipping container and put them into her unit 38.  Before the doors were delivered to Kennards, the AFP hid a microphone in one of the cardboard boxes and hid inside storage unit number 38 a video camera with two microphones.
21On 20 October 2010 telephone number XXXX XXX191 was subscribed in the name of Mr Wai Wong of 289 Beamish Street, Campsie with a date of birth of XX September 1980.  289 Beamish Street Campsie was the business address of Scorpio Communications Pty Ltd.  A business card of that company was found in the applicant's possession after he was arrested.  A telephone with that telephone number was also found in the applicant's possession after he was arrested.  The applicant's date of birth was XX October 1977.  
22On 20 October 2010 that mobile phone was used twice to ring the telephone number of Mrs Ma.  On 22 October 2010 there was contact on three occasions between that mobile phone and telephones associated with Mrs Ma.  On 28 October 2010 there was contact between that mobile phone and a telephone associated with Mrs Ma on two occasions and on 30 October 2010 the contact was on five occasions.
23At about 2.50pm on 30 October 2010 AFP members observed the applicant arrive at the Kennards Guildford premises in company with Mrs Ma and her son, Bin Xiao.  All three persons entered the unit and began to disassemble the dummy doors.  Silver foil packages from the dummy doors were observed being placed into black bags.
24The recordings made by the listening and optical devices inside the storage unit on 30 October 2010 showed the applicant opening 6 cardboard boxes, breaking into 6 plywood dummy doors and removing the silver foil packages which were placed in bags.  The devices also recorded conduct and discussions which took place during that process.  The applicant, Mrs Ma and Bin Xiao then carried the bags which contained 134 silver foil packages and placed them into the boot of the vehicle QMA 457 which was registered in Mrs Ma's name.
25At about 3.38pm on 30 October the applicant, Mrs Ma and Bin Xiao departed the Kennards Guildford premises in vehicle QMA 457 with the bags.  At about 4.30pm on 30 October, vehicle QMA 457 travelled to 16 Beaumont Street in Campsie.  A short time later, the applicant was observed to walk to Beamish Street and purchase two large black trolley suitcases.  The applicant then walked back to 16 Beaumont Street.
26Thereafter, AFP members observed vehicle QMA 457 reverse into the driveway at 16 Beaumont Street.  At about 5.47pm on 30 October the applicant was observed departing the premises in that vehicle.  He was at the time the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle.
27At about 6.15pm on 30 October vehicle QMA 457 was stopped by police at the corner of Gordon Street and Livingstone Street in Lewisham after it was observed to have performed a number of U-turns.  At the time the vehicle was forced to stop, the applicant was surrounded by unmarked police cars and a marked NSW Police van with its lights flashing.  The applicant reversed his vehicle into the front of an unmarked police car, leaving the vehicle in gear and with the engine running.
28The applicant then alighted from the driver's side and ran down the middle of Gordon Street, between the traffic.  When the applicant got out of the vehicle, AFP members had yelled ""Stop, police"".  At least one officer had shown his police badge, the marked police van had its flashing lights engaged, two of the unmarked police cars had their flashing lights engaged and at least one of the unmarked police cars had its siren activated.  A short time later, the applicant was stopped by two civilians and arrested by police.
29Immediately before the police arrested him, the applicant continued to resist arrest by attempting to avoid having his hands placed in handcuffs and he was observed to be attempting to dial his mobile telephone.  Inside the car at this time were three suitcases containing 134 of the silver foil packages.
30During a search of the applicant at the time of his arrest, the following items were located:
(i) 4 x mobile telephones.
(ii) $1,527.80 in Australian currency.
(iii) $4,915 in Hong Kong currency.
(iv) A Hong Kong passport in the applicant's name.
(v) An International Driving Permit issued on 11 October 2010.
(vi) One small notebook, later found to have latent fingerprints matching the applicant's fingerprints, containing the following handwritten notes:
● ""XXXX XXX688"" (mobile telephone number of Mrs Ma)● ""565 Woodville Road Guildford NSW 2161"" and● Numerals ""901-910"".
31A search of vehicle QMA 457 revealed the following:
(i) Two black trolley suitcases.
(ii) A red trolley suitcase; and 
(iii) Four gloves in a Supre bag.
The two black trolley suitcases and one red trolley suitcase contained a total of 134 silver packages, matching the inert packages placed inside the dummy doors delivered to the Kennards Storage unit on Friday 29 October 2010.
32The applicant was observed to use public telephones on 30 October to call Hong Kong telephone numbers (despite the fact that he had four mobile telephones with him when arrested).
33During the search of unit 38 at Kennards Guildford the following items were located:
(i) One screwdriver.
(ii) One claw hammer.
(iii) Various gloves.
(iv) 10 cardboard boxes labelled 901-910 (inclusive).
(v) 10 dummy doors from the abovementioned boxes (6 dummy doors were opened and empty, 4 dummy doors were unopened with the concealment intact); and
(vi) 96 silver foil packages containing substitute material (found inside the four unopened dummy doors).
34After his arrest, the applicant took part in an ERISP.  In the interview, the applicant said that he was going to stay in Australia for seven days just to do sightseeing.
35He said that when he was in Hong Kong he went out for some drinks and got to know this friend and after knowing this friend, got to know another friend.   The second friend's name was Ah Ming and after the applicant had been in Australia for about five days, Ah Ming contacted him by telephone by ringing his Hong Kong number and asked whether the applicant could do some work for him.  Ah Ming said that he would pay the applicant a few thousand Australian dollars.  He did not say what he wanted the applicant to do, just that it was something very simple.  Ah Ming knew the applicant's Hong Kong telephone number.
36When asked about the car he was driving, the applicant said he borrowed the car from a woman.  When asked for her name, he said ""Is her name Ah Mee.  I am so nervous I can't remember"".  It was put that the applicant was here referring to Mrs Ma's first name, i.e. Amy.
37The applicant said that the friend who rang his Hong Kong telephone number, whose name was Ah Ming asked him to contact this woman.  He had never worked for Ah Ming before.   The applicant's friends knew that he was coming to Australia.  Ah Ming gave the applicant the woman's telephone number and told him to contact her to get the car.
38The applicant said that he agreed to help Ah Ming and then waited for his telephone call.  On 30 October Ah Ming rang him.  Ah Ming told him to go to his company and get something and bring it away.  The applicant did not know what his company was or where it was.  Ah Ming told the applicant to look for this person (whom he had previously mentioned in the interview) and get the car.  Ah Ming told him that he would then call him and tell him where to leave the car, just leave it in a car park and he would tell him where to leave the stuff - ""just leave it in the car park will do"" (ERISP A139 - 142).
39The applicant said that Ah Ming told him to take a train and he would have someone waiting for him at the train station and someone would pick him up from there.  The applicant could not remember the name of the train station.  Ah Ming told him to meet the lady at the station and that was the lady who gave him the grey Toyota.  After that they went to the company.  A man was driving the car (surveillance evidence established that on 30 October Mrs Ma's son, Bing Xiao, drove her to a street corner across the road from Campsie railway station and the applicant got into the car).  
40When asked what happened after arriving at the company, the applicant said that he did not do much, just took something from the company and then went away.  He was asked what he picked up and he said that he did not know.  He said it was square.  He took whatever he needed to take and put it in some bags.  The things which he put in the bag and which he did not know were silver in colour.
41He agreed that after he arrived he went inside, picked the things up and put them into the car.  He did not know what was inside the silver square things.  She did not tell him about them.  He saw that they were very hard and he did not know what they were and even thought they were gold bars.
42He was asked what he was thinking when he thought the things were gold bars and his answer was: 
""I was thinking that those were gold bars, whether they would have any problems or not, why were they in such conditions, I don't know I was there already and I did not have much choice then. I was thinking that I should speedily move things and then left.  In my heart I was thinking oh if it is gold bar, would that be any problem, but at that time I had no choice, or I thought maybe quickly do that work and then go.""  (ERISP A.206)
43 When asked why he did not walk away when he realised that they were gold bars and he might be doing something illegal, he said that he was guessing that these things were to do with tax evasion similar to when he had to pay duty when he brought an iPhone into Mainland China.  
44At Q.296 he was asked:
""So you knew that it was something that was wrong and against the law though?  So you know that there is something wrong?A.  So my thought was how quickly finish the stuff and I go.  This is how I think and just quickly finish off.""
45The applicant said that Ah Ming called him that afternoon, i.e. 30 October, and asked if he had parked the car in one of the car parks.  This was after the applicant had left the company.  Ah Ming wanted him to park the car with the luggage in it.  He was told to leave the car and put the key on the tyre and then he could go.  He had to leave the key on the rear tyre, he had to park the car in a sheltered car park, like a big shopping place.  Ah Ming told him that after he had parked the car, he would ring him and the applicant would tell him which car park he was in.  Ah Ming rang him every one or two hours and asked whether he had finished yet and if he did not know the place, he was to write it down and tell Ah Ming that he was at a certain car park.  
46When the applicant was told that the AFP had recorded conversations which took place at Kennards, he said that the lady had told him that all those things were there but had not told him anything more about them.  He said that he did not know where the stuff came from and that he had never seen any of the big wooden doors or the silver packets before he got to Australia.
47The applicant said that he had paid for his airline ticket with his own money.  He said that he had a job in Hong Kong in car sales and was paid $HK3,000-4,000 a month.  He said that Ah Ming told him he would be paid about $HK20,000 and he thought that was a lot of money.  He said that when he met his friend and met Ah Ming he told his friend that he was going to Australia and that he had already booked his ticket and that Ah Ming heard that.
48The applicant said that Ah Ming telephoned him one day before he left for Australia and that all Ah Ming spoke about was that Australia was a fun place.  The applicant confirmed that he had spoken to Ah Ming five days after he arrived in Australia.  He said that he changed his return flight after he spoke to Ah Ming so that he could stay and do the work for Ah Ming.
49He was asked why he ran away from the police when they came to arrest him and said that he felt in his heart a sudden surge of pressure and did not know what was happening.  He said that he did not understand their English and did not know who they were.  He thought they were bad guys chasing him (ERISP - A.400 - 403).
50The applicant said that the woman Ah Mee or Amy asked him to take out the silver things which were inside the timber.  He said that he did not know what the silver things were and that he did not know that they contained drugs.  He said that he did not become aware of that fact until he was told by a police officer.  
51The National Measurement Institute (NMI) analysis of the compressed powder found in the silver foil packages removed by the AFP demonstrated the presence of heroin with a purity of between 60.9 and 80.6 percent.  The estimated wholesale value of the heroin was between $39,000,000 and $41,000,000.  The estimated street value of the heroin was between $119,000,000 and $205,000,000.
52It was the Crown case that the applicant was a pre-arranged drug unpacker who came to Australia specifically for that purpose.  The jury could come to that conclusion by seeing the manner in which the applicant unpacked the boxes.  That he came to Australia specifically for that purpose could be inferred from the odd circumstances surrounding his travel arrangements.  On that issue the Crown relied on the relationship between the applicant's original travel arrangements and the date on which the ship was expected to arrive in Sydney.  When the ship was delayed, the applicant changed his travel and accommodation arrangements.  The Crown relied on inferences to be drawn from the contact with Ah Ming after his arrival in Australia, his acceptance of the offer of some thousands of dollars to do an unspecified job and his contact with Mrs Ma which was arranged by Ah Ming.
53The Crown relied upon the false details provided by the applicant in relation to the two mobile telephones to which he subscribed in Australia.  The Crown identified that as part of the accumulation of evidence which was to be considered by the jury.  The Crown relied on the applicant's use of public telephones when he had access to four mobile phones.
54The Crown relied upon the offer made to the applicant by Ah Ming which (if one accepted the accuracy of that evidence) was the equivalent of five months salary before tax as something from which the jury could infer that the applicant must have known that whatever was inside the doors was highly valuable and highly illegal.
55The Crown relied on the surveillance evidence which the Crown argued showed particular familiarity and expertise on the part of the applicant in disassembling the wooden doors in which the silver foil packets were secreted.  The Crown relied upon the appearance of the silver foil packets secreted in the doors in that way as being obviously prohibited drugs.  This was particularly so when the point of origin of the doors was Malaysia.
56The Crown relied on the inherent improbability of the explanations given by the applicant in his ERISP.  It relied upon some of the audio material from the Kennards storage facility of conversations between the applicant and Mrs Ma.  On occasions they were whispering and Mrs Ma seemed not to want her son to know what was in the foil packages.  The Crown relied upon the inherent improbability of the applicant not asking Mrs Ma what was in the foil packages unless he in fact knew their content.
57The Crown relied upon the inherent improbability of Ah Ming entrusting drugs with a value of between $50,000,000 and $200,000,000 to someone who was merely an acquaintance with an expectation that this person would in due course identify where he had left the motor vehicle containing the drugs.  The Crown submitted that the strong likelihood was that such a valuable commodity would only be given to a trusted subordinate.
58The last part of the Crown case was its reliance upon the behaviour of the applicant when the AFP sought to arrest him, in particular his attempt to escape as indicating a consciousness of guilt.
59It was the applicant's case that the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he had the intention to possess a border controlled drug, or had knowledge that the substance he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.  It was the applicant's case that there was no evidence that he had that state of mind or knowledge.  It was his case that while there might have been a basis for inferring that he knew that there was some illegality involved in what he was doing, the jury could not be satisfied by that evidence that he believed or was aware that what he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.  The applicant argued that for him to be convicted, the Crown had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he had that specific belief or awareness.
Ground 1 - There was a miscarriage of justice by reason of:
(a) The Crown witness, Ms Xiao Fang Chen (Ms Chen), giving evidence (expressly or impliedly) that she was accredited by a National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters Ltd (NAATI) to interpret from the Chinese language to the English language when she was not so accredited.
(b) The failure by the Crown to disclose to the accused that Ms Chen was not accredited by NAATI to interpret from the Chinese language to the English language; and
(c) New evidence, which is also fresh evidence, namely that Ms Chen was not accredited by NAATI to interpret from the Chinese language to the English language.
60The new evidence upon which the applicant sought to rely is an affidavit from Mr Foote, who is the Manager, Accreditation in the national office in NAATI, which is the national standards and accreditation body for translators and interpreters in Australia.  In that affidavit, Mr Foote stated:
""4 Ms Xiao Chen NAATI number 67433 holds the following NAATI accreditation:  Professional Translator English into Chinese.  This accreditation was awarded 2nd February 2009.
5 Ms Chen does not hold and never has held any NAATI accreditation for interpreting Mandarin into English or English into Mandarin (note:  NAATI refers to the spoken language as Mandarin but the written form of Mandarin as Chinese) or any accreditation for translation Chinese into English.
6 In addition Ms Chen holds one other NAATI credential, this is:  Recognised Interpreter Fuzhou/English.  This recognition was awarded 26 February 2009.""
61By way of further background to this ground of appeal, in answer to a request from the solicitors for the applicant dated 28 May 2012, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions replied as follows:
""1. To the best of my knowledge, no staff member of this Office was aware before receiving your email of 28 May 2012 that Ms Chen was not NAATI accredited to interpret from Mandarin to English; ...
With Ms Chen's assistance, the AFP Case Officer, Federal Agent Thwaites, drafted Ms Chen's statements, and she signed them.  At no time did Ms Chen inform FA Thwaites that she was not NAATI qualified to interpret from Mandarin to English.  Paragraph 3 of Ms Chen's statement states the following:
""I am currently self-employed as a translator.  I translate Mandarin and Fuzhou dialect into the English language and the English language into Mandarin and Fuzhou dialect.  I am recognised national authority accreditation for the translator and interpreter (NAATI) translator between the English language and Mandarin/Fuzhou dialect.  My NAATI number 67433.""
This is the only information which was provided to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to Ms Chen's qualifications before Ms Chen undertook translations in this matter and before she gave evidence at the trial.""
62The applicant submitted that the evidence given by Ms Chen would have misled the jury into believing that she was NAATI accredited to interpret from the Mandarin language when she was not so accredited.  He submitted that it was only in May 2012, after the jury had returned its verdict that his solicitors learned that Ms Chen did not hold such NAATI accreditation.  He submitted that this was important in the trial because there was a dispute between Ms Chen and Mr Au, an expert interpreter called by the applicant, as to what was said in the Kennards storage facility when the foil packages were being removed from the doors.
63The applicant submitted that the Crown had placed emphasis on Ms Chen's interpretations of the recorded conversations which took place on 30 October 2010 in the storage unit at Kennards.  Her interpretations included information which was not included in the transcripts prepared by other interpreters (the Crown had retained two other interpreters, as well as Ms Chen).  He submitted that the Crown placed great weight on the interpretation of Ms Chen because of all of the interpreters she had spent the most time listening and re-listening to the conversations.  Her interpretations were set out in Exhibits 40 and 41.
64The applicant noted that as part of his evidence Mr Au prepared a document which indicated points of discrepancy between his interpretation and that of Ms Chen.  That document identified 15 main discrepancies (Exhibit G in the trial).
65In submissions, the applicant emphasised ""discrepancy seven"" in Exhibit G.  In Exhibit 41 Ms Chen's interpretation was:
""What to say to him/her what it is/they are ... (walking in).  Ha (interjection requiring answer)?  (Amy follows him).  Ma you, you come inside.""
In Exhibit G Mr Au recorded his interpretation as follows:
""Does your child (son) know what's inside? (moving things)  Ha!  Things are put like that ... so you go inside.""  (p1.10 of Exhibit G)
It was common ground that this conversation between Mrs Ma and the applicant was whispered.
66The applicant submitted that the significance of the discrepancy was that on the Crown's interpretation, the applicant was asking Mrs Ma what he should tell her son was inside the doors.  On the Crown case the reason he was asking that question was because he knew that the drugs were inside the doors.  The applicant submitted that Mr Au's interpretation did not allow that inference to be drawn or at the very least, his interpretation left open the reasonable possibility that the applicant was just being curious.  
67On the same topic, the applicant relied upon what he submitted to be another important discrepancy between the interpretations of Ms Chen and Mr Au.  Shortly after the above conversation, Ms Chen interpreted the following:
""15:03:49 (Amy walks to the doorway)Lau: (Ind) that ... (ind) ... Ask him/her to come and move.Amy:  (Ind) Come and help you. (Walking inside and talking to Lau in a whisper).  These are used for filming (Ind)(Ind).Lau: (Ind)  What to say to him/her what it is (following Amy who was walking out).Amy: (stopping walking and whispering)  That's for hospital.  Soda powder.Lau:  Let him/her help.  I will do it quicker.Amy: What?Lau:  If he helps, the job will be done earlier.  I one person Amy doesn't matter let him in and help.Amy:  (Ind).""
[The notation ""ind"" is used to indicate a word which is indecipherable.]
68The applicant submitted that the interpretation of Mr Au of the same conversation was significantly different:
""Lau:  Slow down a bit ... come on in.Amy:  Let me help you (ind) ... for filming.Lau:   What did he/she say these things are?Amy:  Hospital sourced materials.Lau:  Hospital source materials?Amy:  Soda powder.Lau:  Help me be a bit faster, be a bit faster.Amy:  What?Lau:  Help me be a bit faster in this way, it's a bit faster just me alone who is doing ...""
69The applicant submitted that these discrepancies in interpretation were important because on the Crown's case the recorded conversation showed that he knew that what he was doing was highly illegal and that he knew that what he was handling was an illegally imported drug because of the whispering and because of the secrecy, particularly in suggesting to Mrs Ma's son that the content of the foil bags was soda powder sourced from a hospital.  The applicant submitted that because of the importance of this evidence to the Crown case and because the jury had been misled as to Ms Chen's qualifications, a miscarriage of justice had occurred.
Consideration of Ground 1
70There are a number of difficulties for the applicant in relation to this ground of appeal.  What needs to be understood is for persons engaged in the interpretation of languages, both oral and written, the words ""interpretation"" and ""translation"" are terms of art.  It is apparent even after the trial that some of the legal advisers of the applicant and the Crown did not appreciate this distinction.  ""Interpretation"" refers to interpreting oral communications from one language to another.  ""Translation"" refers to carrying out the same process in relation to the written word.  When that distinction is understood, it can be seen that there was nothing misleading in what Ms Chen said in her statement and nothing misleading in her evidence.  On the contrary, she was careful to distinguish between ""interpretation"" and ""translation"" but either this was not understood by counsel for the applicant or if it was understood, he did not regard it as important.
71In cross-examination the evidence of Ms Chen was:
""Q.  You started working as, am I correct in saying, an interpreter from April 2008 or a translator?A.  Interpreter and translator. 
Q.  You're NAATI accredited for translation, that's correct?A.  Yes.
Q.  But not for interpretation?A.  No.
Q.  But you've been able to work as an interpreter since April 2008?A.  Yes.
Q.  Is that in Mandarin in Fuchou or just Mandarin?A.  In both Mandarin and Fuchou.
Q.  Is it the case to become accredited you would have to do an 18 month course?A.  Sorry?
Q.  Is it the case that to become accredited as an interpreter, you have to do an 18 month course?A.  Yes.
Q.  You haven't done that course I take it?A.  I did that course.
Q.  You have done the course?A.  Yeah.
Q.  So are you accredited or are you recognised?A.  I am recognised. 
Q.  So although you have done the course, you are not yet accredited.  Is that what you're saying?A.  Yes.
Q.  When did you finish the course?A.  In 2008.
Q.  2008?A.  Yeah.
Q.  How long did the course take?A.  One year.
Q.  One year?A.  Yeah.
Q.  It doesn't take 18 months?A.  No. 
Q.  So you started the course in January 2008 did you?A.  Yes.
Q.  You've applied to do a PhD, you're not a PhD student?A.  No. 
Q.  Is it a PhD in - I think you said something to do with socio economic conditions in China.  Is that correct?A.  Yeah, it is socio economic. 
Q.  But not to do with translation?A.  No.
Q.  Not to do with interpretation?A.  No.""  (T.648.31 - 649.47)
72When those questions are contrasted with those of the Crown in chief at T.612-613 it seems clear that the Crown did not understand the distinction between ""interpretation"" and ""translation"".  As the above evidence demonstrates, counsel for the applicant at trial did appreciate the distinction.  That being so, the inference is that counsel for the applicant at trial did not regard it as a matter of importance that Ms Chen was not NAATI accredited to ""interpret"" Mandarin into English.  In any event, he did not pursue the issue.
73If I am incorrect in my reading of that evidence, the principal difficulty for the applicant in establishing that there has been a miscarriage of justice because the jury may have misunderstood Ms Chen's qualifications, is that very little turned on the difference between her interpretation of what was said in the Kennards storage facility and that of Mr Au.
74In its written submissions, the Crown helpfully set out a schedule of the 15 ""discrepancies"" identified by Mr Lau.  In relation to those ""discrepancies"", the Crown's document set out the interpretation of Ms Chen and the other two interpreters relied upon by the Crown.  The document also set out the context in which the words were apparently used and the evidence given by both Ms Chen and Mr Au relating to the ""discrepancies"".  What emerges from that analysis is that the ""discrepancies"" were of a minor kind and that the evidence itself related to issues which were at best marginal in the trial.
75By reference to the ""discrepancies"" specifically identified to by the applicant  at [67] - [68] above, put at its highest the Crown case was that the applicant and Mrs Ma were whispering because they did not wish her son to hear what they were saying.  The applicant wanted help in disassembling the doors but if the son helped, some explanation would have to be given to the son about what was in the silver foil packages.  That inference which the Crown sought to draw is just as open from the interpretation of Mr Au, (particularly when he was cross-examined) as it is from the interpretation of Ms Chen.  
76The real issue in the cross-examination of Ms Chen and Mr Au was not one relating to accreditation but to explain how it was that Ms Chen in Exhibit 41 was able to include more information about what was said between the applicant and Mrs Ma than she had in her earlier transcripts and more than Mr Au and the other interpreters had been able to set out.  The explanation given by Ms Chen which was not challenged, was that she was provided with very high quality earphones by the AFP and that she found that when she listened to the audio from a single audio device, rather than both together, she was better able to distinguish the words that were said.  Mr Au in his evidence confirmed that this was so, particularly when he was provided with better quality equipment by the Crown with which to listen to the conversations.  It is not without significance that under cross-examination Mr Au moved more closely to the interpretation given by Ms Chen.
77For completeness it should also be noted that NAATI accreditation is not an essential qualification before expert evidence can be given as to interpreting from one language to another.  Section 79 of the Evidence Act 1995 provides that expert evidence can be given by an interpreter if that person has specialised knowledge based on that person's training, study or experience.  In this case it was common ground that Ms Chen had listened to the conversations for much longer than any of the other interpreters and that she had access to very good equipment with a playback facility.  The difficulty faced by all interpreters, of course, was that because of the whispering, much of what was said was simply indecipherable.
78The final point to be made is that apart from the fact that the differences in interpretation between Ms Chen and Mr Au were relatively minor, they can be explained by the superior equipment available to Ms Chen for most of her work and because she spent considerably longer listening to the conversations than did any of the other interpreters.  It is also important when one looks at the context in which the discrepancies arose, that the interpretation of Ms Chen fits better into that context than does that of Mr Au.  This is demonstrated most clearly from the useful schedule prepared by the Crown to which I have referred.
79Given the cross-examination of Ms Chen by counsel for the applicant, which I have set out above, it cannot be said that the information in the affidavit of Mr Foote is ""fresh"" evidence.  It was clearly available at trial, had the parties wished to do something with it.  If I am wrong in that conclusion, and there was a real possibility that the jury were misled as to her NAATI accreditation, the point goes nowhere.  In the context of over four and a half hours of listening device recordings, the differences in interpretation between Mr Au and Ms Chen were relatively minor and to the extent that there were differences, they related to issues which were at best marginal in the proceedings.  Moreover, there was no basis for the assertion that the Crown deliberately sought to mislead either the defence at trial or the jury as to the accreditation of Ms Chen.
80It follows that even if the jury misunderstood the extent of Ms Chen's accreditation by NAATI, no miscarriage of justice occurred.
Ground 2 - The verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.
Particulars
The jury should not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant believed or was aware that what he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.
81The applicant submitted that the evidence may have been able to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that during the unpacking at Kennards he thought there must have been some illegality involved in what he was doing, but the jury should not have been so satisfied that he believed or was aware that what he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.  The applicant submitted that this second element of the charge required specific proof and that having regard to the evidence, there was no such specific proof and therefore the verdict could not be supported.  The applicant submitted that the evidence never rose above proof of the applicant being involved in some illegality when unpacking at Kennards and that he had agreed to carry out that work for Ah Ming but the evidence was insufficient to enable the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he believed or was aware that what he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.  In that regard, the applicant relied upon M v R [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 and MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606.
82The applicant submitted that this Court could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he came to Australia to unpack drugs and deliver them at some arranged destination.  He submitted that the Court could only be satisfied beyond reasonable that from 19 October when he spoke to Ah Ming that he knew that he would be involved in some illegality.  The applicant submitted that that was sufficient to explain the notebook entry ""901-910"" in that it went no further than indicating that he had been directed to open the dummy doors and remove packages.  The applicant submitted that it was a significantly greater step to infer from that notebook entry that he was aware that the doors contained border controlled drugs.  The applicant submitted that nowhere in the trial was there evidence to establish that fundamental ingredient of the offence.
Consideration
83As was stated by the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in MFA:""23 ... None of this relieved the Court of Criminal Appeal of its responsibility in scrutinising the evidence, and making its own assessment of the reasonableness of the guilty verdicts. However, in making that assessment, the Court would properly have been conscious of the fact that there were aspects of the case that would not be reflected adequately in the written record. 
...
25 Where it is argued that the verdict of a jury is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, the test to be applied is that stated by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment in M v The Queen. That test was accepted and applied by this Court in Jones v The Queen. In M, it was pointed out[4] that it was once common for expressions such as ""unsafe or unsatisfactory"", or ""unjust or unsafe"", or ""dangerous or unsafe"" to be used in place of the language of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, and corresponding statutes in other jurisdictions, and that such expressions might cover different parts of the statutory provision, referring, for example, either to a verdict that is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or to a miscarriage of justice because an accused has not had a fair trial according to law. Speaking of cases where what is in question is whether a verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, the joint judgment said: 
""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""""
These principles were restated by the plurality (French CJ, Gummow and Kiefel JJ) in SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR.
84The Crown case to establish the fault element, namely that the applicant knew or believed that the substance hidden inside the dummy doors was an illicit drug, was a circumstantial one.  The Crown submitted that each circumstance operated as the strand of a rope to establish beyond  reasonable doubt that fault element.
85The circumstantial evidence from which the jury were asked to infer the applicant's fault element included:
(a) The removal by the applicant of the silver foil packages from the dummy doors - including the skill and speed he demonstrated - which the Crown said established that he knew exactly what he was looking for and he knew precisely how to remove it.
(b) The packing by the applicant of the silver foil packages into bags.
(c) Carrying packed bags from the storage unit to Mrs Ma's car.
(d) Loading the packed bags into Mrs Ma's car.
(e) Travelling in Mrs Ma's car from Kennards at Guildford with packages inside bags in the boot and on the rear seat.
(f) Purchasing two new suitcases to transport the foil packages.
(g) Repacking the packages into the new suitcases.
(h) Driving Mrs Ma's car with the packages inside bags in the boot and on the rear seat.
(i) Inferences arising from the nature, method and circumstances of the concealment.
(j) Inferences arising from the origin of the shipment.
(k) Inferences arising from the value of the heroin.
(l) Inferences arising from the applicant travelling to Australia, including the giving of a false address on his Incoming Passenger Card.
(m) Inferences arising from the applicant giving a false address on a mobile telephone service to which he subscribed when he arrived in Australia.
(n) Inferences arising from the applicant subscribing to a mobile telephone service in a false name with a false address and thereafter using that phone to contact Mrs Ma and the person he called Ah Ming.
(o) Inferences arising from his use of public telephones to call Hong Kong numbers (despite the fact that he had four mobile telephones on him when arrested).
(p) The conversations between Mrs Ma, her son and the applicant recorded on the listening devices and optical device on 30 October 2010.
(q) Inferences arising from the applicant's notebook entry ""901 - 910"" which corresponded with the markings on the cardboard boxes containing the concealments.
(r) The answers given by the applicant during his recorded interview with the AFP, including that he was offered ""a few tens of thousands"" of Hong Kong dollars (equivalent to a few thousand Australian dollars) to perform the task of removing and delivering the packages, which in the context that the applicant's monthly income from employment in Hong Kong of $HK3,000 - $HK4,000 was equivalent to approximately six to seven months of his normal income.
(s) Fleeing from the police when they tried to arrest him.
86Of those circumstances there are some which provide very powerful evidence in support of the fault element in the Crown case.  Apart from the fact that the applicant had in his notebook ""901 - 910"" the way in which he went about opening the first of the doors was strongly suggestive that he knew exactly how the foil packages had been packed and what he needed to do in order to gain access to them.  He immediately started to dismantle the door with the use of the screwdriver and undoing the screws.  There was no hesitation in his approach to the first door.  He did not seek to remove the cardboard with which the door was encased.  Rather, he sliced open the cardboard on the narrow side and then through that narrowest of openings, prised open the door and placed his arm up to his elbow inside the cavity which he had created in order to withdraw the concealed foil packages.
87Another powerful piece of evidence were the photographs of how the foil packages were placed in the doors.  The placement of the packages was careful and orderly within each of the dummy doors.  In this day and age the overwhelming inference which would be drawn by a reasonable person observing photographs of the concealment of the foil packages is that they contained illicit drugs.  This is particularly so when the concealment was of such a kind and the doors had come from overseas.  This is one of those cases where the photographs themselves, without any explanation, is the most powerful evidence of the likely content of the foil packages.
88Another important aspect of the circumstantial evidence is the apparent trust placed by Ah Ming in the applicant.  We know that the heroin had a potential value in excess of $200 million.  According to the applicant, he and Ah Ming had met only once and were at best acquaintances, yet the jury was asked to believe that the applicant whom Ah Ming barely knew was entrusted with the responsibility of delivering the drugs to a location which only he would know and the whereabouts of which he would then communicate to Ah Ming.  All this was to be done in exchange for a relatively modest payment.  This when taken with the photographs of the foil packages and the speed and skill with which the applicant accessed the dummy doors makes his explanation in his ERISP incredible in the true sense of that word.  That is the conclusion which the jury clearly reached, as do I.  These matters when taken with the other circumstantial strands of evidence produced a very strong Crown case more than sufficient to establish the fault element of the charge, so that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that issue.
89This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 3
(a) The judgment of the court at trial should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law.
(b) Alternatively there was a miscarriage of justice.
Particulars of this Ground 3
The trial judge erred in ruling that evidence relied upon by the Crown as flight was admissible.
(i) To prove that the applicant believed or was aware that what he had attempted to possess was a border controlled drug and;
(ii) As evidence of consciousness of guilt.
The trial judge also erred in failing to refuse to admit the evidence relied upon by the Crown as flight.
90I have already set out in general terms the evidence concerning the apprehension of the applicant by members of the AFP at [27] - [29] hereof.
91The applicant submitted that when the evidence of the particular Federal Agents involved in his apprehension is closely examined, it disclosed a number of contradictions.  He referred to the evidence as to the lane in which his car came to a halt and to the evidence as to which of the unmarked cars flashed lights and activated sirens.  Although this was not expressly articulated, I infer that the purpose of these submissions was to demonstrate that it was not clear to the applicant that the persons who had stopped him and prevented further movement by his car were police officers.  If this were so, it is consistent with the applicant's explanation in his ERISP that he thought they were ""bad guys chasing me"".  He ""did not know what was happening"" so he just ran.
92The applicant submitted that the evidence of flight, if established, was not capable of being seen as indicating a consciousness of guilt of the specific offence charged, i.e. it was not capable of being seen as indicating that the applicant believed or was aware that what he had attempted to possess was a border controlled drug (R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [22], [23] and [25] (Simpson J with whom Ipp JA and Adams J agreed).  He submitted that even if the evidence of flight were only to be considered as part of the accumulation of circumstantial evidence it was not capable of contributing to the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he believed or was aware that what he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.
93The applicant submitted that put at its highest, the ""flight"" was evidence that he wanted to escape from the police and although it may have been evidence that he thought that there must have been some illegality involved in what he was doing, such evidence did not convert that belief into an awareness that what he was attempting to possess was a border controlled drug.  The applicant submitted that this was consistent with what he had said in his ERISP that he thought he might have been involved in tax evasion or that it might have been gold in the packages. 
94The applicant also relied upon ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 1995.  The applicant submitted that the evidence of flight should have been excluded, pursuant to s137 of the Evidence Act, because it had a tendency to improperly influence the jury to:
(a) Conclude that because the applicant was running away from the police, he must be guilty; and
(b) Come to that conclusion without considering whether that evidence was probative to the applicant believing or being aware that what he had attempted to possess was a border controlled drug.
95The applicant submitted that the evidence of flight should not have been admitted because it was unfairly prejudicial to him.  He submitted that the unfairness substantially outweighed any probative value of the evidence and there was the danger of unfair prejudice which has already been referred to.
Consideration of Ground 3
96It was well open to the jury to reject the applicant's evidence that he thought the policemen who stopped him might have been ""bad persons"" and that he did not know what was happening.  This is clear from the evidence of the police officers which was not challenged by the applicant.  Five unmarked AFP police cars followed him on 30 October 2010.  He was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle, which was carrying bags which contained 134 silver foil packages.  He was observed driving erratically, executing a number of U-turns in quick succession and stopping his car on the side of the road.  The evidence was that driving in that manner was an indicator of a person engaging in counter-surveillance manoeuvres.
97Quite fortuitously, before the applicant was forced to stop, a marked NSW Police Hyundai van with its rooftop flashing lights activated, drove directly behind the applicant's vehicle.  The overwhelming inference is that he knew that this was a police vehicle.  This is particularly so when one has regard to the evidence of Mr Au that in Hong Kong police vehicles, as well as having markings in the Chinese language, also have the word ""police"" prominently displayed.
98At the time when the applicant's vehicle was forced to stop, Agent Everingham's vehicle was parallel to it at which time Agent Everingham held up his police identification and said ""Please switch off your vehicle"" and observed the applicant looking at him.  One of the AFP vehicles had its police siren activated at that time and two had their flashing lights activated.  Agent Warne put on his police cap and yelled out ""Stop police"".  Agent Griffiths also yelled out ""Stop police"".
99The applicant's reaction was to reverse his car at low speed into the front of one of the AFP vehicles which he then left in reverse gear with the motor running and still in contact with the AFP vehicle.  At the time he did this, the marked NSW Police van was 6 - 10 metres away from his car towards its rear on the driver's side.  At the time when the applicant got out of his car, uniformed NSW Police were 8 - 10 metres away and in the process of getting out of their van.  The applicant was pursued on foot by the AFP for 150 - 200 metres with agents yelling ""Stop, police"" until he was stopped by two Brazilian tourists.
100The applicant had to be brought forcibly to the ground, after which time he continued to resist struggling violently while the AFP officers tried to place him in handcuffs.  They observed that the applicant was trying to dial his mobile telephone at the time.  During this struggle, the officers were constantly telling the applicant that they were police and Agent Warne was still wearing his police cap and police accoutrement belt.  It was only after he had been forcibly handcuffed, that the applicant ceased struggling.
101The evidence to the effect that the applicant must have known that the persons who had stopped his vehicle and were seeking to apprehend him were police officers was overwhelming.  It follows that the jury were entitled to make such a finding.
102The statement of principle by Simpson J in R v Cook to which the applicant referred is at [50]:
""50 Where evidence of flight is relied upon as evidence of a consciousness of guilt, the principles of law applicable to directions which must be given to the jury are, in my view, identical to those which govern the directions to be given to a jury where lies are relied upon as such evidence.  Those principles are stated in Edwards, Zoneff and Hyde.  The conventional direction in relation to lies drawn from those, and other cases, requires a degree of adaptation in order to be accommodated to evidence of flight relied upon by the Crown for the same purpose.  In particular, it is necessary, in my opinion, to draw attention to the circumstance that an accused person may behave in a way suggestive of a recognition of guilt for reasons other than such recognition of guilt - for example, fear of being unjustly accused.  It is also necessary to point out to the jury that the consciousness must be a consciousness of guilt of the specific offence charged, and not, for example, of some other offence or some other discreditable conduct.  The flight (or lie) may only be used as evidence of a consciousness of guilt of the offence charged where the jury is satisfied that it points unequivocally to consciousness of guilt of that offence and not some other offence or discreditable conduct.""
103That statement of principle was adopted and qualified in Ristevski v R [2007] NSWCCA 87 where McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Bell and Howie JJ agreed) said:
""33 Only one qualification may be necessary to her Honour's remarks. Her Honour speaks of the jury being satisfied that the lie or flight points unequivocally to consciousness of guilt of the relevant offence. In Edwards v The Queen 178 CLR 193 Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ emphasized that unless the alleged lie is the only evidence against an accused, or an indispensable link in the chain, it does not have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt (p 210).
34 In the present case it was plain that the appellant sought to escape in order to avoid apprehension for an offence relating to the drugs he had discarded. He said that he did so because he might be wrongly accused of possessing the drugs. His counsel reminded the jury of this explanation and her Honour, in summing up, also reminded them of it. No other explanation was offered. It follows that there was no reason for the trial judge to remind the jury that persons may have reasons to flee other than from a consciousness of guilt. The issue was properly placed before the jury.""
104The trial judge correctly applied those principles.  She identified the five conditions which must be fulfilled to establish that flight is capable of amounting to consciousness of guilt.
(i) The flight must be deliberate.
(ii) It must relate to a material issue.
(iii) The motivation for flight is a realisation of guilt.
(iv) (Where relevant) the evidence of flight must be from an independent witness.
(v) The flight must be capable of being seen as an indication of consciousness of guilt of the specific offence with which the accused is charged.
105In her interlocutory judgment in relation to the admission of this evidence, the trial judge correctly held that the evidence of flight was capable of amounting to consciousness of guilt.  The only conduct to which the evidence of flight could relate was the applicant's conduct in accessing the foil packages from the dummy doors and transporting them to a particular destination.  As was conceded by the applicant, that conduct was capable of being evidence that at the very least he thought that there was some illegality in what he was doing.  It was a matter for the jury, applying the principles set out by the trial judge, as to whether they were satisfied that the particular illegal conduct involved an attempt to possess a border controlled drug.  That was the issue to which Ground 2 related.  Unless the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on that question, then the evidence of flight of itself was not capable of establishing it.  If the jury were so satisfied, then the evidence of flight was clearly corroborative.
106The task of determining admissibility is predictive in its nature, requiring an assessment of whether the evidence is capable of establishing a particular issue.  It involves an assessment of the potential value of the evidence when the mosaic of evidence is complete.  It is no part of that assessment process to determine what the jury will make of that item of evidence on completion of the evidence in the trial.  In applying s137 of the Evidence Act, the courts assess the capacity of the evidence, if relevant, to support a particular finding by balancing the probative value and unfair prejudice of the particular evidence proffered by the prosecution.  The section does not require assessment of the credibility, reliability or weight of such evidence, those being matters left to the jury if the evidence be admitted (R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 at [60], [64], [74]; DJS v R; NS v R [2009] NSWCCA at [8], [11], [55] - [56], [135] and [136]; R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 at [2], [42], [86] - [87], [171], [175]; R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335 at [161] - [171]).
107On the Crown case, which was circumstantial in relation to the fault element, the trial judge held that the evidence had substantial probative value and that this value was not outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice.  The question of whether in fact the applicant's flight was evidence establishing consciousness of guilt and a circumstance to be taken into account in determining proof of the fault element were questions of fact to be determined by a properly instructed jury.  The trial judge's direction to the jury on evidence of flight and the use to which the jury could put that evidence was correct.  Significantly, no objection was taken by counsel then appearing for the applicant concerning the content or correctness of that direction.
108This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCEThe difference between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the sentence imposed on the co-accused Ying Ma is manifestly excessive and such as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance in the mind of an objective observer that justice has not been done.
109The applicant submitted that the disparity in the sentences imposed on him and Mrs Ma was so great that from the point of view of an objective observer, he was entitled to have a legitimate sense of grievance.  In order to understand the competing submissions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the findings of the trial judge when sentencing Mrs Ma and the applicant.
110Mrs Ma was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 4 years, commencing 20 October 2010.   The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 4 years, also commencing 20 October 2010.
111In relation to Mrs Ma, the trial judge made the following findings of fact which were relevant to the objective seriousness of her offending:
(a) At the direction of Mrs Ma, the container was delivered to the Kennards warehouse at Guildford.  She arranged for two men to unload the container.  One of those men (Mr Yang) noticed that 10 of the doors were damaged.  When he inspected one of them, he found and opened one of the substituted parcels.  He then telephoned Mrs Ma and said:  ""He did not know what the stuff was, but expressed some concern at what it might be"".
(b) Mrs Ma then spoke to a person in Malaysia regarding the doors and at 8.03am on 30 October 2010 received a phone call from a Mr Wang who said:  ""Listen to me, he will offer you $500,000 first, ah your money there"" to which Mrs Ma responded ""Mm is that so"".
(c) Mrs Ma subscribed to a new telephone service in a false name and thereafter used that phone to speak to the applicant and Mr Wang.
(d) At about 2.50pm on 30 October Mrs Ma and Bing Xiao went to the warehouse.  Mrs Ma carried with her tools and gloves.  About half the substituted parcels were unpacked and placed into bags which Mrs Ma provided.
(e) Mrs Ma, the applicant and Bing Xiao then carried the bags to Mrs Ma's vehicle and placed them in the boot.  They drove to Mrs Ma's house in Campsie.
(f) The applicant was arrested while driving that car from Mrs Ma's home.  Found inside the car were three suitcases containing 134 of the substituted packages.
(g) Her Honour noted ""The Crown accepts that Mrs Ma was initially unaware of the concealment and that up until Mr Yang reported his discovery to her, which led to her being offered a substantial payment to turn a blind eye to it, was being used as an innocent dupe by those bringing drugs into Australia"".
(h) Although her Honour accepted that Mrs Ma's conversations with Mr Wang and Mr Yang on 29 October ""Would have alerted her to the likelihood the shipment contained border controlled drugs"" she held ""I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that she was a knowing participant in the enterprise before she had the conversation with Mr Wang at 8.30am on 30 October in which she was offered $500,000 to facilitate the movement of the packages from the doors into Mr Lau's custody"".
(i) Her Honour found: ""[Mrs Ma] thereafter spent the afternoon doing a number of things to facilitate the movement of the packages into Mr Lau's custody and I accept intended to facilitate the movement of the remaining 96 packages into Mr Lau's custody the following day"".
(j) Her Honour found that: ""Although it must be said that after she was offered the money, she rather enthusiastically embraced her task, I do take into account that the situation was thrust upon her and that as a result she found herself in a difficult position"".
(k) She must have known that the quantity of heroin was significant because of the discussions she had with Yang and Wang and because she was going to be paid $500,000 for what was to be a relatively minor involvement with the drugs.
(l) Her Honour was not satisfied that Mrs Ma knew the magnitude of the heroin, given that both her car and the containers she provided were not adequate to move the entire shipment.
(m) It was an aggravating feature that ""She prevailed upon her son to assist her to unload the packages and transport them to her home"".
(n) Her Honour found that Mrs Ma's ""Offence is towards the lower end of objective seriousness for offences of this kind although the magnitude of the shipment could not be overlooked"".
112It was common ground that Mrs Ma initially provided the bags which were to be used to transport the packages from Kennards, she provided the tools and the gloves, all of which the Crown submitted were necessary to access the drugs.  She controlled and kept control of the key to unit 38 at the Kennards complex.  Mrs Ma picked the applicant up from near Campsie railway station and took him to unit 38 at Kennards.  She provided the car that the three of them used.  It can be inferred that she would have been involved in the loading of the packages at her home into the two new bags which had been purchased by the applicant and in the placing of all the bags into her car.  She allowed the applicant to use the car to drive away with the packages packed in the bags.
113Her Honour made the following findings as to the subjective circumstances of Mrs Ma.  She was 57 years old, compared to 34 for the applicant, had no criminal record and was having significant difficulty in coping with custody and had a heart condition.  Her Honour accepted that Mrs Ma has, and would continue to suffer more than other prisoners while in custody, as a result of her suffering extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress.  Her Honour found that because Mrs Ma's skills were insufficient to cope and survive in the prison system over a long period of time, she would require a great deal of support from Chinese speaking professionals.
114Her Honour accepted that Mrs Ma facilitated the course of justice by making extensive written admissions which narrowed the issues which had to be litigated. 
115The trial judge made the following findings in relation to the objective seriousness of the offending of the applicant:
(a) Her Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he came to Australia to unpack the drugs and deliver them at some pre-arranged destination.
(b) Her Honour was satisfied that from 19 October 2010 he became involved in the enterprise to the extent that he agreed at that time to do a job for Ah Ming which he knew involved some illegality as it was on 19 October that he changed his return flight and shortly after bought a second phone which he thereafter used to speak to Ah Ming and Mrs Ma, having first registered it in a false name using a false date of birth.
(c) Her Honour found that the entry in the notebook of ""901 to 910"" meant that ""at some time prior to Mr Lau commencing to open the dummy doors to remove the packages he knew that those doors contained border controlled drugs"".
(d) Her Honour found that the amount he was to be paid ""which is the equivalent of about $AU2,500 even accepting that it was 6 or 7 times Mr Lau's monthly wage, certainly does not suggest that at the time he agreed to do the job he knew that what he was to do involved a substantial quantity of border controlled drugs"".
(e) Her Honour stated that she proposed to sentence the applicant on the basis that ""For reasons of greed, he agreed to do the job that he knew would involve some illegality, that 11 days later he discovered the job involved a substantial quantity of a border controlled drug and knowing that, continued to be involved in opening the dummy doors, removing the packages, transporting 134 of those packages to Mrs Ma's house intending to return the following day to get the balance and then commencing to transport them to a place he had been told on 30 October to take them, intending to leave them there.""  Her Honour found:  ""Although his was a crucial role it was a role at a low level in the enterprise"".
116The trial judge made the following findings in relation to the applicant's subjective case.  That he had a prior conviction in Hong Kong for conspiracy to defraud and had served a term of imprisonment for that offence.  Because of this she found that he was not entitled to the leniency that might otherwise be afforded to a first time offender.
117The applicant left school in year 9, he had a special relationship with his 88 year old grandmother who looked after him a lot when he was a child.  His family could not afford to come to Australia to support him.  Despite this, his father, brother and sister-in-law provided letters to the court referring to his kindness towards his parents and that he was the main supporter of his family financially.
118Her Honour accepted that the applicant had something of an intellectual disability so that general deterrence was not of quite the same importance in the sentencing exercise as it otherwise would be, nevertheless, it still had some importance.  She accepted that the applicant had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.  The applicant had a reactive anxiety and depressive condition which was mainly associated with his impending incarceration.
119The applicant submitted that although the sentencing judge had found that his role was a crucial one, it was also the case that the role of Mrs Ma was crucial.  Her agreement to the removal of the drugs from the container was essential if the importation was to be successful.  The applicant noted that although her Honour made a favourable finding for Mrs Ma in that she found herself in a difficult position because the situation was thrust upon her, her Honour also found that after she had been offered the money, Mrs Ma enthusiastically embraced her task.  In that regard, the applicant submitted that the amount of $500,000 which Mrs Ma was to be paid, was indicative of how important those who had arranged the importation, regarded her role.
120The applicant submitted that a comparison of the matters which her Honour took into account when assessing the objective seriousness of their offences did not justify the substantially greater sentence which he received.  He was going to receive significantly less money, he did not involve anyone else whereas Mrs Ma had involved her son.  Mrs Ma knew that the quantity of heroin was significant.  It was Mrs Ma who had provided the car and all of the equipment.
121In relation to their subjective cases, the only real difference was that the applicant had a previous conviction, Mrs Ma's coping skills would make her time in gaol more difficult and she had facilitated the course of justice by making written admissions.  The applicant submitted that in his favour was his borderline range of intelligence and that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
122In summary, the applicant submitted that the objective seriousness of the offending by each of them was similar.  It was only the subjective circumstances of Mrs Ma which were more favourable to her.  The applicant submitted that the difference in the subjective cases was not such as to justify such a significant difference in the sentences imposed.
Consideration
123In Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) said:
""32 A court of criminal appeal deciding an appeal against the severity of a sentence on the ground of unjustified disparity will have regard to the qualitative and discretionary judgments required of the primary judge in drawing distinctions between co-offenders. Where there is a marked disparity between sentences giving rise to the appearance of injustice, it is not a necessary condition of a court of criminal appeal's discretion to intervene that the sentence under appeal is otherwise excessive. Disparity can be an indicator of appealable error. It is also correct, as Mason J said in Lowe, that logic and reality combine to favour the proposition that discrepancy is a ground for intervention in itself. Unjustifiable disparity is an infringement of the equal justice norm. It is appealable error, although it may not always lead to an appeal being allowed. If an appeal is allowed on the ground of disparity, a court of criminal appeal in re-sentencing is not required to achieve identity of punishment. It must have regard to the sentence imposed on the co-offender and give it appropriate weight. In such a case, an appeal to this Court on the question whether a disparity identified in a court of criminal appeal was unjustifiable and called for intervention by that court would also involve review of a qualitative and discretionary judgment.
33 There is a question whether a sentence which would otherwise be appropriate can be reduced on the ground of disparity to a level which, had there been no disparity, would be regarded as erroneously lenient. In Lowe that question was answered explicitly in the affirmative by Mason J and less explicitly but to like effect by Dawson J, with whom Wilson J agreed. It has also been answered in the affirmative in a number of cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales. On the other hand, as Simpson J correctly pointed out in R v Steele, the existence of a discretion, where unjustified disparity is shown, to reduce a co-offender's sentence to one which is inadequate does not amount to an obligation to do so. Certainly, the discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal to reduce a sentence to a less than adequate level would not require it to consider reducing the sentence to a level which would be, as Street CJ put it in R v Draper, ""an affront to the proper administration of justice.""  Moreover, if the relevant sentencing legislation, on its proper construction, does not permit an inadequate sentence to be imposed, there can be no discretion on appeal to impose one. Whether or not the discretion to reduce a sentence to an inadequate level is available, marked and unjustified disparity may be mitigated by reduction of the sentence appealed against to a level which, although lower, is still within the range of appropriate sentences.""
124With all due respect to the sentencing judge, I am firmly of the view that the sentence imposed on Mrs Ma was manifestly inadequate.  As has been submitted by the applicant, the objective seriousness of the offending by him and Mrs Ma was at least equal and there is a respectable argument to the effect that her offending was more serious.  Certainly on the evidence available, those in charge of the importation were prepared to pay a substantially greater amount of money to ensure her co-operation than they were in respect of the applicant.  On the findings made by her Honour, the applicant played a relatively menial role in physically accessing the heroin and then driving it to a location where it could be collected by others.  It is difficult to see how his involvement was any more serious than that of Mrs Ma who, although she came into the transaction at a later point in time, was fully aware of the seriousness of what she was doing and who provided all the equipment, including a car, to facilitate the importation.
125It is true, as was properly conceded by the applicant, that Mrs Ma had a stronger subjective case.  It is proper that this consideration be reflected in the sentence.  The difference in the subjective cases is not sufficiently great, however, to justify a difference in the non-parole periods of imprisonment whereby the sentence to be served by the applicant is 75 percent greater than that to be served by Mrs Ma.
126In my opinion, the applicant is entitled to have a justifiable sense of grievance insofar as the difference in sentences is concerned.
127That does not end the matter.  A complicating factor is that the sentence imposed by her Honour on Mrs Ma was manifestly inadequate but the Crown has not brought an appeal against that sentence. In those circumstances, while it is necessary in order to observe the principle of parity that the applicant's sentence be reduced it should not be reduced to a level that would make it also patently inadequate (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [33]).
128Keeping that consideration in mind, I propose that the applicant should be re-sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 3 years.
Conclusion
129The orders which I propose are as follows:
(i) An extension of time be granted within which the applicant can seek leave to appeal against conviction.
(ii) Grant leave to the applicant to appeal against conviction.
(iii) Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
(iv) In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, grant leave to appeal.
(v) Allow the appeal against sentence.
(vi) Quash the sentence imposed on the applicant by Flannery DCJ on 10 May 2012.
(vii) In lieu thereof the applicant is re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing 30 October 2010 and expiring 29 October 2016, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 29 October 2019.
130HARRISON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
131McCALLUM J:   I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL, for the reasons his Honour has stated.  
132As to ground 2, learned senior counsel for the applicant undertook a careful analysis of the cogency of the evidence going to the fault element of the offence.  Those submissions have not persuaded me that the jury ought to have entertained a doubt as to that element.  Based on my review of the evidence, I have not been persuaded that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence.  
133I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL as to the sentence appeal and with the orders proposed by his Honour.

2704523,R v CABLE [2014] NSWDC 342,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The Director of Public Prosecutions proposes arraigning the accused, Francis William Cable, on 18 counts alleging various types of sexual assault committed on five separate complainants between 53 and 47 years ago when the accused was a member of the Marist Brothers Holy Order. He was then known as Brother X. The offences were allegedly committed in the Hunter Valley and south-eastern Sydney when the accused was teaching at schools at which the various complainants attended.
	
	
	PH9 is one of the five complainants, in respect of whom there are eight counts, as I counted them, in the proposed indictment to be presented at the present time.
	
	
	For the purposes of considering the issue that I am now giving judgment on, the accused is relevantly charged with “sexual assault offences” as they are defined, pursuant to Pt 5 Div 2 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, hereinafter referred to as “the Act”. The sections of that Division of that Part of the CPA relevantly are ss 295-306. However, as the matter transpires, the critical provision requiring close attention, although all relevant provisions have been considered is s 299D of the Act.
	
	
	That section provides:
	



	
	The Court cannot grant an application for leave under this Division unless the Court is satisfied that:
	



	
	The document or evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or adduced, or to be produced or adduced by the parties seeking to produce or adduce the document or evidence, have substantial probative value, and
	
	
	Other documents or evidence concerning matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available, and
	
	
	The public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value.
	



	
	Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of determining the public interest and preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm the court must take into account the following:
	



	
	The need to encourage victims of sexual offences to seek counselling,
	
	
	That the effectiveness of counselling is likely to be dependent on the maintenance of the confidentiality of the counselling relationship,
	
	
	The public interest in ensuring that victims of sexual offences receive effective counselling,
	
	
	That the disclosure of the protected confidence is likely to damage or undermine the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person,
	
	
	Where the disclosure of the protected confidence is sought on the basis of a discriminatory relief or bias,
	
	
	That the adducing of the evidence is likely to infringe a reasonable expectation of privacy.
	



	
	For the purposes of determining an application for leave under this Division the court may permit a confidential statement to be made to it by or on behalf of the principal protected confider by affidavit, specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer if the application for leave is granted.
	
	
	A court must not disclose or make available to a party (other than the principal protected confider) any confidential statement made to the Court under this section by or on behalf of the principal protected confider.
	
	
	The Court must state its reasons for granting or refusing to grant an application for leave under this division.
	



	
	Section 299D(6) is not relevant to current considerations.  I pause for a moment to point out that the Court has received a confidential statement in affidavit form from PH9, the “principal protected confider” in accordance with s 299D(3) of the Act and I have taken that material into account.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 298 of the Act two subpoenae were issued by leave of the District Court, directing a medical practice and a psychologist to produce documents to the Court. There was one minor difference in the schedules of each subpoena, (more a typing error it would seem rather than anything of substance) but essentially each subpoena requested the production of “clinical notes, referrals and report(s) of consultations and treatment and counselling of PH9 (date of birth provided) in respect of his mental health for the period from 1 January 2010 and 1 April 2014.” No issue has been taken with the width of the schedules in the respective subpoena although one might have thought that they were somewhat inelegantly drafted.
	
	
	The two subpoenaed parties have produced relevant documents. There can be no doubt that to all intents and purposes the material protected is relevantly a protected confidence under the Act. Application is now made by the accused for access to relevant documents. The application is opposed by the principal protected confider, PH9.
	
	
	In this particular matter no issue of “misconduct” arises pursuant to s 301 of the Act. The circumstances in which the subpoenae have issued, somewhat at the heel of the hunt, arise from two matters involving information volunteered by the principal protected confider. In his statement to police, which is the basis upon which the counts relating to this complainant and the accused rest, made on 1 October 2013 (at para 34) the protected confider said this:
	


“In the past two to three years I was starting to have problems at night time when I would go outside and I felt that people were attacking me and raping me. During the night I woke up and I was like I am 12 years old again and I have visions of people who abused me and I feel like I am under attack. I have in past armed myself with knives and machetes and gone out into my paddocks. At the time I think I am fighting the people who abused me. When I wake up in the morning I don’t remember exactly what has occurred but I have had to go and retrieve machetes and knives from trees on my property. I always deep down knew that I had been sexually abused but I was too embarrassed to remember and thought I would forget about it eventually.”


	
	This statement, as I said, sets out the history of the protected confider’s education at a particular school in south-east Sydney from year 7, meeting the accused in February 1965 and detailing various sexual assaults that were committed upon him at La Perouse during swimming excursions and at the school during 1965 and up until his last contact with the accused in 1967.
	
	
	The protected confider gave evidence at the committal proceedings.
	



	
	The complainant was asked this question at the committal proceedings, “Could I just ask you how you came to give that statement to the police?” This is a reference to the statement signed on 1 October 2013. The complainant outlined matters in that interview that are not for publication but which were detailed in court.  
	



	
	I have extensive written submissions from the accused through his legal counsel largely setting out the statutory provisions including, within it, a number of submissions made justifying access to documents that have been subpoenaed. To summarise what is set out in those written submissions it is submitted, by reference to part of what I have read above from the committal proceedings, that there are “real concerns” about the reliability of the complainant’s account, in the context of the disclosure made by the complainant in his statement from which I have already read from that he had been treated by his general practitioner for depression and that he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is also identified that the protected confider’s psychologist, who has been one of the subpoenaed parties was a “support person” for the complainant when he gave evidence at the committal proceedings. It is submitted on behalf of the accused that “granting access...will provide documents” which are “very relevant to the witness’ reliability”. I have some concerns about the confidence of the prediction made without access to the documents.
	
	
	Be that as it may, submissions were put about issues relating to the need to address the reliability and honesty of the witness and by reference to the relevant statutory provisions it is submitted that the public interest in admitting the evidence as it is expressed in the written submissions but in fact are permitting access to the material in the subpoena documents outweighs the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the confider from harm. Primarily this arises, it is submitted, by reason of ‘self‑disclosure’.
	
	
	The applicant cites the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of KS v Veitch [2012] NSWCCA 266 particularly the observations of Basten J at [34]. His Honour said inter alia at that paragraph
	


“...an assessment that the information has substantial probative value, in the usual case no doubt casting doubt on the veracity and reliability of the complainant, will militate in favour of disclosure where it would give rise to a doubt as to the guilt of the accused.”


	
	I am very familiar with the judgment, as I mentioned in discussion, because I was the Judge at first instance that was given the unhappy task on the day of the commencement of the trial of dealing with an issue of protected confidences in circumstances where nobody took issue with the improper way in which the subpoenae had been initially issued.  As would be clear from the judgment, very little assistance was provided to me in the determination of the application on the day.
	
	
	Learned counsel for the protected confider here submits that the Court would not be satisfied of the matters required to be established pursuant to s 299D(1)(a)(b)(c) which I have earlier cited. It is submitted in general terms that, bearing in mind counsel for the protected confider has had opportunity to examine the documents, that there is no material of substantive probative value. In any event, there are other sources of information such as evidence and documents, part of which I have read, which concern matters arising potentially in the protected confidences already available to the accused. It is further submitted that the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the confidence of the document of substantial value.
	
	
	The protected confider, through his counsel, relies upon the confidential affidavit which I earlier referred to and which I have read. Learned counsel for the protected confider also points to those matters which must be taken into account in considering the terms of s 299D(1)(c), including the need to encourage victims of sexual assaults to seek counselling, that the effectiveness of counselling is likely to be dependent on the maintenance of confidentiality, the public interest in ensuring the victims of sexual offences receive effect counselling and the potential for damage to, or the undermining of, the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person.
	
	
	It was submitted by learned counsel that if access was granted this would “send a message to the community” of the vulnerability of people having their private confidential communications exposed to the wider world and certainly it would send a message to the community of the adverse effect upon the welfare of the particular complainant in the context of the information available to the court in the confidential affidavit.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor was asked to comment and he remains neutral of course. He has not had access to the material. He simply pointed out that PH9 was a central witness to the particular counts concerning him and the Crown case was dependent upon his reliability and honesty as central to proof of the Crown case.
	
	
	Having regard to ss 299B and 299C of the Act, the Court has complied with what is required under s 299B(1) - (4) and the accused has complied with the requirements of notice under s 299C, as is self-evident from the presence of the legal representative of the protected confider. I have already noted the terms of s 299D. Having read the material produced under subpoena and also, as I said earlier on two occasions, had regard to the affidavit of the protected confider, I have concluded a number of aspects of the matter on the available evidence in the context of the legislative requirements upon me.
	
	
	In reaching my decision I have also had particular regard to the judgment in KS v Veitch as it relates to the operation of Pt 5 Div 2, particularly at [14] ‑ [19], [24] - [25] and [30] - [35] in the judgement of Basten J. I have identified for the purposes of these proceedings the subpoenaed material and made it an exhibit on the voir dire. As to the contents of exhibit 4 on the voir dire, that is the relevant clinical notes et cetera produced by the “Florence Street Medical Practice”, I have come to the conclusion that much of the material has either no relevance or no probative value. It essentially is irrelevant to consideration of matters concerned with the mental health of the protected confider. Such material that relates to the protected confider’s mental health either does not have substantial probative value, or in my view, is of such a character that by operation of s 299D(1)(b) primarily and s 299D(1)(c) cannot be made available to the accused.
	
	
	As to the material produced by the psychologist, which is exhibit 3 on the voir dire, much of the material produced by the psychologist comprises notes and/or reports, many hand-written, some typed, which should not be provided given that the bulk of their character is truly counselling notes, extensive as they are. They, in my view, cannot be provided to the accused by reason of the operation of s 299D(1)(b) and (c) of the Act, particularly by regard to the latter provision, taking into account the need to encourage victims of sexual assaults or offences to seek counselling, the need to maintain the maintenance of confidentiality of the counselling relationship as provided by subs (2)(b), the public interest in ensuring that victims of sexual offences receive effective counselling and because the disclosure of the protected confidences contained within these counselling notes is likely to damage or undermine the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person (s 299D(2)(c)). Some of the matters recorded by the psychologist are mundane administrative notes concerning the making of appointments and the like which of course, are of no probative value in any event.
	
	
	However, there is part of the material that in my view ought be made available to the accused. This relates to type-written notes by the psychologist dated 8 October 2013. I pause for a moment to note that these notes have been recorded as I would understand the chronology of events, seven days after the protected confider had made his statement to the police. The notes that I would make available to the accused are part of five or so pages of typed notes that appear to, on my view of it, relate to a session of counselling with the psychologist. The particular part of the notes that in my view has substantial probative value in the context of s 299(D)(1)(a) of the Act are matters of history concerning the circumstances in the identification of the alleged sexual abuse by the accused on the part of the protected confider.
	
	
	I have had obvious regard to the terms of s 299D(1)(b), particularly given those passages that I have read from the statement of the complainant and the evidence the complainant gave at the Local Court. My examination of the relevant part of the history that I would be prepared to provide on the call of the subpoena, in accordance with the requirements of Pt 5 Div 2 of the Act, is material that supplements what has already been disclosed by the complainant, it would appear, voluntarily. Particularly in the statement he gave to police which no doubt gave rise to the circumstances of his examination at the committal proceedings and the further information that the protected confider provided to the Court and is in the public domain.
	
	
	It seems to me with respect that some of the matters that I would be prepared to make available to the accused fall within the rubric of consideration identified by Justice Basten at [34] of the judgment of KS. In permitting access to this material, it may be thought on analysis that some of the matters are matters already identified within the statement of the complainant or alternatively in the evidence of the committal proceeding which I have earlier cited. However, such additional material provided within the history provided by the protected confider or complainant must be seen in a proper context. Thus, it would seem to me with respect that such matters that are disclosed in the material I would allow to be inspected that has already put in the public domain, would not in my view cause any additional embarrassment to the protected confider or any additional harm to the protected confider, than that that has already arisen by the disclosure by the protected confider in his statement to police and in his evidence.
	
	
	I pause for a moment to acknowledge the fact that when a person brings an allegation of sexual assault against another person, there is implicit or inherent in that process a considerable degree of embarrassment.  There is also a considerable degree of trepidation and concern about the disclosure of matters personal that, no doubt on the part of the complainant, would cause considerable distress.
	
	
	That I acknowledge. I certainly acknowledge the spirit of the legislation to which I have referred to try to minimise such harm or reaction for a protected confider. However, the additional matters that shed light upon what has already been disclosed by the protected confider emerge from the material that I am making available. Those matters need to be seen in the context of the information provided by the protected confider to the psychologist, according to my understanding of the relevant note, on 8 October 2013.
	
	
	So far as the probative value of the material is concerned, I have concluded it has substantial probative value. As I have already pointed out that substantial probative value, in part, has to be considered in the context of this part of the history being provided almost contemporaneously with the making of the statements that gave rise to the charging of the accused in relation to the allegations made by PH9.
	
	
	What I propose to do therefore is as follows. I provide to counsel for the protected confider a copy of the extract from those type‑written notes now. I propose to place another copy of that document, subject to any suggestions counsel for the protected confider may have about tidying up the very rough editing task I have undertaken in my chambers this morning, in an envelope which will be sealed and only opened at the direction of this Court or the Supreme Court and made an exhibit in these proceedings, exhibit 8. Exhibit 3 and exhibit 4, the produced documents with copies of the subpoenae attached, will be each placed in sealed envelopes, again only opened at the direction of or further order of the District Court or the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

		29 June 2015",2014-09-08 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704529,R v Johnson [2014] NSWSC 1254,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: On 25 July 2010 Mitchell Johnson, to whom I will refer throughout as the offender, was completing a bobcat competency assessment at Horsley Park. That assessment involved both theory and practical components and he left the premises where the assessment was conducted at about 3.30pm that afternoon. Later in the day he received a telephone call from a friend of his brother. The friend told the offender that ""something bad"" had happened and that his brother needed help immediately. The offender was given no further details and went directly to his brother's home. Upon arrival at his brother's home the offender saw the body of Mohammad Abouhait. He was dead. He had recently been bashed by the offender's brother. The offender's brother made an admission to that effect to Gina Schembri although that admission was not made in the presence of the offender.
	
	
	At his brother's request, and in those very particular circumstances, the offender assisted his brother in moving the deceased's body from the premises to some nearby premises which were occupied by other men. Mr Abouhait's body was transported by the offender and his brother using the offender's full size SUV. A bloodstain was left in the full size SUV and this was later noticed by a witness. The decomposed remains of the deceased were found in bushland at Londonderry on 16 March 2012, that is, nearly two years later. Upon investigation, the suspicion of the police fell upon the offender and his brother.
	
	
	On 26 September 2012 the offender attended the Fairfield Police Station and took part in an electronically recorded interview. Whilst he told the police various things about a conflict between his brother and another man, or group of men, he denied any knowledge of the whereabouts of the deceased or of the deceased's murder. On 30 October 2012 the offender was arrested. He was again interviewed by police. He gave the police more information about the dispute between his brother and the other men, but in respect of the murder and his involvement in the removal of Mr Abouhait's body, he provided a dishonest account. The offender was charged with murder and bail was refused.
	
	
	On 6 September 2013 he was jointly arraigned with his brother in this Court. Each man was charged with murder. On three occasions, between 28 April 2014 and 8 May 2014, joint trials were commenced. On each occasion the offender was charged with murder. On each occasion, for reasons not presently relevant, the jury was discharged part-way through the proceedings. After a third attempt at a joint trial the proceedings were separated.
	
	
	On or about 8 May 2014 the offender's legal representatives raised with the prosecutor the possibility that the offender might or would plead guilty to a charge of accessory after the fact of murder if the murder charge was discontinued. At that stage the prosecutor rejected the proposal. The trial of the offender's brother commenced again and the offender's trial was adjourned to be heard after his brother's trial.
	
	
	On 13 May 2014 the offender was granted bail. By that stage he had been in custody charged with murder for a period of 18 months and 14 days.
	
	
	On 29 May 2014 the offender's brother was found guilty of the murder of Mr Abouhait. He was convicted by Bellew J and awaits sentence. As I understand it, and by a singular coincidence, his sentence proceedings are to be finalised today.
	
	
	The offender's trial for murder was listed before me on 4 August 2014. At that stage I was informed that discussions were taking place between the legal representatives of the parties. On Wednesday 6 August, the offender was arraigned on an indictment containing two counts. He pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder and guilty to an alternative charge of being an accessory after the fact to murder. The prosecutor indicated that the Director of Public Prosecutions would now accept that plea in full discharge of the indictment. At that stage I formally discharged the offender in relation to the murder charge and I formally convicted him of the offence of being an accessory after the fact to murder. The offender now stands to be sentenced for that crime.
	
	
	The offence of accessory after the fact to murder carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment: s 349(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
	
	
	It is an offence which can occur in a very wide range of circumstances and accordingly the range of sentences imposed is very wide. There are numerous instances where offenders have been sentenced to non-custodial sentences. On the other hand, there are many cases in which offenders have been sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. Recent authorities in this Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal show that the offence of accessory after the fact to murder is generally considered to be an offence of extreme gravity: see, for example, the judgments of Fullerton J in Postlewaight v R [2011] NSWSC 279 and R v Urriola [2010] NSWSC 367.
	
	
	In those cases sentences ranging from six years for Mr Urriola and eight years and six months for Mr Postlewaight were imposed. That was after discounts for pleas and/or assistance to authorities.
	
	
	The gravity of the crime of accessory after the fact to murder was again emphasised by Fullerton J in Kaminic v R [2014] NSWCCA 116 where an undiscounted sentence of nine years imprisonment was held, by majority, to be within the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion: see Kaminic at [54].
	
	
	An assessment of the objective gravity of offences of this kind involves a consideration of a number of factors. These include but are not limited to:
	



	
	The circumstances of the murder itself;
	
	
	The extent of the knowledge in the accessory of those circumstances;
	
	
	The precise act, or acts, which constitutes the offence of being an accessory after the fact;
	
	
	The length of time over which the offender assisted the principal offender in escaping justice;
	
	
	The extent to which the acts of the offender successfully delayed, or thwarted, the investigation and prosecution of the principal offender;
	
	
	The motivation of the offender in committing the crime;
	
	
	Related to the question of motivation is the question of whether the offender's conduct was motivated by a sense of misguided loyalty or emotional attachment to the principal offender. This is a circumstance of particular significance in cases where a family member assists the principal offender;
	
	
	It has generally been held that offences which involve the disposal or destruction of a corpse are cases which fall at the upper end of the range of criminality for the offence.
	


See, for example, R v Quach [2002] NSWSC 1205 at [11] (Simpson J); R v Cowen [2008] NSWSC 104 at [19] (Buddin J); R v Galea [2000] NSWSC 301; R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944.


	
	However, as the judgment of the majority in Kaminic establishes at [45]:
	


It does not follow that if the assistance an accessory renders is of a different or less direct kind (as well it might be in the case of a contract killing of the kind alleged here) that it necessarily constitutes offending of a lesser order of objective seriousness. Each case must be assessed on its own facts.


	
	In my dissenting judgment in Kaminic, I provided, at [90]-[120], a brief summary of around 20 sentencing cases, both at first instance and on appeal, which had been decided between 1999 and 2014. A copy of those summaries, with the case of Kaminic itself added to it, will be annexed to the published version of this sentencing judgment.
	
	
	The extent to which the sentencing decisions in past cases, either by reference to the judgments in those cases, or by an interrogation of the statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission, can assist a sentencing judge in determining a just and proper outcome in a particular sentencing case is limited. It is an exercise that has been held in many cases to be problematic and fraught with difficulties.
	
	
	The correct approach was articulated by the High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 and by Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 205 A Crim R 1 at [304]-[305]. In Hili and Jones, it was said at [54]:
	


In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa, Simpson J accurately identified the proper use of information about sentences that have been passed in other cases. As her Honour pointed out, a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits. As her Honour said: ""Sentencing patterns are, of course, of considerable significance in that they result from the application of the accumulated experience and wisdom of first instance judges and of appellate courts."" But the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence"". Past sentences ""are no more than historical statements of what has happened in the past. They can, and should, provide guidance to sentencing judges, and to appellate courts, and stand as a yardstick against which to examine a proposed sentence"" (emphasis added). When considering past sentences, ""it is only by examination of the whole of the circumstances that have given rise to the sentence that 'unifying principles' may be discerned"".

As the plurality said in Wong ""[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""


	
	I have already set out the fundamental facts of the case in my opening remarks. Two particular circumstances pull in opposite directions in determining the objective gravity of the offender's crime. On one hand, the offender did assist the principal in disposing of the deceased's body by having it moved to a place where it could ultimately be disposed of and that disposal successfully delayed the investigation and prosecution for more than two years. On the other hand, his involvement occurred in the immediate aftermath of the murder when he was confronted with the horrific circumstance that his own brother had been involved in a homicide.
	
	
	In Urriola, Fullerton J said at [28]:
	


In some cases the moral culpability is moderated where the offender's conduct can be said to be a spontaneous reaction to a critical or unexpected situation.


	
	It is also a case, as was put by Mr Spencer who appears for the offender on sentence, where the offender was motivated by fraternal loyalty. In R v Dileski [2002] NSWCCA 345; (2002) 132 A Crim R 408, Hidden J (with whom Buddin J agreed) said at [17]:
	


In many cases of this kind, the offender's conduct is the product of emotional attachment or dependence or a misguided sense of loyalty. No doubt that accounts for most, if not all of the cases in the Judicial Commission's statistics which were disposed of otherwise than by full-time custodial sentences.


	
	His Honour also made similar comments in R v Kari; R v H; R v Hamid [2008] NSWSC 993, a case of accessory after the fact to manslaughter, at [41]:
	


Non-custodial sentences are by no means unheard of but tend to be confined to cases in which the accessory has strong emotional ties to the principal offender.


	
	Another matter which is important in the offender's case is that his involvement appears to have taken place over a very short period of time and there is no suggestion that he was a party to the ultimate disposal of the body in bushland. His criminality is encompassed in his action in assisting to move the body from his brother's home to premises of people I take to be friends or associates of his brother. Precisely what the offender knew of the circumstances of the murder is not clear. From the Agreed Statement of Facts it seems that all he knew was that his brother had bashed the deceased to death a very short time before he, the offender, received the telephone call to come and help. The facts make it clear that he was not told that there had been a murder when he was asked by the brother's friend to come and help. He became aware of that when he saw the body of the deceased lying on the ground at his brother's home.
	
	
	However, the facts of the murder have some relevance and it is necessary to set out the background as they are presented in the Agreed Statement of Facts.
	
	
	In July of 2010 the offender resided with his partner and his two children in Horsley Park. His brother resided at 41 Bulolo Drive, Whalan. The brother used his residential premises to repair and sell motor vehicles. Towards the middle of July 2010, a late model BMW motor car valued at about $200,000 stopped outside the brother's premises and the driver approached him and asked him if he wanted to buy the vehicle for $2,000. The brother knew immediately that the vehicle was stolen and declined the offer. The brother reported the matter to police and the occupants of the BMW were arrested.
	
	
	Some days later, the deceased, Mohammad Ayman Abouhait, attended the brother's home and demanded cars as compensation for the BMW that the police had seized. Although the deceased was not present when the offer was made to sell the BMW, the strong inference is that he was involved. The brother refused to hand over any vehicles and the deceased, thereafter, at gun point, stole a gold chain from him indicating that he would be back for the cars. That information was contained in the brother's statements made to the police at a later time.
	
	
	In the early morning of 25 July 2010 the deceased was arrested attempting to break into the brother's home. The brother was not present at the time. When police informed the brother of the arrest, he said that he did not want the deceased charged and that he would look after it himself. The deceased was released from custody later that day. Following his release there were numerous telephone calls between the deceased and the brother. Following his release from custody that day, the deceased visited a friend and told her that he was going to drive around and pick up some cars in Bulolo Drive. The deceased was not seen or heard from again. His decomposed remains were found in bushland at Londonderry on 16 March 2012.
	
	
	That is all I am told of the facts of the murder other than the admission that the brother based the deceased to which I have earlier made reference.
	
	
	Those circumstances take the case well away from cases of professional or contract murders, such as were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Kaminic, Postlewaight and Urriola.
	
	
	It should also be recalled that the offender's actions, whilst involving the disposal of a corpse, or at least taking a step towards the disposal of a corpse, are much less serious, as Mr Spencer points out, than cases where the offender either buries or destroys a body: Examples of those cases are R v Galea; R v Yeo [2000] NSWSC 301 and R v Faulkner [2000] NSWSC 944.
	
	
	In so far as there is utility in placing offences within a putative range of seriousness and thereby categorising them, I am of the opinion that, objectively, the present offence falls somewhere below the middle range of offences contemplated by s 349(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). I do not accept Mr Spencer's submission that it is an offence that falls in the low range of objective criminality.
	
	
	Both the maximum penalty and the principles of sentencing under the common law and s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) result in the inevitable conclusion that a substantial punishment must be visited upon the offender. In particular, the sentence must make it clear to others that involving oneself in the aftermath of a relative's serious crime cannot be justified by reliance on the relationship with the offender. In that respect, general deterrence has an important role to play. Similarly, the conduct must be subject to denunciation by the Court and the offender must be made accountable for his actions.
	
	
	The harm and the distress caused to the victim's relatives must also be given substantial weight. The conduct of the offender in this case was part of a successful attempt to cover up the killing. The victim's relatives were left in a state of uncertainty as to where Mr Abouhait was and what, if any, harm had come to him. They were unable to obtain closure. I can only imagine the hurt and distress accompanying the horrific realisation that he had been killed and dumped in bushland.
	
	
	In view of the lengthy period of time during which the offender was in custody charged with murder, it has been submitted on his behalf that a sentence should be imposed which is no more than the period of time that he has already been in custody.
	
	
	In terms of the non-parole component of that sentence, the learned Crown Prosecutor has indicated that I would not be falling into error in imposing a sentence of such magnitude. The question is whether I accept that concession and accept that submission.
	
	
	I have come to the conclusion that the objective circumstances of the offence are such that the only appropriate sentence is one of full-time custody: s 5(1), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
	
	
	I am of the opinion that a failure of the record to reflect that a full-time custodial sentence was imposed would constitute a failure to give effect to the requirement of general deterrence and the necessity that the conduct engaged in be denounced.
	
	
	However, the offender has presented a substantial subjective case, albeit with economy and brevity by his learned counsel. That warrants significant mitigation of the penalty to be imposed.
	
	
	The offender is a man of a little under 40 years of age and he has little criminal history. His criminal history, which was tendered as Exhibit B, discloses an irrelevant traffic offence in 2012 which did not result in a conviction. There are also offences of assault and malicious damage of property and negligent driving in 2007 which resulted in fines and a 12 month bond. In 2011 the offender was convicted for two counts of intimidating a police officer. That may sound quite serious, but the resulting fine of $400 and a 12 month good behaviour bond suggests that those offences were not as serious as they first appear.
	
	
	In my assessment, that criminal history does not disentitle the offender to leniency and I accept Mr Spencer's submission that the offender does not have any significant record of previous convictions: s 21A(3)(c), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I am also satisfied on the evidence before me that the offender is a person of otherwise good character and he is unlikely to offend again. Apart from the fact that he does not have a significant criminal record, reliance is placed on a psychological report prepared by Ms Brigida, which became Exhibit 1. That report shows that the offender grew up in a family of five; his parents had migrated from Lebanon - his father in the late 1960s and his mother in the early 1970s. He has had two serious relationships in his life. The first resulted in two children who are now aged 13 and 9 years. The second relationship resulted in one child who is just 19 months of age. I take it that the offender has missed out on the infancy of that child by virtue of being in custody for most of the child's life.
	
	
	The offender was not a brilliant student at school, but has had a consistent employment record starting from when he was just 14 years of age when he obtained work in a petrol station. He tried to become a diesel mechanic but had some difficulties with the academic side of that occupation and commenced his own business in freight or trucking in 1999. He kept that business going until 2009 when the breakdown of his first serious relationship meant that the trucking business also ceased.
	
	
	The report shows, and I accept, that since his release, he has got himself a job driving what is described as ""a tipper truck"" and is working in excavation and demolition.
	
	
	The report speaks of a history of cannabis abuse and has assessed the offender of being below average intelligence. But there are no relevant psychological problems and the report concludes that which is probably obvious from the looking at his criminal history - he is not a psychopath.
	
	
	The author of the report concludes that his probability for re-offending appears to be minimal and she relies upon some of the psychological testing in coming to that conclusion. He is assessed, by reference to that assessment, as being in the ""low category for re-offending"". That conclusion is by no means binding on me, but I have come, as I have said, to the same conclusion based on his employment history and his absence of serious criminal record in the past.
	
	
	While the offender did not plead guilty to the offence for some time after being charged, the Crown had, at all stages, proceeded with an allegation of murder which it ultimately accepted could not be justified or sustained. The plea of guilty to the charge of accessory after the fact to murder was offered some time before the prosecution was prepared to accept it, and as soon as the prosecution indicated its willingness to accept it, the offender entered a plea of guilty.
	
	
	The Crown accepts that in those peculiar circumstances the offender is entitled to a substantial reduction in his sentence to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. It concedes that the offender is entitled to a discount based on a plea of guilty entered at the first reasonable opportunity. I need not refer in detail to the relevant case law, but I have considered the guideline judgment in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383 which speaks of a range of discounts of between 10 and 25 percent.
	
	
	This case is obviously complicated by the fact that the offender was charged with murder and it seems that no serious consideration was given to a plea to the current charge until very late in the piece. I note the comments of the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases such as R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310 and R v Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15 where offers of pleas of guilty to manslaughter were made and the cases went to trial for murder. I also note that in R v RD [2014] NSWCCA 103, a discount of 20 percent was given in circumstances not completely dissimilar to those that apply here and that discount was not disturbed on appeal: see RD at [28]-[31].
	
	
	In all the circumstances I propose to allow a discount of about 20 percent. It will in fact be rounded up in the offender's favour to keep the sentence that is imposed in sensible round figures.
	
	
	The mitigating features include the fact that the offence was not relevantly part of a planned or organised criminal activity and I have already referred to some of the subjective features which give rise to mitigating features under the provisions of s 21A.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor does not contend that any relevant aggravating feature exists for the purpose of s 21A apart from matters that are perhaps inherent in the offence itself. Mr Spencer was prepared to concede an aggravating feature in the fact that the offence was committed in company, but I do not understand that to be a concession that it is aggravating for the purpose of s 21A and I do not find it to be so.
	
	
	In my opinion, a starting point of three years is an appropriate sentence, taking into account all of the relevant principles of sentencing, as well as the purposes of sentencing, the facts and circumstances of the offence and the subjective case of the offender.
	
	
	From that starting point, I would deduct 8 months which is a little more than a discount of 20 percent for the plea of guilty. That would result in a total sentence of 28 months. Pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I am satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying a reduction in the length of sentence to be served in custody. In particular, the fact that the offender has spent 18 months and 2 weeks in gaol, that he appears to have progressed well during that period and has now been released from custody and appears to have assimilated into the community successfully is a matter which I consider to constitute special circumstances for the purposes of s 44. I can see no benefit to the community in him returning to custody for a period of weeks or months based around a failure to find special circumstances.
	
	
	Accordingly I would reduce the time in custody to a period of 18 months which is around the period that the offender has already served.
	
	
	Section 47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act allows a sentencing judge to order that a sentence will commence on a day prior to the date that the sentence was imposed. Many authorities of this Court and in the Court of Criminal Appeal confirm that where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody the best approach is to backdate the sentence to ensure that it is clear that the period of pre-sentence custody has been taken into account; see, for example, R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588; R v Deeble (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 19 September 1991, unrep per Handley JA, Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ), R v Reid (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 26 March 1997, unrep per Newman and Sully JJ) and R v Foster (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW),30 October 1996, unrep per Studdert and Hidden JJ).
	
	
	The preferable practice becomes a little more complicated where there has not been a period of continuous or unbroken pre-sentence custody. There was a view that where there was a break in the period of custody this would constitute a good reason and the usual practice of backdating would not be followed: see R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245 at [23]. The alternative approach, of course, is to reduce the proposed sentence by the period in custody. However, in R v Newman [2004] NSWCCA 102; (2004) 145 A Crim R 361, Howie J confirmed that the preferable course remained to backdate the sentence even where it created something of a fiction whereby the sentence commenced on a day that the offender was not even in custody. His Honour also confirmed that nothing in s 47 prohibited that practice, at [26]-[30]:
	


""The difficulty arises in cases where, as here, the pre-sentence custody did not continue unbroken to the date of sentence. In such a case the court is faced with two options: it can simply state that the pre-sentence custody is being taken into account and reduce the sentence accordingly; or it can backdate the sentence even though the offender was not actually in custody on the date when the sentence is deemed to have commenced. Notwithstanding some doubt expressed about the latter practice in R v Sayak (NSWCCA, unreported, 16 September 1993), this Court has dealt with the matter in this way on more than one occasion. See R v McDonald (NSWCCA, unreported, 12 December 1995), R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309, and R v Phillips and Simpson [2002] NSWCCA 167. There is nothing in s 47 of the Act that would suggest that a court could not make such an order.

In my view, although there is an element of fiction involved in backdating a sentence to a period when the offender was not in custody, there is much to be said in its favour. Firstly, it preserves the denunciatory and deterrent value of the sentence to be pronounced. If a sentence is decreased by a substantial period already served in custody, it can have the appearance of being inadequate both to public perception and when it appears in the statistical information that is now so often relied upon by sentencing courts. This was one of the reasons expressed in McHugh for the adoption of the practice and it remains a highly important consideration.

In McDonald, a case in which a judge deferred passing sentence in light of the fact that the offender had spent 17 months in pre-sentence custody, this Court stated:

The first submission made on behalf of the Crown is that, even if (which is not conceded) Abadee J were right to conclude that the time already spent in custody by the respondent was adequate in the circumstances, this was not a case in which the matter should have been dealt with by a deferred sentence upon the respondent entering into a recognizance. The Crown argues that, if Abadee J had been minded to produce the practical result that the respondent, subject to appropriate assessment by the relevant authorities, spent little or no further time in custody, he could have achieved that result by back-dating a sentence of imprisonment to commence on 3 November 1993, and providing for a minimum term to end at about the time of sentencing, together with an additional term. That a sentencing judge has power to back-date a sentence, even in circumstances where the offender has been at large during the intervening period, is not in doubt. That not infrequently happens in this court, and, when it does, the court makes it clear that it is aware, in imposing its sentence, that the prisoner has been at large during part of the period the subject of the sentence.

We agree with the Crown's submission. There is a significant difference between serving a part of a sentence in the community, on parole, and being at liberty on a recognizance. In the former case, the offender is serving the sentence, although in the community. Breach of parole has certain immediate consequences. More important, the community sees that the offender is subjected to a sentence.

In that case, the Court backdated the sentence to the date upon which the respondent first went into custody, notwithstanding that he had been at liberty pending the determination of the Crown appeal; a period of over nine months.

The practice of backdating the sentence also makes it obvious to the offender that he, or she, has received a reduction in the sentence for the period already spent in custody. It ensures that there can be no argument, such as is now presently before this Court, as to whether the discount was in fact given even though the sentencing judge said that the time served in custody was taken into account in the sentence imposed. The importance of this aspect of sentencing was recognised in R v Phillips and Simpson and in R v Galati [2003] NSWCCA 148. In Galati James J, with whom Smart AJ agreed, said:

[36] It is true that, while a sentencing judge is required to take a period of pre-sentence custody into account, it is not obligatory for the sentencing judge to take the period of pre-sentence custody into account by the means of backdating the commencement of the sentence and that in Howard the Chief Judge at Common Law left open the option of reducing a sentence to be imposed so as to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody. However, in the present case, I consider that, notwithstanding the sentencing judge's assertion in his remarks on sentence that he had taken into account the first period of presentence custody, the first period of presentence custody is not demonstrably reflected in the sentences which were imposed. The first two sentences, on which the other two sentences depend, were made to commence from 18 January 2002, a commencement date which would allow only for the second period of pre-sentence custody. The sentences which were imposed were for round periods of whole years, which tends to militate against any conclusion that an irregular period of one month and twenty six days was really taken into account.

The practice also avoids questions of disparity erroneously arising because a sentence, with which comparison is being made, has been markedly reduced by pre-sentence custody. Such a sentence, particularly where there are few comparable sentences for similar offences, can also skew the statistical information derived from sentences imposed by other courts and give a false indication of the range of sentences that have been imposed for a similar offence or on a similar offender.""


	
	The present case is a good example of why the preferable course is to impose an appropriate sentence and to backdate the sentence. If I were to subtract the period of custody from the proposed sentence the resulting sentence would not properly denounce the crime and be seen by others as having a deterrent effect. Further, the sentence may be misunderstood when it finds its way into the Judicial Commission statistics.
	
	
	Noting first that the non-parole period that I intend to impose has already been served by the offender and, secondly, that s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires me to direct the release of the offender at the expiration of a non-parole period if the sentence in total is three years or less, I propose to backdate the sentence to the date that the offender went into custody.
	
	
	Mr Johnson, I formally convicted you on the last occasion. If not, I do so now.
	
	
	You are sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 30 October 2012 and expiring on 29 April 2014. I set a balance of term of eight months commencing on 30 April and expiring on 29 November 2014.
	
	
	I direct that you were to be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period and I note that you were in fact released on 13 May 2014. It is a condition of your parole that you attend the Fairfield office of the Probation and Parole Service within seven days of today. It is a further condition of your parole that you accept the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service for the period of the balance of term or for such shorter period as the service determines to be appropriate.

		26 July 2016",2014-09-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704534,RH v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2014] NSWCA 305,"Judgment

1BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Basten JA and the orders he proposes. I agree with his Honour's reasons. I also agree that this is not an appropriate matter to remit to the magistrate for redetermination, for the reasons given by his Honour. 

2There is a further reason why that course may not be appropriate. It was indicated in argument that the aggravation of the offence was that it was committed in the company of a child under school age. There was some, but not definitive, support for this indication in the material before the Court. There may be a question whether, if that is correct, the applicant could be guilty of the offence with which he was charged. Given that it is over two years since the proceedings were conducted in the Local Court and over four years since the charge was laid, there seems little point in the matter being remitted where there is a possibility that, in any event, the offence charged could not have been committed by the applicant.

3McCOLL JA: I have read the reasons of Basten JA in draft which identify the critical facts and legal issues. I agree that the applicant should have leave to appeal, but disagree (save as to the costs orders his Honour proposes) as to the orders that should be made disposing of the appeal.

4Section 55(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the ""CAR Act"") enabled the appeal before Hoeben CJ at CL, being one against conviction, to be determined in one of three ways:
""(a) by setting aside the conviction, or
(b) by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the Local Court sitting at the place at which the original Local Court proceedings were held for redetermination in accordance with the Supreme Court's directions, or
(c) by dismissing the appeal.""

5It was common ground before the Chief Judge that the test whether the prosecution had rebutted the presumption of doli incapax in favour of RH was a subjective one: RH v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2013] NSWSC 520 (at [22]). That being the case, the applicant had established ground 2 of the Amended Summons by which he had appealed from the Local Court decision pursuant to s 52 of the CAR Act.

6That position having been reached, it is apparent that the matter proceeded before his Honour on the basis that he should determine whether, applying the correct test, the first ground of appeal, whether the Magistrate erred in law in finding there was evidence capable of rebutting beyond a reasonable doubt the presumption of doli incapax, was made good. 

7As Mr Nicholson of Senior Counsel, who appeared for the applicant with Mr H T Quilter on the application in this Court, but not before the primary judge, accepted, this inquiry had to be undertaken to determine whether, even if the conviction (it being common ground that the finding of guilt against the applicant was included in the meaning of ""conviction"" in relation to a decision of the Children's Court under Part 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW): s 3(2) CAR Act) should prima facie be set aside by reason of the Magistrate's application of the wrong legal test, there was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the presumption was rebutted to warrant remitting the matter to the Local Court for redetermination in accordance with the court's directions as to the correct legal test.

8It is apparent, however, from the primary judge's reasons, and as Ms Mitchelmore who appeared for the respondent before Hoeben CJ at CL acknowledged, that the question whether, should his Honour find the evidence was sufficient, he should make a remittal order rather than dismiss the appeal, was not debated.

9That question arises in this Court, Mr Nicholson having sought a remittal order in the alternative to an order setting aside the conviction.

10In my view Hoeben CJ at CL did not err in concluding (at [34]) that there was sufficient evidence that the plaintiff knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and was not merely mischievous. As his Honour said:

""28 The importance of the object of the break-in being a fire station was that it would have been appreciated by the plaintiff that the fire station existed for a specific purpose and that he was not meant to be there. That he was aware of this fact, emerges from statements which he made to CK. Of more significance is the use of a jemmy to break open the padlock. I have concluded that it was well open to his Honour to conclude that this was something which could be taken into account with other circumstances to indicate an awareness on the part of the plaintiff that what he was doing was seriously wrong. This was an obviously wrongful act which required some planning, i.e., having a jemmy available.

...

31 The most important evidence from the point of view of the prosecution was the statements made by the plaintiff to CK. His Honour characterised those statements as 'boasting about what he has done'. The statements do bear that characterisation and it is difficult to see what other purpose RH had in going to the home of CK late at night and telling him about what he had done. That was a finding open to his Honour.
32 It is, however, the actual words used by the plaintiff which I consider are of particular significance in determining his state of knowledge. The words were 'I got drinks and that here, I got them from the fire station, I broke in there, I was in with all the fire trucks, I was searching looking for money. I found drinks and balloons and rulers. Me and S got 'em'. The next day he said to CK 'Look at I got, I got them last night, I got them from the fire station in Xxxxxx'.
33 The plaintiff submitted that the words 'I was in with all the fire trucks' was the sort of expression a young and immature person would use. That may be so, but it says nothing about his understanding of whether what he was doing was seriously wrong. On the other hand, the statements 'I broke in there'; 'I was searching looking for money. I found drinks and balloons and rulers. Me and S got 'em' make it clear that the plaintiff understood that what he was doing was seriously wrong. He was breaking into a fire station with the intention of looking for money and anything else of value. On the basis of that evidence, it was well open to his Honour to find that the plaintiff understood that these were seriously wrongful acts and not acts of mischief.""

11Similar reasoning can be found in R (a child) v Whitty (1993) 66 A Crim R 462 in which Harper J (as his Honour then was) concluded that the presumption of doli incapax was rebutted in the case of a twelve year old girl charged with stealing a pair of track suit pants from Target. In her record of interview when asked what she had done at the plaza where the shop was located, the girl said ""went into the shop, Target, and stole those jeans"". Harper J regarded her use of the word ""stole"" as conclusive in circumstances where ""[n]obody had used that word before, at least not in the record of interview"", indicating she used the word ""deliberately and appropriately and knew what is meant"": Whitty (at 465).

12I agree, however, with Basten JA (at [43]), that having regard to the Magistrate's reasons that the Chief Judge could not find that, applying the correct test, only one conclusion was open. There being evidence which is, however, capable of supporting a finding that the presumption had been rebutted, I would not favour simply setting aside the conviction without more. Breaking into the Rural Fire Services premises was a serious offence as the terms of the charge indicated. 

13In my view, the Court should set aside the conviction and remit the matter to the Local Court for redetermination in accordance with the Court's directions, with no order as to costs.

14BASTEN JA: The applicant is a young person, under 16 years of age. In October 2010, when he was aged 12, he broke into a country fire station, with a young girl, and they took a computer belonging to the Rural Fire Service together with several rulers, balloons and cans of soft drink. He was charged with an offence of aggravated breaking and entering, contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He appeared before Magistrate Dunlevy in the Children's Court on 6 July 2012 and was found guilty. On 10 August 2012 the charge was dismissed, with a caution.

15There was no dispute that the applicant undertook the acts the subject of the charge: the only issue was whether he could be held criminally responsible for his conduct, having regard to his age.

16For children under the age of 10 years, by statute they cannot be guilty of a criminal offence: Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 (NSW), s 5. (The principle is sometimes referred to using the Latin phrase doli incapax.) However, above the age of 10, general law principles apply. The relevant principle was succinctly stated by the House of Lords in C (A minor) v Director of Public Prosecutions [1996] AC 1, in giving an affirmative answer to the following question set out by Lord Lowry at 21:

""Whether there continues to be a presumption that a child between the ages of 10 and 14 is doli incapax and, if so, whether that presumption can only be rebutted by clear positive evidence that he knew that his act was seriously wrong, such evidence not consisting merely in the evidence of the acts amounting to the offence itself.""

17The principle was subject to a scathing review by Laws J in the same case, in the Divisional Court from which the appeal was taken to the House of Lords. However the operation of the principle in this jurisdiction is not in doubt. The question is whether it was properly applied by the Magistrate in finding the applicant guilty of the offence. 

18The applicant appealed from this finding to the Supreme Court, pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""Appeal and Review Act""). (The finding relevantly constituted a ""conviction"" for the purposes of the appeal provisions: Appeal and Review Act, s 3(2).) Section 52 provides for an appeal from a conviction in the Local Court, ""but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone."" (There is a more extensive appeal, on a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact, but only by leave of the Supreme Court, which was not invoked in the present case: Appeal and Review Act, s 53(1)). The matter came before Hoeben CJ at CL in May 2013, who dismissed the appeal: RH v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2013] NSWSC 520. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal to this Court on the basis of error on the part of the Chief Judge.

19Although the matter involves a question of law only and relates to the correctness of a criminal conviction, leave is required to appeal: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(r). In resisting the application for leave, the Director referred to the following statement of principle in Director of Public Prosecutions v Priestley [2014] NSWCA 25; 201 LGERA 1, where Gleeson JA (with whom Beazley P and Emmett JA agreed) said at [15]:

""The matters which are relevant when considering an application for leave to appeal to the Court are summarised by Basten JA (Tobias AJA agreeing) in Be Financial Pty Ltd as Trustee for Be Financial Operations Trust v Das [2012] NSWCA 164 at [32]-[37]. An applicant for leave must establish something more than that the primary judge was arguably wrong in the conclusion arrived at: Carolan v AMF Bowling Pty Ltd t/as Bennetts Green Bowl [1995] NSWCA 69 (Sheller JA); Zelden v Sewell [2011] NSWCA 56 at [20]-[22] (Campbell JA, Young JA agreeing). Ordinarily, leave will only be granted in matters which involve issues of principle, questions of general public importance, or an issue which is reasonably clear in the sense of going beyond what is merely arguable.""

20That was a case in which the Director sought leave to appeal from an acquittal, contending that the public interest lay in resolving a lack of clarity in the statutory provision creating an offence. Neither the statement of principle, nor the outcome in that case, is to be doubted. However, the question of public interest has quite a different connotation with respect to a challenge to a criminal conviction, based on an error of law. There being a real issue in the present case as to whether the Chief Judge erred in the approach he took with respect to the question of law before him, the applicant should have leave to appeal.

21The issue raised by the appeal can be shortly stated. It arose in circumstances where the Chief Judge was satisfied that the magistrate had committed at least two errors of law in reaching his conclusion that the applicant had criminal capacity. (The findings of error, which were not challenged on appeal, will be noted shortly.)

22What happened thereafter is a little unclear. The Chief Judge continued at [25]:

""This does not end the matter. What it means is that when considering the evidence which was before his Honour, I have to ignore that finding.""

The error relied upon in this Court is that, having found legal error on the part of the magistrate, the Chief Judge asked ""whether by reference to the evidence as a whole, it was still open to his Honour find that the presumption had been rebutted"": at [25]. The Chief Judge continued:

""Put another way, had the Crown on the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that RH knew that what he did at the fire station was seriously wrong as distinct from an act of mere naughtiness or mischief.""

23The course being undertaken at that point involved one of three possibilities. The first possibility derived from the grounds of appeal. The Chief Judge upheld ground 2, which alleged that the magistrate had erred in law in applying an objective test in deciding whether the presumption of incapacity was rebutted beyond reasonable doubt. It is possible that the Chief Judge was then turning to the first ground which alleged error on the part of the magistrate in finding that ""there was evidence capable of rebutting"" the presumption beyond reasonable doubt. However, that seems unlikely, the language at [25] being directed to the consequence of a finding of error under ground 2.

24The second possibility was that the Chief Judge had turned directly to considering final relief under s 55 of the Appeal and Review Act. That provision, so far as relevant, stated:

55 Determination of appeals

(1) The Supreme Court may determine an appeal against conviction:

(a) by setting aside the conviction, or
(b) by setting aside the conviction and remitting the matter to the Local Court ... for redetermination in accordance with the Supreme Court's directions, or
(c) by dismissing the appeal.

25Although the Chief Judge did in fact dismiss the appeal, pursuant to s 55(1)(c), to do so after concluding that there was legal error required consideration of matters which were not to be found in s 55(1) itself.

26The third possibility was that the Chief Judge was seeking to apply s 65 of the Appeal and Review Act, which states:

65 Appeal not to succeed on narrow technical grounds

(1) A conviction, order or sentence is not to be set aside on an appeal merely because of:

(a) an omission or mistake in the form of the conviction or order, or
(b) an error in law in the order or sentence,

if it appears to the appeal court that there were sufficient grounds before the Local Court to have authorised a conviction, order or sentence free from the omission, mistake or error.

(2) In such a case, the appeal court:

(a) may amend the conviction, order or sentence and determine the appeal as if the omission, mistake or error did not exist, or
(b) may remit the matter to the Local Court to make the conviction or order, or impose the sentence, authorised by law and to amend the conviction, order or sentence accordingly.

27Again, this is a possibility, but the Chief Judge did not refer expressly to s 65 and, according to the submissions before this Court, its operation was not raised in the hearing before him. Certainly it was not raised in the written submissions in this Court. If it had been relied upon, one would have expected a careful consideration of its scope. The application of the wrong test to the critical question in issue before the magistrate did not involve a mistake in the form of any conviction or order for the purposes of s 65(1)(a). Nor did it involve ""an error in law in the order or sentence"" within the scope of paragraph (b). Provisions of this kind have a long history since the enactment of Jervis' Act in England in 1848. They are designed to ensure that orders, convictions and sentences are not set aside for mere want of form or for breach of a technicality not casting doubt on findings as to all the ingredients of the offence: see Ex parte Lovell; Re Buckley (1938) 38 SR(NSW) 153 at 167-168 and 173-174 (Jordan CJ; Davidson and Halse Rogers JJ agreeing). (Similar principles operate in relation to s 16 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).)

28It is no doubt correct, as stated by Brereton J in Maritime Authority of New South Wales v Rofe [2012] NSWSC 5; 84 NSWLR 51 at [107]-[108], that an appeal will not be upheld if an identified error ""has not affected the order"" or ""could have made no difference to the result."" However, the manner in which such considerations operate in a criminal case will differ from civil cases, whence Brereton J derived the language used in that passage. It would be a startling result to conclude that the error of the trial judge in applying an objective rather than a subjective test in determining the capacity of the accused ""could have made no difference to the result"", the result being dependent upon the court being satisfied by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. Nor did the Chief Judge make such a finding.

29The two questions identified at [22] above were not in fact the same: the first asked whether it was ""open"" to the magistrate to reach the conclusion he did; the second required the Supreme Court to answer the factual question. As the following passages in his reasons revealed, the Chief Judge approached it on the former basis. He stated at [34]:

""When one leaves out his Honour's finding as to the plaintiff's maturity, and when one leaves out the finding that the plaintiff made some effort to hide the items which he stole, was there sufficient evidence to allow his Honour to find beyond reasonable doubt that the plaintiff knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and was not merely mischievous. In my opinion, there was sufficient evidence and it was open to his Honour to make such a finding.""

30The matters referred to at the beginning of this passage refer to findings made by the magistrate which had been held to be erroneous and were therefore excluded by the judge from his assessment of the ""evidence"". The first error was that the magistrate had applied an objective test to question of capacity. The magistrate had stated (in a passage set out by the Chief Judge at [20]):

""I have also taken into account the young person's maturity. He is not that young and by the age of 12 he should be well aware that you cannot break into fire stations, particularly in the modern era of universal education, access to the internet, television, radio and so on.""

As the Chief Judge noted at [22]:

""It was common ground that the relevant test was a subjective one and concerned the state of mind of the particular minor. It could not be applied on the basis of what a normal child of 12 would have known or thought.""

31The second error identified was the finding in the first sentence of this passage by the magistrate as to the applicant's ""maturity"". The applicant had submitted before the Chief Judge that the evidence before the magistrate was insufficient to support the finding that he had ""the level of maturity ... of a normal 12 year old"": at [23]. The Chief Judge accepted that submission, hence his statement in his final conclusion that he would leave out of account the magistrate's finding as to the plaintiff's maturity: see at [29] above.

32The second factual finding rejected by the Chief Judge related to the magistrate's conclusion that the applicant had ""subsequently made some attempts to secrete a number of items which he took."" The Chief Judge noted that that conclusion was without foundation in the evidence. He stated at [30]:

""The evidence from his mother was that there were rulers with 'Fire Brigade' written on them and little packets of coloured pencils in the kitchen. There does not seem to have been any attempt to hide those. The police officers who searched the home had no difficulty in finding a number of Rural Fire rulers in a hallway cabinet. The only evidence concerning the finding of the laptop was that it was located 'inside a television cabinet'. There was no evidence of a description of the cabinet or of where in the cabinet it was found. I have concluded that it was not open to his Honour to find that the plaintiff had 'made some attempts to secrete a number of items which he took'.""

33The last conclusion explained the reason for leaving out of account the second matter identified by the Chief Judge set out at [29] above.

34The Chief Judge identified a number of other factual findings relied on by the magistrate. One was that, in the language of the police officer who attended the premises, the place had been ""ransacked"". The magistrate had said:

""... another reason why I feel that this offence goes beyond mere mischief or being naughty and can obviously be seen to be very wrong and very much a culpable act is that the office was ransacked and so the young person committing this offence has not just gone in and taken a number of items. He has severely messed up the place so to speak.""

35The Chief Judge dealt with this matter at [29] in the following terms:

""The difficulty for his Honour, and for this Court, is that what was meant by the word 'ransack' was never explained by the two police officers who used it. In the absence of any explanation, I would not be prepared to interpret the word as indicating anything more than it was obvious to an observer that drawers and cupboards had been opened (and perhaps left open) consistent with the search for money, which was one of the [applicant's] purposes in breaking into the premises.""

36Although no express finding was made, that appears to have been another factual consideration which the Chief Judge dismissed, at least in assessing whether the conclusion reached by the magistrate was open on the evidence.

37There is, however, a further matter of some significance given the common ground that the test to be applied was subjective and not objective. The magistrate had commenced his assessment of the evidence stating:

""In terms of the offence itself, it is notable that the offence was committed on a fire station that is an Emergency Services building. That lends an additional sinister aspect to this case. It marks it as being a very wrong act.""

38The Chief Judge dealt with this passage at [28] in the following terms:

""The importance of the object of the break-in being a fire station was that it would have been appreciated by the [applicant] that the fire station existed for a specific purpose and that he was not meant to be there. That he was aware of this fact, emerges from statements which he made to CK."" (Emphasis added.)

39The evidence of CK was that he saw the applicant on the street throwing a large bag of balloons up in the air and, when they fell on the ground, jumping on them so that the balloons went all over the road. The applicant left the balloons lying in the road and said to CK, ""Look [what] I got, I got them last night, I got them from the fire station ..."". What the evidence revealed was, of course, that he knew he had been in a fire station: what it did not reveal was that he knew that this was a ""sinister"" matter. The point is of some importance, because the Chief Judge himself adopted the language of an objective test, ""it would have been appreciated by the [applicant]"", with relation to the significance of the fire station and a subjective test only as to his awareness that he had been in the fire station.

40The critical issue for present purposes, however, is the acknowledgment by the Chief Judge that the magistrate had applied a wrong test. The application of the objective test no doubt followed from the stark absence of evidence relating specifically to the knowledge and state of mind of the applicant. That fact, however, merely demonstrated that there was only sparse material from which a finding could be made beyond reasonable doubt as to the particular knowledge and state of mind of the applicant. It did not justify substituting an objective test for that required by law.

41It was, of course, necessary for the Chief Judge, having found legal error, to determine whether those legal errors were material in the circumstances. The answer to that question could not have been in doubt: the test and the standard to be applied were central to the issue being determined by the magistrate. 

42There was a further problem with the subtraction of two findings from the matters relied upon by the magistrate, while maintaining that he would have come to the same conclusion absent those findings. Thus, having identified some five matters relevant to that issue the magistrate concluded (LC Tcpt, 06/07/12, p 6(5)):

""And so, again, conglomerating all of those conclusions I find that doli incapax has been negatived by the prosecution and so, therefore, each element ... has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

There is no doubt that the magistrate relied on the cumulative effect of all the matters to which he referred: to remove two features was to make a fresh finding of fact, a course not open to the Chief Judge on this appeal.

43On an appeal limited to a question of law, the findings as to error dictated the outcome, unless it could be said that, applying the correct test, there was only one conclusion open to the magistrate. The Chief Judge did not reach that conclusion, nor could he have done so on the material before him. Accordingly, the only course open was to set aside the conviction. The fact that it was open on the evidence for the magistrate to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had criminal capacity merely meant that the matter could be remitted for a further hearing, rather than the charge being dismissed. It would have been open to the Chief Judge to set aside the decision and remit it pursuant to s 55(1)(b); that course was not taken.

44The appeal should be allowed. There is then a question for this Court as to whether the matter should be remitted for redetermination by the Children's Court. It is now four years since the offence was committed. On sentence, the magistrate, having found the applicant guilty, dismissed the charge with a caution, pursuant to s 33(1)(a) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. In these circumstances, the administration of justice would not be served by returning the matter to the Local Court with an invitation to the parties to relitigate the issue on the basis of further evidence, nor would it be sensible to invite the magistrate to re-decide the case, more than two years after he had heard the evidence and four years after the conduct occurred.

45The Court should make the following orders:

(1) Allow the appeal and set aside the order in the Common Law Division dismissing the appeal.

(2) Allow the appeal to the Supreme Court and set aside the finding of guilt of the applicant at Wentworth Children's Court on 6 July 2012 and the caution administered on 10 August 2012.

46The applicant's counsel did not seek costs, it being in the nature of a criminal proceeding and no order should be made as to the costs in this Court.

3GARLING J: This is an appeal by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (""CDPP""), pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against two sentences imposed in the District Court by Finnane DCJ on 23 January 2014. 

4The respondent, Bilal Afiouny, was charged with two offences. Each offence was of bribery of a Commonwealth public official contrary to the provisions of s 141.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth).

5The two offences involved the respondent paying seven bribes to a Customs official in the period 6 July 2011 to 29 August 2011. The total amount of the bribes was $352,190 and US$20,000. The bribes were paid in an attempt to circumvent border protection controls and to avoid payment of between $25 M and $27 M in customs duty and taxes.

6Mr Afiouny pleaded guilty to the offences.

7The maximum penalty for each offence was imprisonment for 10 years, and a fine of $110,000. 

8In respect of each offence, the sentencing Judge imposed a sentence of 3 years 3 months imprisonment. He fixed a single non-parole period of 1 year 8 months for both offences. 

9He ordered that the two sentences be wholly concurrent and that they were both to commence on 23 January 2014. The single non-parole period will conclude on 22 September 2015. The whole sentence will conclude on 22 April 2017. 

Commonwealth Director's Appeal

10The CDPP appeals against the sentences that were imposed upon four grounds. They are:

(1)The sentencing Judge erred by imposing wholly concurrent head sentences.

(2)The sentencing Judge erred by imposing a single non-parole period of 1 year 8 months, without having regard to the provisions of Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and in particular, the requirement in s 16A to make an order of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the offences, having regard to general sentencing principles.

(3)The sentencing Judge erred by allowing a combined discount of 60 per cent in recognition of the respondent's remorse and contrition, guilty plea and assistance to authorities.

(4)The sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.

Facts

11An Agreed Statement of Facts was tendered to the sentencing Judge by the prosecution as part of its case. The following is a sufficient summary. 

12In June 2011, the respondent, Mr Afiouny was in Indonesia. He approached an Australian Customs Officer, Mr Graham, who was providing technical training to Indonesian Customs Officers, and sought a meeting with him to discuss a ""business arrangement"".

13Mr Graham, and a fellow customs officer, Mr Alton, attended the meeting. At that meeting, the respondent sought their assistance to clear shipping containers through the Port Botany container terminal in circumstances where the cargo and the containers would be tobacco. The respondent offered each of the customs officers $100,000 per cleared shipping container.

14The two customs officers reported the approach. Under supervision, and pursuant to a controlled operations authority, Mr Graham continued dealing with the respondent until the respondent was arrested on 1 September 2011. 

15Over that period, there were a number of telephone calls and personal meetings between Mr Graham and the respondent. Each of these contacts was lawfully recorded by either telephone intercept or listening device. 

16During the controlled operation, five shipping containers, containing either cigarette sticks or else loose-leaf tobacco, were imported and cleared by Mr Graham at the request of the respondent. 

17In total between 28.8 million and 31.8 million cigarettes sticks were imported. As well between 35,754 kg and 38,754 kg of loose leaf tobacco was imported. It was agreed that no less than $25.34 M was the total duty owing on these imports, and which it was sought to evade.

18On six separate occasions, the respondent paid Mr Graham a total of $352,090 and US$20,000 for his ""work"" in facilitating the clearance and release of the shipping containers.

19Based upon these facts, two rolled up charges were brought. The first charged the respondent with bribes paid on five occasions totalling $172,090. The second charge concerned the payment of two bribes on one occasion comprising $180,000 and US$20,000.

20The first charge related to containers being smuggled into Australia for the respondent's own benefit. The second charge related to a container which was being smuggled into Australia by a friend of the respondent. The respondent had no financial interest in this importation. 

21Each offence carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment or a fine of 10,000 penalty units or both. 

Remarks on Sentence

22His Honour, at the outset, noted the agreement between the Crown and defence counsel, that the respondent ""... cannot be regarded as a principal in the smuggling operation"". However, the basis of this agreement is not apparent and the comment seems to be erroneous. The Crown's written submissions to the sentencing judge contended for a finding that the respondent was a principal. His Honour referred specifically to that submission, and went on to make a finding that the respondent ""... was a principal in the enterprise and that he stood to make significant money from it"". The respondent was sentenced on this basis. No complaint is made in this Court about that finding.

23The sentencing Judge rejected the case advanced by the respondent that his meeting with the customs officer in Indonesia was an unplanned event. Rather, his Honour was satisfied that the respondent's conduct was part of a well thought out plan, the aim of which was to induce the officers, by means of the bribe, to be part of a ""... long term conspiracy to defraud the revenue"". This finding is consistent with the finding that the respondent was a principal in the offending.

24In reaching this conclusion, and in dealing generally with the respondent, his Honour also noted that in 2007, this Court in civil penalty proceedings had found that the respondent had knowingly participated in a previous episode of smuggling of tobacco into Australia with the intention of defrauding the revenue. He was found guilty of evading the payment of proper duty, and fined a total of $1.75 M. An order was made for the payment of the legal costs of those proceedings. 

25His Honour expressed the view that whilst this was not a criminal conviction, he could, nevertheless, have regard to the fact that the respondent had previously engaged in similar conduct. 

26With respect to the respondent's subjective case, his Honour noted that the respondent had indicated an intention to plead guilty to the charges at an early point in time and, accordingly, without submission to the contrary from the Crown, afforded the respondent a 25 per cent discount from any sentence for the utilitarian value of his early plea. 

27His Honour considered and rejected as being of no weight, matters relating to arguments of hardship and health advanced by the respondent. His Honour did not regard the respondent as a man of previous good character, however, he did accept that the respondent had engaged in good works dealing with refugees and others in Africa. His Honour found that this indicated a likelihood that the respondent would be successfully rehabilitated.

28Of particular importance was that the sentencing Judge had accepted that the respondent had shown remorse and contrition in a practical way by assisting authorities. His Honour described the fact that the respondent had given significant assistance to the authorities with respect to matters not directly related to the importations and payment of bribes, but to importation of tobacco generally. The respondent took part in a controlled operation - thereby exposing himself to considerable danger in so doing. His Honour noted that the respondent had offered to help in the future.

29His Honour concluded that it was appropriate to discount any sentence which he imposed by a total of 60 per cent to take account of the respondent's remorse and contrition, that he pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and facilitated the course of justice by providing information to bring serious offenders to justice. His Honour noted that this was above the level of discount usually granted.

30His Honour concluded that so far as the offences were concerned, it was necessary for the respondent to serve a full time jail sentence in order to adequately punish the respondent for his involvement in ""... a very serious crime"".

31His Honour assessed the seriousness of the criminality in this way: 

""There is no doubt that bribery of a Commonwealth official is a very serious crime, particularly when it is directed to getting the official to involve himself in an even more serious crime and the courts must be seen to be acting to deter such conduct.""

32His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentence, which I have set out above at [ REF _Ref397002817 \r \h 8]. In imposing the sentence, the sentencing Judge commenced with a notional head sentence of 8 years. He then proceeded to apply the discount of 60 per cent, which he had earlier determined was appropriate. The single non-parole period represented about 50 per cent of each of the head sentences.

Ground 1: Error in Complete Concurrence

33In his sentencing remarks, when considering the question of whether the sentences should be made wholly concurrent, his Honour said:

""It is appropriate in my opinion to make both sentences concurrent since the offences are linked.""

34The Director submitted that this statement constituted an error of principle because the mere linkage of two or more offences is not an appropriate or principled test for imposing wholly concurrent sentences. The Director submitted that even if this was a correct statement of principle, upon the facts and circumstances of this case, the application of such principle was erroneous.

35The Director submitted that the offences fell into two categories, there was a distinct difference in the criminality, the offences had separate conduct with a separate focus, and therefore the sentencing Judge should have concluded that it was not appropriate for the sentences to be wholly concurrent.

36The respondent submitted that the trial Judge made no error in making the sentences wholly concurrent. The respondent submitted that the difference relied upon by the Director to distinguish the offences, namely, whether the respondent was himself conducting the importation as a part of the syndicate, or else was engaged in the offence of bribery for the purposes of others to achieve a successful, but unlawful, importation of a container of tobacco, was an illusory difference. The respondent contends that having regard to the period of time over which the offences were committed, the similarity of the offences, the identities of the individuals involved in the offences, and that the offences were essentially a part of a single course of conduct, it was wholly within the discretion of the sentencing Judge to make the sentences concurrent.

37There is no general rule which determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. What is necessary is that the sentencing Judge applies the principle of totality of the criminality involved for which the offender is being punished: see Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] per Howie J; R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 165 A Crim R 481 at [13] per Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ.

38In R v Knight [1981] 26 SASR 573, the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia (Walters, Zelling and Williams JJ) said, in their joint judgment at p.576:

""... it seems to us that when regard is had to the totality of the sentences which the applicant is required to undergo, it cannot be said that in all the circumstances of the case, the imposition of a cumulative sentence was incommensurate with the gravity of the whole of his proven criminal conduct or with his due deserts. To use the language of Lord Parker LCJ in Reg v Faulkner (1972) 56 Cr App R 594 at 596:

'At the end of the day, as one always must, one looks at the totality and asks whether it was too much.' ""

39As the High Court recognised in Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59 at [8]:

""Where the principle [of totality] falls to be applied in relation to sentences of imprisonment imposed by a single sentencing court, an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred.""

40It can be seen that it is difficult to consider this ground separately from the fourth ground of appeal, namely that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 

41However, it is appropriate to note that whilst the two charges charged similar offences, there were, in my view, material factual differences between them, and subject to an appropriate consideration of the overall length of the sentence, those differences were such as to call for the sentences imposed to be cumulative rather than wholly concurrent. 

42However, as I have explained, the real issue, namely whether the sentence imposed reflected the totality of the criminality involved, is best considered with respect to Ground 4.

Ground 2: Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)

43The Director submits that the single non-parole period imposed of 1 year and 8 months in the particular circumstances demonstrated that the sentencing Judge imposed a non-parole period which failed to reflect the provisions of s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in that the sentencing which was passed was not one ""... of a severity appropriate in all of the circumstances of the offence"".

44The submission of the Director concentrates with respect to this ground on the non-parole period of the sentence, and is seemingly encapsulated in this way:

""The final result arrived at of a single non-parole sentence of 1 year and 8 months imprisonment as the period to be served by the respondent, was not a sentence of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances for the two discrete bribery offences. Given the grave offending involved, it is low enough to shock the public conscience.""

The last phrase seems to adopt the words used in the decision of this Court in R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 232 per Gleeson CJ. 

45Again, as this submission unfolds, it is clear that it is really to be regarded as a particular of the Director's argument raised in Ground 4, that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. It can be fully and conveniently considered under that ground.

Ground 3: Excessive Discount for Assistance

46As has earlier been indicated, the trial Judge allowed a discount of 60 per cent by way of recognition of the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty, and also in recognition of the assistance that the respondent gave to authorities. 

47Before the sentencing Judge, it was clear, and accepted by the prosecution, that the respondent had pleaded guilty at an early stage, had co-operated with the authorities and had promised to provide further assistance to the authorities in the future. 

48These were matters that the sentencing Judge was specifically required to take into account: s 16A(2) Crimes Act.

49The Director accepted that whilst there was no range of discounts set by statute, and the determination of what discount is appropriate is a matter within the proper exercise of a sentencing Judge's discretion, nevertheless, he submitted that a review of authorities suggested that discounts are customarily in the range between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, and any discount in excess of 50 per cent would be exceptional. 

50The Director drew attention to the judgment of this Court in SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249. In that case, Buddin J (with whom Simpson J agreed), said:

""53. However, in light of the authorities to which I have referred ... it is my opinion that a combined discount exceeding 50 per cent should be reserved for an exceptional case.""

51Earlier in the judgment, Howie J (with whom Simpson J also agreed), said:

""3. ... having reconsidered the matter I do not recant from my view that in general a combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance should be given and that such a discount should not normally exceed 50 per cent.""

52However, his Honour went on to make the following observations:

""5. But the notion of an irreducible minimum sentence that must inform the lower limit of the sentencing discretion is manifest in the often quoted decisions of this Court emphasising that at the conclusion of the exercise of the sentencing discretion, whatever be the subjective circumstances of the offender and whatever discounts are applied to achieve a recognised public policy, the sentence must bear a reasonable relationship with the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfil the manifold purposes of punishment: see e.g. R v Geddes (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; and R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. Sometimes it is said that the sentence must 'accord with the general moral sense of the community': R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. After taking into account the various statutory and common law principles and applying such discounts that arise on the particular facts, the sentencing judge is required to stand back and ask whether the resulting sentence is just and reasonable, not only to the offender but also to the community at large.""

53In SZ reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, where Latham J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Howie J agreed) said:

""The gravamen of the Crown's complaint on this appeal resides in the quantification of a composite discount of 45 per cent in order to take account of the respondent's plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities. ... While there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, discounts customarily range between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. There have been comparatively rare cases where a discount in the order of 55 per cent or 60 per cent has been given. Generally speaking however, a discount of 50 per cent is regarded as appropriate to assistance of a very high order. No doubt, that is in part a reflection of the principle that a discount for assistance must not produce a result which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender.""

54The Crown accepted that the assistance provided constituted a substantial mitigating factor and entitled the sentencing judge to reduce the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed. The Crown however submitted that the discount was excessive with the result that the sentence imposed fell below one which was required to denounce the crime.

55The respondent submitted that the Crown had conceded before the sentencing Judge that the assistance provided would be valued by the sentencing Judge as ""... being at the very high end of the range"". The respondent further submitted that the Crown had conceded that a discount of ""around about 50 per cent"" would be in order. As well, the respondent pointed to the remarks of the sentencing Judge with respect to assistance and submitted that having regard to all of those factors, it could not be said that a discount of 60 per cent was outside the range properly available as a matter of discretion to the sentencing Judge.

56It was submitted that the combined discount was reasonably proportionate to the criminality involved.

57In considering these competing submissions, it is necessary for the Court to consider the nature and extent of the assistance provided. I have done so. In my view, the concession made by the Crown described in [ REF _Ref397003163 \r \h 55] and [ REF _Ref397003164 \r \h 56] above, is an adequate, but short, description of the assistance provided. Any more detailed description in these reasons would be inappropriate and unnecessary.

58In my opinion, in all of the circumstances of this case, the early plea of guilty and the discount provided for assistance to the authorities did not warrant at 60 per cent discount. Such a discount is, in the circumstances of this case, excessive. The respondent's assistance, whilst it may be categorised as assistance of a high order, when combined with his early plea of guilty, merited no more than a discount of 50 per cent. 

59It was, in my view, an error on the part of the sentencing Judge to determine the discount in the amount which he did. 

60I would propose that this ground of appeal be upheld.

Ground 4: Manifest Inadequacy

61The Director argued that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate in all of the circumstances, and that it did not reflect the seriousness of the offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty. 

62The first two grounds of appeal are really to be seen as particulars of the complaint by the Director that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. As the Director's submissions put it:

""The sentences ultimately imposed on the respondent fall outside the range of sentences that could reasonably have been imposed, manifesting error either upon one or more of the bases outlined in the submissions in relation to the first three grounds of appeal which are also relied upon to explain the asserted manifest inadequacy of the sentences imposed, or some other error an otherwise unknown or unidentifiable kind in the exercise of the learned sentencing Judge's discretion.""

63Shortly put, the Director submitted that a sentence in which the respondent served only 1 year and 8 months as a non-parole term for the serious offences to which he pleaded guilty did not recognize the seriousness of the criminality involved, nor did it act as any form of deterrence for the respondent, or any others who may be tempted to engage in similar conduct.

64The Director accepted that whilst a discount was properly to be allowed as a result of the early plea and assistance given by the respondent to authorities, the Director submitted that the sentence which was imposed was one which: 

""is so far out of touch with the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender that ... it constitutes an affront to community standards"".

See R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 221 at 232 per Gleeson CJ (Meagher JA and Hunt J agreeing).

65In oral submissions, senior counsel for the respondent conceded that the sentence imposed may be described as being towards the lenient end of the range of appropriate sentences. However, he submitted that by reference to the starting point of the sentence before discount, it could not be said that where a judge commenced the consideration of an appropriate sentence at 80 per cent of the maximum term of imprisonment available, and proceeded conventionally to take into account and allow for factors which were both aggravating and mitigating circumstances, that the result ought be regarded as being outside the range of legitimately available sentences. 

66I am unable to agree with senior counsel for the respondent. 

67Whilst the process through which his Honour went, ensured that he took into account all of the relevant factors to which regard ought properly be had, and it can fairly be said that his starting point for a consideration of the offences was not at all unreasonable, I am left with the clear view that the point at which he ended up was so low as to fall outside the reasonable range of appropriate sentences. It was manifestly inadequate.

68Simply put, the respondent was a man with a history of engaging in the illegal importation of tobacco for the purpose of avoiding the appropriate duty and tax. He had been brought before this Court on one previous occasion, and been found to have committed an offence against the Customs Act. A significant monetary fine was imposed. 

69In the circumstances here, he set about a deliberate course of conduct, as a principal, of attempting to enrich himself by importing illegal tobacco in various forms, in large shipping containers facilitated by the bribing of customs officials and thereby intending to avoid the payment of customs duty. His only motivation was greed.

70He undertook these importations on more than one occasion. Indeed, he paid bribes on seven occasions. The total of the bribes involved was a significant monetary sum. They were many times the annual salary of a customs officer. But for the fact that the two customs officers with whom he engaged were decent, honest and law abiding officials who reported the approach immediately to their superiors, the pernicious nature of the offending may have gone undetected with a less than robust customs officer. Indeed, for some customs officers, entirely understandably, the lure of such riches would be hard to resist. 

71The seriousness of the offending cannot be understated. In response, the subjective case to which reference has been made, was important but not so compelling as to warrant anything less than a condign punishment. 

72A proper discount for assistance needed to be given, an excessive discount was given, and in order to ensure a sentence which reflected the seriousness of the offence, it was necessary that the sentences be accumulated. There was no accumulation applied. 

73In the end result the sentence is manifestly inadequate. I would propose that the appeal be upheld on this ground.

Residual Discretion

74It is well accepted that the primary purpose of appeals by the Crown, or here, the CDPP, against sentence under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, is to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons. This Court has in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D a residual discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence even though it is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2].

75However, in considering the exercise of the residual discretion, including in appeals dealing with Commonwealth offences, the Court is not to have regard to any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again: s 68A Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001; Green at [24]-[26]; Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1; (2012) 244 CLR 638.

76Hence, although as I am persuaded, the CDPP has established error with respect to the grounds of appeal, consideration needs to be given to whether, in the exercise of the residual discretion, the appeal ought nevertheless should be dismissed.

77I do not think that the Court should exercise its residual discretion in this case. The sentences which were imposed by the sentencing Judge, and in particular the single non-parole period, do not reflect proper attention to the seriousness of the offending, nor to the important role of general and specific deterrence in the circumstances of this case. In the result, in my opinion, the sentences imposed are so lenient that they are offensive to the administration of justice and this Court must intervene.

Re-sentencing

78It is necessary to re-sentence the respondent. 

79Enough has already been said in this judgment to indicate that the objective seriousness of the offences was high. The sums of money involved were large. The respondent knew precisely what he was doing and was motivated solely by greed. Due allowance must be given for the respondent's assistance to authorities and his early plea of guilty.

80The respondent is a mature man. He was educated to Year 10, leaving school to work in the family business. He worked as the manager for his family business, which was a large Mediterranean food importation company for about 15 years. He had up to 16 employees under his care and often worked six days a week. He had a very positive work ethic. 

81Since being arrested, and prior to his entry into custody, the respondent developed mental health issues and was placed on anti-depressants with psychological counselling for his well being. He attempted suicide in mid2012 by an overdose of medicine.

82Up until 2012, the respondent was married for about 12 years and is the father of four children aged between 2 and 12 years of age. In 2012, his marriage broke down. Since then he has, in the course of a relationship with another woman, fathered another child. Up until entering custody, he cared for his five children on weekends.

83He has a limited minor criminal history but, as I have said earlier, was dealt with by this Court in 2007 with respect to offences under s 233 and s 234 of the Customs Act, for which he was fined a total of about $1.75 M.

84There is no doubt the he has also done good works for a wide range of people. 

85In my view, it is appropriate to commence a consideration of the proper sentence for each offence with a notional head sentence of 8 years as the sentencing Judge did. 

86To those head sentences, I would apply a 50 per cent discount to recognise the respondent's early plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities. This would result in a head sentence of 4 years for each offence. 

87The appropriate non-parole period for each offence, to reflect all of the facts and circumstances which are properly to be taken into account, is 2 years and 6 months for each offence. 

88It is necessary to fix a single non-parole period: s 19AB Crimes Act.

89This necessarily requires the consideration of the question of accumulation or concurrence between the two offences. Unless the offences are accumulated, then the sentences would not reflect adequately the extent of the criminality involved. In my view, the period of accumulation should be 12 months. 

90This means that in respect of the first count on the indictment, I would impose a sentence of four years imprisonment to commence on 23 January 2014 and to expire on 22 January 2018. With respect to the second count on the indictment, I would impose a sentence of four years imprisonment to commence on 23 January 2015 and to expire on 22 January 2019.

91I would fix a single non-parole period for both offences of 3 years and 6 months, commencing 23 January 2014 and expiring 22 July 2017.

Orders

92I propose the following orders:

(a)Appeal allowed;

(b)Quash the sentences imposed by Finnane DCJ in the District Court on 23 January 2014;

(c)In respect of Count 1 on the Indictment, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for four years to commence on 23 January 2014 and to expire on 22 January 2018;

(d)In respect of Count 2 on the Indictment, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment for four years to commence on 23 January 2015 and to expire on 22 January 2019;

(e)A single non-parole period is fixed for both offences of 3 years and 6 months to commence on 23 January 2014, and expire on 22 July 2017.

		11 September 2014",2014-09-03 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704542,R v Ethan McKellar; R v Bevan McKellar [2014] NSWSC 1243,"Judgment

1R A HULME J: On 11 March 2014 Ethan McKellar and Bevan McKellar were arraigned along with Douglas Dennis and Luke Elwood on an indictment charging that on 1 May 2011 at Ashmont, a suburb of Wagga Wagga, they murdered John Gjedsted, wounded JG with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm, and assaulted John Gjedsted with intent to rob him whilst armed with an offensive weapon.

2On 9 April 2014 the jury returned with the following verdicts:

Ethan McKellar: Guilty of murder, wounding with intent, armed assault with intent to rob.

Bevan McKellar: Guilty of murder, wounding with intent, armed assault with intent to rob.

Douglas Dennis: Not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, not guilty of wounding with intent and of armed assault with intent to rob.

Luke Elwood: Not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, not guilty of wounding with intent, and guilty of armed assault with intent to rob.

3I am proceeding to sentence the offenders Ethan McKellar and Bevan McKellar before I have embarked upon hearing the case on sentence concerning the other two offenders. That is for reasons which are not presently known to me but I am assured that it is not material to the present proceedings. I trust it will become clearer when I embark upon the sentencing proceedings for the other offenders.

Facts

4Mr John Gjedsted was a 55 year old man who lived at xx Marshall Street Ashmont with his son JG who was aged 17 (who cannot be named because of his age). Mr John Gjedsted was a user of marijuana and sold small quantities. His son gave evidence that people would come to the front door and purchase ""a stick"" which was marijuana packed in foil for which they would pay $20. Bevan McKellar was a regular customer and there was evidence in the trial to the effect that a week or so prior to 1 May 2011 a dispute had arisen between Mr Gjedsted and Bevan McKellar which seems to have concerned the quantities that were being supplied. It culminated in Bevan McKellar tricking Mr Gjedsted by giving him money that was not legal tender. There was obviously ill-feeling between them as a result.

5On 1 May 2011 at about 6.10pm the four offenders attended xx Marshall Street. They had travelled together in a car driven by Douglas Dennis who parked the car some distance away. The Crown case was that the four went there with an intention to rob Mr Gjedsted. It was the case for each of the offenders that they were simply going there to purchase some marijuana. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that two weapons were brought with the men, namely a machete and a knife. The evidence as to the bringing of those items to the scene was not entirely clear, but it is clear from the events which took place at the scene that such weapons were brought. 

6Once they arrived at xx Marshall Street, Bevan McKellar and Douglas Dennis went to the front door while the other two offenders remained in the near vicinity. There was a knock on the door and when it was answered by John Gjedsted the offender Dennis asked him for a ""stick"". Soon after this, Bevan McKellar punched Mr Gjedsted to the ground. JG emerged from his bedroom and saw Bevan McKellar on the threshold before the latter turned and ran. John Gjedsted got up and pursued him and JG followed.

7JG saw his father trip and fall on the lawn near the unfenced border of the neighbouring property. Bevan McKellar kneed the prone deceased. JG ran up and punched Bevan who then pursued JG. Ethan McKellar joined the pursuit. Bevan McKellar shouted to Ethan, ""kill the cunt"". JG was then stabbed twice by Ethan McKellar.

8A machete was later found near to where Bevan McKellar had assaulted John Gjedsted on the lawn. It had the deceased's blood on the blade and Bevan's DNA material on the handle. How and when it might have been used is difficult to determine. In those circumstances, the significance of it is that it was brought to the scene, thereby supporting the proposition that the possibility of violence was foreseen.

9Items of Bevan McKellar's clothing were also found in the general area of the assault upon John Gjedsted on the lawn. This indicates that there was more of a struggle between the pair than was observed by JG. 

10After the stabbing of JG, Bevan and Ethan McKellar directed their attention to John Gjedsted who by this stage was on the ground near the front of the adjoining property. I infer that the other offenders had some interaction with him that resulted in his movement to that location. The four men surrounded Mr Gjedsted and he was on his hands and knees. The witness descriptions as what precisely occurred are not entirely reliable given the distance from where they were observing and the limited lighting conditions. However I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at least some of the four men were grabbing at Mr Gjedsted and kicking him. The assault culminated with Ethan McKellar stabbing Mr Gjedsted four times. JG saw his father being stabbed in the back and he yelled out, ""get off him"". The men then ran away.

11JG made his way back into the house and called triple 0. By that stage his father had made his way back inside the house and was sitting in the kitchen bleeding and obviously in a serious condition. Neighbours came to assist and the ambulance and police arrived shortly afterwards. Both John Gjedsted and JG were taken to hospital.

12Dr Cumberlege gave evidence of the ambulance arriving at the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital at 6.44pm. He examined John Gjedsted and found no sign of life. His preliminary examination indicated that the most likely cause of death was a stab wound to the chest. Dr Stephen Wills, forensic pathologist, conducted an autopsy on 3 May 2011. He described four sharp force injuries. The principal and fatal injury was described as being a large stab wound to the left side of the back of the chest, penetrating through two ribs and into the upper lobe of the left lung. There was a further stab wound in the middle of the back penetrating through a rib and entering the chest cavity but not injuring the underlying lung. A further shallow puncture type mark was found on the front on the left side of the chest and there was also a shallow incised wound on the under surface of the front of the chin. Dr Wills also described various areas of bruising and abrasions to other parts of the body. 

13Dr Cumberlege was involved in the treatment of JG. He said there were two stabs wounds: one was to the right armpit which was not actively bleeding. The other was to the back of the chest. Dr Cumberlege said that both wounds could have been fatal if the patient did not receive emergency treatment, the more so the wound to the back of the chest. Urgent surgery was carried out to repair the wounds.

14The issue about the identity of the person who stabbed John Gjedsted and his son was a live one at the trial. I have mentioned that in both cases it was Ethan McKellar and I am satisfied of this beyond reasonable doubt. I do not rely much upon the purported recognition by JG. The various accounts he gave to police and others varied in their consistency. 

15The verdicts of the jury confirm that it was the present two offenders who were involved in the assault upon JG. He described his two attackers as wearing a white hoodie and a black hoodie. He said it was the man in the black hoodie who had the knife and the man in the white hoodie who called out encouragement to, ""kill the cunt"". When he later saw his father being stabbed he was clear that it was the same man with the black hoodie. It was accepted that Bevan McKellar was wearing a light grey coloured hoodie. That leads inevitably to the conclusion that it must have been Ethan McKellar wearing a darker, probably black, hoodie who was the offender armed with the knife and who inflicted the stab wounds upon both JG and John Gjedsted. 

16It is clear that the responsibility for the wounding of JG arises in relation to Ethan McKellar because he was directly responsible. Bevan McKellar is responsible because he was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to rob John Gjedsted, he anticipated the possible intervention of a third party to prevent such a robbery occurring, and he realised the possibility that one of the participants in the enterprise might wound an intervening third party with the intention of causing grievous bodily harm. 

17Ethan McKellar is directly responsible for the murder of John Gjedsted. Bevan McKellar is responsible, in my view, because he was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise to assault Mr Gjedsted and` contemplated the possibility that one of the participants in the enterprise might intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. 

18The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) prescribes maximum penalties of imprisonment of life for murder; 25 years for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm; and 20 years for armed assault with intent to rob.

Personal circumstances of Ethan McKellar

19Ethan McKellar was born in 1992 and was aged 18 at the time of the offences and is now almost 22.

20A Juvenile Justice report prepared in November 2010 noted that Ethan McKellar was of Aboriginal descent and was born in Wagga Wagga to Ms Lillian McKellar. He had no contact with his father. He is the youngest of his mother's nine children (one of whom is deceased). His siblings had a different father. Some of them lived in Wagga Wagga and others in Bourke. Bevan McKellar is one of his brothers.

21He commenced his education in a primary school in Wagga Wagga where he underwent Kindergarten to Year 2 but then moved to live with his mother in Bourke. He returned to Wagga Wagga in May 2008 where he lived with his sister Jodie. His formal schooling progressed to Year 9 level. He commenced a numeracy and literacy program at Wagga Wagga TAFE in September 2008 but discontinued after he was hospitalised for a number of weeks because of injuries sustained in a household ""accident"". There seems to be some scepticism about whether it was in fact an accident; he had a history of being a victim of domestic violence. 

22In 2009 he commenced a horticultural course at TAFE but did not progress because of his unsatisfactory attendance, motivation and ability to follow directions. In 2010 he was working with an employment service agency and undertaking another TAFE numeracy and literacy course. 

23It was recorded that a police officer in Bourke had advised the juvenile justice officer that the home life for Ethan McKellar and his siblings in Bourke ""would have been nothing short of 'traumatic' with weekly drinking parties that have resulted in numerous incidents of intense violence"". The police were cautious about attending the home and the officer wondered what it must have been like for children being raised within it. He described Ethan McKellar having a compliant nature which was a ""defence mechanism that has enabled him to avoid conflict and violence"". He would generally shower at home but otherwise live on the streets to avoid being at home. Ethan McKellar told the Juvenile Justice officer that he was adamant he would not be returning to Bourke. 

24The Juvenile Justice officer noted that Ethan McKellar had a history of minimising his drug and alcohol abuse and had repeatedly indicated an unwillingness to engage in rehabilitation or counselling programs. However, when in custody in 2010 he had ""engaged extremely well"" with counselling services for such issues. However, he remained reticent in talking about his personal life and was still rejecting efforts to engage in counselling for psychological effects that may be attributed to his traumatic childhood.

25Ethan McKellar has a criminal history that commenced when he was 14 years of age. He told the Juvenile Justice officer that ""he offends when he is bored"". The offences for which he has been dealt with include larceny; damaging property; being carried in a stolen car; possessing a knife in public; possessing implements to break into or steal a car; and taking a car without the owner's consent. There are multiple entries for some of those offences. The most serious offences are ones of aggravated enter dwelling within intent (for which he received a 7 month custodial order at age 16); reckless wounding (14 month control order at age 18); and take and drive conveyance taken without its owner's consent (13 month control order at age 18). (Control orders were imposed because the matters were dealt with in the Children's Court as he was aged 17 at the time of committing the offences.)

26The period of parole for the last two of those matters ran from 21 January to 22 September 2011. Accordingly he was on parole at the time of the commission of the present offences which is a serious aggravating factor.

27The reckless wounding offence occurred in the early hours of the morning of 2 July 2010 after a party at which a large quantity of alcohol was consumed. The victim was the partner of Ethan McKellar's cousin. There had been an altercation involving Ethan McKellar and the victim which culminated in Ethan McKellar saying, ""I'll get you dog"". A short time later as the victim was about to get into a taxi to leave, Ethan McKellar approached him with a steak knife and stabbed him in the shoulder causing a 3cm wide 3cm deep wound.

28A psychological report under the hand of Dr Susan Pulman and Ms Amanda White was tendered. In addition to the matters already noted, it included that at school he was regularly involved with fighting, truancy and ""serious behavioural issues"". His academic work was poor although he said he was literate.

29He reported drinking alcohol now and again; daily cannabis use between ages 15 and 16 and sporadic use after he was released from juvenile custody in January 2011. He had experimented with other drugs.

30The authors noted an assessment by Dr Christopher Lennings, psychologist in May 2014 that Ethan McKellar had a moderately high risk of recidivism for a violent offence. 

31He was unable to articulate his feelings regarding the current offences. He did not like to think about them, or about the time he would spend away from his family as a result. 

32Psychometric testing revealed a level of intellectual functioning and memory at a very low level; the test results varied but some fell in the ""Extremely Low"" and ""Borderline"" ranges. Results of other tests concerned with executive or adaptive functioning (the capacity to regulate and control one's responses in accord with what is happening in a given situation) were inconsistent. Tests were also administered to provide an objective indication of level of effort and these revealed varying levels; some below those expected and others within normal limits. The report authors concluded that ""his results on current neuropsychological assessment may not be an accurate reflection of his true cognitive capacity and should be treated with caution"".

33The authors concluded that the results of formal testing did not support a diagnosis of intellectual disability. His true cognitive ability was most likely within the Low Average range. There was a possible diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. He was considered to have the capacity to engage in rehabilitation endeavours. He had the capacity to acquire new information and to reason effectively, although his abilities could be undermined by poor attention. 

34The report of Dr Lennings to which I have referred was prepared in May this year. He noted that Ethan McKellar was ""a particularly inarticulate young man who could provide little expansion in answer to questions"". The fact that the consultation was by way of AVL might have been inhibiting to some extent. In any event, he obtained a history that was limited in some respects but broadly the same as the other psychologists reported. He did tell Dr Lennings more about his use of drugs. He said that he was regularly and heavily using cannabis from the age of 15 until he went into custody. He had consumed both alcohol and cannabis on the evening of the offence. 

35A sense of hopelessness and lack of insight into his behaviour and psychological state was noted by Dr Lennings and it is a theme that seems to pervade all of the reports. Dr Lennings offered the opinion that Ethan McKellar's ""antisocial behaviour appears to reflect the multiple impacts of his local culture, his substance use and his low cognitive ability rather than an entrenched antisocial personality disorder"". One shortcoming in Dr Lennings' assessment that there was no evidence of psychopathy was that he understood there was an absence of violent behaviour prior to age 18; the offence of reckless wounding occurred when the offender was aged 17. 

36Dr Lennings' assessment of Ethan McKellar having a moderately high risk of recidivism for a violent offence (the assessment of which was by use of a process which was structured yet of moderate validity only he warned) was accompanied by his opinion that ""the most likely scenario involves him abusing drugs or alcohol (leading to disinhibition of behaviour), in the presence of anti-social peers (it needs to be recalled that Mr McKellar was the youngest and possibly least sophisticated of his peer group in the current offence and hence the presence of older and/or more sophisticated anti-social peers represents a critical risk factor for Mr McKellar) and without pro social routines to give Mr McKellar an incentive not to offend"". 

37Dr Lennings considered that to reduce the risk of recidivism there should be a post-prison rehabilitation plan that included substance abuse treatment, assistance with employment or structured pro-social leisure activities, and discouragement from formation of anti-social peer bonds. 

Personal circumstances of Bevan McKellar

38Bevan McKellar was born in 1983 and was aged 28 at the time of the offences.

39His criminal history commenced when he was aged 13. He has been dealt with for a variety of offences including receiving; break, enter and steal; entering inclosed lands; car theft; assault; assault occasioning actual bodily harm; malicious wounding; affray; contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order; intimidation; and larceny. There are multiple occurrences of some of those offences. He has been sentenced to full-time custody on quite a number of occasions. 

40His past response to parole has been blemished by revocation of parole on three occasions (2004, 2006 and 2009). He has spent the vast majority of the past 13 years in gaol. 

41Bevan McKellar was on bail in respect of a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm at the time of the commission of the present offences which is a serious aggravating factor. He received a 3 month prison term for that offence on 20 June 2012 and it was specified to take effect upon imposition. Accordingly, the period in which he has been in custody solely referable to the present offences is 3 months less than it otherwise would have been.

42Dr Olav Nielssen was engaged after the trial to prepare a report in respect of Bevan McKellar. In relation to his state of mind at the time of the offence he told Dr Nielssen, ""I was intoxicated ... I had a few beers with the boys and I'm drunk ... next thing I know I'm sitting in here"", meaning a prison cell. 

43He told Dr Nielssen that he could remember little of his schooling. He could ""read a little bit but it's not good"". He could perform basic arithmetic. He was good at sports. He left school relatively early. His subsequent employment experience was limited. 

44He began drinking alcohol when he was young and it had been a problem over the years. He told a nurse who wrote another report that I will mention shortly that, ""I was on the grog from about age 11 and was pretty well drunk most of the time when I was not in custody"". He gave up drinking alcohol upon his previous release from gaol (the records indicate this was probably in April 2010) and had not consumed any until the day of the offences. He began using cannabis at around age 12 or 13 and had smoked it most days of his adult life. He had also used methamphetamine, but only ""from time to time"".

45As to his family background, he told Dr Nielssen that he was the fifth of nine children, one of whom had passed away. His father died when he was young. His parents were from the Wangkumara tribal group from the far northwest of the State. He was born in Bourke and spent his early years there. The nurse's report includes that he had ""a sad dysfunction[al] childhood"" and that he reported ""domestic violence and years of physical and emotional abuse from his father ... and his elder brothers"". 

46Bevan McKellar sustained a head injury in a high impact motor bike accident in June 2006. Reports by a mental health clinical nurse consultant with the Statewide Community & Court Liaison Service dated 13 January 2011 and by an occupational therapist/outreach worker with the South West Brain Injury Rehabilitation Service dated 17 February 2011 were tendered. They indicate that while frontal lobe damage was suspected, he was transferred from Royal Prince Alfred Hospital to Dubbo Hospital but then discharged. There was no appropriate follow up involvement of a rehabilitation service. Testing indicated moderate memory impairment. He required reminders about attending appointments. Instructions given at the beginning of half an hour of conversation were not recalled by the end. 

47Another impairment assessed as consequent to the head injury was a difficulty in controlling his anger: ""He stated he has found that if pushed his frustration level becomes too great and he 'hits out'; this has, he stated, been difficult to control since his injury"". The author of the South West Brain Injury Rehabilitation Service report indicated that it would provide a variety of rehabilitation services to Mr McKellar. However, it was only 3 months later that he was arrested and held in custody for the present offences.

48Dr Nielssen discerned from his consultation with Bevan McKellar that there were signs of frontal lobe injury with significant memory impairment. He said, in part, ""he appeared blank and confused, and was slow to respond to questions and his verbal responses were vague in content and simple in form"". He noted that typical symptoms of frontal lobe injury involved impairment of emotional regulation, planning, social judgment and impulse control. There can also be increased susceptibility to the effects of alcohol. 

49Dr Nielssen made the following formal psychiatric diagnoses: Traumatic brain injury and Substance use disorder.

50Dr Nielssen concluded his report as follows: 

""Mr McKellar has a combination of disorders and a pattern of past behaviour that would predict further offending. He will require ongoing supervision and support after his release, to minimise the likelihood of resuming alcohol abuse and to help make up for the deficits in memory function and emotional regulation arising from his brain injury. However, it is not possible to predict Mr McKellar's individual circumstances, or the services that might be available when he falls due for release, and hence any estimate of future dangerousness can only be made in the most general terms.""

51It was submitted that I should find that there was a causal connection between Bevan McKellar's mental condition arising from his brain injury and the commission of the offences. I accept that difficulties with impulse control and particularly with control of anger are consequences of that injury. But a countervailing feature might be that he was aware of the potential for excessive drinking to adversely affect his behaviour. He told Dr Nielssen that his problem with drinking was ""the only reason I come to gaol"". However, it must also be accepted that his ability to maintain a resolve to be abstinent was rendered more difficult because of his reduced impulse control. 

52If there was a causal connection between Mr McKellar's mental condition and the commission of the offences it is indirect and somewhat tenuous. It is notable that he committed a number of offences of violence, likely influenced to a degree by intoxication, both before and after the accident in 2006. 

Some observations common to both offenders

53None of the statutory mitigating factors that are commonly addressed in sentencing judgments, such as remorse, good prospects of rehabilitation and the like, are present here. But the fact that both offenders have derived from a background attended by a significant degree of social disadvantage, characterised by drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence, is a highly relevant matter and must be taken into account. The negative circumstances of their upbringing have undoubtedly left a lifelong mark affecting their ability to mature, exercise judgment and learn from experience. This, coupled with the low intellectual and cognitive capacity of Ethan McKellar, and the consequences of the brain injury for Bevan McKellar, make them less suitable subjects to be made an example of to serve the need for general deterrence. Moderation of the need for specific deterrence is also called for.

Objective seriousness of the offences

Armed assault with intent to rob

54I accept that the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that both Ethan and Bevan McKellar were each aware of the presence of a weapon; that Mr Gjedsted was assaulted at the front door of his home; and that there was a joint purpose to rob him of, what most likely was anticipated to be, a modest quantity of cannabis. As noted in the submissions of Mr Young SC, there was no evidence of a weapon being produced at the time of that assault. 

55Generally speaking, that is without reference to individual culpability, this offence is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such an offence. Four men attended the victim's home where three of them were found by the jury to have intended a robbery. The jury must have been satisfied that those three were aware of the possession by one or the other of them of a machete and a knife. Their intention was to steal the victim's property. That there was a multiplicity of offenders and the location was the victim's home serve to elevate the seriousness of the offence. The roles of the offenders were indistinguishable in that it was an offence carried out with force of numbers. The role of Bevan McKellar is slightly greater in that he engaged in the assault upon the deceased at the front door.

Wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm

56Only the present offenders were found guilty of this offence. I have previously indicated my satisfaction that Ethan McKellar actually did the stabbing of JG but he did so with significant assent and encouragement from Bevan McKellar. He must have been aware that his younger brother had a lethal weapon that would permit his encouragement to ""kill the cunt"" to be carried out. Objectively, Ethan's culpability is more than Bevan's on the basis that he had, and used, the knife, but the difference is not great.

57I accept, however, that the offence was reactive to circumstances. However, the jury must have been satisfied that the offenders foresaw the possible need to deal with the potential intervention of a third party who might try to prevent the robbery. That was an element of the Crown's extended joint criminal enterprise case. The wounding of JG was undoubtedly serious but fortunately medical intervention averted more serious consequences. Given an offence against s 33 of the Crimes Act involves either wounding or the infliction of grievous bodily harm, and that grievous bodily harm can involve quite serious harm up to the level of catastrophic, I would assess this offence, in a general sense, as being below the middle of the range of objective seriousness; but it is certainly not anywhere near the bottom of the range.

Murder

58I accept the submission made by Mr Young that by the time of the events out the front of the neighbour's property, the initial intention to rob Mr Gjedsted had evaporated. I accept that what there occurred was more an expression of the offenders' displeasure at the resistance that had been shown by Mr Gjedsted and his son. The stabbing of Mr Gjedsted was not something that was planned but something that occurred relatively quickly. However, it was something that was done by Ethan McKellar with at least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm and the possible infliction of grievous bodily harm was something that Bevan McKellar foresaw as a possible occurrence in carrying out the joint assault.

59I do not accept the suggestion that this was in the nature of ""a robbery gone wrong"". I accept the Crown Prosecutor's submission that once a plan to rob became futile, the offenders had the option of leaving; but they remained and engaged in the pointless but murderous assault of Mr Gjedsted.

60I accept that it is a reasonable possibility, as Mr Young submitted, that the garments of Bevan McKellar that were found turned inside out on the ground at the scene of the final assault were indicative of a continuing struggle between him and the deceased there. How this may have related to the attack involving all of the offenders upon Mr Gjedsted is difficult to infer in the absence of any of them having given evidence about it. 

61Features that render this offence more serious than it otherwise might be include that it occurred in a robbery context (although I hasten to add I am conscious of the need to avoid double counting) and that there were multiple assailants. I assess the objective seriousness of the murder of Mr Gjedsted, in a general sense, as being in the middle of the range but the individual objective culpability of the two offenders is a little different. Ethan McKellar's culpability must be considered as greater than that of his brother on account of their different states of mind and that it was Ethan who actually drew the knife and used it.

Moral culpability 

62I have indicated my view of the objective seriousness of each of the offences which is, of course, an important aspect in the assessment of sentence. I have stressed, however, that I have done so ""in a general sense"". By that I mean I have put aside matters that are relevant to the moral culpability of the offenders. Matters that I have discussed when earlier reviewing their personal circumstances relating to their background of social disadvantage, their impaired mental functioning and, in the case of Ethan McKellar his young age and his immaturity, have the result that their moral culpability for the commission of these offences is less than it otherwise would be.

Victim impact statements

63Ms Jay Gjedsted and JG provided the Court with victim impact statements. They are very moving accounts of the unfathomable sadness and loss that they have suffered as a result of the brutal taking of their father's life. Neither mere words, nor the sentences I impose, can possibly assuage their grief. But it is important that the impact of the offenders' crimes upon the loved ones of their victim be recognised and never forgotten. Again, I extend my sincere condolences.

General matters relating to sentence 

64Each offender has been in custody since their arrest on 3 May 2011. It is appropriate to commence the sentences for Ethan McKellar from that date. In the case of Bevan McKellar I propose to commence his sentences from 3 August 2011 to allow for the 3 month sentence for an unrelated matter he served in 2012.

65I propose to accumulate the sentences partially in order to reflect the different nature of each of the offences and, particularly, that there were two victims. The degree of accumulation will be substantially moderated by the need to have regard to the totality principle.

66It was submitted that special circumstances could be found so as to warrant a longer than usual period on parole. I have considered those submissions but have determined that the usual period of parole will be more than sufficient to accommodate the needs of each offender for a variety of assistance in reintegrating into the community after release. I do propose, however, to make an adjustment so that the usual proportions are reflected in the overall sentence.

2704546,R v Azbaa [2014] NSWSC 1228,"Judgment


1HER HONOUR: On 6 September 2012, the deceased, Anil Herat, was attacked and killed by Dani Amine Azbaa in his home in Springwood where he lived with his wife and from where he conducted his business as a solicitor. Mr Herat was alone when he was killed. He was aged 55. 

2At 5.14pm that day Mr Herat placed a triple-0 call in which he was heard screaming for help. Mr Azbaa could be heard in the background. While most of what was said was inaudible, Mr Azbaa was heard to shout out certain disjointed phrases such as ""working for Sarkis brothers"" and ""Sarkis brothers"" several times. 

3The deceased's neighbour, John Gildea, was alerted to very loud voices which sounded like a man yelling at the top of his voice for approximately 10 to 15 seconds after which he heard the sound of smashing glass which sounded to him like a rock going through a window. He could not make out the words and did not recognise the voice. He could hear dogs barking at the time of the sustained yelling. At 5.14pm Mr Gildea also placed a triple-0 call. 

4The contents of both triple-0 calls are generally consistent with the account Mr Azbaa gave to police in his ERISP on his arrest the following day when he admitted attacking and killing Mr Herat. 

5Police arrived at Mr Herat's home at approximately 5.30pm where they found him lying on the floor in a rear bedroom. There was a large amount of blood on the floor and the bed. Police also identified a glass window at the front of the house that had been broken from the outside. Ambulance officers attended at 5.59pm. They pronounced that Mr Herat was deceased. 

6The results of autopsy revealed multiple stab wounds to the deceased's body. There were five stab wounds to the chest and abdomen and four to the back and buttocks. Three stab wounds penetrated the abdominal cavity through the abdominal wall. Approximately 500ml of blood was present in the abdominal cavity. The pathologist concluded that death would have been the consequence of blood loss due to stab wound(s) to the abdomen. 

7There were no eyewitnesses to the fatal attack. However, in the course of the investigation police were provided with information from a number of people to the effect that a male matching Mr Azbaa's description was observed in the Springwood area proximate to the time when Mr Herat was attacked and killed. CCTV footage from the Springwood railway station identifies Mr Azbaa leaving the Springwood train station at 4.28pm and walking in the direction of Mr Herat's home. The same footage also shows him returning to the train station at 6.45pm. 

Mr Azbaa's statements to witnesses prior to the murder

8A number of witness statements forming part of the compendium of documents tendered by consent at the trial assist in the reconstruction of Mr Azbaa's movements prior to the killing. They also provide some insight into his state of mind at that time. 

9On 5 September 2012 (the day before the killing) Mr Azbaa approached Dr Subramaniyan at her place of work in Parramatta in order to obtain Mr Herat's address. Dr Subramaniyan is the principal solicitor of Success Lawyers and Barristers with whom Mr Herat worked as a consultant. Mr Azbaa sought legal advice from Dr Subramaniyan's firm in relation to an unfair dismissal complaint. Although Dr Subramaniyan was present at all the conferences with Mr Azbaa and attended a meeting with the Fair Work Inspector with Mr Azbaa on one occasion, Mr Herat had carriage of the matter. She refused to supply Mr Herat's address but she did provide his phone number. Although Dr Subramaniyan spoke with Mr Herat the following day about an unrelated matter she did not mention Mr Azbaa's visit. 

10On the morning of 6 September 2012 (the day of the killing) a man described as carrying an Adidas backpack walked into the Hunter Street Eye Specialist apparently looking for someone. When the secretary asked him who he was looking for, the man repeated the name ""Herat"". When she said there was no one there by that name, the man said ""lawyers"" and something like ""they tricked"". She then realised that the man was looking for the lawyers who had previously occupied a suite in the building. The man declined her offer of the phone number of ""Herat's Solicitors"". Instead, he asked her, ""Where are they?"", and appeared to be in a state of high agitation. 

11While the secretary was unable to make out some of what the man was saying, she was able to discern certain words and phrases, including ""He's ruined our life"" or ""He's ruined my life"". He then made throat slitting gestures across his neck and said ""I want him"", ""I want to kill him"", ""I'm going to kill him"" and ""I want his home address"". He also frequently mentioned ""brother"". 

12Some time between 4pm and 5pm on 6 September 2012 a man described as carrying a dark backpack asked a pizza shop owner in Springwood for directions to the road on which Mr Herat resided. The shop owner gave the man directions. 

13At about 4.45pm on 6 September 2012 a man approached the receptionist at the Springwood Balance Family Medical Practice asking for directions to the road on which Mr Herat resided. She googled the road and printed out a map. The man thanked her and left. 

14Mr Azbaa's account to police is generally consistent with these accounts. He told police he asked Dr Subramaniyan for Mr Herat's address the day before he killed him but that he found Mr Herat's details online. He also told police that he asked someone at a Springwood restaurant for general directions to the road on which Mr Herat resided and that ""a lady secretary"" from a ""clinic"" printed him a map. 

15At about 6.15pm on 7 September 2012 (the day after the killing) Mr Azbaa approached the front desk of a club at Galston and asked the manager to ring the police for him. When asked what was wrong, Mr Azbaa replied, ""I've killed somebody with a knife and want to be arrested by the police and go to jail"". The manager rang Hornsby police and informed them of the situation. He then handed the phone to Mr Azbaa. Mr Azbaa said to the officer, ""I killed a man yesterday at Springwood and I need the police to come and get me and take me to jail"". He also said, ""I poured stuff over something in the city and I set it alight. Can you please send the police to get me, I want to go to jail"". 

16Police officers arrived at the club shortly thereafter. Mr Azbaa had a large knife in a sheath tucked into his trousers. This was removed and he was arrested without incident. He was wearing the same clothing, cap and boots that he was seen to be wearing in the CCTV footage the previous day. 

17Later that night, Mr Azbaa participated in an ERISP (assisted by an interpreter) during which he made admissions to having killed Mr Herat. He told police that he went to Springwood in order to kill the deceased and took a knife with him for that purpose. He told police he rang the doorbell of the deceased's home a number of times. When no one came to the door, he walked around the balcony of the house. Mr Herat saw him and opened the front door. A few words were exchanged before they started fighting, in the course of which punches were thrown. Mr Herat managed to push Mr Azbaa backwards and out the door which he then slammed shut. Mr Azbaa heard the deceased call triple-0 and say, ""He's going to kill me, he's going to burn the house"". Mr Azbaa then broke the front window with a pot plant, entered the house and attacked Mr Herat with the knife. 

18Mr Azbaa also told police that he knew that the deceased was dead. He said he then left the house and hid in nearby bushland before travelling by train to the city. He also told police that he attempted to set fire to the deceased's home. The evidence before me does not disclose whether there was any attempted arson.

19Mr Azbaa explained his motivation in calling the police as follows: 

A: 'Cause on the way I thought that I would just surrender myself to the police as I didn't want to do anything wrong. They put pressure on me and they made me do this. 

Q: Who's they?

A (Int): Anil Herat and Sarkis Brothers. 

20He also told police that he had intentionally left his Adidas backpack at the scene so that police would be able to identify him as the killer. 

21It is also clear that he believed, albeit wholly irrationally, that his actions were justified as revenge for what he believed to be the damage Mr Herat had caused to his name and reputation and because he believed, also wholly irrationally, that Mr Herat had ruined his life and his future in Australia. 

22When police asked him whether he had taken anything from Mr Herat's house when he left, he said:

A: No, I just had that envelope that had my papers in it the white envelope. Because I took all my paperwork with me so that if the police caught me there then I could show them my documents and know why I had killed him. 

...

Q: ... How, how did you feel after you left Mr Herat's house?

A (Int): Normal, very normal.

...

Q: Were you satisfied?

A (Int): Satisfied with that, yes. Because the last three years I have been because of the order that Anil Herat did I have been living on the streets. Haven't been able to work at all in Sydney.

...

Q: OK. After you killed Mr Herat, why didn't you get rid of your clothing?

A (Int): I don't want to get away or run away from the crime. I want them to know that it was me because they're the ones that killed... honour... going to put down my honour, my name. And they said that to all people and they told them that I was gay and I had no right in life. I want all the people to know that I killed Mr Herat and everyone know that I burnt down the Fair Work Ombudsman and still thinking about killing the Sarkis Brothers.

...

Q: But do you understand that the actions you have taken are illegal?

A (Int): I know... But I'm not going to go back to my country without taking my revenge.

23Mr Azbaa was formally charged with Mr Herat's murder at the conclusion of the ERISP in the early hours of 8 September 2012. He has been detained in the Mental Health Screening Unit at the Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre since his arrest. 

The trial

24With the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, and with leave granted under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), Mr Azbaa's trial was listed to proceed without a jury. On 26 August 2014 he was arraigned before me. He pleaded not guilty on the ground of mental illness as provided for in s 22(2) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (""the Act""). 

25The sole issue is whether Mr Azbaa has discharged the onus of establishing, on the probabilities, that he should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to s 38 of the Act. Section 38 provides that a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness must be returned if at the time of the offence the person was mentally ill so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her actions at the time the offence was committed. In R v Rodriguez [2010] NSWSC 198 at [33], Johnson J succinctly set out what is required to establish the defence of mental illness:

To establish the defence of mental illness, it must be proved upon the balance of probabilities that at the time of committing the acts causing death, the Accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from disease of the mind as not to know the nature and quality of his act, or if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. A person does not know what he was doing was wrong when he does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons, or when he cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing: R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190.

26Both the Crown and counsel for Mr Azbaa were in agreement that a special verdict on the basis of mental illness was available and should be returned in this case. 

27The defence of mental illness will be made out in this case if I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time Mr Azbaa stabbed the deceased he was suffering from a defect of reason because of mental illness such that he did not know that it was wrong to act as he did. Although I must be satisfied that Mr Azbaa's state of mind at the time he killed the deceased (a state of mind productive of a defect of reason and involving a disorder of the capacity to reason that the act was wrong) was one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from a condition, it is unnecessary that I make any finding as to whether the condition is temporary or longstanding, curable or incurable (see R v Pratt [2009] NSWSC 1108 at [19]). 

28In deciding whether a special verdict should be returned I am obliged to have regard to the legal and practical consequences of a finding that Mr Azbaa is not guilty of murder on the grounds of mental illness. I am not, however, required to decide whether the requisite intent for the offence of murder, that is, either an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, is proved (see R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 62 NSWLR 490). That question only arises if I do not find that the defence of mental illness is established. In this case, however, I have no reason to doubt Mr Azbaa intended to kill Mr Herat.

29A compendium of documents, including a crown case statement, witness statements and the reports of two forensic psychiatrists, was tendered by consent. Mr Azbaa was assessed by Dr Adam Martin at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 16 June 2014 and by Dr Olav Nielssen at the request of his legal representatives on 5 May 2014. 

30No oral evidence was called in the proceedings. 

Mr Azbaa's employment with Sarkis Brothers and his relationship with the deceased 

31Mr Azbaa was a stonemason from Lebanon who was sponsored on a work visa to come to Australia by a building company owned by Sarkis Brothers Pty Ltd. He arrived in Australia in May 2009. 

32George Sarkis is the director of Sarkis Brothers Pty Ltd. According to Mr Sarkis, Mr Azbaa displayed what he describes as ""unusual"" behaviour from January 2010 evidenced by mood swings and random displays of temper. Mr Azbaa also accused Mr Sarkis of forging his signature on immigration documents. Between February and March 2010 Mr Azbaa was frequently absent from work. Mr Sarkis attempted to have him resume work but, as he was unsuccessful, Mr Sarkis withdrew the company's sponsorship of Mr Azbaa's visa and notified the Department of Immigration. He cited Mr Azbaa's ""unsafe work practices"" as the reason he was dismissed. 

33Mr Azbaa complained to the Fair Work Ombudsman that he had been unfairly dismissed. Between May and September 2010 the Ombudsman dealt with the unfair dismissal complaint. 

34Mr Herat was retained to act for Mr Azbaa. Although the Ombudsman found that the Sarkis Brothers had unfairly dismissed Mr Azbaa and that he was entitled for a modest amount in compensation, he was not reinstated. That decision impacted on Mr Azbaa's right to remain in Australia since the work visa required him to be employed if he was to legally remain here. In this unsettled state, and because of what I am satisfied was his underlying mental illness, he apparently formed the irrational belief that Mr Herat was working in collaboration with the Sarkis Brothers and not on his behalf. He also apparently believed that Mr Herat and the Sarkis Brothers committed fraud and told lies about him so that no one else would employ him. In the ERISP he was asked why he was motivated to kill Mr Herat to which he said: 

A (Int) So when the order came out that I was unstable um, with the refugee and I didn't have any money to be able to appeal that because they had stopped my work. And I can't go back to my homeland in Lebanon because I have a problem with the um, Muslim Brotherhood.

Q: OK.

A (Int): With that all that they've done they've ruined my whole life and my future because they said that I was mentally unstable. So I can't get married to anyone and I can't work and I can't leave here and go to any other country.

...

A (Int): Immigration was also trying to um, get me out of the country. They were putting pressure on them. So that's why I became angry and wanted to get my revenge. I went down and I burned the Fair Work Ombudsman... I went down and I killed Anil Herat.

Mr Azbaa's recollection of events leading up to the murder provided to Dr Nielssen and Dr Martin

35Dr Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, assessed Mr Azbaa on 5 May 2014. He told Dr Nielssen that he was ""hearing voices all the time"". He said that the voices ""told [him] kill the guy... kill the lawyer... make fire"". When asked why he had to obey the voices, he said ""hearing voices say do it... I do it every time"". He told Dr Nielssen that Mr Herat was ""not the lawyer for me... he is the private lawyer for Sarkis brother"". He also said that he believed Mr Herat had made the decision to cancel his visa and also to cancel his case before the Fair Work Ombudsman. Mr Azbaa confirmed what he told police, namely that he asked for directions to Mr Herat's home and that he spoke with him prior to stabbing him. In addition to blaming Mr Herat for making decisions adverse to him, Dr Nielssen reported that Mr Azbaa was angry with the Fair Work Ombudsman. 

36Dr Martin, forensic psychiatrist, assessed Mr Azbaa on 16 June 2014. Mr Azbaa often responded to Dr Martin's questions by saying, ""I have hearing voices"" or words to that effect. With respect to the killing, Mr Azbaa said, ""I was hearing voices told me to kill the lawyer and schizophrenia"". He also told Dr Martin that Mr Herat had cancelled his visa on two occasions. When asked about his understanding of the moral wrongfulness of the killing, Mr Azbaa said, ""I can't make control - hearing voices make control for me"". 

Mr Azbaa's history as recounted to Dr Martin and Dr Nielssen

37Mr Azbaa was 37 years old at the time of his arrest. He has never married and has no children. He was born in Lebanon and is the oldest of six children, with two brothers and three sisters. One of his brothers has schizophrenia for which he receives treatment. Mr Azbaa's schooling was disrupted as result of the conflict in Lebanon. He began working with his father as a stonemason from the age of 18. In 2009 he came to Australia on a work visa. 

38Mr Azbaa told Dr Nielssen that he had been admitted to hospital in Beirut on about five occasions prior to coming to Australia for treatment for schizophrenia. He reported contact with mental health services for the first time as a child where he was first given medication after hearing voices. He said his first admission to hospital was at the age of eighteen. He reported that whenever he stopped taking his medication he would become unwell and would be readmitted to hospital. 

39He told Dr Nielssen that he began drinking alcohol around the age of 18 and said that alcohol ""make [him] sick and make [him] make trouble"". He began using cannabis around the same age and smoked that drug every day. Although he had been advised against smoking cannabis because of his mental illness, he believed it calmed him. He also reported occasionally used cocaine and methamphetamine. 

40At the time he left for Australia he was under doctor's advice to maintain his medication. He told Dr Nielssen that when he arrived he stopped taking his medication and that after a few months ""the voices came back"". By the time of the killing he said he was ""hearing voices all the time"". 

41He is currently taking prescribed antipsychotic medications consisting of 400ml of zuclopenthixol every two weeks, together with nightly doses of olanzapine and quetiapine. He is prescribed benztropine to manage the side effects of the antipsychotic medication. 

42Both Dr Nielssen and Dr Martin described Mr Azbaa's verbal responses on clinical assessment as brief and impoverished in content. Dr Nielssen described his movements as slow and his emotional responses as limited. He opined that Mr Azbaa's presentation was consistent with a chronic form of schizophrenia. 

43Dr Martin described Mr Azbaa as appearing preoccupied and guarded. He told Dr Martin that he was hearing voices telling him not to speak to Dr Martin in detail. This is consistent with the more comprehensive responses Mr Azbaa gave Dr Nielssen compared to those given to Dr Martin. There are, however, no material inconsistencies between the accounts given to the two forensic psychiatrists. 

Opinions of Dr Nielssen and Dr Martin 

44After his consultation with Mr Azbaa and upon a review of the Crown case statement and related material, Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr Azbaa as suffering from chronic, treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

45Dr Nielssen described schizophrenia as:

... a degenerative neurological condition affecting the brain, which produces a pattern of irrational beliefs, impairment in emotional regulation and in the capacity for logical thinking that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. 

46Dr Nielssen also diagnosed Mr Azbaa as suffering from a substance dependence and abuse disorder on the basis of his ""account of a pattern of hazardous alcohol use, and his use of cannabis and stimulant drugs known to be especially harmful in patients with schizophrenia"". 

47Dr Nielssen was of the ultimate opinion that:

... At the time of [the offence], Mr Azbaa was affected by a defect of reason in the form of the delusional belief that Mr Herat and the Fair Work Ombudsman had made malicious decisions against him to deprive him of his job and compensation. His behaviour, including the planning of the [offence], indicates that he was aware of the nature and quality of his actions. However I believe that at the time of [the offence] he was deprived of the ability to reason with sense or composure about the moral wrongfulness of his actions because of the effect of an acute exacerbation of his mental illness on his reasoning ability and the intrusive and overpowering effect of commanding auditory hallucinations.

48In effect, the acute exacerbation of Mr Azbaa's schizophrenia:

... produced an abnormality of mind that had a significant effect on his perception of events, his ability to judge right from wrong and his capacity to control his actions, which would allow him to raise the defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind to the charge of murder.

49Dr Martin was of the same opinion. He concluded that: 

...the history I obtained ..., together with findings on mental state examination and the available collateral information, strongly suggests that [Mr Azbaa] suffers a major mental illness, probably paranoid schizophrenia, associated with substance misuse (cannabis and alcohol) ...

...His account to the police, consistent with the other evidence made available, suggests strongly ... that he was motivated by anger and revenge, as a result of persecutory thoughts towards the victim and the ombudsman's office, and engaged in premeditated and organised violence, feeling morally justified in doing so, and having no concern in being caught by the police. In fact, he seems to infer that he wanted the police to know he killed so that his actions could be known, and he could somehow be vindicated, or have his honour avenged. 

50In short (Dr Martin went on to say): 

Based on the available information at the time of writing, the alleged actions appear to be goal-directed and deliberate, but... were [in fact] the product of disordered thinking and persecutory delusions as a result of having a major mental illness... it is likely that his paranoid beliefs caused rage and the desire for revenge, and impacted on his ability to understand the moral wrongfulness of his actions. 

51Dr Nielssen reported that Mr Azbaa will require lifelong psychiatric treatment. With respect to Mr Azbaa's ongoing care, Dr Martin said:

... In terms of future management, he appears to continue to have psychotic symptoms despite being on high dosage of two anti-psychotic medications, and it is probable that he would be considered ""treatment-resistant"" and ... require assertive treatment in a secure psychiatric facility such as the Forensic Hospital and probably would benefit from a trial of the anti-psychotic medication, Clozapine. 

52I fully endorse Dr Martin's recommendations. 

Conclusion 

53I well appreciate that these proceedings and my findings will do little to ameliorate the unimaginable grief, perhaps even disbelief, suffered by Mr Herat's family, friends and colleagues at his death in such violent circumstances. I particularly acknowledge the loss to his family of a much loved husband and father. I extend to them my personal sympathy and the sympathy on behalf of the Court. The legal profession has also lost a valued member. I accept that feelings of anger and frustration will likely surface from time to time but in our system of justice only the mentally competent are punished as criminal offenders. 

54I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time Mr Azbaa killed the deceased he was suffering from an acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia such that he did not know that it was wrong by acceptable community standards to act as he did in inflicting multiple stab wounds upon Mr Herat and, by that conduct, causing his death. 

Orders

55Accordingly, I make the following orders:

1. Pursuant to s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), I return a special verdict of not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness.

2. Pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), Dani Amine Azbaa is to be detained in a correctional facility or at such other place as determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

3. I direct that the Registrar notify the Minister for Health of these orders. 

4. I direct that the Registrar notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal of my verdict and of these orders. I also direct that the Registrar provide the Tribunal with a copy of these reasons and my orders and a copy of the exhibits tendered during the special hearing.

2704550,Dranmore Pty Ltd & Ors v Paul Bimson [2014] NSWSC 1230,"Judgment
1I apologise to the parties for the long delay in deciding this case.

2The plaintiffs seek alternative relief in their summons. First they seek judicial review of a decision of a magistrate in the Local Court of New South Wales at Parramatta made on 14th February 2013 refusing their application to dismiss the proceedings on grounds said to arise from Kirk v Industrial Court (NSW) [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 539. If that relief is refused they seek leave to appeal from the magistrate's decision pursuant to s 53(3) (b) Crimes (Appeal and Review) 2001 (NSW) (Review Act). The avenue of appeal created by that section is limited to ""a ground that involves a question of law alone"" and requires leave. The same grounds based on Kirk are invoked. The order which they seek leave to appeal from is not just the refusal of the application for dismissal but also the learned magistrate's refusal to order the provision of further particulars. 

Factual background

3There are eight plaintiffs. Five are transport companies based in Shepparton, Victoria (the corporate plaintiffs). The remaining three plaintiffs are directors of those companies (the director plaintiffs). On 9th May 2012, all eight plaintiffs were charged with 237 offences in aggregate by way of Court Attendance Notices (CANs) filed in the registry of the Local Court. The CANs named the defendant to these proceedings, Paul Bimson (an officer of Roads and Maritime Services), as prosecutor.

4Of the 237 charges eight are ""chain of responsibility"" speeding offences. Four of them are brought against Road Master Driving Tutorial Pty Ltd under s 69C Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW) (repealed), and another four against a Mr Frederick Borg, a director of that company under s 178 Road Transport (General) Act 2005 (NSW). It is not necessary to say much about these matters because after the commencement of proceedings in this Court, and on 13th April 2013, the defendant chose to amplify the particulars previously provided by giving the geographical co-ordinates of the location of the device by which the primary speeding offence committed by the truck driver was detected. Dr Martin, for the plaintiff seemed to accept that the provision of that additional information answered his complaint and for that reason did not address me further on those matters. He maintained these offences may remain relevant in due course to questions of costs.

5Mr Higgins for the defendant did not concede that the defendant was legally obliged to provide the additional particulars because that information did not go to an element of the offence. The defendant simply volunteered to provide additional information to assist the plaintiffs.

6S 69C(3)(b) provides a defence if a person charged proves that the speeding offence was caused by the effect of gravity on a vehicle fitted with a speed limiter (my paraphrase).

7The legal obligation to provide particulars cast upon a prosecutor in criminal proceedings may extend to providing particulars necessary to enable the person charged to decide whether a recognised defence of the charge may be available: Kirk at 558 [27]; Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 483 - 484 by Dixon J. Although Counsel did not argue this point extensively, it seems to me that the particulars provided on the 13th of April 2013 fell into this category. They were necessary, and should not be viewed simply as an act of grace on the part of the prosecution. 

8The claims for relief in respect of these eight charges was not pressed and I will say nothing further about them. To the extent to which the circumstances may give rise to a special order as to costs, I will give the parties an opportunity to address further submissions. At this stage I would simply observe they represent a very small, albeit discreet proportion of the charges and appear to have absorbed little of the forensic endeavours of the parties.

9The remaining offences are summarised in the table appearing below. I have drawn this table from the written submissions of Counsel for the defendant. It appears to be an accurate summary so far as it goes.

Total Roadmaster Driving Tutorial Pty Ltd: 79 offences

Total offences now relevant: 229

10As can be seen from the table the remaining charges against the corporate plaintiff's arise under Cl 156(3) Road Transport (General) Regulation 2005 (NSW) (Repealed) (the Regulation) as against the director plaintiffs the charges are brought under s 178(1) Road Transport (General Act) 2005 (NSW) (the Act).

11Clause 156 is found in sub-division (1) of division 2 of Part 7 of the Regulation. Part 7 is headed ""Heavy vehicle speeding compliance""; Division 2 is headed ""Specific duties and offences""; and Sub-division 1 is headed ""duties on employers, prime contractors and operators"". It is not in dispute that Cl 156 applies to the corporate plaintiffs, because at the material time, they were each the operator of a heavy vehicle, and at the time the driver was making the journey for one of them. It is not in dispute that each of the vehicles concerned was a heavy vehicle and that each corporate plaintiff fell within the definition of operator in cl 152 of the Regulation. The parts of Cl 156 material to the present dispute are in the following terms:

156 Duty to ensure offences are not committed

(3) A person to whom this clause applies commits an offence if, at any time the driver of the vehicle, or a vehicle is subject to the person's control, the driver commits a speeding offence while driving the vehicle.

..................

(6) It is an offence under this clause if the accused person establishes that:

(a) The person did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known, of the conduct that constituted the offence, and;

(b) Either:

(i) The person took all reasonable steps to prevent that conduct from occurring, or

(ii) There were no steps that the person could reasonably have been expected to have taken to prevent that conduct from occurring.
.......................
I have included the heading notwithstanding s 35 Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), because it is has relevance to the argument advanced by the plaintiffs.

12By cl 156(7) whether the driver has been charged is irrelevant, but if he or she has, evidence of a conviction or payment of an infringement penalty is evidence of the time, place and circumstances of the offence committed by the driver referred in cl 156(3). 

13Section 178 is in chapter 5 of the Act. Chapter 5 is headed ""Enforcement of Road Transport Legislation"". Part 5.1 containing s 178 is headed ""Liability for Offences"". The provisions of s 178 material to the present case are as follows:

178 Liability of Directors, partners, employers and others for offences by bodies corporate, partnerships, associations and employees

(1) If a body corporate commits an offence under the Road Transport Legislation, each director of the body corporate, and each person concerned in the management of the body corporate, is taken to have committed the offence and is punishable accordingly

...................

(5) This section does not affect the liability of the person who actually committed the offence.

(6) A person may be proceeded against and found guilty of an offence arising under this section whether or not the body corporate or other person who actually committed the offence has been proceeded against or been found guilty of the offence.

(7) It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence arising under subsection (1) if the defendant establishes that:

(a) The defendant was not in the position to influence the conduct of the body corporate in relation to the actual offence, or 

(b) The defendant, being in such a position, took reasonable precautions and exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the actual offence.

....................

Proceedings below

14The prosecutions in the Local Court were commenced by CANs issued on 9th May 2012. A dispute arose about the adequacy of the particulars provided. The essential dispute between the parties was whether, for the purpose of cl 156(3) of the Regulation, and s 178(1) of the Act, it was for the prosecution to specify what reasonable steps, in the case of the regulation, and what reasonable precaution and due diligence, in the case of the Act the accused person should or could have taken to prevent the occurrence of the primary offence. 

15By an undated Notice of Motion (but apparently filed on 10th January 2013) returnable on 14th January 2013 seeking, so far as is presently relevant, an order that the prosecution provide the particulars the plaintiffs maintain are due, a self executing order dismissing the proceedings if the prosecution failed to comply with an order for particulars, ""and alternatively"", the dismissal of all charges as incompetent. 

16I interpolate that the defendant argues that the Local Court application was incompetent because the form used was headed in a manner appropriate to civil proceedings. This may be inferred from its reference to s 45 Local Court Act 2007 (NSW) and Part 4 Local Court Rules 2009 (NSW) which do not apply to criminal proceedings. However, the details of application provided in that form expressly invoked s 175(3)(b) Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The use of an inappropriate form was a mere irregularity; at best a defect in form.

17Section 44 Local Court Act makes it clear that s 45 does not apply to criminal proceedings. This may be so, but the Local Court had undoubted power to order the provision of particulars on the application of an accused person: De Romanis v Sibraa (1977) 2 NSWLR 264 at 291-92; Ex parte N Ormsby & Sons Pty Ltd; Re Mason (1964) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 286 at 290 - 1 (see [43] below). I do not regard the use of a form which may have been inappropriate renders a decision based upon it as unamenable to the provisions of s 53 of the Review Act (cf s 80 Interpretation Act).

18In my view the learned Magistrate was correct to decide that he had the power to determine the interlocutory application. 

Decision below 

19His Honour decided the central question about whether Kirk required the disputed particulars to be provided in the following terms (Transcript 14th February 2013 page 11.15 - .45; ):

But the central question, the decision is whether or not the High Court's decision in Kirk is applicable to these ... prosecutions and if it were, I think, as (Counsel for the plaintiff) has summed up I would be in the position where I might be obliged to dismiss them all. I must say that it is my conclusion that the High Court's judgment in Kirk so far as prosecutions clause 156 of the Regulation ... is concerned I think that the Kirk decision is irrelevant. I think the provisions examined by the High Court in that case were sections imposing a duty on employers to ensure that persons in employment were (not) exposed to particular risks (arising) from their employment. And failure to comply with that obligation is what constitutes an offence.

The legislation that founds these prosecutions is to my mind an entirely different structure. Clause 156 ... impose(s) criminal liability on a person who while not the actual driver is a person who is (in) control of the vehicle or person responsible for the vehicle, when the actual driver of the vehicle commits a speeding offences ... they due not speak of duties. They impose strict liability on persons responsible for speeding vehicles and they provide statutory defences which are in broader terms than the Proudman v Dayman style of approach to defending strict liability offences. Strict liability offences are the way in which the road transport legislation manages obligations or the (Roads and Maritime Services) does through that legislation. There is nothing unfamiliar about it, and were I to suggest that in this case there was an obligation to provide a brief of evidence of the type described then all the strict liability offences would be similarly susceptible to people coming along and saying ""I don't know enough about it"". Alright there is a reference in earlier sections to duties, but the section itself is to my mind plain. It is in strict terms and as I have said I do not think the decision in Kirk is relevant. And as it has no application and the defence to my mind has not established any broader case to suggest an injustice being visited upon them, certainly not as a result of RMS intransigence. (My emphasis)
...

After further the argument the learned magistrate gave some additional reasons (31.40-33.20T) including the following:

A whole range of aspects (of Roads and Transport Legislation) are obviously deliberately designed to place the onus of proof for certain issues upon the defendant rather than being matters which a prosecutor has to disprove in the course of dealing with the proofs before the court. The proofs required for both Clause 156 and s 69C are pretty straight forward, they are not complex, they do not call for any expert evidence that I can see. As to what the requisitioning of materials from the defendants means I can only speculate. 

...

As I say I do not necessarily think for my own instincts it is a fair thing, but it's quite plain that legislature expects that the community will be content with the onus being shifted in some instances to a defendant to prove its innocence and this is increasingly the way in which legislation is constructed. That being so I really cannot see that it is reasonable in these circumstances for me to order any kind of special brief of evidence or other orders for production of material against the RMS.

His Honour then pronounced the following order:

In the circumstances the notice of motion is refused.


20The plaintiffs do not cavil with the order refusing their application for the provision of a brief of evidence. And, it is common ground that these passages represent his Honour's reasons for declining either to dismiss the CANs as defective or to order further particulars: the refusal of the motion covers both.

21Section 178 of the Act is not referred to in his Honour's reasons, presumably because so far as the remaining dispute is concerned, cl 156 of the Regulation is the main battleground. If there is no corporate liability under cl 156, there is no personal liability in a director under s 178. 

The issues in this court

22The plaintiffs sought to have the CANs ""quashed as insufficient in law and invalid as non-compliant with s 175(3)(a) and (b) Criminal Procedure Act"" because they did not particularise the reasonable steps the corporate plaintiffs failed to take to prevent the primary offence occurring. A similar position was taken in relation to the failure to particularise the necessary, available reasonable precautions for the purpose of s 178 of the Act.

23Secondly, and in the alternative, the plaintiffs argue that leave should be granted to appeal from the learned magistrate's decision because he misinterpreted Cl 156 of the Regulation by deciding that the reasoning in Kirk did not apply to the interpretation of Cl 156 or, for that matter, s 178. This error of interpretation is ""a question of law alone"", undermining the magistrates interlocutory order refusing further particulars.

The arguments of the parties

24S 175(3) Criminal Procedure Act is in the following terms:

(3) A court attendance notice must do the following:
(a) describe the offence,
(b) briefly state the particulars of the alleged offence,
(c) contain the name of the prosecutor,
(d) require the accused person to appear before the court at a specified date, time and place, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail,
(e) state, unless a warrant is issued for the arrest of the person or the person is refused bail, that failure to appear may result in the arrest of the person or in the matter being dealt with in the absence of the person.

25The common law rule which informs the meaning of s 175(3)(a) and (b) is that a defendant is entitled to be told not only the legal nature of the offence with which he or she is charged, but also the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. In support of this submission, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed to Johnson v Miller at 489 per Dixon J, and Kirk at [26], where the plurality said the following:

The common law requires that a defendant is entitled to be told not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he or she is charged, but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. In John L Pty Ltd v A-G (NSW), it was explained that the older cases established that an information could be quashed as insufficient in law if it failed to inform the justices of both the nature of the offence and the manner in which it had been committed. In more recent times the rationale of that requirement has been seen as lying in the necessity of informing the court of the identity of the offence with which it is required to deal and in providing the accused with the substance of the charge which he or she is called upon to meet. The common law requirement is that an information, or an application containing a statement of offences, ""must at the least condescend to identifying the essential factual ingredients of the actual offence"". These facts need not be as extensive as those which a defendant might obtain on an application for particulars. In Johnson v Miller, Dixon J considered that an information must specify ""the time, place and manner of the defendant's acts or omissions"". McTiernan J referred to the requirements of ""fair information and reasonable particularity as to the nature of the offence charged"". (Footnotes omitted)

26Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this appeal is analogous to Kirk, and relied upon what he submitted were relevant similarities between the legislative regime applicable in Kirk and the legislation in the present proceedings. 

27In Kirk, the appellant was charged with contraventions of the duties imposed upon employers by ss 15 and 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (NSW) (Repealed) (OHS Act). The plaintiffs submit that these sections are analogous to clauses 155 and 156 of the Regulations because each describes offences by reference to duties. The plaintiffs pointed to the fact the clauses appear in the Regulation as part of Part 7 regarding heavy vehicle speeding compliance, the object of which is set out at cl 151(1):

...to improve road safety and compliance with road safety laws by imposing responsibility in relation to speeding by heavy vehicles on those whose business activities influence the conduct of the drivers of those vehicles.

28By its inclusion in Part 7, the plaintiffs submitted that cl 156 is directed towards identifying all reasonable steps that could have been taken to prevent the prohibited conduct, and whether or not those steps could be expected to have been taken. The plaintiff submits that, as in Kirk, proceedings for the charged offences in this case are to be dealt with summarily according to s 180(1) of the Act. The plaintiffs further submit that while in Kirk defences were available where the measures were not reasonably practicable or where the offence was due to causes over which the person had no control, in this case defences are available to the operators under cl 156(6) (see [11] above). They submit that while the burden of proof lies with the person charged, liability is not strict or absolute. Reference was also made to the defence available under s 178(7) of the Act in support of the submission that, in accordance with Kirk, it is not necessary and is unduly burdensome for a person charged to establish every possible risk has been obviated, rather it should answer only acts or omissions specified in the statement of charges. The plaintiffs submit that, in a manner similar to Kirk, the charges alleged against them say nothing about what should have been done, and do not identify the deficiency in any system adopted or measure taken. The absence of particulars of this kind means that the corporate and director plaintiffs are denied an opportunity to properly put a defence. 

29The plaintiffs submit that by failing to appreciate that no act or omission on the part of the plaintiffs had been charged the learned magistrate committed error: Kirk at [37]. They submit that as the error appears as part of the reasons it is an error of law on the face of the record. The plaintiff also submits that the errors can be identified as jurisdictional error of the third kind identified by the High Court in Craig v State of South Australia [1995] HCA 58; 184 CLR 163; i.e, misconstruction of a statute causing the court to misapprehend the limits of its functions and powers. The plaintiffs seek prerogative relief in the nature of certiorari to correct these errors.

30The plaintiffs submit that if these propositions are established two further consequences flow. First, if the CANs are invalid then the proceedings against the corporate plaintiffs founded on them are likewise invalid, and accordingly the defendant would not be in a position to commence or maintain prosecutions against the director plaintiffs under the Act, as those offences are predicated on a conviction having been recorded against the corporate plaintiffs under the Regulation. Secondly, as the offences with which the plaintiffs are charged must be dealt with summarily within one year of the date of the alleged offence (s 181 of the Act), the defendant having failed to commence proceedings validly within that time limit is now statute barred from bringing proceedings, either by amendment or issuing fresh CANs. The defendant has never sought to amend and should not be permitted to do so now.


31The defendant submits that no claim for relief arises under s53(3)(b) Review Act as the true nature of the applications in the court below were not interlocutory, but rather were final orders seeking the dismissal of the CANs. The defendant submitted that in determining whether a claim for relief arises under the Act it is necessary to look at the nature of the applications and their strict legal effect: Sanofi v Parke Davis Pty Ltd (No 1) (1982) 149 CLR 147 at 152; Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd (No 1) (1980) 147 CLR 35. It was submitted that although the orders sought by the plaintiffs included both orders for the provision of particulars and other interlocutory matters, the strict legal effect of the applications was to have the CANs dismissed for non-compliance with s175(3) Criminal Procedure Act. If this characterisation were accepted it would not be appropriate to grant relief under s53(3)(b). 

32As to the merits of the matter the defendant submitted that the court below properly construed cl 156(3) of the Regulation as not requiring the defendant to particularise an act or omission said to constitute, for instance, a failure to take all reasonable steps and accordingly no error of law was committed. Counsel for the defendant also submitted that it had adequately particularised each of the offences contrary to cl 156(3) both in the CANs themselves, and in letters to the plaintiffs solicitors dated 24 September 2012 and 23 April 2013. 

33The defendant submits that even if the cl 156(3) offences were not adequately particularised in the CANs, particularisation need not occur at the time the charge was first brought: Area Concrete Pumping Pty Ltd v Childs (Workcover) [2012] NSWCA 208 at [45]. It submits that Kirk is not authority for the proposition that a failure to adequately particularise the charge as initially laid necessarily results in the charge being rejected. Rather, in its submission, a failure to adequately particularise a charge will not, without more, render it a nullity. Having regard to the provisions of s16(2) Criminal Procedure Act, defects can be cured by amendment to the charges, or subsequent particularisation, provided the charges disclose an offence known to law and procedural unfairness is not caused to the plaintiffs by such amendment. 

34The defendant submits that Kirk is distinguishable. There are relevant differences in the offence provisions in that case when compared to those applicable in the present proceedings. In particular, the defendant submits that the relevant offence provision in Kirk was the contravention of statutory duties of employers to, inter alia, take such steps as are necessary to obviate an identifiable risk to employees in the workplace. He points out by way of comparision that cl 155, a contravention of which is not alleged against the plaintiff, imposes a duty on an operator to take all reasonable steps to ensure business practices will not cause a driver to exceed the speed limit. By contrast, the liability of an operator under cl 156(3) arises when one of its drivers commits a speeding offence. He submits that the offence provision does not include a failure to implement a system or business practice, or a failure to avoid a risk. The defendant submits that cl 156(6) provides a statutory defence, the legal burden for the establishment of which lies with the defence. He submits that, in contradistinction with Kirk, a duty to take 'reasonable steps' is not a part of the offence provision. The absence of any such duty as part of the offence provision in cl 156 distinguishes the offence provision from cl 155 and the provisions the subject of Kirk. It is submitted that the existence of a statutory defence does not necessitate its particularisation by the prosecution as part of the charge. 

Western Freight Management Pty Ltd v Roads & Maritime Services NSW

35Whilst my decision was reserved, Davies J ([2013] NSWSC 1123; 64 MVR 415) and the Court of Appeal ([2014] NSWCA 132; 66 MVR 279) decided the Western Freight Management case by rejecting the applicability of the reasoning in Kirk to ss 56 and 87 of the Act, which have an interrelated operation.

36Both parties sought leave to make further submissions concerning the applicability of the Western Freight Management decision to the current case, albeit that Western Freight was concerned with different provisions. I granted leave on 19th May 2014.

37The plaintiff argued that the decision was distinguishable because ss 56 and 87 were separate provisions. One created an offence and the other provided a defence. Neither was predicated upon a duty to ensure steps were taken. This sufficiently distinguished them from cl 156 of the Regulation which was, as the heading to the Section demonstrated, concerned with a duty to ensure offences are not committed. This put that provision into the same category as Kirk.

38The defendant argued that the provisions were indistinguishable and the interpretation adopted in Western Freight Management was equally applicable to the provisions with which this case is concerned. The defendant pointed out that the heading was not part of the Act (s 35 Interpretation Act); and s 34 of the Interpretation Act did not apply because the meaning of the provisions was plain: there is no doubt about the ascertainment of their meaning; and they are not ambiguous, obscure, manifestly absurd or unreasonable. In truth, the defendant argued, the provisions in dispute before me were on all fours with the provisions, the subject of the decision of the Court of Appeal, by which I am bound.

Determination

39Both issues are interrelated because in the end, whether the CANs are valid on the one hand, or whether further particulars should have been ordered on the other, depends, at least in part, upon identification of the essential elements of the statutory offence. This, of course, is a question of statutory interpretation.

40The cases seem to admit a distinction between the sufficiency of the particularisation of the offence and the manner of committing it which must appear on the face of the CAN, and the entitlement to an order for the provision of further particulars: see De Romanis at 291-2; approved in John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508 at 519 - 20. This distinction is recognised in Kirk at [26] as set out above. As John L makes clear it is essential that the CAN provide ""the accused with the substance of the charge which he is called upon to meet"". Moreover, in Kirk at [27] legally sufficient particulars required identification of the specific act or omission relied upon as constituting a breach of ss 15(1) and 16(1) OHS Act. This was necessary to put the accused persons in a position to know whether a defence under s 53 of that Act was available: Kirk at [27] and [28]. Section 11 of the Criminal Procedure Act ""does not dispense with the necessity of specifying the time, place and manner of the defendant's acts or omissions"": Johnson v Miller at 486. 

41The start of the plaintiffs' case on the first issue is a point not decided in ""Kirk"". At [30] the Court observed that no application was made for an order quashing the orders of the Industrial Court requiring the accused person ""to appear to answer the offences charged "". It was ""neither necessary nor appropriate"" for their Honours to answer that question in those circumstances. But their Honours said ""the matter should not have proceeded without further particularisation of the Acts and omissions said to found the charges"".

42All of the proceedings in the present case were commenced in accordance with s 172 of the Criminal Procedure Act ""by the issue and filing of a Court Attendance Notice"". Under s 175(3)(d) a CAN ""must ... require the accused person to appear before the Court at a specified date, time and place"". The plaintiffs say that the question not decided in Kirk arises for determination in this case. This is not a matter which is free from authority binding on me. The Court of Appeal has twice considered the question. In GPI (General) Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2011] NSWCA 157; 207 IR 93, and in Area Concrete Pumping Pty Ltd v Childs (WorkCover) [2012] NSWCA 208. In the latter case the Chief Justice reviewed GPI (General) and other authorities, and concluded at [47]:

In these circumstances GPI (General), in my opinion, is authority for the proposition that a failure to adequately particularise a charge will not without more render it a nullity and that having regard to the provisions of s 16(2) of the CP Act and s 170(3) of the IR Act, defects can be cured by amendment to the charge or subsequent particularisation, at least provided the charge describes an offence known to law and that procedural unfairness is not caused to the defendant by the amendment.

Section 170 empowered the Industrial Court to allow an amendment. Sections 21 and 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act permit amendment of an indictment if the Court is of an opinion it can be done without injustice. An indictment for the purpose of ss 21 and 22 includes a CAN. There is no suggestion here that the offences with which the plaintiffs are charged are not ""known to law"". Before considering the question of procedural unfairness, it is appropriate to say something more about GPI (General). 

43Hodgson JA at [33] made the point, as recognised by the Chief Justice in Area Concrete, that in Kirk the High Court did not rule that ""particularisation had to occur at the time the charge was first brought"". His Honour also pointed out that although in John L the majority seemed to hold that the lack of particularity in a charge as first brought was fatal, the statutory regime there did not include provisions in the nature of ss 11 and 16(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act. His Honour also referred to Johnson v Miller at 490 where Dixon J said:

There is more than one means by which the occurrence or transaction, the subject of the charge, may be identified and distinguished from other occurrences or transactions alleged to have occurred, equally capable of supporting the complaint. A direction may be given that particulars should be furnished; the complainant may be required to elect among the instances or transactions he proposes to prove, and to state definitely to the court which of them is to be treated as the subject of the complaint; or the complaint may be amended so as to indicate one to the exclusion of the others. Although no statutory provision exists enabling courts of summary jurisdiction to require the furnishing of particulars, it is well recognised that they may do so if, as sometimes but probably not often happens, the interests of justice make it necessary (Citations omitted)

At 497 - 8 Evatt J expressed the view that even absent express statutory power, courts of summary jurisdiction had authority to order further particulars to be furnished. McTiernan J was of the same view (see 501). Subject to considerations of natural justice as referred to by the Chief Justice in Area Concreting, and even assuming for the moment that it was incumbent upon the prosecution to provide particulars of the steps or precautions the accused persons ought to have taken to prevent the commission of the primary speeding offence, the CANs were not necessarily liable to be quashed because any such ""defect"" could be cured by an order for particulars, and if the learned magistrate refused (as his Honour did) he was subject to correction by this Court on an application for leave to appeal. I would refuse the application for judicial review.

44It is convenient now to turn to the question of statutory interpretation. Is the identification of relevant reasonable steps or reasonable precautions an element of the offence? As Basten JA pointed out in Western Freight Management at [48] ""Kirk broke no new ground"". His Honour stated that Kirk was decided by the application of established principle ""that a statement of an offence"" must identify ""the essential ingredients of the actual offence"". The principle is derived from John L, Basten JA went on to say:

The statement of the statutory offence did not require the incorporation into the offence of any relevant element of the defence. The significance of the reference to the defence was that, unless the putative offender were told what conduct constituted the offence, albeit the conduct was by way of omission, the defendant would not be in a position to say whether there was a reasonably practicable course for remedying the alleged omission.

45And as McColl JA, distinguishing Western Freight Management from Kirk, said at [17]:

No ingredient of the s 56 offence concerned taking steps to prevent the contravention. Rather, the actus reus of the s 56 contravention was the overloading, in this case of the tri-axle, not any matter which went to requiring the applicant to take reasonable steps. That was the subject of its s 87 defence. As the primary judge said (at [16]), once the s 56 contravention was particularised in the penalty notice and the court attendance notice, the applicant knew the charge it had to meet: see also Kirk at [26].

46Leeming JA at [60] pointed out that an obligation to particularise within the CAN, the steps asserted to have been reasonable which were not taken could only arise ""if an element of the offence was ... the absence of those steps"". His Honour rejected a formulation of the offence in terms that the accused person ""did not take all reasonable steps to prevent the axle overload"".

47Basten JA and Leeming JA each said that natural justice may require the prosecutor ""at some stage"" to specify steps which were reasonable and which had not been taken: [50] - [51] Basten JA; [61] Leeming JA.

48I am of the view that the decision in this case is governed by the reasoning in Western Freight Management. The actus reus of the offending covered by cl 156(3) of the regulation is that the operator commits an offence if whilst a driver, or vehicle, is subject to its control, ""the driver commits a speeding offence while driving the vehicle"". Effectively the statute creates a form of vicarious criminal liability notwithstanding the common law's antipathy to such a concept. See Presidential Security Services of Australia Pty Ltd v Brilley [2008] NSWCA 204; 73 NSWLR 241 at 265 [140] to 268 [153] per Ipp JA. Vicarious liability is well recognised as a form of strict liability, the expression preferred by the learned Magistrate: Carolyn Sappideen and Prue Vines, Flemings the Law of Torts (Thomson Reuters 10th Ed, 2011) at page 437 (19.10).

49MFI 2 is a sample of the cl 156(3) CAN. It is not in dispute that it adequately particularises the elements of s 156(3). Nor is it disputed that it contains no averment, or particulars, of, or related to, the elements of s 156(6). For the reasons given by the judges in Western Freight Management s 15 of the OHS Act is not analogous to cl 156. In broad terms, s 15(1) imposed a duty to ensure, inter alia, safety at work. Section 15(2) expands on the content of that duty. Clearly a mere averment that an employer failed to provide a safe system of work, for example, may inform as to the nature of the offence but it does not inform as to the manner in which it has been committed. Unless the specific act or omission relied upon as constituting the breach is particularised, the accused person has no opportunity to rely upon a defence under s 53 of that legislation that it was not reasonably practicable for it to comply with s 15. This required particulars of the measure that should have been taken, but was not. 

50Clause 156(3) is different. The offence is committed, for instance, when a driver commits a speeding offence whilst under the control of the accused person. The question of reasonable steps does not come into it.

51The language of cl 156(6) provides a defence if the accused person establishes the conditions set out in paragraph (a) and (b). Those conditions include taking all reasonable steps to prevent the driver speeding, or demonstrating there were no steps that the accused could reasonably have been expected to have taken to prevent the driver from speeding. These are elements of the defence to be established by the accused not elements of the offence to be established by the prosecution. It may be that natural justice will require the prosecution to point to a step not taken as Basten and Leeming JJA say in their separate reasons. As Basten JA put it at [50] procedural fairness may require the prosecution to indicate a step not taken before the defence is rejected. But the practical content of procedural fairness will depend upon the circumstances of the case including in particular the nature of the evidence raised or introduced by the accused, which bears the onus.

52In my opinion, the heading to cl 156, which does not form part of it, makes no difference in this case. The clarity of the language mitigates against whatever assistance the heading might otherwise provide.

53In my opinion s 178(1) of the Act falls into the same category. Again, it establishes a vicarious criminal liability: if the corporation commits an offence so too does, inter alia, the Director and he or she is liable for the same punishment. The sample CAN in respect of these offences is MFI 3. It sets out all of the elements of the Cl 156(3) offence and avers that the named defendant is a director of the corporation. Reliance is placed on s 178 as well as Cl 156. It does not specifically or separately aver that the corporation has committed an offence but no complaint is made about that, and reading the CAN as a whole that formal omission is of no moment. Again it says nothing about the matters referred to in s 178(7) which establishes the defence. It says nothing about how the defendant was in a position to influence the conduct of the company in relation to the actual offence, or what reasonable precautions, or due diligence, was required to prevent the commission of the actual offence. 

54However the interpretation unanimously favoured by the Court of Appeal in Western Freight Management is equally applicable to s 178 of the Act and it is unnecessary to restate it.

55Western Freight Management, of course, was concerned with the interplay of two provisions in the Act being ss 56 and 87. However, s 56(3) effectively incorporated the provisions of s 87 by use of the expression ""has the benefit of the reasonable steps defence"". Section 87 described the content of that ""reasonable steps defence"" in various circumstances. There is no appreciable difference in meaning to be deduced from the structure of the provisions in question in Western Freight Management when compared with those in question here.

56For these reasons I conclude that the CANs are not liable to be quashed for invalidity and the learned magistrate's decision to dismiss the plaintiffs' application is not undermined ""on [a] ground that involves a question of law alone"". I would have granted leave but dismissed the appeal.

57Given these conclusions it is unnecessary for me to decide the points of contention raised by the defendant. I have already made clear that I would reject the argument that the application below was beyond power or outside the jurisdiction of the Local Court. In substance, the defendant conceded that either s 28 of the Local Court Act or s 219(3) Criminal Procedure Act conferred power to deal with the application. In my judgment an erroneous reference to Part 4 of the Local Court Act is of no moment and made no difference to the legality of the proceeding.

58As to the argument that s 53(3)(b) did not apply because the order made by the magistrate was final. With respect, the submission is entirely misconceived. Contrary to the submission of learned counsel, in Australian law it is not ""the strict legal effect of the application"" which is in question, rather ""it is the legal force of the judgment in question, and not its practical effect, that has to be considered determining whether or not the judgment is a final one"" (citations omitted). Sanofi at 152. The substance of the magistrate's order dismissing the application determined nothing finally. Even had the magistrate acceded to the application to dismiss the proceedings because the CANs were bad for want of sufficient particularisation, fresh CANs could have been issued subject to the provisions of the applicable statute of limitations, s 181 of the Act.

59In the event the proceedings must be dismissed. My provisional view in respect of costs is that the s 69C Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 matter makes no difference to the manner of the exercise of the court's discretion as to costs. For this reason I will pronounce the usual order for costs in favour of the defendant, but allow liberty to the plaintiff to apply for a variation of that order. I am adopting this approach, lest on consideration the plaintiffs decide to make no special application.

60My orders are:

(1)Proceedings dismissed;

(2)Plaintiffs to pay the defendant's costs on the usual basis forthwith after they have been agreed or assessed.

(3)The parties to have liberty to apply for a variation of order (2) within 14 days of today's date by motion supported by written submissions not exceeding 3 pages in length and any necessary affidavit.

		08 September 2014",2014-09-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704557,R v Safi [2014] NSWSC 1208,"JUDGMENT INTRODUCTION1On 19 May 2014, John Safi (""the offender"") pleaded not guilty to an indictment alleging that on 25 July 2010, at Whalan in the State of New South Wales, he murdered Mohammad Ayman Abouhait (""the deceased"").  On 29 May 2014 the jury returned a verdict of guilty against the offender.  I heard submissions from the parties in relation to sentence on 22 August 2014. 
2The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment: Crimes Act 1900 s. 19A.  A standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed pursuant to s. 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"").
3Section 61(1) of the Sentencing Act mandates the imposition of a life sentence for murder if I am satisfied the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a sentence.  The Crown has not sought the imposition of a life sentence in the present case and I am satisfied that such a sentence is not appropriate.
4The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in that range, without regard to those factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case: Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27] and [31].
5A Victim Impact Statement was presented to the court on behalf of Inas Karim, the deceased's sister.  Ms Karim also gave evidence at the offender's trial.  Once again, I extend my sympathy to Ms Karim and the members of her family.  I am hopeful that the opportunity that she has been given to provide her statement to the court will assist her process of grieving. 
6The Crown accepted that in the present circumstances, where a conviction was recorded against the offender on 29 May 2014 after the return of the jury's verdict, the amendments to the Sentencing Act introduced by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Family Member Victim Impact Statement) Act 2014 had no application.  Accordingly, I remain bound by the principles expressed in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and R v Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510 regarding the relevance, on sentence, of the statement provided by Ms Karim.  
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDING7I am required to make findings of fact in relation to the circumstances of the offending.  Such findings must be consistent with the jury's verdict.  In particular, I must accept such facts as are established by that verdict, and I must not determine any factual issue in a way which is not consistent with it: R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374.  The Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender.  The offender bears the onus of proving factual matters in mitigation, on the balance of probabilities.
8The Crown case at trial was that the deceased was murdered in the course of the offender and his brother, Mitchell Johnson, carrying out a joint criminal enterprise to assault the deceased.  There was no direct evidence of the deceased's murder.  The Crown relied on a series of circumstances, along with evidence of admissions said to have been made by the offender to various persons, in order to prove its case.  
9Bearing in mind all of these matters I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstances of the offending were as follows.
10In June 2010 four Aboriginal males attended the offender's premises in Whalan offering to sell him a 2008 model BMW X5 motor vehicle for a sum of $2,000.00.  The offender had previously spent some years working in the motor vehicle industry and in fact sold cars at one point. From time to time he would also have cars for sale in his front yard.  As a consequence of this experience, the offender was well aware of the fact that the value of the vehicle which had been offered to him for sale was well in excess of $2,000.00.  In these circumstances he came to the view that the vehicle must have been stolen.
11Accordingly, the offender telephoned the police and reported the matter.  The police arrived at his premises shortly afterwards and arrested the four males.  The offender provided a statement to the police about what had occurred.
12In mid to late July 2010, after the incident outlined above, the deceased attended the offender's premises in the company of two other males. The offender had not met the deceased prior to that time and in fact knew nothing of him.  Having introduced himself as ""Ayman Darwiche"", the deceased said to the offender:
""I'm here on behalf of the sood"".
13""Sood"" is apparently an Arabic term for ""black"".  This led the offender to conclude that the deceased was referring to the four aboriginal males who had previously been arrested at his home in June.  At that point the following conversation ensued between the deceased and the offender:
Deceased: All I'm here for is the debt.Offender: What debt?Deceased:  The BMW debt.Offender: Its got nothing to do with me.Deceased: I'm in a hurry now, but I'll be back tomorrow and we'll talk. 14The deceased returned the following day and the following conversation with the offender ensued:Deceased: We are here to collect money or cars.  You just let us know which one.Offender: Why should I be paying for something that isn't my debt?  Its got nothing to do with me.Deceased: You either give me money or the cars.
15An argument followed, in the course of which the deceased produced a gun and threatened the offender with it.  He then told the offender to remove a gold chain the offender was wearing at the time.  The deceased took the chain and told the offender he would be back the following day.  
16The deceased returned to the offender's premises on the next day and the following conversation ensued:  
Deceased: Get the cars ready, I'm taking them now.  Offender: Get a tow truck.  They need a tow truck.  They won't start.Deceased: Alright, I'm going to get a tow truck and I'll be back.  
17The deceased left a short time later.  The offender then barricaded, and left, his premises.  He did so because he feared the deceased.  He went to live with his then girlfriend, Gina Schembri.  He told Ms Schembri that the deceased had ""put a gun to his head"" and had ""taken the chain off him"".  He also told her that he ""wasn't going to stop until he got the chain back"".  
18There was telephone contact between the deceased and the offender around this time, in the course of which the deceased threatened the offender (inter alia) that he would ""take his cars and his house"".  Around the same time Ms Schembri overheard the offender speaking to a person on the phone and saying:
""I'm not going to stop until I get the chain back. If you don't give it back, I'm going to hurt ya.""
19I am satisfied that the offender was speaking to the deceased when he said those words.
20At about this time Ms Schembri's twin sister, Angela Schembri, also had a conversation with the offender in which he said that:
"" .... some bloke, came over to get the money.  When he didn't recover any money .... he took the chain ..."".  
21In the early hours of 25 July 2010 police attended the offender's premises in response to a radio message reporting that an offence of break enter and steal was in progress.  When the police arrived, they saw the deceased at the rear of the offender's premises attempting to open a window.  The deceased was arrested and taken to the police station.  
22Senior Constable Grant, who was one of the arresting officers, then spoke with the offender.  He informed the offender of the deceased's arrest and told him that the deceased had claimed that he (the deceased) was a friend of the offender.  The offender responded by saying:
""He's not a friend of mine.  He's actually made threats against me"".
23When Senior Constable Grant asked the offender if he would be prepared to make a statement about the matter, he replied:
""No, I'll look after it myself"".
24The offender's neighbour, Doug Piccinelli, also spoke to the offender about the attempt by the deceased to break into his home.  When he asked the offender why he did not wish to proceed with the matter, the offender said:  
""Don't worry. I'll fix him myself"".
25The deceased was released from custody on 25 July 2010.  He then telephoned the offender and said:
""I got locked up for you overnight.  I'm in Penrith now.  I'm coming to Mt Druitt to pick up the cars.  Have them ready"".26This is consistent with the evidence given at the trial by Jodi Reynolds, an acquaintance of the deceased, that when she last saw the deceased he had said to her that he ""had to pick up some cars"" from premises located in the same street as those of the offender.  The deceased and the offender were in telephone contact with each other during the course of the afternoon of 25 July 2010.
27At some time shortly after the attempted break in of his premises, the offender was driven to Gina Schembri's home by his brother, Mitchell Johnson.  On that occasion the offender said to Ms. Schembri that they had ""bashed"" the deceased and had then taken him to a ""FOB's house"" and left him there.  I am satisfied that the reference to ""they"" was a reference to the offender and his brother.
28The offender also told Angela Schembri that he had seen the deceased and ""bashed him to death and got his chain back"".  
29Approximately two days after the attempted break in at the offender's premises, Mr Piccinelli spoke with the offender in the presence of his brother.  On that occasion, the offender told Mr Piccinelli that the person who had stolen his chain had been ""fixed"".  The offender then walked inside his premises before returning in possession of a baseball bat.  He held that bat in one hand and used it to repeatedly tap the palm of his other hand.  Nothing was specifically said about it.  
30On 16 March 2012 human remains, later identified as those of the deceased, were found in bushland at Londonderry.  It is not part of the Crown case that the offender played any part in depositing the deceased's body in the bushland. 
31The deceased was last seen alive on 25 July 2010.  Consistent with what he had said to Ms Reynolds, I am satisfied that the deceased went to the offender's premises at some time during the afternoon or evening of that day.  In light of what the offender said to Gina Schembri, Angela Schembri and Doug Piccinelli after that time, I am satisfied that the deceased was killed when he went to the offender's premises.
32I should note that the Crown called evidence at the trial from Jeffrey Small, an acquaintance of the offender.  Mr Small told the Court (inter alia) that he had been at the offender's premises on one occasion when he saw a man, identified as the deceased, arrive at the premises and have an argument with the offender.  Mr Small also gave evidence that he saw a motor vehicle belonging to the offender's brother at the premises on that same day, on the back seat of which he observed traces of blood.    
33Mr Small's evidence was inconsistent, in material respects, with what he had told police.  Some of his evidence in chief was entirely omitted from an earlier statement.  He conceded that his memory was not good.  He also conceded that he had discussed aspects of the incident leading to the offender's arrest with Gina Schembri, and possibly with Angela Schembri.  
34Overall, I found Mr Small's evidence to be quite unreliable.  None of my factual findings as to the circumstances of the offending are based, in any way, upon his evidence.  
35The Crown also called evidence from Mr Small's father, Garry Small, who gave evidence of an admission said to have been made by the offender, to the effect that he had ""kicked the shit"" out of the deceased.  The circumstances in which that statement was said to have been made were, in my view, inherently unlikely for a variety of reasons and none of my factual findings are based upon an acceptance of it.
36I am satisfied that the deceased was killed as a consequence of, and in the course of, the offender and his brother carrying out the joint criminal enterprise upon which the Crown relied.  
37Three principal issues arise as to the circumstances of the offending, namely whether:
(i)a baseball bat was used;(ii)the offending was planned; and(iii)the offender intended to kill the deceased, or whether he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on him.
38As to the first of those matters, the Crown relied upon the evidence of Mr Piccinelli (at [29] above) to sustain an inference that a baseball bat was used in the attack on the deceased.  I accept Mr Piccinelli's evidence that the offender told him that he had ""fixed"" the deceased.  I also accept that having said that, the offender retrieved a baseball bat from his premises and showed it to Mr Piccinelli, ""tapping"" it in the manner Mr Piccinelli described.  Viewed in this way, there was a clear connection between the ""fixing"" of the deceased (as the offender described it) and the use of the baseball bat which the offender exhibited to Mr Piccinelli.  If there was no such connection, the offender would have had no reason to retrieve the baseball bat at all.  In these circumstances I am satisfied that a baseball bat was used in the attack on the deceased.   That is an aggravating factor having regard to s. 21A(2)(c) of the Sentencing Act although the evidence does not permit me to determine whether the bat was used by the offender, by his brother, or by both of them.  
39As to the second of those matters, statements made by the offender to Senior Constable Grant and Mr Piccinelli around the time of the attempted break in to his premises are consistent with the offender wanting to exact some retribution upon the deceased for what had previously occurred between them.  However, in circumstances where the evidence does not establish the precise circumstances in which the deceased and the offender came to be together on the occasion when the deceased was killed, I am unable to determine, one way or the other, whether the offending was planned.  
40As to the third of those matters the Crown pointed to the evidence of Angela Schembri that the offender had told her that he bashed the deceased ""to death"".  It was submitted that this was consistent with an intention on the part of the offender to kill the deceased.  As I understood it, the Crown put this as the primary, if not the only, evidence which supported such a conclusion.  Whilst I accept that this was said, it was a statement which was made after the event.  It does not, in my view, establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill the deceased at the time of the attack.  It is a statement of what occurred.  It is not a statement that what occurred was in fact intended by the offender.  In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the offender intended to kill the deceased.  I am satisfied from other statements made by the offender to Gina Schembri, Angela Schembri and Mr Piccinelli that the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.   
41The previous dealings between the deceased and the offender, although not amounting to provocation as such, necessarily form part of the background to the offending.  The evidence of the deceased's dealings with the offender leave me in no doubt that the deceased was a person prone to aggression and violence.  There was other evidence given in the trial, notably that of Jodi Reynolds, which satisfies me that the deceased was also prone to attempting to extort money from people without cause.  There was also some evidence of the deceased having been caught up in what was referred to as a ""drug rip"" involving members of an outlaw motor cycle gang.  On the evidence before the court, the term ""stand over man"" would not be an inapposite description of the deceased.  
42I am satisfied that the deceased, without any justification at all, had been antagonistic and threatening towards the offender in the period leading up to his death.  I am also satisfied that the offender, as a result of the deceased's behaviour towards him, was sufficiently concerned for his personal safety to move from his home for a period of time.      
43However the deceased's behaviour towards the offender provides no justification whatsoever for what ultimately occurred.  
44The circumstances which culminated in the deceased's death had their origins in the occasion on which the offender was visited by people wanting to sell him a stolen motor vehicle.  The offender brought that incident to the attention of the police and allowed them to deal with it by arresting those responsible.  In doing so, the offender demonstrated an understanding and appreciation of the proper course to be taken when confronted by criminal activity.  The deceased's death represents the end result of the offender's decision to take a different course when confronted by the deceased's threatening behaviour towards him.  That different course involved the offender taking the matter into his own hands.  That is not the role of any member of the community when faced with such a situation.  
45In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the objective seriousness of the offending falls below the mid range, a proposition with which the Crown did not take any real issue.
THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASE46A report of John Machlin, Clinical Psychologist, who examined the offender on 17 July 2014 was tendered on sentence.  Although Mr Machlin identified a possibility that the offender had a paranoid personality disorder, he did not reach a concluded diagnosis and identified other investigations which would be required to be undertaken in order for such a possibility to be confirmed.  Mr Machlin reported that there were no signs of any other mental health condition or clinical disorder.    
47In these circumstances, counsel for the offender relied on Mr Machlin's report as providing some background to the offender's personal circumstances.  In that regard, I note the following.
48The offender is now 37 years of age.  He is one of five children born to Lebanese parents in Sydney.  He has apparently become distant from some members of his family since his childhood, although he described his relationship with his family throughout his childhood as good.  He appears to have the continuing support of his mother.  He became engaged in 2011 and married in July 2012.  His wife also remains supportive of him and visits him regularly.    
49The offender was educated to Year 12.  He has had various employment positions in the motor vehicle industry, including conducting a hire car business as well as a business selling motor vehicles.  The offender reported to Mr Machlin that as a consequence of his incarceration, he has lost such assets as he had.  
50Mr Machlin reported that the offender ""maintains his innocence"" and that he had expressed ""indignation"" about aspects of his case.  Mr Machlin also reported that the offender had been assaulted whilst in custody.  However, counsel for the offender made it clear that he did not submit that this incident constituted some form of extra-curial punishment, nor did he submit that the offender's conditions of custody were rendered more onerous as a result.51In terms of the offender's subjective case two matters of particular significance arise.  
52Firstly, although the offender has a criminal history, it consists generally of driving and dishonesty offences which are of a relatively minor nature.  Importantly, there is nothing within the offender's criminal history in terms of previous violent offending.  The Crown conceded that this was a mitigating factor in terms of s. 21A(3)(e) of the Sentencing Act. 
53The second matter concerns the offender's prospects of rehabilitation.  I have previously noted the relevant aspects of Mr Machlin's report.  It follows from the offender's continued statements of innocence, and his reported ""indignation"", that he has expressed no remorse for the offending of which the jury found him guilty.  
54An offender who is found guilty after a trial, and who does not thereafter acknowledge his guilt, is not automatically deprived of a finding that he or she has good prospects of rehabilitation: BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159 at [84] per Johnson J (with whom Hodgson JA and Rothman J agreed) citing Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 at [65] and Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 at [48].  However, as Johnson J pointed out, remorse will be a major factor in determining whether an offender is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation.  The absence of such remorse may render it difficult to make such a determination:  R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [41]. 
55In my view, there are a number of matters which bear directly upon this question.  Firstly, at 37 years of age the offender is a relatively young man.  Secondly, he appears to have had a reasonably stable employment history.  Thirdly, he appears to enjoy the support of his wife, as well as of his mother.  Fourthly, he has no history of violent offending.  In determining the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, and in considering the likelihood of re-offending, it is necessary to balance these factors against the fact that there is no expressed remorse. 
56In Alseedi (supra) Giles JA (with whom Hidden and McCallum JJ agreed) stressed that there can be rehabilitation without confession.  Notwithstanding the absence of any remorse, the factors I have identified satisfy me that the offender has generally good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to reoffend.   
CONCLUSION57The offender was arrested on 30 October 2012.  He has been detained in custody since that time solely in respect of the present offence.  The parties have agreed that any sentence should be backdated accordingly.  
58I make the following orders:
(1)The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 17 years imprisonment commencing on 30 October 2012 and expiring on 29 October 2029 with an additional term of 5 years and 8 months imprisonment commencing on 30 October 2029 and expiring on 29 June 2035.
(2)The total sentence is one of 22 years and 8 months imprisonment.
(3)The offender will be eligible for parole on 29 October 2029 and his sentence will expire on 29 June 2035.

		05 September 2014",2014-09-04 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704572,Agius v R [2014] NSWCCA 173,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  Mark Anthony Agius (the applicant) seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Colefax in the District Court on 14 September 2012.
2The applicant had pleaded guilty to three offences, each committed against the same complainant.  First, one offence of detaining for advantage contrary to s 86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), for which the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for 14 years; and secondly, two offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty prescribed is 5 years imprisonment.  
3The applicant had also asked that four further matters on a Form 1 be taken into account by the primary judge pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), namely, the offences of contravening an apprehended violence order (between 8 December 2011 and 14 February 2012), common assault committed against the complainant (between 1 April 2011 and 30 April 2011), possession of a prohibited drug (on 16 February 2012), and assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed against the complainant (between 13 December 2011 and 15 January 2012).
4On 14 September 2012 the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 6 years imprisonment with an aggregate non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.  
5The applicant filed a notice of application for leave to appeal on 26 February 2014.  An extension of time to do so had previously been granted.  
Grounds of appeal
6The applicant relies upon three grounds of appeal against sentence:
(1)His Honour erred in concluding that the applicant had at no time sought any professional assistance for his drug addiction or for his propensity for violence.
(2)His Honour erred in failing to find special circumstances.
(3)His Honour erred in concluding that, on the state of the evidence and on the balance of probabilities, he did not assess the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation as good. 
7In short, the applicant contends that, as a result of his Honour's erroneous conclusion that the applicant had made no attempt to seek professional assistance, he wrongly assessed the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation as not being good and wrongly found that there were not special circumstances which would have warranted a longer period on parole. 
Circumstances of the offences
8The sentencing judge proceeded on the basis of a statement of agreed facts.
9The uncontested facts are that in 2010 the applicant and the complainant commenced living together at the complainant's home in Cranebrook.  They had previously known each other for 26 years.  The applicant's violence towards the complainant commenced with the first assault in April 2011 and the final assault occurred in February 2012.  
10The first assault in April 2011 is the common assault matter on the Form 1.  In September 2011 the applicant and the complainant became engaged.  In November 2011 they moved from Cranebrook to Lithgow.
11On 29 November 2011 the complainant made an application to the police for an apprehended domestic violence order.  She briefly moved out of the Lithgow house but returned on 4 December 2011.  
12On 8 December 2011 an apprehended domestic violence order was made by the Local Court which prohibited the applicant from assaulting, molesting, harassing, threatening, or stalking the complainant.  Within days of this order having been made the applicant contravened this order after an argument with the complainant at the Lithgow house.  The complainant had attempted to leave and the applicant hit her arms with such force that she dropped what she was holding.  This contravention of the apprehended domestic violence order is the second matter on the Form 1.  
13When the complainant later attempted to leave the Lithgow house on the same day, the applicant obtained a chain and wrapped it around the complainant's wrists so tightly that it left a mark.  The complainant did not struggle as she feared that the applicant would hit her again.  The applicant chained the complainant to their bed where she remained for the entire night.  The following morning the applicant unwrapped the chains and released the complainant and apologised to her.  This kidnapping was the subject of the ""detain with intent to obtain advantage"" offence.
14Some weeks later, in about late December 2011 or early 2012, the applicant told the complainant to leave the Lithgow house and said that he would not stop her.  The applicant then grabbed the complainant by the throat and pushed her back onto the bed.  He punched the complainant in the head which caused a graze.  He also bit her left pointer finger.  He struck her legs with leather shoes so hard that she was unable to walk the next day.  During this incident the applicant said to the complainant:
""I don't care if I kill you cunt.  I don't care if I hurt you.""
This assault occasioning actual bodily harm is the fourth matter on the Form 1.  
15On 11 February 2012 the applicant argued with the complainant when checking a bank statement.  He punched her in the back of her head when outside the Lithgow house.  Inside the house the applicant punched the complainant repeatedly in the head.  He spoke to her in abusive terms.  He also threatened to kill himself and her children if she left him.  The complainant was dazed from the beating she had received.  The applicant continued with his attack, punching her to the right side of her rib cage causing her pain.  The applicant blamed the complainant for his violent behaviour and told her she was a liar.  He proceeded to ask her a series of questions.  When she gave an answer which he did not like he threw a mug at her.  One of the mugs hit her in the chest and another grazed her finger when she tried to defend herself.  These events constitute the first offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  
16Later in the afternoon of 11 February 2012 the applicant inflicted a further sustained assault on the complainant.  This included the applicant hitting the complainant's head (whilst she was in the bath tub) with sufficient force that she hit her head against the bathroom tiles, punching her in the right knee-cap, and repeatedly running a kitchen knife, that he sharpened in front of her, across the complainant's arm, on one occasion leaving a mark and a small cut.  The applicant spoke to the complainant in abusive and degrading terms including, when she asked to go to the toilet:
""If you want to go, you can go outside like a dog"", 
which is what the complainant was forced to do - she went outside to urinate.  The applicant also told her that: 
""This is the last day you are going to live"".  
He gave her a knife and told her to slit her own wrists, which she refused to do.  These events constituted the second offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
17The complainant reported these matters to the police on 15 February 2012.  The applicant was arrested the following day.  He participated in a record of interview.  A search warrant was executed at his Lithgow home and 0.2 grams of amphetamine was located.  The applicant told the police that the drugs were his and that he had been using $50.00 of ""ice"" intravenously.  The possession of the prohibited drug was the third matter on the Form 1.
The applicant's subjective case 
18The applicant was 42 years of age when he offended and 43 years when sentenced.  The applicant was married in 2000 but had separated by 2001.  His former wife had refused access to their 12 year old daughter because of domestic violence issues.
19The applicant had been employed consistently since he left school at the age of 15.  He was self-employed as an arborist at the time of his arrest. 
20The applicant has a lengthy history of alcohol and drug abuse from the age of 15, beginning with using cannabis and moving onto cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, LSD, and finally ""ice"" from about 2006.  The applicant had not sought or received assistance in relation to his drug use prior to entering custody.  
21An alcohol and other drug report dated 21 May 2012 noted that the applicant had undergone a one week detoxification on being remanded in custody on the subject charges.  The report also noted that the applicant had attended interviews, completed a treatment readiness questionnaire, and stated that he was willing to participate in a residential rehabilitation program.  The report had been previously tendered on an earlier bail application.  The report was again tendered on the sentencing hearing and became Exhibit 1.
22The pre-sentence report (Exhibit B) also noted that the applicant completed a one week period of detoxification when taken into custody in February 2012, and that the applicant ""indicated that he had not undertaken any other intervention or treatment for his addictions"".  The report stated that the applicant wished to complete a period of residential rehabilitation and that his mother, brother, and the complainant ""all agree that this outcome would be desirable, as the offender has made no attempt to address his issues to date"".
23The pre-sentence report noted that the applicant blamed his offending behaviour on his long-term drug habit and regularly heavy alcohol consumption.  Nonetheless, the report also noted that the applicant took full responsibility for the offending behaviour and expressed remorse.  The author of the report expressed the opinion that the applicant may benefit from completing a lengthy period of treatment in a residential rehabilitation facility, prior to his release to the community.
Reasons of the primary judge
24The primary judge allowed a 25% discount for the applicant's plea of guilty.
25His Honour gave little weight to the applicant's expression of remorse because of his failure to give evidence.  
26His Honour found the applicant's statements regarding his wish to undergo rehabilitation to be ""self-serving"" and that his prospects of rehabilitation were not good.  His Honour said (at ROS 10):
""Since he was taken into custody Mr Agius has undergone one week of detoxification. At no time has he sought any professional assistance for his drug addictions or his propensity to violence - and in circumstances where his abuse of his partners has been over a significantly extended period. I regard his unsworn statement to the author of the presentence report that he now wishes to undergo rehabilitation to be self-serving. On the state of the evidence and on the balance of probabilities I do not assess his prospects for rehabilitation as good. I do not think they would be enhanced by a longer period on parole.""
27His Honour found that the offences and the matters on the Form 1 involved prolonged and degrading abuse of the complainant and that the abuse was not only physical, but also undoubtedly deeply emotional.  
28His Honour rejected the submission made on behalf of the applicant that the offences were at the lower end of the range but accepted that they were not the worst type of such offences.  His Honour considered that general and specific deterrence required a sentence of imprisonment.  
29Although it was the applicant's first period in custody his Honour declined to find special circumstances, because he considered there was a greater need to protect the community.
30His Honour imposed an aggregate sentence: 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months.  Had he not imposed an aggregate sentence his Honour's indicative sentences were a term of imprisonment of 4 years for the kidnapping offence, and terms of imprisonment of 2 years 3 months and 3 years respectively for each of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offences.
Ground 1 - Suggested erroneous conclusion that the applicant had made no attempt to seek professional assistance
31The applicant contends that there was an error or oversight by the sentencing judge in concluding (at ROS 10) that at no time had the applicant sought professional assistance for his drug addictions or propensity to violence.  Counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour had overlooked the evidence in Exhibit 1, that, whilst on remand in May 2012, the applicant had sought a drug and alcohol assessment for the purpose of being placed in a residential drug and alcohol treatment program.  
32There are two difficulties with this contention.  
33The first difficulty is that the contention is not borne out by an analysis of his Honour's findings.  The relevant portion of his Honour's remarks on sentence are set out at [26] above.  His Honour's reference to the applicant not having sought professional assistance in circumstances where the abuse of the complainant had occurred over a ""significantly extended period"" - that is, prior to the current charges - makes it abundantly clear that the temporal context of his Honour's finding was the period prior to the applicant entering custody on the subject charges.  His Honour's finding was correct.  It did not misstate the material in the pre-sentence report, where the following appeared (AB 41):
""Mr Agius said that he completed a one week period of detoxification when taken into custody in February 2012.  He indicated that he had not undertaken any other intervention or treatment for his addictions.  He said that he wished to complete a period of residential rehabilitation in order to break his drug habit and reconcile with the victim.""
34His Honour then stated that he regarded the applicant's unsworn statement to the author of the pre-sentence report (that he wished to undergo rehabilitation) to be self-serving.  There is no challenge to this finding.  It was reasonably open to the sentencing judge to arrive at this conclusion based on the materials before him.  In turn this finding reinforced that the temporal context of his Honour's earlier finding - that the applicant had not sought professional assistance - was to the period prior to the applicant entering custody on the subject charges. 
35The second difficulty with the applicant's contention is that it misstates the relevance of the material in Exhibit 1 and how this was relied upon by the applicant at the sentencing hearing.  Before the sentencing judge the applicant had relied upon Exhibit 1 in support of a submission that he should be given the opportunity to participate in a full-time residential program (AB 55, lines 1-10).  The sentencing judge indicated that this was a matter for the Probation and Parole Service to arrange after the applicant's release on parole.  Counsel for the applicant agreed (AB 55, lines 12-15), and then formally submitted that any custodial sentence might be suspended or partially suspended.  The matter was not taken further by the applicant's counsel in submissions before the sentencing judge.  
36In light of his Honour's decision to impose a full-time custodial sentence, as to which no complaint is made by the applicant, it cannot be said that his Honour overlooked the material in Exhibit 1, simply because he did not expressly refer to it in his remarks on sentence.  This material was sought to be relied upon by the applicant for a different purpose.
37No error has been demonstrated in his Honour's finding.  This ground of appeal is not made out. 
Grounds 2 and 3 - Suggested failure to find special circumstances and erroneous conclusion that the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation could not be assessed as good
38Grounds 2 and 3 may be dealt with together.  The common premise of these two grounds is that the asserted error, which is the subject of ground 1, flowed through to his Honour's negative assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and his conclusion that those prospects would not be enhanced by a longer period of parole.
39Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that these two grounds could not succeed if ground 1 was not made out.  This concession was properly made.  No other basis was advanced for challenging his Honour's finding that the applicant's unsworn statement that he now wished to undergo rehabilitation was self-serving.  
40It follows that there was no error in his Honour's finding that the applicant's prospects for rehabilitation could not be assessed as good.  In these circumstances there was no error in his Honour declining to find special circumstances because of the greater need to protect the community.
41Grounds 2 and 3 are not made out.
Conclusion and order
42For the reasons given above, there is no merit in any of the proposed grounds of appeal.  Accordingly leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.
43I propose the following order:
(1)Application for leave to appeal refused.44FULLERTON J:  I agree with Gleeson JA.
45McCALLUM J:  I agree that leave to appeal should be refused, for the reasons stated by Gleeson JA.  The applicant subjected his partner to a series of violent, abusive and degrading assaults.  After his arrest, and only then, he professed a willingness to undertake residential drug rehabilitation and sought bail for that purpose.  The suggestion that the sentencing judge's scepticism as to the prospects of rehabilitation reveals error is untenable.

2ADAMSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
3BELLEW J:  On 2 October 2013 Paul Mark Hart (""the applicant"") was sentenced by his Honour Judge Maiden SC in the District Court as follows:  
Date / Place of offenceSectionMaximum PenaltySentence Imposed1.8 November 2011 at TeralbaRobbery in company: s. 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (""the Act"")20 years imprisonmentA non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months.2.8 November 2011 at TeralbaLarceny of a motor vehicle: s. 117 of the Act5 years imprisonmentFixed term of 2 years imprisonment to date from 16 May 20133.8 November 2011 at TeralbaDestroy property (motor vehicle) by fire: s. 195(1)(b) of the Act10 years imprisonmentFixed term of 3 years imprisonment to date from 16 May 20134.10 November 2011 at CessnockArmed robbery: s. 97(2) of the Act25 years imprisonmentNon-parole period of 7 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months to date from 16 November 20125.10 November 2011 at CessnockLarceny of a motor vehicle: s. 117 of the Act5 years imprisonmentFixed term of 2 years imprisonment to date from 16 May 20136.10 November 2011 at CessnockDestroy property (motor vehicle)by fire: s. 195(1)(b) of the Act10 years imprisonmentFixed term of imprisonment of 3 years to date from 16 May 20137.16 November 2011 at Kurri KurriUse an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension: s. 33B(1)(a) of the Act12 years imprisonmentA non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months to date from 16 November 2013 with an additional term of 1 year and 6 months
4The sentences imposed in respect of the offending in 1 - 3 and 7 followed pleas of guilty being entered by the applicant in the Local Court, whilst those imposed in respect of the offending in 4, 5 and 6 followed the applicant being found guilty by a jury.
5The overall sentence imposed was a non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months imprisonment, with an additional term of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment.  The applicant is presently eligible for release on parole on 16 May 2020.  The applicant appeared for sentence with a co-offender, Malcolm Littlewood.  No parity issue is raised by the applicant on this appeal.  
THE FACTS6The sentencing judge found the facts of the offending to be as follows (commencing at ROS 1):
""It appears that in approximately October of 2011 a plan was hatched between the two of them to carry out some robberies. The plan in respect of both robberies involved the theft of a motor vehicle and the destruction of the motor vehicle after the robberies occurred. That occurred in respect of both matters.
In regard to the Teralba matter, the offender Hart had been dealing with a scrap metal dealer and he appears to have decided to enlist the support of his co-offender to rob the woman who was the office manager. The plan involved both offenders stealing motor vehicles, replacing their number plates and following the female manager. Having established that the manager had collected cash from the National Australia Bank, she was followed and then a four wheel drive driven by the offender Hart pulled towards the vehicle driven by the victim and forced the victim's vehicle off the road. Hart reversed the vehicle and rammed the victim's car twice more, pushing the vehicle into the bush. The offender Hart approached the victim and said, ""Give me your fucking money. I've got a gun."" He demonstrated that he had something beneath his shirt, although the victim did not see any gun or pistol. She threw the money onto the floor of the passenger seat of the vehicle and at this time the offender Littlewood approached the vehicle and Littlewood said, ""Give me the fucking money, bitch, or I will kill you."" He was holding a meat cleaver at that time. Further threat was made by action and both offenders then left with the money.
The Toyota vehicle that Littlewood had been in was burnt, that vehicle having been stolen the previous day.
In respect of the second matter of the East Cessnock bowling club, the offenders stole motor vehicles and went to the East Cessnock bowling club at closing time. They approached the bar supervisor who was at that time packing money into the safe. They ran into the bar both wearing gloves and balaclavas. It would appear that Hart was carrying a shortened .22 calibre rifle and Littlewood a long sword. There were a number of patrons in the premises and the manager put his hands up in fear that he was likely to be injured or killed. The offender Littlewood emptied the safe and placed money in a bag that he had with him. Meanwhile, Hart stood by the bar keeping the manager and patrons at bay. They went into the vehicle and decamped. An amount of almost $37,000 was stolen.
A vehicle was burnt out and that vehicle having been stolen on 9 November.
The police were investigating the matter having received information from a number of sources. On 16 November they were watching the work premises of Mr Hart's workshop when they were alerted that the offender Littlewood was driving towards the workshop. Police stopped Littlewood and he was arrested and then charged with the matters. A number of items including a balaclava that was worn in the East Maitland robbery was found. There were also other items such as a knife, a replica pistol and other items consistent with items that had been or might be used for robbery offences.
The person Hart was pursued by police officers which is subject to the matters sequences 9 and 10 and that chase involved police officers risking themselves in pursuit of a person who they believed to be dangerous and by this time they must have known that he had been convicted of murder. The offender Hart drove into the bush and the police continued in their vehicles but as the police vehicles were unable to follow the four wheel drive through the bush, they went on foot. It was during this time that Hart turned towards the police officers and drove towards the senior officer who had to jump for safety to avoid being injured or killed.""
THE APPLICANT'S CRIMINAL HISTORY7The applicant's criminal history includes some relatively minor matters which were dealt with in the Local Court in 1991 and 1992.  However in 1993 the applicant was found guilty by a jury of murder and was sentenced to a minimum term of 14 years imprisonment with an additional term of 4 years.  An appeal against conviction was dismissed by this Court.  Leave to appeal against the sentence imposed was granted, but that appeal was also dismissed (see R v Hart NSWCCA (unreported) 21 June 1996).  
8At the time of being taken into custody for the murder offence the applicant was 24 years of age.  He was released on parole on 19 March 2009, at the age of 40.  However, whilst on parole he was convicted in the Local Court for a driving offence and sentenced to a fixed term of 3 months imprisonment.  That conviction constituted a breach of parole.  As a consequence, the applicant was returned to custody on 13 November 2009.  He was released at the expiration of his sentence on 21 October 2010, at the age of 42.
9Following his release, the applicant remained at liberty until 16 November 2011, at which time he was arrested for the matters which are the subject of the present appeal.  He has remained in custody since that time.  
10Assuming for present purposes that the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge remain, and assuming further that the applicant is released on parole immediately upon becoming eligible, he will be aged 52 and will have spent 26 of the preceding 28 years in custody.THE SENTENCE PROCEEDINGSThe evidence in the applicant's case 11The applicant did not give evidence on sentence.  A report of Dr Allnutt, Forensic Psychiatrist, was tendered in his case without objection.  The history recorded by Dr Allnutt included the following (at page 2):
 ""... he said he had trouble adapting to life out within the community particularly at times by himself dealing with other people and running his business.
He stated that due to his long tenure in prison he had become used to being in a cell alone and found that he was as a consequence since his release feeling more anxious particularly when people demanded things of him; he felt more easily overwhelmed; he had difficulty explaining himself; he found that he wanted to get away from people; when he was with too many people he felt sweaty, easily frustrated with a need to remove himself from that environment; he would feel irritable as well.
He stated that over time these feelings worsened; he stated that on these occasions he would feel lost.""
12Dr Allnutt also recorded (at pages 2-3 of his report) that the applicant reported having commenced the use of amphetamines shortly prior to the offending which is the subject of this appeal:  
""After commencing methamphetamines he started to feel even more estranged from people; he had more paranoid thoughts concerned that people knew that he had been locked up; he thought people were watching him; he tended to take what people said more to heart but he denied experiencing any perceptual disturbances such as voices, tastes, smells although sometimes he thought he heard noises around the workshop; there were no messages from the TV, the radio or the newspaper
...He said he was asked to participate in the offending a few minutes before (10-15 minutes); at the time he was intoxicated on methamphetamines; he had had about half a gram.""
13In terms of diagnosis, Dr Allnutt expressed the following opinion (at page 5): 
""In my opinion (the applicant) manifests predominantly symptoms consistent with a chronic adjustment disorder with a depressed mood characterised by feeling ""down"" frequently, broken sleep, reduced appetite, reduced energy levels, feelings of worthlessness, loss of capacity for pleasure with associated episodes of anxiety with sweatiness probably consistent with a mild depressive disorder or a chronic adjustment disorder with a depressed and anxious mood.""
14Importantly, Dr Allnutt also said the following (at page 6):
""In my view having regard to the amount of time that your client has spent in an institution and taking into consideration his description of the difficulties he described in re-integrating into civilian life, I would regard him as an individual who has become institutionalised and has had difficulty in establishing himself in the community; this would have been a further contributing factor to use of substances and offending.""
15Dr Allnutt concluded by expressing the view that the applicant demonstrated ""some insight"", and that he had a number of rehabilitation requirements.  These were said to include:  
(i)referral to a psychologist for supportive counselling;
(ii)undertaking a drug and alcohol treatment program; 
(iii)prescription of anti-depressant medication and associated treatment by a psychiatrist;
(iv)vocational assistance; and
(v)assistance of ""social services"" at the time of his release in order to assist him in re-establishing himself.
The submissions made to the sentencing judge16In the course of submissions, counsel who appeared for the applicant on sentence made specific reference (T10-11) to the custodial history I have outlined above.  He emphasised that the applicant had spent an extremely limited period of his adulthood at liberty.  Counsel then addressed his Honour on the contents of Dr Allnutt's report.  In doing so, he concentrated (T11 L5 and following) on the difficulties which the applicant had experienced in re-integrating into the community following his previous release from custody.  It is apparent from reading the transcript that counsel was moving to the point of submitting to his Honour that the applicant was institutionalised.  Counsel highlighted the matters to which Dr Allnutt had referred in his report as being necessary for the applicant's rehabilitation, and submitted that these matters were relevant to the structure of any sentence that might be imposed.  Counsel also submitted to his Honour, in effect, that particular focus needed to be directed to ensuring, as far as possible, that when the applicant was eventually released he did not experience the same difficulties as he had in the past.       
17At that point, and against the background I have outlined, the transcript records his Honour saying the following (commencing at T11 L48):
""Mr Marr, can I interrupt to say that recently on Radio National there was a person reporting an academic study into this issue, recidivism and dealing with, in terms of when people were released on parole and what happened. It was quite insightful and what the person was doing was perhaps saying with (sic) both Dr Furst and Dr Allnutt, both of whom as I understand it, are qualified in respect of the corrections system and very experienced in that way and bring an insight that has been recognised by this study. So I have no difficulty in accepting the submission that you make at all. And indeed I do.""
18Given the context in which his Honour's statements were made, they can only be construed as acceptance, firstly of the submissions regarding the difficulties the applicant had previously experienced in re-integrating into the community, and secondly of the opinions of Dr Allnutt as to:
(a)the fact of applicant's institutionalisation; and(b)the necessity to implement a number of steps upon the applicant's eventual release, directed towards his rehabilitation.  
19Counsel for the applicant then made a further (and more specific) reference to the applicant's institutionalisation, in support of a submission that his Honour find special circumstances under s. 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"") (T15 L5-16):
""...When your Honour comes to consider institutionalisation, I think there is well-founded submissions, in my respectful submission, that your Honour can use that issue to temper what might otherwise be your Honour's determination. If your Honour is to vary the standard non-parole period relationship then your Honour would need to find some form of special circumstances for this offender. The only matter that I can mount in that regard, is the institutionalisation that he suffered and your Honour the quite evident need for long term rehabilitation for this offender, once released. Because the efforts that have been made by him in the past, particularly those two matters, those two times that he was released that I took your Honour to, at the commencement of my submissions, have quite evidently failed.  Without help, he may very well fail again.""
20The transcript of the sentence proceedings makes it clear that the applicant's institutionalisation, and the associated need to address the issue of his rehabilitation, were important issues in determining an appropriate sentence.
THE REASONS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE21His Honour's reasons were delivered approximately one week following the sentence hearing.  His Honour found the offence of robbery committed on 8 November 2011 to be in the mid range of objective seriousness (at ROS 4-5):
""Looking at the robbery of the employee of the metalwork shop, I find that matter in the middle range of objective seriousness, that is, that the offender Hart rammed the vehicle of the victim and forced the vehicle off the road into the bush. Hart may have had a replica pistol but it is unclear on the objective evidence, but in any event he indicated that he did have a gun and he was prepared to use it. In respect of Littlewood, he had produced a meat cleaver which obviously had put the victim in even greater fear.
I have read the victim impact statement of the person whose initials are TG and that matter confirms the significant effect that the actions have had on this young woman. Persons who carry out their duties in going from business to banks must have some protection against persons who commit the actions that have occurred here and in my mind this matter must be put into the middle range of objective seriousness for a matter under s 79(1) (sic). Such a matter carries twenty years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.""
22His Honour then found the offence of robbery committed on 10 November to be above the mid range of objective seriousness:
""In respect of the second robbery matter, that matter involved an amount of planning with the taking of vehicles again, disguises and carrying weapons, namely a .22 rifle and a sword on the part of Littlewood. In the facts mention is made of a shotgun but I think that is an error and refers to the .22 sawn-off rifle that Hart had.
In my mind this matter must be above the mid range of objective seriousness in that it was calculated to put people in fear and there was a risk of fear of injury to the persons at the club.
Indeed the success of the second matter was that there was almost $37,000 obtained from the manager.
As I have indicated, vehicles that were taken for both robberies were stolen, used in the robberies and then destroyed by fire.""
23His Honour concluded (at ROS 9) that there was a need for general deterrence but did not find (at least in the case of the applicant) that there was a need for specific deterrence.  
24His Honour made no reference at all to the issue of the applicant's institutionalisation.  Further, despite having expressly indicated to counsel that he accepted the submission which had been made in relation to rehabilitation, and that he accepted the associated opinions of Dr Allnutt, his Honour said (at ROS 6-7):
""...There was tendered on behalf of the offender Hart a reportof Dr Stephen Allnutt, forensic psychiatrist, an expert who is well known to this Court. Dr Allnutt indicated that on the history given to him the offender had been using or injecting methamphetamine of up to 1 gram per day. Once again we have a matter where a person who has the ability to work and work gainfully and to not come under notice appears to have allowed his desire fordrugs to interfere with his mental processes.   This offender cannot get any benefit from the disclosure that he used ""ice"". Indeed it is a matter that the Court must take into account that this was deliberate and at a time when he was working, was in a relationship and on the face of it did have the ability to remain drug-free and refrain from offending.
The report mentions that he has a chronic adjustment disorder with depressed mood. I have no doubt that this is so and that since he has been bail refused since 16 November 2011 and with the prospect of this matter being sentenced that such a condition is likely to exist. The report says that he has expressed feelings of remorse in respect of his behaviours and is wishing to pursue drug and alcohol rehabilitation by way of abstinence. The report concludes with the offender demonstrating some insight into his offending behaviours which he could deal with whilst in custody"".
25The above passages represent the only references to Dr Allnutt's report in his Honour's sentencing remarks.
THE GROUNDS OF APPEALGround 1 - His Honour erred in failing to take into account evidence in relation to the applicant's institutionalisation
Submissions of the applicant 26Counsel for the applicant submitted that the issue of the applicant's institutionalisation had been squarely raised before his Honour, and that the unchallenged opinion of Dr Allnutt supported a conclusion that the applicant was in fact institutionalised.  Counsel submitted that in those circumstances, the absence of any reference to the issue in his Honour's remarks on sentence necessarily led to the conclusion that his Honour had failed to take it into account when determining an appropriate sentence.  In light of the importance which attached to that issue, it was submitted that his Honour's failure to take it into account was an error.    27Counsel for the applicant also submitted that there was a fundamental inconsistency between his Honour's express acceptance of the submissions of counsel concerning the opinions of Dr Allnutt and the applicant's rehabilitative needs, and the findings that he ultimately made.  It was submitted that, contrary to his unequivocal indications to counsel,  his Honour's reasons effectively amounted to a rejection of the opinions of Dr Allnutt.  This, it was submitted, was procedurally unfair to the applicant.   
Submissions of the Crown28The Crown argued that even though a submission had been made regarding the applicant's institutionalisation, the sentencing judge was not bound to accept it.  The Crown further submitted that the extract from the transcript set out at [17] above demonstrated nothing more than the fact that his Honour recognised that the applicant was in need of a ""step down"" program, or some form of residential rehabilitation as part of his parole, in order to assist with his re-integration into the community upon release. 
Consideration and conclusion29In light of his criminal history, the question of the applicant's institutionalisation was a matter of considerable significance on sentence.  Specific submissions were made by counsel to his Honour in relation to it.  The Crown has properly pointed out that his Honour was not bound to accept those submissions.  He was, however, bound to consider them.    
30The absence, in his Honour's reasons, of any reference to the issue of applicant's institutionalisation indicates that his Honour had no regard to that matter when considering sentence.  In the circumstances of the present case, that was an error.    
31Further, I am not able to accept the Crown's interpretation of the passage of the transcript set out in [17] above.  When read in the context of the submissions that were being put to his Honour on the applicant's behalf, the passage records an unequivocal acceptance by his Honour not only of the submissions, but of the opinions of Dr Allnutt which underpinned them.   That acceptance cannot be reconciled with his Honour's remarks on sentence.  To the extent that his Honour made reference to the report of Dr Allnutt at all, it was essentially confined to that part which recorded the applicant's history of amphetamine use around the time of the offending.  His Honour made no reference at all to Dr Allnutt's opinion concerning the applicant's rehabilitative needs, which was the basis of the submissions which were being made by counsel, and which his Honour had unequivocally said that he accepted.  
32For these reasons ground 1 is made out.  
Ground 2 - His Honour erred in: a) failing to take into account the effect of accumulation when considering special circumstances; andb) failing to find special circumstances.
His Honour's reasons33I relation to the submission that a finding of special circumstances should be made, his Honour said (at ROS 7): 
""... I am of the view that special circumstances do not apply to the offender Hart. The matters that Dr Allnutt has raised flow from what would be the situation created by the offender and in respect of his feeling of feeling ""down"", that condition did not affect in any way his offending behaviour and is a matter that he can easily and should be able to easily deal with himself or if he wishes to he could deal with those matters whilst in custody.""
34The matters raised by Dr Allnutt to which his Honour was referring related to the applicant's amphetamine use leading up to, and at the time of, the offending (see [24] above).  His Honour made no reference to those parts of Dr Allnutt's report set out at [15] above regarding the applicant's needs in terms of rehabilitation.
Submissions of the applicant35Counsel for the applicant pointed out that in terms of the overall sentence which his Honour imposed, the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence was 78.2 percent, and thus in excess of the statutory ratio.  It was pointed out that the application of the statutory ratio would have resulted in the imposition of a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months.  
36Counsel for the applicant submitted that in the circumstances of this case, that difference was significant.  It was submitted, in particular, that the evidence of the applicant's custodial history, and the difficulties he had experienced in re-integrating into the community at the expiration of his previous sentence, warranted a downward, rather than an upward, adjustment of the ratio.  
37Counsel for the applicant further submitted that a finding of special circumstances was warranted having regard to:
(i)the evidence of the applicant's institutionalisation;(ii)the history of the difficulties the applicant had experienced in re-integrating into the community following the completion of his previous sentence;(iii)the opinion of Dr Allnutt as to the applicant's insight; and(iv)the opinion of Dr Allnutt as to the applicant's rehabilitative needs.
38Counsel for the applicant pointed out that in declining to find special circumstances, his Honour had made no reference to any of these matters.  
Submissions of the Crown   39The Crown submitted that the ratio at which his Honour arrived was not markedly greater than the statutory ratio.  It was further submitted that an inference should be drawn that his Honour had intended that overall result.
40The Crown further submitted that the overall sentence represented an outcome which was, in all of the circumstances, ""very favourable"" to the applicant.
Consideration and conclusion41As outlined in [33] above, his Honour's reasons for declining to make a finding of special circumstances followed a brief reference to the report of Dr Allnutt.  That reference was limited to that part of the report which dealt with the applicant's use of amphetamines at the time of the offending, and the applicant's history that he was feeling ""down"" since being returned to custody.    
42Those parts of Dr Allnutt's report were of marginal relevance to the question of whether a finding of special circumstances should be made.  However, directly relevant to that question were the unchallenged opinions of Dr Allnutt that the applicant was institutionalised, that he had some insight into his position, and that he had particular rehabilitative needs which needed to be implemented.  His Honour did not refer to any of those considerations when declining to find special circumstances.      
43A finding of special circumstances is a discretionary one which involves two steps.  The first is to identify the relevant circumstances which are said to be special, and the second is to determine whether those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWSC 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 per Spigelman CJ at [73].  In the present case, his Honour failed to identify, and thus failed to take into account, a number of circumstances which were clearly relevant to the determination he was asked to make.  In addition, his Honour took into account factors which were, at best, only marginally relevant to that determination.  As a consequence of these circumstances, the exercise of his Honour's discretion miscarried.  
44Further, in circumstances where there was a considerable body of unchallenged evidence which supported a downwards adjustment to the ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence, the end result was an adjustment in the opposite direction.  That result supports the conclusion that his Honour failed to have regard to the effect of the accumulation which he had ordered.
45For all of these reasons Ground 2 is made out.
IS SOME OTHER SENTENCE WARRANTED IN LAW? 46As error has been established, the question now arises whether some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 s. 6(3).  
Submissions of the applicant47In support of the proposition that some lesser sentence was warranted, the submissions of counsel for the applicant concentrated upon the evidence, to which I have already referred, of the applicant's need for a longer period on parole to assist in his rehabilitation.  
48Counsel placed particular reliance on the evidence of Dr Allnutt which, it was submitted, supported a conclusion that the applicant would have greater success in integrating into the community if an appropriate rehabilitation plan were was put in place.  It was submitted that in all of the circumstances, a period of 2½ years on parole was insufficient for that purpose.
Submissions of the Crown49The Crown's submissions emphasised the need to impose a head sentence and a non-parole period which properly reflected the objective gravity of the offending:  R v Wasson [2014] NSWCCA 95 at [33] per R A Hulme J (Gleeson JA and Campbell J agreeing) citing R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 546.  The Crown went so far as to submit that the structure of the sentences imposed upon the applicant was ""unduly generous"" to the applicant because no effective additional punishment for the serious offence of using an offensive weapon to avoid detection had been imposed.
50To the extent that emphasis had been placed upon the need to address the applicant's rehabilitation, the Crown emphasised the restraints which are imposed upon an appellate court from interfering with the findings of a sentencing judge regarding special circumstances: R v Simpson (supra) at [73].
Consideration and conclusion51The seriousness of the applicant's offending is apparent from the facts which were found by the sentencing judge.  It needs no further comment.  No issue has been raised about his Honour's assessment of the objective gravity of the offending.  In my view, the conclusions his Honour reached in that regard were open on the evidence.  The offending put members of the public, and police, in danger.  It follows that the protection of the community is an important consideration in determining whether some other sentence is warranted in law.  
52Equally, one of the purposes of sentencing set out in s. 3A of the Sentencing Act is to promote the rehabilitation of the offender.  That was a primary issue before his Honour but the evidence bearing upon it, which was considerable, was not taken into account.  
53Bearing in mind the applicant's custodial history, and having regard to the unchallenged opinion of Dr Allnutt, I am satisfied that the applicant is institutionalised.  Further, the events which occurred following his previous release from a long period in custody highlight the fact that unless his rehabilitation is properly addressed at the time of his release from custody, he is likely to face the same difficulties.  
54In my view, the evidence clearly establishes that the applicant will require assistance in re-integrating into the community when he is eventually released.  The community must be protected from future offending by the applicant to the greatest possible extent.  An important component in attempting to achieve that end is to ensure, as far as possible, that appropriate steps are taken to address the applicant's rehabilitation, and his re-integration into the community, when he is released.55One conclusion to be drawn from Dr Allnutt's report is that when he is eventually released, the applicant would benefit from the implementation of a rehabilitation plan which includes the various components to which Dr Allnutt referred.  The nature of that plan is such that it will take some time to be fully implemented, and thus be effective.  
56A further conclusion to be drawn from Dr Allnutt's report is that if such a plan is implemented and given a proper opportunity to take effect, it is likely to assist the applicant's rehabilitation.  In particular, it is likely to assist his re-integration into the community, and go some way towards assisting him to deal with the difficulties he has experienced in the past.        
57This Court has observed that in order for special circumstances to be made out there must exist significant positive signs which show that if an offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, as opposed to being a mere possibility: R v Tuuta [2014] NSWCCA 40 at [57] per Bellew J, Bathurst CJ and Hoeben CJ at CL agreeing.  In my view, the evidence in the present case satisfies that test.  Whilst I am not minded, in view of the seriousness of the offending, to alter the total overall sentence imposed by his Honour, I am satisfied that special circumstances have been established and that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the overall non-parole period and the head sentence.  
58The issue then arises as to the extent of any adjustment.  The Crown's original position was that by virtue of the operation of Clause 228 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2008, there was a practical limit of 3 years which was placed upon the period of the applicant's supervision on parole.  However, at the hearing of the appeal the Crown pointed out that a recommendation had been made that the applicant be managed as a serious offender pursuant to s. 3 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999.  As a consequence, the relevant authority will have the power to recommend, and if appropriate implement, an additional period of supervised parole.  However, as matters presently stand, there is obviously no certainty that this will occur and I accept that the prospect of the applicant being at liberty on parole without supervision would not meet the interests of the community: Jinnette v R [2012] NSWCCA 217 at [108] per Johnson J (Hoeben JA and Beech-Jones J agreeing).  
59Accordingly, I propose that the applicant be re-sentenced so as to give effect to a finding of special circumstances which will allow him a period of 3 years on parole.  This will give him the benefit of a further 6 months on supervised parole.  In other circumstances, such an adjustment may be of little moment.  However in light of the evidence in the present case, it is significant.
60For these reasons I propose the following orders:
(i)leave to appeal is granted;
(ii)the appeal is allowed;
(iii)the sentence imposed in respect of the offence of armed robbery on 10 November 2011 is quashed;
(iv)in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of 7 years imprisonment commencing on 16 November 2012 and expiring on 15 November 2019 and a balance of term of 3 years imprisonment commencing on 16 November 2019 and expiring on 15 November 2022.
(v)the sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Maiden SC are otherwise confirmed;
(vi)the applicant will be eligible for parole on 16 November 2019 and his sentence will expire on 15 November 2022.

2704581,R v Marsh [2014] NSWDC 301,"Judgment


	
	I am sentencing a young man who survived a fairly unstable upbringing for most of his life. However when he got to the age of 17 or 18 he developed a habit of taking the illegal drug ice. That seems to coincide with his criminal record which commenced in 2012, the same year that he started taking that substance. He has committed a lot of offences in a short period of time. This morning I am sentencing him for five separate offences. I will need to say something about each of the offences and I will need to say something about the personal circumstances of the young man himself.
	
	
	The young man’s name is Ian Marsh. He is still only 19. The five offences I am sentencing him for are these: I am sentencing him for a robbery in company committed at Redfern on 15 November 2012. That is an offence against s 97 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Parliament regards that offence as very serious and has fixed a maximum of 20 years imprisonment to the crime.
	
	
	I am next sentencing Ian Marsh for an aggravated enter a dwelling with intent to steal. That is an offence against s 111(2) of the Crimes Act. Parliament has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to that offence. When I am sentencing him for that offence he has asked me to take into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) an offence of stealing property from a dwelling house. I will take that additional offence into account when I sentence him and I have signed a form under s 32 to that effect - the form is part of Exhibit B.
	
	
	The third offence I am sentencing Ian Marsh for is assault with intent to rob. That was committed at Cammeray on 3 February 2013. That is an offence against s 94 of the Crimes Act and Parliament has fixed a maximum of 14 years imprisonment to that crime. (If I failed to mention it, the aggravated enter with intent to steal was also committed in Redfern and it was committed on 30 January 2013.) Returning to Cammeray, at the same time as committing the assault with intent to rob he committed a separate robbery in company - in fact he committed two separate robberies in company. Each of them he has been charged with. All of those Cammeray crimes were committed on 3 February 2013. The robberies in company are more serious. They are offences against s 97 of the Crimes Act and Parliament has fixed a maximum 20 years imprisonment to those offences.
	
	
	When he was brought before court charged with all five offences, Ian Marsh pleaded guilty. He pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity - the prosecution acknowledges that. The effect of that is to free up the justice system significantly so that other cases can be dealt with because Mr Marsh has avoided the need for a trial. Accordingly in due course I will discount the sentences which he should receive by 25% in order to acknowledge the plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity. Although he has been in full-time custody from 30 May this year, Ian Marsh spent about a month and two days, I am rounding it up in his favour, from 3 February 2013 to 4 March 2013. Accordingly I would backdate the sentence to 28 April 2014. However he also spent two and a half months in a residential facility for drug rehabilitation called The Glen. I will allow him just under half of that, about a month and a week because it is regarded by the courts as being not unlike full-time custody. Accordingly his sentences will commence on 21 March 2014.
	
	
	As I said, I need to say briefly something about each of the offences which Mr Marsh has committed. The first in time was on 15 November 2012. A man finished work at a car wash in Redfern and he was waiting on the street. He was approached by Mr Marsh and another man. Mr Marsh approached the waiting man from behind along with a companion and asked him for fifty cents. They were then joined by a third offender. That man stood over the victim to stop him from walking away. The three men surrounded him, grabbed the front of his shirt and pulled his backpack off. The man ran away but Mr Marsh followed him. Police later found Mr Marsh and arrested and charged him with the offence of robbery in company.
	
	
	The aggravated enter and commit larceny was committed a few months later on 30 January 2013. A man who was nearly 60 was living in his unit in Redfern. He heard a knock on the door. Mr Marsh and a number of other people were at the door. The others were waiting out of sight. When the man opened his door Mr Marsh pushed past him and the others went in. He was pushed backwards onto the couch. He was asked where his money was and he said that he did not have any money or drugs. The agreed facts record that Mr Marsh punched the man. Mr Marsh denied that in evidence and also in his record of interview. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he punched the man. The group searched for money and drugs and then left with Mr Marsh holding an iPad. To his credit some days later Mr Marsh turned himself in at the Redfern Police Station. The taking of the iPad is the matter which I am taking into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	I turn now to the three offences which were committed on 3 February 2013 at Cammeray. A group of teenage boys were using their skateboards in a park. Again Mr Marsh was one of a group of others who were hanging around nearby. Mr Marsh and the men he was with surrounded the teenagers. One of them punched one of the boys in the jaw with his closed right hand. The agreed facts in this case record that it was a young person whose name I will not supply. Interestingly in her remarks on sentence of that young man her Honour Judge Hock noted that the “evidence in the trial established that it was Ian Marsh who did so”. Nevertheless, there is no evidence before me apart from that observation by her Honour that Mr Marsh punched the teenager and I do not so find. But he was there at the time in the joint enterprise and is therefore guilty of the crime of assaulting with intent to rob.
	
	
	The two offences of robbery in company occurred with the other teenagers, the young man who was punched having run away. One of Mr Marsh’s companions grabbed one of the remaining teenagers and forced him to produce his wallet. He had only a few coins in it which he passed on. In fact, the offenders gave him back his wallet. From the other young man they stole about $20. They were going to steal his camera but he asked for it back and they gave it back. These are the two offences of robbery in company.
	
	
	I have made reference to Ian Marsh’s criminal record. He became an adult in September 2012. Earlier that year he was convicted of robbery in company at Bidura Children’s Court. He was called up later in the year because he breached a probation order. He was also convicted of break enter and steal at Parramatta Children’s Court as well as stealing from the person. In addition he was convicted of aggravated robbery in the Parramatta Children’s Court. More recently, in fact this year, he was convicted of offensive behaviour. He got a good behaviour bond for that. He has not been in custody until he was bail refused relating to these matters after his arrest in 2013. As I have already said, his criminal behaviour appears to coincide with the development of his use of the drug commonly known as ice.
	
	
	There is a presentence report which was prepared by a Community Corrections Officer. It noted “an unstable upbringing”. He lived at times with his mother and at times with his father in Perth. He has also been effectively homeless at times since he moved to Sydney. He attended seven separate schools and left after Year 9 and has a limited work history. He started drinking alcohol from about 13 and also started using other drugs, including prescription drugs. The report noted that the forensic psychiatric report “provided for the information of the court identifies a number of symptoms reflecting general emotional difficulties and risk of self-harm”. He acknowledged to the Community Corrections Officer that he knew he had done the wrong thing. It noted that he had some accommodation with an older person which the Corrections Officer thought to be “a step in the right direction”. In a later report however, his progress was described as uneven and his efforts in contacting the Community Corrections Service for an update report were not good at all.
	
	
	The forensic psychiatric report referred to was by a consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Richard Furst. Dr Furst diagnosed a substance dependence, namely alcohol, cannabis and amphetamines and also what he described as borderline/antisocial personality traits. He noted a “history of childhood adversity, abuse and neglect.” Dr Furst thought it likely “that his offences were influenced by his unstable social circumstances, homelessness, and the effects of his chronic drinking and substance abuse.” He also expressed remorse to Dr Furst. He thought that his condition may have contributed “to the poor judgment and impulsivity he displayed when committing the various offences.” He would benefit from “specialist drug and alcohol services available through Justice Health and the Department of Corrective Services for treatment of his substance dependence.” Dr Furst described his “risks of further relapse and re-offending” as requiring “assertive treatment and monitoring in the future, preferably with residential rehabilitation and/or supported accommodation for troubled youth after any custodial sentence he may receive.”
	
	
	Mr Ian Marsh has attempted rehabilitation before at a place called The Glen Centre. He spent, as I have said and taken into account, some months in that centre and a report from the Centre said that the staff “found Ian hard to read at times because there was days when he was very serious about the programme and other days when you could not get him to take anything seriously.” He also spent some time with the Oasis Youth Support Network conducted by the Salvation Army. It noted that when he “began residing in New South Wales, his mental health and drug and alcohol behaviour started to deteriorate.” He had also been admitted to Westmead Hospital.
	



	
	Ian Marsh did some work for his father’s company earlier this year. He received a very good reference from the General Manager of that company who was impressed by his “high level of work ethic, his commitment to doing what is right and following through on completing tasks.” She described him “extremely polite and well mannered, with a desire to do well.” She would be prepared to support him in his endeavours in the future.
	
	
	I have to take into account that when committing all of these offences Ian Marsh was on conditional liberty. That means that courts had released him into the community instead of keeping him in custody provided that he behaved himself. He abused that trust given him by the courts. He had been on a probation order issued by the Children’s Court and two bails which applied to one or more of the offences.
	
	
	Mr W Sandilands who appeared for Mr Marsh called his client to give evidence. Mr Marsh made it clear that he was very sorry for all of the offences that he had committed. When he is released from custody he wants to get away from Sydney and the people he mixes with there. His father will commence conducting a business on the Gold Coast at the end of the year and he would like to do some work with his father.
	
	
	Cross-examined by Ms R Chalmers who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions Ian Marsh confirmed that he had been homeless for some months. His intentions for after he is released became a little unclear but he confirmed that he would like to move away from the city and bad influences and move into the country, perhaps within New South Wales not far from the border with Queensland so that he can have access to his father.
	
	
	I think his prospects for rehabilitation are reasonable, I cannot assess them as high because of the Community Corrections Officer’s report and his previous unsuccessful attempts. But his time in custody he has been using to get off the drugs as much as he can which is a good sign. As Ms Chalmers said, and I accept, he has many more hurdles to go in dealing with the reality of a sober lifestyle. Mr Sandilands suggested that he would benefit from an extended parole period. Ms Chalmers did not take exception to that and in due course I will extend the usual parole period. It will enable him to settle into the community with support.
	
	
	An important factor in this case were the sentences imposed by her Honour Judge Hock in respect of one offender who was present with Mr Marsh at all but one of the offences that he committed. That young man had pleaded guilty to the same assault with intent to rob and the same pair of robberies in company which Ian Marsh has pleaded guilty to. However the other young man’s plea was quite late. Her Honour allowed him a 15% discount. In respect of the assault she imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment and in respect of the robberies in company her Honour sentenced him to a concurrent 10 months sentences but commencing two months into the 12 months sentence. In fact the overall effect was a 12 months sentence. The other offence shared with Mr Marsh was the aggravated enter with intent to steal. The other young man went to trial on that, so did not have the benefit of a plea of guilty. He was found guilty by the jury and convicted. Her Honour fixed a sentence of 20 months with a non-parole period of eight months, accumulated by four months on the Cammeray offences. The overall sentence imposed by her Honour on that young man in respect of the four offences, all of which were also committed by Mr Marsh, was a sentence of two years and two months with a non-parole period of 14 months.
	
	
	In respect to the Cammeray offences I regard it as appropriate to be guided by her Honour’s sentences in respect of those matters. The young man also had a criminal record which included at least one robbery which was committed in another country.
	
	
	In respect of the assault with intent to rob committed at Cammeray I would regard an appropriate sentence for Mr Marsh as being 14 months imprisonment. I would discount that by 25% because he pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and I would round it off at 10 months imprisonment. In respect of each of the robberies in company committed at Cammeray I would regard an appropriate sentence for each of them as being 12 months. Again I would discount that sentence by 25% so that for each of those crimes Mr Marsh will receive a sentence of nine months imprisonment. They are marginally less than the sentences imposed upon the other young man because Mr Marsh pleaded guilty at a much earlier time and is therefore entitled to a greater discount.
	
	
	Again in respect of the aggravated enter dwelling with intent committed at Redfern, I will take as a guide her Honour’s sentence of 20 months imprisonment. However that sentence was imposed after a trial, so for Ian Marsh I would discount it by 25% to 15 months. However I must take into account the additional offence he has asked me to take into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, so I would regard an appropriate sentence for Ian Marsh for that crime as being one of 16 months imprisonment.
	
	
	For the robbery in company committed at Redfern on 15 November 2012, I regard an appropriate sentence as being 12 months imprisonment. Again I would discount that by 25% because Ian Marsh pleaded guilty and I would round it off to nine months imprisonment.
	
	
	In due course I will impose one sentence under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but I need to indicate what my individual sentences would have been. For the assault with intent to rob, as I have said I would have imposed a sentence of 10 months imprisonment. It would have commenced 21 March this year and would expire 20 January 2015.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Sandilands and Mr George, I know you two are noting all these mathematics please because I am going to ask you both at the end to make sure I am right.

So 10 months 21 March 2014 to 20 January 2015.


	
	In respect of each of the robberies in company committed at Cammeray, I have said that I would impose a sentence of nine months imprisonment. I would accumulate that by two months but they would run concurrently each with the other. So the pair of sentences would commence on 21 May 2014 and would expire 20 March 2015. I can see that is wrong straightaway. That should expire on 20 February 2015.
	
	
	In respect of the robbery in company committed 15 November 2012 at Redfern I have indicated that I would have imposed a sentence of nine months imprisonment. I would accumulate that by four months on the other sentences, so that it would have commenced on 21 September 2014 and would expire on 20 June 2015.
	
	
	Finally in respect of the aggravated enter dwelling with intent to steal I would have imposed a sentence of 16 months imprisonment. I would have accumulated that by four months on the other sentences. So that sentence would have commenced on 21 January 2015 and would have expired on 20 May 2016.
	
	
	The overall effect of those sentences which I would have imposed would be a sentence commencing 21 March 2014 and expiring 20 May 2016, an overall sentence of two years and two months imprisonment.
	
	
	The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act envisages that the non-parole period should be 75% of the full sentence. Were I to follow that, the non-parole period for Ian Marsh would be about 19 and a half months but in my opinion there are special circumstances for reducing that, as both Mr Sandilands and Ms Chalmers acknowledged he needs a good amount of time in the community to get himself assistance with rehabilitation and employment. I would reduce his non-parole period to 15 months. It would commence 21 March 2014 and expire 20 June 2015.
	
	
	Under s 53A I propose to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all of the offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each one.
	


HIS HONOUR: Alright now Mr Marsh if you would stand up I am going to sentence you now.


	
	For all of those crimes - all five of them - I sentence you to imprisonment for two years and two months. That is backdated to commence 21 March 2014 and it will finally expire on 20 May 2016. I fix a non-parole period that you have to be in custody for to commence on 21 March 2014 and that will expire next year on 20 June 2015. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I make an order directing the release of Ian Marsh on parole on 20 June 2015.
	


HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Sandilands and Mr George two things. One is the maths, take your time. It is much better than having to come back for a revision of the sentence. The second thing is conditions of parole because I will be fixing conditions of parole, it is under three years. So have a think about those two things and tell me what you think and I would like you to do the maths independently, not one of you do it and compare it, I want to hear from both of you that I have got it right.

SANDILANDS: Your Honour I can indicate that I was going through it as you read it out and I agree with those figures.

HIS HONOUR: You agree, that is a good start. Now Mr George do you agree as well?

GEORGE: Yes your Honour I agree.

HIS HONOUR: That is very encouraging. Now the other thing Mr Sandilands, and I forgot to mention it to you last week, we have got here Dr Furst’s report and we have got something from the Glen, something from Oasis. I can send those by fax to somebody in Correctives. Some prisoners do not want that sort of stuff circulating but the Corrections people say that that sort of material is very helpful to them in classifying prisoners. So would you get some instructions?

SANDILANDS: Yes thanks your Honour I’ve just got instructions saying he’d be happy for those reports to go off.

HIS HONOUR: Happy for them to--

SANDILANDS: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: --okay good, I will sort that out in chambers. There is a fax that we will send them to and I will send those three first, the Glen Centre and Oasis. Now conditions of parole please, the usual but what else?

SANDILANDS: Your Honour I think on the basis in my submissions that in relation to the normal ones of supervision that perhaps to follow the supervision in particular in relation to guidance as to drug and alcohol.

HIS HONOUR: Can I make a recommendation that if he is here - and it is up to him - you are not sure where you are going to go are you when you are out but you would like to go to the country. Are you still thinking that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: I mean and the three of us, the three lawyers were talking about the possibility that you might go up north of this State so you are near your dad. Is that something that is a possibility or too early to say?

OFFENDER: Too early to say but it’s my intention.

HIS HONOUR: It is your intention to get a job with your dad, is that right?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: You are getting on alright with him aren’t you?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Sandilands I could recommend that consideration be given to him being given leave to start employment in Queensland provided he is resident in New South Wales.

SANDILANDS: Thank you your Honour.

GEORGE: It is not opposed.

SANDILANDS: Look your Honour the Corrective Officer was very kindly pointing out to me about the fact that if he wants to reside in Queensland he has got permission off the Parole Board, we went through that last week.

HIS HONOUR: We did yes.

SANDILANDS: Hence that’s why he has got to be in Tweed Heads, it is too hard to go interstate.

HIS HONOUR: Now who are the two people we want to avoid?

SANDILANDS: Yes I’d like a recommendation that--

HIS HONOUR: Let’s get the names right. I did not mention the names in my judgment or sentence because I just cannot remember whether one or all of them is a juvenile.

SANDILANDS: I don’t think they were, I think the juvenile is the one starting I’ll just say with D because I think they’re at the top of Judge Hock’s judgment, WHATU Wautta I think I’m pronouncing it right Wikohika W-i-k and Patrick Thompson exactly.

HIS HONOUR: And they are the two you want to avoid?

SANDILANDS: Yes.


	
	As part of my order I recommend strongly to the Commissioner for Corrective Services that he give consideration to keeping Ian Marsh in separate custody from the offenders Whatu Wikohika and Patrick Thompson. The conditions of Mr Marsh’s parole are these -
	



	
	That he be of good behaviour.
	
	
	The he notify the Registrar of this court of his residential address once released and notify any changes.
	
	
	That he attend court if called upon to do so.
	
	
	That he accept supervision from the Community Corrections Service and accept all reasonable recommendations and directions from an officer of that Service including, in particular, concerning drug and alcohol counselling. I recommend that the Community Corrections Service give favourable consideration to Mr Marsh being able to secure employment with his father in Queensland.
	


HIS HONOUR: I will just leave it at that and they can work out where to go from there. I will explain this to your client in a moment. Anything that I have left out Mr George, Mr Sandilands?

SANDILANDS: Don’t think so your Honour.

GEORGE: Perhaps just if he is to ultimately reside at Tweed Heads and attend for work in Queensland that he only attend Queensland for that purpose and no other.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

SANDILANDS: I can understand that, yes.

HIS HONOUR: I think I will leave the recommendation as it is Mr George. I can see your point but I left it fairly general because it is a recommendation and they may disapprove it, they may approve it, they might even be more generous than we expect, so I have just left it in those general terms.

SANDILANDS: It will be the discretion, I’ve been told, of his Officer. That’s exactly right, it’s discretionary.

HIS HONOUR: Anything else Mr George, Mr Sandilands?

COUNSEL: No.

HIS HONOUR: Okay now Ian Marsh. Am I right in thinking you went off the rails in 2012 with the ice?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: That is when you came back to Sydney from Perth, is that right?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: And things spiralled out of control by the looks of it.

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: You turn 19 next month is that right?

OFFENDER: Turn 20.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry turn 20 next month I mean. Now look you have got a gaol sentence, I had no choice. Mr Sandilands with respect gave you very good advice to start that process. Now your sentence commenced back on 21 March, you have already cut out almost six months of it. Now you have got a sentence of two years and two months. It commenced on 21 March and it will expire on 20 May 2016. Okay that is when the overall sentence expires, so you are still under sentence until that date. I fixed a non-parole period. Normally it should be about 19 months but I have reduced that so you have got more of your sentence on parole and less in custody. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: The non-parole period is 15 months, that also started back on 21 March. That will expire on 20 June next year and I have ordered your release on parole on 20 June next year. Now when you are released I have directed that you accept supervision from Community Corrections - Probation and Parole. Now you have got to make an effort with them, they know what they are doing and they will help you. They are used to helping young men like you and they will give you good help. You will need a lot of support to stay off the drugs and alcohol and away from bad influences. They will help you with that. A couple of formal conditions are you have got to stay out of trouble on parole. If you get into trouble you will be back before me or the Parole Authority will just revoke your parole, so you have got to stay out of trouble. No getting picked up for cannabis use or drink driving or anything like that, you have got to stay clean. When you get out you let the Registrar of the Court here know where you are living and if you change it and if you are called up to court you turn up. Unlike Mr Sales this morning, we do not want to have to issue a bench warrant for you and get you here and use a lot of the Sheriff’s time and police time. If you get a notice you turn up. Otherwise you are in the hands of Community Corrections. You have got to serve the time until June next year because of all those crimes you have committed, robbing people and breaking in and things like that. You have got to do your time for that but I am hoping that when you get out with Community Corrections and perhaps some psychological support that you will be able to get back on the track and get some work with your dad and stay clean. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Up to you - lots of other judges have told you that. Nothing I can do now, it is up to you. And also there are facilities in prison which you can now use because you are sentenced. Dr Furst thought that was a good idea, so if you can kick off some sort of course in prison so that when you are out you have got something already behind you then that is a good start. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Good luck Ian Marsh.

		06 March 2015",2014-08-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704587,Potier v R [2014] NSWCCA 177,"Judgment
1JUDGMENT of the COURT:  These are our reasons for dismissing the application for bail immediately following the completion of the hearing on 27 August 2014.
2Mr Malcolm Huntley Potier has been in custody since 9 May 2000 when he was arrested and charged with two counts of solicit to murder.  He was tried and convicted, and a head sentence of 8 years and 8 months was imposed.  His appeals to the Court of Criminal Appeal were dismissed (there were separate hearings of, first, a sentence appeal:  R v Potier [2004] NSWCCA 136, and then a conviction appeal:  Potier v R [2006] NSWCCA 27).  Special leave to appeal to the High Court was sought, and refused.
3The sentence has been wholly served.  Mr Potier wishes to apply for a review under Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  Mr Potier maintained that he had in fact done so, but the Crown contended that, because of an order made under the Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008 (NSW) (as to which see further below), that had not occurred because leave was required and had not been obtained.  We express no view on the point.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that on any view, the review process, to the extent that it has started at all, remains at a preliminary stage.
4While in custody, Mr Potier was charged with another count of solicit to murder.  He was convicted of this offence in 2006, and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 7 August 2006.  He has an undetermined appeal, or application for leave to appeal, against that conviction, listed for hearing in November 2014.
5Mr Potier has applied for bail before.  By a reserved decision, R A Hulme J refused bail:  Potier v R [2010] NSWCCA 234.  His Honour noted that because of each of ss 9D and 30AA of the (former) Bail Act 1978 (NSW), bail could not be granted unless the Court was satisfied that there were ""special circumstances"" and ""special or exceptional circumstances"" justifying the grant of bail.
6Mr Potier has brought a suite of other proceedings.  No attempt is made in these reasons to identify most of them.  They included an application to review the decision of R A Hulme J, which was the subject of a reserved decision in 2011 (Potier v R [2011] NSWCCA 204).  It is sufficient to refer to the account given by McCallum J in Attorney General in and for the State of New South Wales v Potier [2014] NSWSC 118, where her Honour identifies more than 40 decisions, most of which were applications brought by Mr Potier.  Her Honour made an order, subject to various qualifications, under the Vexatious Proceedings Act 2008 (NSW).  From that order an application for leave to appeal is pending.  What presently matters is that this application for bail is expressly excluded from the operation of that order:  see at [219].
7The non-parole period of Mr Potier's second sentence expired last year.  The Parole Board has determined that Mr Potier is not suitable for parole.  Mr Potier has challenged that decision, and it seems that there is to be a hearing of that challenge next week. 
8It was common ground that Mr Potier's application presently before the Court is dated so long ago as 20 April 2013.  The seeming departure from the obligation in s 22 of the (former) Act and s 71 of the current Act that it be dealt with expeditiously is explained by proceedings relating to a notice to produce Mr Potier issued, which was substantially set aside:  see R v Potier [2014] NSWSC 131.  From that decision Mr Potier has an undetermined application for leave to appeal.  
9The application for bail made in 2013 under the former Act is taken, by reason of cl 8 of Part 2 of Schedule 3 of the Bail Act 2013 (NSW), to be a release application under the current Act.
10The Court of Criminal Appeal unquestionably has power to hear the application, in light of the pending appeal:  s 61, noting the wide definition of ""proceedings for the offence"" which extends to an appeal:  s 5(1)(d).  It was appropriate, in light of previous applications for bail, as well as the extensive and highly unusual procedural background, for the application to be heard and determined by this Court as constituted:  s 67(2).
11Section 74 applies to this application, because there have been previous applications for bail which have been refused (these are deemed to have been, for the purposes of s 74, refusals on a release application under the 2013 Act:  see cl 9 of Schedule 3).  In those circumstances, s 74 requires the Court to refuse to hear the application unless there are grounds for a further release application.  The Crown submitted that no such grounds were disclosed.  Mr Potier maintained that there were.  It was arguable that the material contained in Mr Potier's 2013 affidavits constituted new grounds, and the Court proceeded on the basis, favourable to Mr Potier, that s 74 did not prevent his application being heard.
12However, s 22 also applies because Mr Potier has been convicted and there is a pending appeal in this Court.  It provides that bail is not to be granted or dispensed with ""unless it is established that special or exceptional circumstances exist that justify that bail decision"".  Section 22 replicates the former s 30AA, which was considered and applied by R A Hulme J in 2010.  
13In R v Wilson (1994) 34 NSWLR 1, Kirby P said (at 6), with the agreement of Sheller JA, that it was necessary to show more than an arguable point, but that the applicant is most likely to succeed.  Hunt CJ at CL put the matter still higher.  His Honour said (at 7) ""what must be established is a ground that is certain to succeed - and which can be seen without detailed argument to be certain to succeed"".  
14Subsequent authorities show that the formulation of Hunt CJ at CL puts the threshold too high.  In Petroulias v R [2010] NSWCCA 95 Barr AJ, with whom Hodgson JA and Rothman J agreed, said at [34]:""While I appreciate that the Court must look at the aggregate effect of all the matters relied on as constituting special or exceptional circumstances justifying the grant of bail, it is worth noting that, at least where the grounds of appeal are put forward as the only or the principal factor to demonstrate special or exceptional circumstances, an applicant has to show much more than that the grounds seem arguable.""
15In Miles v R [2012] NSWCCA 88, Schmidt J, with whom Hoeben JA and R S Hulme J agreed, wrote to similar effect.
16Mr Potier submitted that under the Bail Act 2013, those decisions no longer applied.  He relied on s 17(3)(i), which requires a bail authority to have regard to whether an appeal has a reasonably arguable prospect of success in determining whether there is an unacceptable risk.  However, s 17(3)(i) is subject to s 22, which is a specific provision directed to the grant of bail when a conviction or sentence is subject to appeal, and which is expressed to be ""Despite anything to the contrary in this Act"".  It is quite clear that it remains necessary for an applicant to establish ""special or exceptional circumstances"".  
17There were two themes put forward by Mr Potier in support of his application.  The first, which was originally formulated in his affidavits sworn in 2013 when the application was made, and was maintained in a letter dated 14 July 2014 repeating some of those concerns, is that he has had difficulties accessing computers for the purposes of printing documents, such that he was given a USB stick on which to store documents.  He expressed concern that his documents have been examined for security purposes. He inferred that his documents have been read, and asserts that ""the vast majority"" would be covered by legal professional privilege.  He also stated that ""all of my legal work since 2010 has now been compromised, beyond repair"".
18We would accept that it is more difficult for Mr Potier to prosecute proceedings while in prison.  However, against this, it may be noted that (a) in most of Mr Potier's applications, he has acted for himself, and no question of legal professional privilege could arise, (b) there is no evidence to suggest that the documents have been read, or that the information used in them has been used in an improper way and (c) there is no basis for the conclusion that all of his legal work has been ""compromised beyond repair"".  One thing that is clear from the procedural history is that Mr Potier has not been prevented from invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, and repeatedly, either before or after those affidavits were made.
19The second theme of Mr Potier's submissions was directed to the probable success of his appeal from the second conviction and application for review of the first.  Mr Potier identified a deal of additional material on which he sought to rely.  He relied on written submissions 13 August 2014, transcript, copies of recordings of phone conversations, and oral evidence he wished to adduce from a police officer.  In oral address he referred to three matters, described by him as ""fresh, cogent and compelling evidence"".  He claimed that he had never had a fair trial, that there had been a series of misconduct by the Crown, in failing to disclose material evidence and in relying on altered copies of tape recordings.  He said that the evidence from the police officer would establish those matters beyond any doubt.
20Those matters were directed primarily to what occurred at the first trial.  Mr Potier confirmed that the entirety of the testimonial evidence he sought to adduce from the police officer was directed to the evidence at the first trial.  However, as Basten JA said in Potier v R [2011] NSWCCA 204 at [30]:
""the applicant is not serving any sentence in respect of the first two offences. His custody relates solely to his conviction for the third offence. Any issue of bail arises only in respect of that offence.""
21Mr Potier submitted that the material was relevant, because if his inquiry under Pt 7 succeeded and the first conviction (whose sentence has now been served in full) were quashed, then his second conviction ""would be a nullity"".  That is simply not so.  The conviction, and the sentence imposed consequent upon it, stand until set aside on appeal:  New South Wales v Kable [2013] HCA 26; 87 ALJR 737.
22Mr Potier also submitted, principally in reply, that the material was relevant insofar as it had been relied on at his second trial.  That may be so; it is not necessary for us to decide the question.  However, what was perfectly plain is that Mr Potier was unable, either in the voluminous materials on which he relied, or in oral address, to demonstrate such a powerful case as to constitute special or exceptional circumstances.  Mr Potier evidently wished to treat the bail application as the hearing of an appeal, including tendering fresh evidence.  It must be remembered that the power of a court on hearing a bail application pending appeal is exceptional.  The grant of bail undermines the result of a trial and a sentence, and does so without a full hearing as would occur on appeal.  
23Furthermore, the substance of this application is based on the material and arguments sought to be relied on in the substantive appeal from the applicant's second trial.  It is sufficient to say they raise significant problems of relevance and admissibility, quite apart from a detailed analysis of the evidence in two trials, subsequent proceedings and what is submitted to be fresh evidence which appears to be not only substantial but highly contentious.  
24It is not appropriate on a bail application for the Court to analyse and weigh this material for the purpose of considering whether under s 22 of the Bail Act 2013, the applicant has established special or exceptional circumstances exist that would justify a grant of bail.  
25The Court asked Mr Potier early in the hearing to identify the ""special or exceptional circumstances"" on which he relied.  He was given 20 minutes to supplement his written materials.  He was given an opportunity to reply to what had been said, briefly, by the Crown, challenging certain factual and procedural matters which it is not necessary to repeat here.
26At the conclusion of his address in reply, Mr Potier asked for more time.  At one stage he said that he had expected to have a full day to do so, and had been told as much by the Court.  Even if that was said (and we very much doubt that it was) it must have been plain from the fact that there were two conviction and three sentence appeals listed, in addition to his application for bail, that that would not occur.  Further, it must have been plain that a bail application is not a substitute for the final hearing of an appeal.  Mr Potier also asked to supplement what he had put orally by further written submissions.  
27We refused Mr Potier's application to be heard further, either orally or in writing.  We refused this application because nothing in the material to which Mr Potier had pointed in writing or orally came close to demonstrating the requisite special or exceptional circumstances, because there has already been a very lengthy delay in the determination of this application, and because s 71 of the Act requires this Court to deal with the application as soon as reasonably practicable.

2704591,Pavlis v Wetherill Park Market Town Pty Ltd [2014] NSWCA 292,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

On 4 October 2009, Ms Fotini Pavlis (""the plaintiff"") was approaching an ATM at a shopping centre, Wetherill Park Market Town (""Market Town""), when she slipped over and fractured her right arm. The pavement was wet from rain. Both Market Town and its managing agent, Pretti Real Estate Pty Ltd (""Pretti""), accepted they owed a duty of care to the plaintiff; the trial turned on whether there had been breach for failure to take reasonable precautions against the foreseeable risk of someone slipping (see Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), s 5B). 

Some six months before the slip, the pavement outside Market Town had been painted with a paint containing a non-slip additive. Relying on an expert's report, the plaintiff argued that was insufficient: despite the non-slip paint the pavement remained prone to being slippery when wet and further preventive measures could have been taken to reduce that risk. The plaintiff's expert also adverted to the area where the slip occurred as not having been recently treated with non-slip paint. While finding the surface remained prone to being slippery when wet, the trial judge found the application of the non-slip paint a reasonable precaution, especially as there was no evidence that anyone else had slipped in the area. The possibility that non-slip paint had not been recently applied to where the slip occurred was dismissed as merely a suggestion.

Pretti had defended the proceedings and sought to be indemnified by Market Town for the costs. The management agreement appointing Pretti as Market Town's agent contained an indemnity clause which provided that Market Town was obligated to indemnify where proceedings were taken against Pretti ""in the course of or arising out of the proper performance of any of [its] powers, duties or authorities"". Market Town resisted the claim for indemnity as to Pretti's costs in defending Ms Pavlis' claim on the basis that the clause did not extend to proceedings which were concerned with a claim of non-performance. The trial judge rejected that argument and ordered that Market Town indemnify Pretti for the costs of the proceeding.

On appeal the plaintiff challenged the conclusion that the precautions taken were reasonable on the basis that a finding should have been made that the plaintiff slipped in an area not treated by the non-slip paint and that, in any event, further precautions should have been taken as the pavement remained prone to being slippery when wet. Market Town sought leave to appeal from the finding that it was liable to indemnify Pretti. 

The Court (Basten JA, Meagher JA and Leeming JA) held, dismissing the appeal on liability, and granting leave but dismissing the appeal on indemnity:

Liability
1. There was no error in the trial judge's conclusion that reasonable precautions had been taken against the risk of someone slipping. The trial judge was entitled to treat as a mere ""suggestion"" that the area where the slip occurred had not been treated with the non-slip paint. Furthermore, as the trial judge correctly noted, the fact the pavement remained prone to being slippery when wet did not mean that a duty of care required further precautions - a conclusion reinforced by the lack of evidence that anyone else had slipped in the area: [26]-[33], [38]

Indemnity 
2. There is no reason to read the indemnity clause as restricting the general law right of an agent to be indemnified by its principal for all liabilities reasonably incurred or discharged in the execution of the agent's authority. Nor is there any reason to read the clause as excluding a claim for the non-negligent performance of its duties: [45]

			Judgment

1BASTEN JA: On the morning of 4 October 2009 Ms Fotini Pavlis (""the plaintiff"") drove to a shopping centre, Wetherill Park Market Town, in order to obtain cash from an ATM. The ATM was located on the external wall of the shopping centre, facing the car park where the plaintiff parked. There was an arcade approximately two metres wide, along which the plaintiff walked in order to approach the ATM. The pavement of the arcade sloped gently towards the car park. As the arcade was open to the weather, that design allowed rain to run off the pavement into the gutter.

2It had been raining (or was raining) when the plaintiff approached the ATM. The pavement was wet. The plaintiff lost her footing and fell, fracturing her right arm, near the wrist.

3In 2011, the plaintiff commenced proceedings in the District Court against a number of parties, seeking damages for negligence. On 27 May 2013 Judge Olsson dismissed the proceedings on the basis that no breach of duty had been established. Against the possibility that her judgment on liability might be reversed, she assessed damages in an amount of approximately $100,000.

4The plaintiff appealed from that judgment, alleging that the trial judge was in error in failing to find liability on the part of the occupier of the shopping centre, Wetherill Park Market Town Pty Ltd (""Market Town"") and the managing agent for the shopping centre, Pretti Real Estate Pty Ltd (""Pretti""). The plaintiff also challenged the amount of damages assessed by the trial judge.

5The plaintiff commenced separate proceedings in this Court by summons seeking leave to appeal from a District Court judgment as to costs relating to an early stage of the trial which was aborted when the plaintiff collapsed in the witness box. The summons was abandoned on the hearing of the appeal and requires only an order that it be dismissed and that any costs associated with that proceeding be costs in the appeal.

6There was a third proceeding before the Court, namely a summons brought by Market Town against Pretti. Although both Market Town and Pretti were exonerated by the judgment at trial, Market Town was ordered, pursuant to a contractual indemnity, to pay Pretti's costs of defending the proceedings brought against it. Market Town sought to challenge that finding. For reasons given below, the summons should be dismissed with costs.

7With respect to the primary appeal, brought by the plaintiff, the judgment of the trial judge was not shown to be erroneous and the judgment dismissing the proceedings against both Market Town and Pretti should be upheld. In the circumstances, there is no need to address the contingent assessment of damages. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.

Factual background
8Although there was no pleading as to the nature and content of the duty of care, it was common ground that both Market Town and Pretti owed the plaintiff, as a member of the public having access to the shopping centre, a duty to take reasonable care for her safety. Most of the pleaded particulars of negligence were inappropriate or too generally expressed to be helpful. However, the factual issues identified in the course of the trial fell within a narrow compass. Both defendants accepted that the arcade was exposed to the elements and likely to become wet in rain. It was also accepted that the paving was liable to be slippery when wet. 

9The judge accepted that, in April 2009, less than six months before the plaintiff's accident, ""Pretti arranged and paid for the tiled surface at the exterior of the shopping centre to be painted with a paint that contained a non-slip additive and compound"": judgment, p 14. The judge accepted that the exterior tiled area was ""painted with a paint which included anti-skid assistant powder and a non-slip additive"". (Whether the surface was ""tiled"" is doubtful, given Mr Pretti's evidence noted below; why Mr Adams described it as such was not revealed in his report.)

10The plaintiff did not contend that the steps thus taken were inappropriate: rather, she raised questions as to whether -
(a) the use of non-slip products was an adequate precaution;
(b) the whole of the relevant area was painted, and
(c) the paint had deteriorated over the period of six months, so as to require a further coat or replacement.

11Pretti was able to produce the invoices for the work done in April 2009, so that the actual products used were known. There was no criticism of the use of those products, assuming that painting was an adequate response to the known risk.

12The plaintiff's case turned upon an expert report prepared by Neil Adams and Associates, who described themselves as ""safety management and ergonomics consultants"". Mr Neil D Adams visited the premises on 17 December 2009, with the plaintiff and her solicitor, took photographs and made measurements of the slip resistance of the floor in the area where the incident occurred. Mr Adams described his findings in the following passages:

""The walkway surface immediately adjacent to the ATM, and extending further to the east, is lightly textured - consistent with having been painted relatively recently with a product that incorporated a non-slip additive. However, the adjoining area where Ms Pavlis slipped was significantly smoother, particularly hear the heavily trafficked centre of the walkway and close to the edges - consistent with having been painted some time ago with a product that incorporated a non-slip additive that has since been significantly worn away ....

...

I measured coefficients of friction on the walkway after wetting it with clean water. ... I made measurements in five different locations, and with the pendulum swinging in different directions. As those measurements were made within only about two months of the incident, it is not necessary to consider the issue of potential surface wear. The measurements that I made (see Table 1) reveal a high level of uniformity between the different measurement sites.""

13Mr Adams was of the view that, although the current Australian and New Zealand Standards do not specify certain coefficients of friction as being ""safe"" or ""unsafe"", the table of ""wet pendulum results"" contained in AS4663:2004 indicated that, on the readings he obtained, the surface would be classified as providing a ""high"" notional contribution to the risk of slipping when wet with water. (In fact, the average reading of 33BPN was close to the margin between ""moderate"" and ""high"", although it was common ground that the slope of 5 degrees increased the risk of a slip.) Mr Adams acknowledged that:

""While it is not appropriate to infer that a surface is 'safe' or 'unsafe' solely on the basis of measured coefficients of friction, because the likelihood of pedestrians experiencing slips on a surface is only partly dependant [sic] on the surface characteristics, it is possible, usually by undertaking objective measurements, to determine the relative contribution that a given surface might be expected to make to the overall risk that a slip might occur. The total risk that a slip might occur on any given surface is dependant [sic] both on the frictional characteristics of that particular surface, as well as on a range of contributing factors, including: the presence of potential lubricants (eg water), footwear ...; pedestrian awareness of the level of available friction; whether the pedestrian is turning or exerting other forces on the surface; other aspects of gait; lighting; differentials between adjacent surfaces; and others.""

14That Mr Adams declined to make any allowance for the period of nine weeks wear between the time of the accident and when he conducted his measurements provided a dilemma for the plaintiff. If the relevant surface had been painted some 25 weeks before the accident, it is not clear whether Mr Adams would have made any allowance for deterioration in the surface over that period. Thus if the painting was an adequate response to the perceived risk when undertaken, the lapse of time was immaterial. (There was other evidence to that effect.)

15The defendants obtained a report from Dr John Cooke, a consultant architect. Mr Cooke did not carry out his investigations until 23 November 2011 (proceedings not having been commenced until 2011). He relied upon further tests carried out by Mr Strautins in June 2011 which reported a reading of 35BPN under wet conditions. Dr Cooke accepted that Mr Adams' results would have more accurately reflected the level of slip resistance at the time of the incident than his own, but there was no evidence as to the likely margin of error.

16Dr Cooke agreed that the surface should have been treated with a material resulting in a ""low"" notional contribution to the risk of slipping, and that the surface should have been regularly checked. Dr Cooke had access to information about the products used when the surface was painted in April 2009, which he described as ""a reasonable preventative measure."" He was also of the view that the adequacy of the surface should have been checked ""at regular intervals of about six months.""

17The trial judge considered this material with some care. She accepted that the defendants would have appreciated the risk of slipping on the ""tiles"" when wet, and for that reason had arranged to have the tiles painted with non-slip additives in the paint. She did not, however, accept that the defendants knew or should have known that, having been painted, the area remained dangerously slippery when wet. She noted that there was ""no evidence that anyone had slipped in that area, either before the plaintiff's accident or since"": judgment, p 15.

18The possibility that the whole of the area had not been painted in April 2009 was also addressed. The trial judge noted the somewhat vague suggestion of Mr Adams that part of the area had been painted ""relatively recently"" and that the area where the plaintiff slipped had been painted ""some time ago"". However, she accepted the evidence of Mr Pretti who had supervised the painting that the whole area had been painted in April 2009. Although the experts were not cross-examined, Mr Pretti was. He was asked about the area near the ATM machine. Mr Pretti's evidence-in-chief included the following, at Tcpt, p 106(35):

""Q. Do you recall in 2009 speaking to a company about doing some work on an area of floor outside the entrance to the shopping centre?
A. The whole pathway area.

Q. When you say the whole pathway area is that an area that goes - that includes the front of the shopping centre?
A. It does.

Q. And can you recall at the time before the work was done ... was it a tiled area or some other substance?
A. No, not tiles, concrete - concrete pattern.""

19In cross-examination the following exchange occurred, at Tcpt, p 111(46):

""Q. When you think about that ATM machine that was there and the work which was done on it in April 2009, can you remember - 
A. The pathway.

Q. The pathway. Can you remember the work that was done? Did you watch it being done.
A. Not a certain area. The whole area. It was gurneyed and cleaned one night.

Q. Gurneyed and cleaned?
A. They gurneyed the whole area. 
...

Q. And then what was done after that?
A. The next day they put a coat on the paint [sic].

Q. So they painted the surface after it had been cleaned?
A. With a roller. Yes.

Q. And you saw them applying that with a roller?
A. Yes I did.""

20It was not expressly put to Mr Pretti that any area of the arcade or pathway was not painted, but it was in any event clear from his evidence that the whole area was painted. It also appeared from Mr Pretti's evidence that the area had not previously been painted with non-slip paint. Nor was it correct to say that there were tiles underneath the paint: Mr Pretti was clear that it was patterned concrete.

21The photographs certainly supported the view that the paint had worn or been chipped in some areas to a greater extent than in others. However, the evidence was silent as to when that had occurred.

Assessment of evidence
22The trial judge was conscious of the test to be applied under s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). The plaintiff bore the onus of demonstrating that the defendants had failed to take precautions against a risk that was foreseeable and not insignificant, being precautions that a reasonable person in their position would have taken: s 5B(1). Amongst other factors, she was required to take into account ""the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken"": s 5B(2)(a). This should be understood as a reference to the likelihood that the risk would materialise if the identified precautions were not taken.

23In assessing the evidence, the trial judge took into account the following factors:
(a) it was a reasonable precaution to apply paint with non-slip additives to the pathway;
(b) the whole of the pathway had been painted less than six months before the accident;
(c) the evidence of Dr Cooke accepted that the area should be inspected every six months, being a period extending beyond the period for which the paint had been applied prior to the accident;
(d) although Mr Adams had identified various measures which could reasonably have been taken to reduce any risk of harm, he did not say that any particular measure should have been taken, and
(e) there was no evidence that any person had slipped in the area since it had been painted.

24Taking these factors into account the judge was not satisfied that either of the defendants was required to take any steps other than those which had been taken, prior to the accident.

Grounds of appeal
25Ground 1 identified three factual errors (as relied upon at the hearing) in rejecting the claim of negligence. 

26The first error was in finding that the plaintiff had slipped on the surface of the pathway which had been painted within six months. Based on Mr Adams' description of the area, the judge should have found, it was submitted, that the plaintiff slipped on ""an adjoining area"" where the surface was worn and smoother, consistent with it having been painted ""some time before"" the April application of non-slip paint.

27Mr Adams' evidence was vague as to timing. Further, the readings which he took at the time of his inspection did not demonstrate that one area was more slip resistant than another. Mr Pretti's evidence was inconsistent with two applications of paint at different times; nor was it suggested to Mr Pretti that there had been two separate administrations of non-slip paint. There was no error in the judge's finding in this respect.

28The second alleged error was in failing to find that the plaintiff slipped on a surface which ""would have been very likely to be experienced as slippery when wet.""

29The judge did not make a contrary finding: she accepted that the testing of the area suggested that the surface did make a high notional contribution to the risk of slipping when wet. Correctly, the judge also noted that such a finding did not of itself demonstrate that other precautions ought reasonably to have been taken. Further, she placed some weight upon the fact that there was no evidence of anyone else having slipped in that area, nor of any previous complaint. It was not suggested to Mr Pretti that there had been any complaint since the painting was undertaken. The fact that there had been a complaint of slipping in another part of the area, before the painting was undertaken, was said to contradict the finding of the trial judge in this respect. However, that was so only if the area where the plaintiff slipped had not be painted: for reasons already explained, the judge was satisfied that the whole of the pathway had been painted and there was no reason to overturn that conclusion. That was described as the judge's ""cardinal error"".

30The third factual error was again based upon Mr Adams' evidence that there was a difference in the smoothness of the surface where the plaintiff slipped and the area immediately adjacent to it.

31The judge said that there was ""a suggestion"" in Dr Adams' report that there was such a difference: the plaintiff contended that it was wrong to dismiss this evidence as less than a statement of fact. 

32On first blush, the criticism of the judge's language was legitimate. Mr Adams made a statement as to his observations, which was supported by photographs showing that one section of the painted concrete appeared to be more worn than another section. However, when he prepared his report, Mr Adams was not apprised of the information available from Mr Pretti as to the work done in April 2009, nor that no other work had been done between that date and the date of the incident. No further opinion was obtained from Mr Adams after that information became available.

33As best one can tell from Mr Adams' report (he did not give oral evidence) no testing was done of the adjacent area. His opinion as to the cause of the visual appearance in December 2009 was not based on information or expertise. There was no error in the trial judge rejecting it in the light of the other evidence, as she did. In these circumstances, the description of his opinion as ""a suggestion"" was understandable and did not reveal error. To give some greater weight to a casual observation of that kind is to accord an expert's report a degree of significance not warranted by the application of any identifiable expertise, and would be contrary to the approach adopted in Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar [2011] HCA 21; 243 CLR 588. None of these matters identified relevant error.

34A fourth error was said to be the finding that the plaintiff could not ""point to something that the owner or agent should have done that would have had the necessary effect of preventing her from falling"": judgment, p 20. This finding of the trial judge was directed to causation and involved an application of s 5D of the Civil Liability Act.

35On one view, the judge's finding on causation was consequential upon finding that negligence had not been established. In other words, a plaintiff who has failed to establish that a particular precaution would have been taken by a reasonable person in the position of the defendant cannot, logically, establish that the failure to take that specific precaution caused the injury. Even if, as the plaintiff submitted, what was required was painting so as to achieve a degree of friction consistent with the relevant Australian Standard, as a result of which the accident probably would not have occurred, nevertheless the judge, for reasons already given, was entitled to conclude that a failure to satisfy that Standard did not involve negligence. Accordingly, the conclusion with respect to causation was immaterial.

36Further grounds, described as ""legal errors"", were little more than a repetition of the alleged factual errors in different guise. The submissions in support of the grounds recognised, in part, that that was so. One additional complaint was raised as a supposed legal error, namely the statement by the trial judge that ""[t]he notion that the plaintiff slipped and, therefore, it must have been slippery is an example of hindsight reasoning and not appropriate"": judgment, p 21. The plaintiff says that that was never part of her case.

37The statement of the trial judge is elliptical. Coming at the end of the section of her judgment dealing with liability, after reaching conclusions that the defendants did all that was reasonably required of them, and in circumstances where there was no evidence that others had slipped in the area either before or after the plaintiff's accident, she may have intended all that remained as accurately described by the proposition. To suggest that in some way she misunderstood the plaintiff's case would be to disregard the manner in which she had dealt with the plaintiff's case over the preceding pages of the judgment.

38In broad terms, the plaintiff's case did depend upon two propositions. The first (not in dispute) was that the plaintiff slipped and fell; the second was that the experts agreed that the slip resistance of the area where she fell, at least when the surface was wet, was significantly lower than the coefficient recommended by the Australian Standard for such walkways. Each factor was significant and was accepted by the trial judge. The countervailing factors relevant to liability relied on by the defendants were (a) that a risk had been identified and precautions taken less than six months prior to the accident; (b) that the precautions taken were reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, and (c) that the relevant precautions could reasonably be expected to have effect for a period of not less than six months. In weighing those competing considerations, no error has been demonstrated on the part of the trial judge in failing to be satisfied that either or both of the defendants had failed to take reasonable precautions against the risk of harm which materialised. Although no doubt the risk was foreseeable, the absence of evidence that it had materialised in any other case in a busy shopping centre suggested that, if not insignificant, the risk was not high. That was a factor properly taken into account in deciding on what precautions were reasonably necessary.

39In these circumstances, no error having been identified, the appeal must be dismissed. The appellant must pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.

Pretti's claim for indemnity
40Having held that neither Market Town nor Pretti were liable to the plaintiff, the trial judge upheld Pretti's cross-claim for indemnity against Market Town for the cost of defending the proceedings. The claim was based on a clause in a common form used to appoint managing agents of property. Clause 15 of the contract provided:

""15. The Principal will hold and keep indemnified the Agent against all actions, suits, proceedings, claims, costs and expenses whatsoever which may be taken or made against the Agent in the course of or arising out of the proper performance of any of the powers, duties or authorities of the Agent hereunder.""

41The basis on which Market Town resisted the claim for indemnity was not that the amounts incurred were unreasonable or unrelated to the proper defence of the plaintiff's action; rather, it relied upon the proposition that the plaintiff's claim did not allege that Pretti acted negligently in the performance of its functions as managing agent, but that it failed to take steps which it ought reasonably to have taken in fulfilment of its duty to persons using the shopping centre. This, Market Town asserted, was a claim of non-performance, which did not fall within the terms of cl 15.

42This narrow reading of cl 15 was said to gain support from the decision of this Court in Laresu Pty Ltd v Clark [2010] NSWCA 180. Mr Clark fell and injured himself whilst using a stairwell (on common property) in a commercial building. The stairwell had an automatic light switch which turned off at 6.30pm. As Mr Clark was using the common property after that time, the light was off. Noting that the clause only applied where there was a relevant ""performance"" of the agreement, the Court held that ""the indemnity would still not apply to a failure to perform such as occurred here"": at [90]. 

43Laresu is distinguishable on a combination of three considerations. First, although the Court, for reasons which were not fully articulated, placed no weight upon this matter, the indemnity applied to ""performance"" of the agreement and did not refer to costs incurred in ""proper performance"". Secondly, the indemnity was sought not merely in respect of a claim which had been successfully resisted, but in respect of conduct which was found to be negligent. Thirdly, the negligence was not merely negligent performance of a duty, but a total failure or non-performance of the duty to light the stairwell. 

44Market Town acknowledged that Laresu did not resolve the issue for present purposes. However, it sought to rely upon the principle applied in Laresu, namely that ""the liability of the surety is strictissimi juris and that ambiguous contractual provisions should be construed in favour of the surety"": see Ankar Pty Ltd v National Westminster Finance (Australia) Ltd [1987] HCA 15; 162 CLR 549 at 561. 

45It may be assumed, favourably to Market Town, that the principle applied. That is supported, on one view, by what was held in Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Ltd [2004] HCA 28; 217 CLR 424, but the general approach is not free from controversy: see Gardiner v Agricultural and Rural Finance Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 235 at [14]-[21] and see T Prince, ""Guarantees and Indemnities"", in P Herzfeld, T Prince and S Tully, Interpretation and Use of Legal Sources - The Laws of Australia (Thomson Reuters, 2013) at [25.3.760]; S Chistensen and W Duncan, The Construction and Performance of Commercial Contracts (Federation Press 2014), pp 481-484. It is not necessary to say anything further about that controversy, which was not the subject of argument in this Court. It is sufficient to note that Ankar was concerned with a guarantee by a surety for the performance of a commercial leasing agreement where the owner was a finance company. The question was whether the breach by the owner of a contractual obligation discharged the surety. The contract did not specify the effect of breach. Those circumstances are materially different from those involving the appointment of an agent to manage commercial premises for the owner. Under the general law, an agent is indemnified by its principal against all liabilities reasonably incurred or discharged by the agent in the execution of its authority: Thacker v Hardy (1878) 4 QBD 685. That general law indemnity did not extend to liability incurred in the breach of the agent's duties, but would have extended to the circumstances of the present case. There is no reason to read cl 15 of the written agreement as restricting the general right of indemnity. Nor is there any reason to read the language of the clause referring to ""the proper performance of any of the powers, duties or authorities of the Agent"" under the agreement, as excluding the non-negligent performance of its duties. The claim was for the costs incurred in defending the proceedings brought by the plaintiff: although the grammatical structure of the first limb of cl 15 leaves much to be desired, it clearly extends to the costs incurred by the agent with respect to proceedings brought against it arising out of such non-negligent conduct. If the liability of the principal under the indemnity was to be judged by the nature of the claim in the proceedings, the more extreme the claim, the less the likelihood that the indemnity would apply. There is no sensible reason for adopting such a construction of cl 15.

46Market Town should have leave to appeal against the order that it indemnify Pretti, but the appeal must be dismissed with costs.

Orders
47The appellant filed a notice of motion seeking to rely on further evidence. That application was abandoned and the motion should be dismissed.

48The Court should make the following orders:

In matter 2012/396652:
(1) Dismiss the summons.
(2) Order that the costs in this matter be costs in the appeal.

In matter 2013/165726: 
(1) Dismiss the appeal.
(2) Dismiss the motion seeking to rely on further evidence.
(3) Order that the appellant pay the respondents' costs of the appeal, including the motion, and the summons.

In matter 2013/222589:
(1) Grant the applicant (Market Town) leave to appeal against the order as to indemnification.
(2) Dismiss the appeal.
(3) Order that the applicant pay the respondent's costs of the proceeding in this Court.

49MEAGHER JA: I agree with Basten JA.

2704593,R v X [2014] NSWCCA 168,"Judgment


	
	SIMPSON J: I agree with Hidden J. I also agree with the additional observations of Hamill J.
	
	
	HIDDEN J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the order of a District Court judge permanently staying proceedings on indictment against the respondent. He was to face trial upon charges of being an accessory before the fact to the manufacture of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and supplying a large commercial quantity of the same drug.
	
	
	Put shortly, it is alleged that the respondent was involved with a number of men in the manufacture of a large quantity of the drug at a property at Werris Creek. As to the first count, it is the Crown case that in late November 2010 he took part in setting up a laboratory at that property, where the drug was manufactured by three other men. It is then alleged that on 15 December 2010 the drug and the equipment used to manufacture it were packed into three vans for transport from the site. The respondent drove one of those vans, which was stopped by police in the Quirindi area for a random breath test. Police searched the van and found the laboratory equipment, and a further search revealed a large amount of MDA, well in excess of the commercial quantity. This is the basis of the second count.
	
	
	On 15 December 2010, the respondent was charged with possessing drug manufacturing apparatus, to which he later pleaded guilty. However, on 17 December he was charged with manufacturing and supplying a large commercial quantity of MDA. In the District Court the charge of manufacturing the drug was changed to one of accessory before the fact of that offence.
	
	
	The respondent's trial was to commence on 10 September 2013. In the meantime, on 2 March 2011, a summons was issued requiring his attendance at the Australian Crime Commission for a compulsory examination under s 25A of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. The examination took place on 8 March 2011, and during it he was questioned about the subject matter of the charges against him. By s 30(2) of the Act he was required to answer those questions. However, the combined effect of subss (4) and (5) of that section is that any answer which he claimed might tend to incriminate him could not be used against him at his trial. He made that claim in respect of the whole of his evidence.
	
	
	Section 25A(9) of the Act provides:
	


""An examiner may direct that:

 (a) any evidence given before the examiner; or

(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the examiner; or

(c) any information that might enable a person who has given evidence before the examiner to be identified; or

(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at an examination;

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the examiner specifies. The examiner must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been, or may be, charged with an offence.""

By subs (10), the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission may vary or revoke a direction under subs (9), but must not do so if that direction might, among other things, ""prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence"": subs (11).


	
	In the present case the examiner made a non-publication order under subs (9). The order was directed ""to any person including New South Wales investigators who may be involved in the investigation of the matters relating to"" the respondent, and also including ""any member of the office of the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions and any member of the judiciary or judiciary staff of the court who might be involved in any way in the prosecution ... ."" On 27 August 2013, the Chief Executive Officer varied that order so as to permit disclosure of the transcript of the examination to the respondent, his lawyers and the court. As a result, when the application for a permanent stay was heard the trial judge had access to the transcript, as did the respondent and his counsel and solicitor, but the Crown prosecutor and his instructing solicitor did not.
	
	
	It is because of that order (as varied) that the court was closed for the hearing of this appeal and the respondent is not named.
	
	
	The trial judge determined that the prosecution should be stayed in the light of the decision of the High Court in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29, 248 CLR 92. The plaintiff in that case had been charged with indictable Commonwealth offences and, while awaiting trial for them, he underwent an examination under the Australian Crime Commission Act (referred to in the judgments as the ""ACC Act"") in which he was asked and answered questions concerning the subject matter of the offences with which he had been charged. The examiner had given a direction under s 25A(9), so that prosecutors and police officers involved in the prosecution were not entitled to receive a copy of his evidence.
	
	
	The plaintiff commenced proceedings in the original jurisdiction of the High Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. A case was stated for the consideration of the Full Court, raising several questions of law. The question which is material for present purposes asked whether the relevant provisions of the ACC Act empowered an examiner ""to conduct an examination of a person charged with a Commonwealth indictable offence where that examination concerns the subject matter of the offence so charged?"" The court, by majority (Hayne, Bell and Kiefel JJ; French CJ and Crennan J dissenting), answered that question ""No"".
	
	
	In a joint judgment, Hayne and Bell JJ, with whom Kiefel J agreed in a separate judgment, said at [70]-[71] (127):
	


""The relevant provisions of the ACC Act should not be construed as authorising the compulsory examination of a person charged with, but not yet tried for, an indictable Commonwealth offence about the subject matter of the pending charge. Permitting the Executive to ask, and requiring an accused person to answer, questions about the subject matter of a pending charge would alter the process of criminal justice to a marked degree, whether or not the answers given by the accused are admissible at trial or kept secret from those investigating or prosecuting the pending charge.

Requiring the accused to answer questions about the subject matter of a pending charge prejudices the accused in his or her defence of the pending charge (whatever answer is given). Even if the answer cannot be used in any way at the trial, any admission made in the examination will hinder, even prevent, the accused from challenging at trial that aspect of the prosecution case. And what would otherwise be a wholly accusatorial process, in which the accused may choose to offer no account of events, but simply test the sufficiency of the prosecution evidence, is radically altered. An alteration of that kind is not made by a statute cast in general terms. If an alteration of that kind is to be made, it must be made by express words or necessary intendment.""


	
	The question was one of statutory interpretation. Their Honours applied the established rule of construction known as the principle of legality, drawn from Maxwell's On the Interpretation of Statutes, that the legislature should not be understood to have departed ""from the general system of law"" without expressing its intention ""with irresistible clearness ..."": [86] - [87] (131-2). Their Honours said that for this purpose questions of fairness ""must be put to one side because they are not relevant"": [90] (133).
	
	
	At [97] (134-5) ff their Honours examined the process of criminal justice, emphasising its accusatorial nature. At [99] (135) their Honours said:
	


""The criminal trial process is accusatorial in the sense that it is for the prosecution to decide what charge is preferred against the accused. The trial process is accusatorial in the further sense that the prosecution bears the onus of proof of all elements of the charge that is laid. But describing these aspects of a criminal trial as 'accusatorial' must not distract attention from the much wider and no less fundamental observation that the whole process of criminal justice, commencing with the investigation of crime and culminating in the trial of an indictable Commonwealth offence, is accusatorial."" (Footnote omitted)


	
	At [101] (136) their Honours added:
	


""As will be shown, the whole of the process for the investigation, prosecution and trial of an indictable Commonwealth offence is accusatorial. It is accusatorial in the sense that an accused person is not called on to make any answer to an allegation of wrong-doing, or to any charge that is laid, until the prosecuting authorities have made available to the accused particulars of the evidence on which it is proposed to rely in proof of the accusation that is made. And even after that information has been provided, the accused person need say or do nothing more than enter a plea of guilty or not guilty to the charge. If the accused person chooses to plead not guilty at trial, he or she is entitled to put the prosecution to proof of the charge and, as part of that process, to test the strength of the evidence which the prosecution adduces at trial. The only relevant limit on the accused person's testing of the strength of the prosecution's case is provided by the accused person's instructions to his or her lawyer. The lawyer cannot test the prosecution case in a manner inconsistent with the accused person's instructions.""


	
	After examining the privilege against self-incrimination and the ""right to silence"", and tracing the criminal process from charge to trial, their Honours said at [118] (140):
	


""The preceding description of the investigation, prosecution and trial of an indictable Commonwealth offence demonstrates that, at every stage, the process of criminal justice is accusatorial. It is against this background that the provisions of the ACC Act, particularly s 28(1), must be construed. If these provisions were to permit the compulsory examination of a person charged with an offence about the subject matter of the pending charge, they would effect a fundamental alteration to the process of criminal justice.""

Section 28(1) is the provision whereby an examiner may summons a person to appear for examination and to produce such documents or other things as are referred to in the summons.


	
	After referring to some statutory modifications of the accusatorial process, their Honours said at [124] (142-3), in a passage cited by the trial judge in the present case:
	


""Even if the answers given at a compulsory examination are kept secret, and therefore cannot be used directly or indirectly by those responsible for investigating and prosecuting the matters charged, the requirement to give answers, after being charged, would fundamentally alter the accusatorial judicial process that begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in the accusatorial (and adversarial) trial in the courtroom. No longer could the accused person decide the course which he or she should adopt at trial, in answer to the charge, according only to the strength of the prosecution's case as revealed by the material provided by the prosecution before trial, or to the strength of the evidence led by the prosecution at the trial. The accused person would have to decide the course to be followed in light of that material and in light of any self-incriminatory answers which he or she had been compelled to give at an examination conducted after the charge was laid. That is, the accused person would have to decide what plea to enter, what evidence to challenge and what evidence to give or lead at trial according to what answers he or she had given at the examination. The accused person is thus prejudiced in his or her defence of the charge that has been laid by being required to answer questions about the subject matter of the pending charge.""

Their Honours added at [125] (143) that ""if an alteration of that kind is to be made to the criminal justice system by statute, it must be made clearly by express words or by necessary intendment.""


	
	Their Honours went on to examine earlier decisions of the court which were relevant, albeit in different contexts, and the functions of the Australian Crime Commission set out in the ACC Act. There is, of course, in the Act no provision expressly authorising the examination of a person charged with an offence about the subject matter of that charge. The question was whether such authority might be found in the Act by necessary intendment. Their Honours concluded that it could not. After considering the Commission's investigative function, their Honours said at [147] (150):
	


""The performance of that investigative function is in no way restricted or impeded if the power of compulsory examination does not extend to examination of a person who has been charged with, but not yet tried for, an indictable Commonwealth offence about the subject matter of the pending charge. The general provisions made for compulsory examination, when read in their context, do not imply, let alone necessarily imply, any qualification to the fundamentally accusatorial process of criminal justice which is engaged with respect to indictable Commonwealth offences.""


	
	It should be pointed out that the decision in X7 was handed down on 26 June 2013, well after the compulsory examination of the respondent. To have examined him about matters in respect of which he had been charged, provided that the safeguards afforded by s 25A of the ACC Act were in place, was consistent with authority prevailing at that time: Australian Crime Commission v OK (Emmett & Jacobson JJ, Spender J dissenting) [2010] FCAFC 61, 185 FCR 258. The view of the majority in OK was subsequently adopted by this court in R v CB [2011] NSWCCA 264 and R v Seller & McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42.
	
	
	Of course, in X7 the court was not called upon to consider whether the consequence of the compulsory examination of a person awaiting trial for an offence about the subject matter of the charge should be a permanent stay of the prosecution. The trial judge in the present case said that X7 did not ""create a class of persons who would be automatically entitled to a stay of proceedings"" and that he was ""still required to consider the case on its merits and to apply those principles relevant to taking the significant step of granting a stay of proceedings."" (Although the principles stated by the majority were expressed to be referable to the trial of an indictable Commonwealth offence, that was simply a reference to the manner in which the question for the court had been framed. It was accepted before the trial judge that those principles were of general application.)
	
	
	His Honour referred to authority on the remedy of a permanent stay, particularly to prevent an abuse of process, including Jago v The District Court of New South Wales & Ors (1989) 168 CLR 23. One of the cases to which he referred was the Canadian decision of R v Regan [2002] SCC 12, from which his Honour cited the following passage in the judgment of the majority at para 54:
	


""Regardless of whether the abuse causes prejudice to the accused, because of an unfair trial, or to the integrity of the justice system, a stay of proceedings will only be appropriate when two criteria are met:

(1) the prejudice caused by the abuse in question

will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; and

(2) no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that prejudice.""

(Reference to authority omitted.)


	
	His Honour examined the transcript of the examination of the respondent, noting that it related to the matters charged ""virtually in its entirety"" and ""was conducted at times in a forceful manner by counsel assisting the examiner ... ."" He appears also to have been concerned that material in the examination may have come into the possession of investigating police, contrary to the examiner's non-publication order. He noted that there had been a previous examination of the respondent by the Crime Commission and said that it was ""somewhat difficult to understand"" why the examination in question was conducted, given that the respondent was only asked about the matters for which he was charged.
	
	
	He also noted that on 2 March 2011, the day upon which the summons requiring the respondent's attendance for compulsory examination was issued, two police officers had attended upon him in custody to question him about the charges but he had declined to be interviewed. His Honour said that there was no evidence that at that stage the police knew the whereabouts of the Werris Creek property where the manufacture of the drug was said to have been undertaken. At the examination on 8 March the respondent was questioned at some length about the location of the property.
	
	
	On 20 March, twelve days later, police went to the Werris Creek area and on the following day, after making enquiries in the area, ascertained the address of the property. They went there on 22 March and, armed with a warrant, searched it. Among items seized during that search was a cigarette butt on which was later found DNA consistent with the respondent's profile.
	
	
	His Honour noted a submission by counsel then appearing for the respondent that there was an ""overwhelming inference"" that information obtained during the examination about the whereabouts of the property had been passed on to investigators. The Crown prosecutor before him had argued that there was no proof ""of anything like that occurring ... ."" This material led his Honour to make these observations:
	


""No other evidence has been placed before me in regard to that situation. However, it is certainly an unusual coincidence, to say the least, that despite being aware of Mr X's arrest in December 2010, it was not until 2 March 2011 that a summons was issued and only apparently after he had been visited by police in custody and declined to provide or to answer further questions.""

After noting the course of events from the issue of the summons on 2 March to the finding of the property later that month, his Honour added:

""Whilst that does not amount to proof per se, it certainly raises a serious issue as to the likelihood that this is just a coincidence, which tends to suggest, even as the law then stood, the examination may have been for a collateral purpose rather than to assist the ACC in its functions and obligations.""


	
	Later in his Honour's reasons his Honour expressed his conclusion as follows:
	


""Given the timing, nature and scope of the ACC examination I am of the view that the accusatorial process has been fundamentally flawed such that it is now impossible for Mr X to have a fair trial in accordance with the commonly recognised rights and privileges that have, for generations, been part of the criminal law of Australia inherited from the country that we derived our laws and usages from ab initio. That applies even if the trial judge was to exclude any relevant evidence such as the evidence in relation to the Werris Creek property. That flaw, in my view, outweighs by far the interests of the public and the state in having criminal cases prosecuted and in having serious criminal offending dealt with. To adopt what was said in R v Regan, which I have referred to above, the prejudice to the applicant would be perpetuated throughout the trial process and there is now no appropriate remedy that would overcome that problem.""

THE APPEAL


	
	In this court the Crown was represented by the Crown Advocate, Ms Adams SC, appearing with Ms Namey, neither of whom had appeared in the District Court. The respondent was represented by Mr Molomby SC and Mr Longville. Mr Longville had represented the respondent in the District Court.
	
	
	A further variation of the non-publication order made by the ACC examiner, pursuant to s 25A(10) of the Act, was made on 10 April 2014 for the purpose of the appeal. This provided for disclosure to the members of this court and relevant registry staff, and to the staff and lawyers of the Director of Public Prosecutions involved in the appeal, only for confidential use in connection with it. For more abundant caution, by agreement with Mr Molomby, Ms Adams had access to the transcript of the examination but it has not been disclosed to her junior or to her instructing solicitor (even though that solicitor is dealing only with this appeal and is not involved in the prosecution in the District Court).
	
	
	The only ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in permanently staying the prosecution. Put shortly, Ms Adams contended that the trial judge's finding that information from the respondent's examination may have been disclosed to the prosecution was not open on the evidence. Alternatively, if his Honour's decision was founded simply upon the fact that there had been a compulsory examination which, in the light of the decision in X7, was unlawful, he erred in concluding that there was no remedy available to ensure that the respondent received a fair trial.
	
	
	Mr Molomby argued that the evidence did justify the inference that material from the examination had been disclosed to investigating police but that, in the event, that was not a matter about which his Honour expressed any concluded view. His Honour ordered a stay because the compulsory examination was such a fundamental departure from the accusatorial process that the respondent could not have a fair trial.
	
	
	R v Seller & McCarthy (supra) was a successful appeal by the Crown against an order for the permanent stay of a trial after the disclosure of evidence in compulsory examinations under the ACC Act. The case was decided before X7 and, in any event, did not deal with the issue which arises in the present case. However, at [110] the Chief Justice expressed succinctly the principles relating to a permanent stay. After referring to the exposition of them by McClellan CJ at CL in CB (supra), his Honour said:
	


""I would merely add what was said by Mason CJ in Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 at 30, where the Chief Justice indicated his agreement with Richardson J in Moevao v Department of Labour (1980) 1 NZLR 464 at 482 that the justification for a stay is to prevent the court process being employed in a manner inconsistent with the recognised purpose of the administration of criminal justice and so constituting an abuse of process. Further, a stay will only be granted in an extreme case and the fundamental defect which warrants a stay must be such that there is nothing a trial judge can do to relieve against its unfair consequences: The Queen v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 605.""


	
	Given that the trial judge in the present case referred to the Canadian decision of R v Regan (supra), it is appropriate to cite the expression of the relevant principles by the majority in that case. While the court there had regard to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the following passage at para 53 is a statement of the common law position:
	


""A stay of proceedings is only one remedy to an abuse of process, but the most drastic one: 'that ultimate remedy', as this Court in Tobiass, supra, (at para. 86), called it. It is ultimate in the sense that it is final. Charges that are stayed may never be prosecuted; an alleged victim will never get his or her day in court; society will never have the matter resolved by a trier of fact. For these reasons, a stay is reserved for only those cases of abuse where a very high threshold is met: 'the threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings remains, under the Charter as under the common law doctrine of abuse of process, the 'clearest of cases' (O'Connor, supra, at para. 68).""

The cases referred to in that passage are Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Tobiass [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391 (S.C.C.) and R v O'Connor[1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 (S.C.C.).


	
	As I have said, the issue in X7 was the interpretation of the ACC Act, guided by the principle of legality. In all the judgments reference was made toHammond v The Commonwealth (1982) 152 CLR 188. In that case the plaintiff had been questioned at a Royal Commission about the subject matter of a charge in respect of which he had been committed for trial. The legislation governing the enquiry was the Royal Commissions Act 1902 (Cth) and theEvidence Act 1958 (Vic). The legislation required him to answer questions, making it an offence to refuse to do so, but it provided that any answers given were not admissible in any civil or criminal proceedings (except in proceedings for an offence against the Act in question). The High Court granted an injunction restraining any further examination of the plaintiff until the determination of his trial. The members of the court were unanimous in that decision.
	
	
	The plaintiff had sought an injunction on the basis that his further examination in the Commission would constitute a contempt of the court at which he was to be tried. It appears that, although the questioning of the plaintiff was to be undertaken in private, the investigating police officers were present and the transcript of the examination was to be made available to the prosecution. Thus, to adopt the current terminology used in X7, the legislation provided the plaintiff with a direct use immunity in respect of his evidence but did not prevent its derivative use by the prosecution.
	
	
	Gibbs CJ said (at 196) that to succeed the plaintiff had to establish ""that there is a real risk, as opposed to a remote possibility, that justice will be interfered with"" if his examination continued. The Chief Justice added that the ""tendency of the proposed actions to interfere with the course of justice must be a practical reality - a theoretical tendency is not enough."" In concluding that there was such a risk, his Honour said (at 198):
	


""Once it is accepted that the plaintiff will be bound, on pain of punishment, to answer questions designed to establish that he is guilty of the offence with which he is charged, it seems to me inescapably to follow, in the circumstances of this case, that there is a real risk that the administration of justice will be interfered with. It is clear that the questions will be put and pressed. It is true that the examination will take place in private, and that the answers may not be used at the criminal trial. Nevertheless, the fact that the plaintiff has been examined, in detail, as to the circumstances of the alleged offence, is very likely to prejudice him in his defence.""


	
	Deane J (at 206) said that the ""mere fact that proceedings are pending in a court of law does not mean that any parallel or related administrative inquiry, conducted for proper administrative purposes, constitutes an interference with the due administration of justice in that court."" His Honour continued:
	


""On the other hand, it is fundamental to the administration of criminal justice that a person who is the subject of pending criminal proceedings in a court of law should not be subjected to having his part in the matters involved in those criminal proceedings made the subject of a parallel inquisitorial inquiry by an administrative tribunal with powers to compel the giving of evidence and the production of documents which largely correspond (and, to some extent, exceed) the powers of the criminal court. Such an extracurial inquisitorial investigation of the involvement of a person who has been committed for trial in the matters which form the basis of the criminal proceedings against him constitutes, in my view, an improper interference with the due administration of justice in the proceedings against him in the criminal court and contempt of court.""


	
	It was the ambit of the principles expressed in that case which was the subject of consideration in X7. It is not necessary to examine their Honours' observations about this matter in any detail. It is sufficient to say that the majority found in the case support for their position: Hayne and Bell JJ at [127]-[136], Kiefel J at [161]; just as the minority, by distinguishing the case on its facts, did for theirs: French CJ and Crennan J at [31]-[36].
	
	
	In their joint judgment, French CJ and Crennan J examined the ""protective provisions"" of the ACC Act to be found in s 25A and s 30, and said at [57]:
	


""These safeguards are capable of preventing a compulsory examination from occasioning an unfair burden on the examinee when defending criminal charges. At trial, the onus remains on the prosecution to prove the guilt beyond reasonable doubt of the accused, without the assistance of the accused. The accused may remain silent at the trial, or not, and take whatever course is desired at the close of the prosecution case, without the risk of being confronted with compulsorily obtained evidence, the use of which is subject to statutory prohibition and safeguards. To the extent that the plaintiff will nevertheless be affected by compulsory examination after he has been charged with offences, that consequence is necessarily implied by the terms of the examination provisions ... .""


	
	Their Honours concluded at [59]-[61]:
	


""If there is some failure to employ the protective provisions such that the prosecution would obtain an unfair forensic advantage, a trial court's inherent power to punish for contempt [119], including a power to restrain a threatened contempt, would be available, as in Hammond. A failure by an examiner to give any, or any adequate, direction under s 25A(9), or an error by the CEO in exercising the power to revoke or vary a direction under s 25A(10), would also be remediable by recourse to the constitutional writs issued pursuant to s 75(v) of the Constitution or s 39B(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).

These considerations show that the examination provisions do not authorise executive interference with the curial process of criminal trials.

Whether a direction under s 25A will be sufficient to preclude the prosecution from obtaining an unfair forensic advantage in a trial cannot be stated in any categorical or exhaustive fashion. In considering the sufficiency of any such direction, it would be necessary to consider the nature of the self-incriminating evidence as well as the role of persons who had access to it, together with the use which such persons might make of it.""


	
	Lee & Anor v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39, 302 ALR 363, was a decision of all seven justices of the High Court, handed down not long after the decision in X7. It arose from an application by the respondent Crime Commission for orders seeking the compulsory examination of the appellants pursuant to s 31D of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW). Both appellants had been charged with certain offences, and their examination would touch upon matters relevant to those charges. R S Hulme J had declined to order the examinations for that reason, but his Honour's decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal and that decision was upheld in the High Court.
	
	
	The High Court's decision was again by majority: French CJ and Crennan J in separate judgments, and Gageler and Keane JJ in a joint judgment. The minority comprised the justices who had been in the majority in X7: Hayne, Bell and Kiefel JJ, each of whom delivered separate judgments.
	
	
	Again, the question was one of construction of the relevant statute, in this case the Criminal Assets Recovery Act (referred to in the judgments as the ""CAR Act""). The majority concluded that that Act did permit the examination of a person against whom criminal proceedings were pending about the subject matter of those proceedings, having regard to the purpose of the Act and its provisions, including the fact that the examination was conducted before the Supreme Court or a prescribed officer of the court. French CJ at [45] referred to the principles enunciated by the majority in X7, concluding ""that the statute to which those principles were applied in that case differs materially from the statute to which they have to be applied in this case."" His Honour set out succinctly at [47] what he saw as the relevant differences between the two Acts. The minority, on the other hand, saw the principles in X7 as directly applicable to the CAR Act.
	
	
	It is unnecessary for present purposes to examine the relevant provisions of the CAR Act and the majority's interpretation of them. Ms Adams suggested that there were ""some live issues as to reconciliation of certain statements made by the court"" in the two decisions. She referred to a number of passages inLee.
	
	
	At [54] French CJ expressly acknowledged the authority of the majority view in X7, saying:
	


""It may be accepted that the examination process under the CAR Act may, if it touches upon matters the subject of pending criminal charges against the examinee, affect the accusatorial character of the trial process. Even if the responses of the examinee to questions put to him or her were kept secret and were solely exculpatory or did no more than disclose defences to the charges, the examinee could be said to have suffered a forensic disadvantage. The nature of that disadvantage was discussed in the joint judgment of Hayne and Bell JJ in X7 [referring to the passage at [124] cited above]. I do not, with respect, disagree with anything their Honours said in the description of that disadvantage.""

However, the Chief Justice went on at [55] to observe that ""those considerations did not deprive the Court of Appeal of power to make the orders it did in this case."" He then enumerated the features of the CAR Act which led him to that conclusion.


	
	Crennan J said at [152]-[154]:
	


""Relying on Hammond, as applying beyond those precise circumstances, the appellants identified a discrete risk of interference in the pending criminal proceedings as the loss of the forensic advantage to them of exercising the right to remain silent, before and at trial, and to reserve their defences until the close of the prosecution case. It was said that being compelled to give an answer, including making an admission or partial denial in respect of an offence, thereafter constrained or embarrassed an examinee in the conduct of a defence (including the making of a plea of not guilty) so long as the examinee is represented by lawyers subject to their ethical obligations. The loss of that forensic advantage is necessarily implied by the effect of the express abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination.

Legislatures have from time to time qualified the right to remain silent before and at trial; for example, legislatures commonly require an accused person to give an alibi notice prior to trial, and have otherwise made changes to the accusatorial process of a criminal trial which intrude upon the forensic or procedural advantages the common law accords to an accused person before or at trial.

If, without more, and notwithstanding the protections afforded to an examinee under the CAR Act, the loss of the identified forensic advantage occasions a real risk of interference with pending criminal proceedings, that risk is incidental to the achievement of legitimate legislative objects, and to that extent is implicitly authorised by the legislature of New South Wales.""

(Footnotes omitted.)


	
	Gageler and Keane JJ said at [322]-[324]:
	


""Hammond is illustrative of the proposition that a real risk to the administration of justice can arise where there is a real risk that the practical consequence of an exercise of a coercive statutory power would be to give to the prosecution in criminal proceedings 'advantages which the rules of procedure would otherwise deny' [Pioneer concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1982-83) 152 CLR 460 at 468]. Hammond is not authority for the proposition that a real risk to the administration of justice necessarily, or presumptively, arises by reason only of the exercise of a statutory power to compel the examination on oath of a person against whom criminal proceedings have been commenced but not completed where the subject-matter of the examination will overlap with the subject-matter of the proceedings. The majority in X7 does not appear to us to have embraced such a proposition.

There is a variety of ways in which, as a matter of practical reality, the examination on oath of a person against whom criminal proceedings have been commenced may have a tendency to give rise to unfairness amounting to an interference with the due course of justice in a particular case. The deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice available to the person in those proceedings may be one of those ways. However, we are unable to regard as the deprivation of a legitimate forensic choice a practical constraint on the legal representatives of the person leading evidence or cross-examining or making submissions in the criminal proceedings to suggest a version of the facts which contradicted that given by their client on oath in the examination. The legal representatives would, of course, be prevented from setting up an affirmative case inconsistent with the evidence but they would not be prevented from ensuring that the prosecution is put to proof or from arguing that the evidence as a whole does not prove guilt [referring to rule 79 of the New South Wales Barristers' Rules; Tuckiar v The King (1934) 52 CLR 335 at 346].

The notion that any subtraction, however anodyne it might be in its practical effect, from the forensic advantages enjoyed by an accused under the general law necessarily involves an interference with the administration of justice or prejudice to the fair trial of the accused is unsound in principle ... . To accept that a criminal trial 'does not involve the pursuit of truth by any means'[R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 576] is not to condone as legitimate the pursuit of falsehood. The words of Lord Scarman in R v Sang [1980] AC 402 at 456, concerning the judicial discretion to exclude legally admissible evidence on the ground of unfairness, resonate more widely:

'The test of unfairness is not that of a game: it is whether ... the evidence, if admitted, would undermine the justice of the trial. Any closer definition would fetter the sense of justice, upon which in the last resort all judges have to rely: but any extension of the discretion ... would also undermine the justice of the trial. For the conviction of the guilty is a public interest, as is the acquittal of the innocent. In a just society both are needed'.""


	
	Both Hayne and Bell JJ, in dissent, responded to the last part of that passage. Hayne J said at [82]:
	


""To suggest that preserving the legitimate forensic choices that are open to an accused at a criminal trial would permit, let alone encourage, the pursuit of falsehood misstates the fundamental character of a criminal trial. Reference to the pursuit of falsehood may suggest that a criminal trial is an `inquisition into the truth of the allegation made. It is not. Subject to the rules of evidence, fairness and admissibility, each of the prosecution and the accused is free to decide the ground on which to contest the issue, the evidence to be called and the questions to be asked. Reference to the pursuit of falsehood may suggest that legitimately testing the strength of the prosecution's proof is somehow dishonest. It is not."" (Footnote omitted.)

Bell J said at [266]:

""The entitlement of a person accused of criminal wrongdoing to remain silent is a fundamental common law right and not a mere forensic advantage. The exercise of the right, and the election to put the prosecution to proof, are decisions which may be made for a variety of reasons. To acknowledge that to compel an accused to give an account of the circumstances of an alleged offence in parallel civil proceedings may limit the capacity of the accused to put the prosecution to proof at the criminal trial is not to condone the pursuit of falsehood. To characterise it in that way risks inverting the assumption upon which our adversarial system of criminal justice proceeds, which is to say that the accused is entitled to be acquitted of a charge of criminal wrongdoing unless unaided by him or her the prosecution proves guilt."" (Footnote omitted.)


	
	It is convenient to refer to this decision as Lee v NSWCC. Those two appellants lived to fight another day in the High Court: Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20. That decision was handed down shortly after the present appeal was argued in this court. It is necessary to refer to it, although neither Ms Adams nor Mr Molomby has sought to make any further submissions arising from it.
	
	
	Broadly speaking, this last decision arises from the same investigation which was the subject of Lee v NSWCC. It was also concerned with the compulsory examination of the appellants by the State Crime Commission, but under different legislation and at an earlier stage of the investigation. Lee v NSWCCarose from an application by the Crime Commission in June 2010 for the examination of the appellants, whereas Lee v The Queen arose from the examination of both of them in 2009. It is not necessary to go to the detail of their lingering and somewhat complex encounter with the criminal justice system. A brief chronology of it is to be found in the joint judgment in Lee v The Queen at [2]-[7] and [11], supplemented by the judgment of Crennan J inLee v NSWCC at [111]-[116].
	
	
	In March 2011, at a trial in the District Court, both of them were found guilty of drug supply offences (and the first appellant, Jason Lee, was also found guilty of possessing a prohibited firearm). Their appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against those convictions was unsuccessful. Lee v The Queen was their appeal against that decision, and the High Court allowed the appeals and ordered a new trial. That decision was founded upon the separate examinations of each of them in 2009, those examinations exploring the subject matter of the prosecution. At the time of those examinations each of them had been charged with certain offences, but not those for which they were to face trial. Those charges were laid in the following year, the earlier charges (with some inconsequential exceptions) having been withdrawn and dismissed. The basis of the appeal was that prior to the trial the prosecution had had access to the transcripts of their evidence.
	
	
	These examinations were conducted under the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985. In respect of the first appellant the Crime Commission had given a direction under s 13(9) of that Act, the effect of which was that the prosecution should not have had access to the transcript of his evidence. No such direction was given in respect of the second appellant, the son of the first appellant, but for the purpose of the appeal it was common ground that it should have been. In disregard of that protective provision, albeit inadvertently, the Commission had furnished transcripts of their evidence, together with documents produced by the first appellant, to the police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It appears that that material disclosed to some extent matters which might be raised in defence of the charges.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal had given judgment before the decision in X7. Put shortly, as the High Court recorded in the joint judgment at [40], that court had dismissed the appeals principally on the basis that there had been no ""practical unfairness"" to the appellants arising from the publication of the transcripts of their evidence. The High Court at [41] questioned that conclusion in the light of the facts of the case but, more importantly, added at [43]:
	


""These appeals do not fall to be decided by reference to whether there can be shown to be some 'practical unfairness' in the conduct of the appellants' defence affecting the result of the trial. This is a case concerning the very nature of a criminal trial and its requirements in our system of criminal justice. The appellants' trial was altered in a fundamental respect by the prosecution having the appellants' evidence before the Commission in its possession.""


	
	Earlier, at [31]-[33], the court affirmed the basic principles governing the criminal justice system to which consideration had been given in X7, and at [45], after noting that the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision predated the judgment in X7, said, ""Attention was therefore not directed to the principle of the common law respecting proof by the prosecution, unaided by the accused, which was in that case confirmed as fundamental to our system of criminal justice."" Their Honours continued at [46]:
	


""In X7, it was held that the compulsory examination of a person with respect to an offence with which the person stands charged would be a departure, in a fundamental respect, from that principle. X7 was ultimately concerned with questions of statutory construction. Nevertheless, the point it makes about what may amount to a fundamental departure from a criminal trial as it is comprehended by our system of criminal justice is relevant to this case. It is a breach of the principle of the common law, and a departure in a fundamental respect from a criminal trial which the system of criminal justice requires an accused person to have, for the prosecution to be armed with the evidence of an accused person obtained under compulsion concerning matters the subject of the charges. It cannot be said that the appellants had a trial for which our system of criminal justice provides and which s 13(9) of the NSWCC Act sought to protect. Rather, their trial was one where the balance of power shifted to the prosecution."" (Footnote omitted)


	
	In X7 and Lee v NSWCC the differences of opinion between the members of the High Court are clear enough. Nevertheless, X7 constitutes binding authority for the proposition that the examination under the ACC Act of a person who has been charged with an offence about the subject matter of the charge is not authorised by the Act and is, accordingly, unlawful. It is the consequences for the pursuit of the prosecution of a person who has been subjected to such an unlawful examination which is the crucial question in the present case. That was not a question which needed to be addressed in X7or Lee v NSWCC. Nor was it in Lee v The Queen, which was concerned with whether a miscarriage of justice had been occasioned by the unlawful disclosure to the prosecution of evidence obtained at an examination.
	
	
	As noted above, the trial judge observed that the lengthy examination of the respondent was directed almost entirely to the subject matter of the charges he faces. As I have said, Mr Molomby's primary position was that, as a result of that unlawful examination, the respondent could not have a fair trial because of the fundamental alteration of the accusatorial process effected by it. He described the statements of principle by the majority in X7, particularly in [124] quoted above, as ""a shift in the tectonic plates"" of this area of the law. In effect, he argued, such an unlawful examination creates presumptive prejudice to the trial process, a prejudice which endures whether or not information from the examination has been disseminated. Accordingly, in such a case the remedy of a permanent stay, exceptional as it is, should be granted.
	
	
	Ms Adams, on the other hand, submitted that the fact that a person has been subjected to an examination of the kind found to be unlawful in X7 does not necessarily mean that that person is entitled to a permanent stay of his or her trial. Rather, it is necessary to examine the circumstances of the case at hand to determine whether prejudice has been occasioned and, if so, whether it can be remedied in such a way as to ensure a fair trial. It is in this context that she relied upon the observations of French CJ and Crennan J in both X7 and Lee v NSWCC, and those of Gageler and Keane JJ in the latter case. In particular, she noted what the Chief Justice and Crennan J had to say in X7 about s 25A of the ACC Act, submitting that the protection of evidence at an examination from disclosure to the prosecution is an important matter in determining whether a stay should be granted.
	
	
	There is no denying the importance of the principles governing the trial process expounded by the majority in X7. Nevertheless, Ms Adams' submissions on this aspect appear to me to be consonant with the authorities on the permanent stay of a criminal trial and should be accepted. In this context the following observations of Hayne J in Lee v NSWCC at [79]-[81] should be noted:
	


""The asking of questions and the compelling of answers about the pending charge inevitably interfere with the conduct of an accusatorial trial and embarrass the defence of the accused. The answers the accused has been compelled to give to the questions asked deprive the accused of forensic choices that otherwise would be legitimately open at trial to test the case which the prosecution advances. That is, the asking of questions about the pending charge and the compelling of answers to those questions work a fundamental alteration to the accusatorial process of criminal justice.

It is theoretically possible that, at the end of a trial, it may be said that the deprivation of those choices was anodyne in its practical effect. But that is not to the point. The issue is presented when it is sought to conduct the examination. The examination occurs before the trial has begun.

No doubt, it is important to notice that an examination under s 31D(1) was to be conducted before the Supreme Court or an officer of the Court prescribed by rules of court. It is to be assumed that the Court or its officer would act to prevent oppression of the person being examined and would act to prevent misuse or abuse of the process of examination, whether by limiting or precluding publication of what transpires at the examination, or otherwise. But if the trial of the person being examined is pending, the Court (or the officer of the Court) cannot know, and cannot predict, what might harm the defence of that person at trial. Those matters are unknown to, and unknowable by, the Court (or its officer) for the simple reason that the Court (or its officer) does not know, and cannot be told, what are or will be the accused's instructions to his or her lawyers at trial.""


	
	These observations highlight the fact that in that case, as in X7, the question for the court was whether an examination of a person about the subject matter of charges brought against him should be allowed to proceed. What his Honour said at [80] recognises that, where such an examination has occurred, its effect on that person's trial will depend upon the circumstances of the case at hand. In the present case, of course, there has not yet been a trial. However, the examination has been completed and, presumably, its effect on the trial can be assessed and measures to guard against such prejudice as it might cause can be considered.
	
	
	Putting aside the question of the Werris Creek property, it is not apparent from the trial judge's reasons that that assessment was undertaken. As I have said, his Honour did say that X7 did not create a class of persons automatically entitled to a stay and that he was still required to consider the case on its merits. However, the decisive passage from his reasons quoted at [25] above conveys that it was the fact of the unlawful examination, without more, which was the basis of his decision. I might add that any assessment his Honour might have made of the prejudice caused to the respondent by the examination, and of any measures which might have remedied it, was complicated by the fact that the prosecutor could make no useful contribution to the debate as he was not permitted access to the transcript of the examination.
	
	
	As to the finding and search of the property, the focus of the argument was not upon the fact that the respondent was required to answer questions about the matter but rather upon the inference for which Mr Longville had contended that, contrary to the direction under s 25A(9) of the ACC Act, his evidence had been made available to the investigating police. Mr Longville mounted that argument by a careful examination of the evidence in the prosecution brief, including the statements of the police officers who located the property, and the chronology of the investigation which that material disclosed.
	
	
	The evidence about this matter was not satisfactory. There was no oral evidence. The allegation that the police had unauthorised access to the terms of the respondent's examination is serious, the more so if the contention was that the examination had been conducted for that collateral purpose. This should have been the subject of cross-examination of relevant witnesses. Here also, of course, the prosecutor was ill equipped to deal with the issue. That said, I agree with Mr Molomby that the trial judge, while expressing concern about this matter, does not appear to have made a finding about it.
	
	
	In all the circumstances I am satisfied that in granting the application for a permanent stay his Honour's discretion miscarried. The matter calls for re-examination and, perhaps, further evidence. This court is not in a position to undertake that task. Ms Adams sought an order that the matter be remitted to the District Court, which I consider to be the appropriate course. Obviously, it would be desirable for the Crown to be represented by counsel and solicitor other than those who have the carriage of the prosecution and for a further variation of the direction under s 25A(9) of the ACC Act to be made for that purpose.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and remit the matter to the District Court for redetermination.
	
	
	HAMILL J: I agree with Hidden J that the appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted to the District Court for further consideration of the respondent's application for a permanent stay of proceedings. I agree with his Honour's reasons for that conclusion.
	
	
	However, I should record that I do not accept the appellant's submission that it was denied procedural fairness in the proceedings before Judge Williams.
	
	
	That submission was based on the fact that its counsel did not have access to the transcript of the proceedings before the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) and on the ground that the trial Judge made a finding (that there was ""unlawful collusion"" between police investigating the matter and officers of the ACC) in circumstances where there was no warning to the prosecutor that such a finding might be made. I note that the suggestion in the written submissions (not prepared by the learned Crown Advocate who appeared on the hearing of the appeal) that ""it was not open to the Crown to call evidence to rebut that contention"" was not pressed.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant was on notice that the respondent relied on the transcript of the hearing before the ACC. Counsel for the respondent had sought, and received, an exemption from the non-publication orders made by the ACC. The appellant could have applied for a similar exemption and, if necessary, sought an adjournment to enable such an application to be made. That is the course that Ms Adams SC took in order to prepare for the hearing of the appeal. I accept that particular complications arose because counsel for the appellant was also briefed to appear at the trial. However, those complications do not mean that the appellant was denied the right to be heard.
	
	
	The requirement for natural justice is a requirement that a party be given the opportunity to be heard. The appellant was afforded that opportunity. As Gleeson JA said in Jamal v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWCA 355:
	


""The obligation of procedural fairness is concerned with providing a person whose rights are potentially affected in a matter with the opportunity to deal with relevant issues. However, a party's failure to make proper use of that opportunity cannot be used to support the claim of procedural unfairness: Victims Compensation Fund Corporation v Nguyen (2001) 52 NSWLR 213 at 219 [37] per Mason P.""


	
	As to the second part of the appellant's natural justice submission, when the matter came on for hearing, counsel for the appellant provided extensive written submissions and a chronology. Whilst the version of the written submissions provided to the appellant was redacted in compliance with the non-publication orders made by the ACC, it was clear that counsel was inviting the primary Judge to conclude from the timing of various events that there must have been some communication or interaction between the investigating police and officers of the ACC. This was based around the following parts of the chronology:
	


15 December 2010 - The respondent was arrested in Quirindi and told police that he had ""just come from a property at Werris Creek"".

The respondent was charged with possession of drug manufacture apparatus.

17 December 2010 - The respondent was charged with manufacture and supply of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug.

2 March 2011 - Two police officers attended on the respondent at Long Bay prison. The respondent declined to be interviewed.

At 2.28pm the ACC issued the summons requiring the respondent to attend for examination.

8 March 2011 - The respondent was examined by the ACC. He was examined extensively as to matters giving rise to the charge and about the location of the Werris Creek property.

20 March 2011- Investigating police travelled to Werris Creek and located the relevant property.


	
	There are two temporal coincidences that arise from this chronology. First, the summons requiring the respondent's compulsory examination was issued by the ACC on the same day that the respondent declined to be interviewed by investigating police. Second, having failed to locate the Werris Creek property in the three months since the respondent's arrest, investigating police located that property twelve days after the respondent gave evidence of its location to the ACC.
	
	
	In any event, as Hidden J concludes at [60], while the primary Judge expressed concern as to the chronology he did not make a clear finding on the subject.
	
	
	The absence of a clear finding on this issue, the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence on the subject and the extreme nature of the remedy invoked are the matters that lead me to agree with Hidden J that the discretion in the primary Judge miscarried.
	
	
	The circumstances in which a permanent stay might be granted in cases of serious criminal prosecutions are not capable of categorisation in advance. The concept of ""abuse of process covers a multiple of ills"": DPP v Shirvanian (1998) 44 NSWLR 129 at 134A per Mason P. However, what is clear is that a permanent stay is an exceptional remedy granted only in extreme cases: see, for example, Jago v The District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23 at 76, R v CB, R v MP [2011] NSWCCA 264, R v Seller and McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42 and R v Regan [2002] SCC 12.
	
	
	This Court has granted or upheld permanent stays in cases where the accused person was able to establish a circumstance or circumstances which meant that they were unable to have a fair trial. For an example in R v Littler [2001] NSWCCA 173, the Court (Hodgson JA, James and Adams JJ) granted a stay of proceedings to a 74-year-old man who had memory problems and was called upon to answer allegations of offences alleged to have occurred between 38 and 46 years earlier. It was held that directions were not capable of curing the prejudice and ensuring him a fair trial.
	
	
	Similarly, in R v Westley [2004] NSWCCA 192 the Court ordered a permanent stay of proceedings where the accused was 77 years of age and charged with offences that occurred when he was ""about 46 or 47"". The evidence was not capable of establishing the precise age of the complainant and would be statute barred if she was aged between 14 and 16. It was held therefore that the prosecution was ""doomed to failure"".
	
	
	In those cases the focus of the Court was not on the conduct of prosecuting authorities but on the ability of the accused person to receive a fair trial.
	
	
	I refer to and gratefully adopt Hidden J's analysis of the cases of X7 v ACC [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92, Lee v NSW Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39 andLee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20. The present case was decided after the decision in X7 but before the decisions in Lee v NSW Crime Commission andLee v The Queen.
	
	
	The language used by the primary Judge and his reference to his ""view that the accusatorial process has been fundamentally flawed"" suggest that his Honour was greatly influenced by the judgment in X7 and particularly the language employed by Hayne and Bell JJ at [124]. The respondent relied heavily on that passage in the arguments before this Court.
	
	
	Given the strength of the language in paragraph [124], it is easy to see how one could conclude that a stay of proceedings would follow from an unlawful and compulsory examination of the kind involved in the present case. However, the High Court is yet to consider a case where the remedy sought in such circumstances was the permanent stay of serious criminal proceedings. Further the orders made in Lee v The Queen, seen in the light of arguments addressed to the High Court on the hearing of the appeal, suggest that a remedy short of a permanent stay may be available depending on the circumstances of the case.
	
	
	The following arguments were made on the hearing of the appeal in Lee v The Queen (Lee v The Queen; Lee v the Queen [2014] HCATrans 69):
	


""KIEFEL J: What do you say the court should have done, hypothetically, if it had been - - -

MR GAME: What the court should have done was order a temporary stay until a different prosecutor was brought on the case and the case was presented in a way that was unaffected by the - - -""

And later:

""CRENNAN J: You are saying, are you not, it is such a fundamental process, defect, that you do not have any need to consider the effect on the verdict?

MR GAME: That is correct, your Honour.

BELL J: If that is so, how does a temporary stay until another prosecutor is briefed in the matter resolve the situation? This depends, I suppose, on acceptance that the prosecuting authorities can establish a satisfactory Chinese wall.

MR GAME: I think the shoe is on the other foot because the prosecution then has to establish that it can run the case untainted by this process.

KIEFEL J: But the problem here is it is now too widely disseminated for a court to be satisfied as to that.

MR GAME: That is our position.

KEANE J: But if that is your position, then if you succeed it is not about a retrial, is it? If that is your position there cannot be a retrial.

MR GAME: That is my position. I do not want to be too bold but, yes, that is our position, but we also say that if your Honours are not with us on that then you would make an order for a retrial and we would have to [sort] out in a forensic battle with our opponents as to whether or not they could put them back on trial. That forensic battle could easily be facilitated in the context of an order for a retrial in which our opponents then sought to satisfy the Court that a stay should not be ordered.

KIEFEL J: How could the court entertain an application for a stay if this Court has ordered a retrial?

MR GAME: Well, because, your Honour, the order for the retrial would not foreclose the outcome of the stay - - -

KIEFEL J: But in the circumstances in which the order for retrial has been made?

MR GAME: It would depend on the circumstances in which the order for a retrial had been made, but the lease [sic] of a stay would not have been determined in terms by the order for a retrial.

FRENCH CJ: Issues relevant to the stay might include practical questions about choice of prosecutor and so forth and I suppose that could be raised after the point of arraignment, after the point at which the trial had commenced.

MR GAME: Yes. I do say that an order for acquittal would be appropriate but I do not want to throw the baby out - another metaphor, but I do not want to put in a lot of claims that are too large.""


	
	The High Court did not, in terms, address these arguments in its judgment. However, the Court ordered a new trial. That was in circumstances where there had clearly been a dissemination of the material to the prosecuting authority.
	
	
	The final chapter of what Hidden J has described as the Lees' ""lingering and somewhat complex encounter with the criminal justice system"" is yet to be written. However, the orders made by the High Court in Lee v The Queen contemplate that a trial that is relevantly ""fair"" may be possible even in circumstances where there has been both an unlawful examination and a dissemination of the material.
	
	
	Insofar as the primary Judge appeared to act on a contrary assumption, his Honour's discretion miscarried.
	
	
	For these reasons, as well as those given by Hidden J, I agree that the appeal must be allowed and the case remitted to the District Court.

(2)The learned sentencing judge gave undue weight to the finding of the applicant's future dangerousness.

(3)The sentence was manifestly excessive.

The Facts

Victim CV

5The victim CV was born on 18 December 2003. The applicant met CV's mother in about 2010. He was on the Child Protection Register as a result of previous offences. In February 2012 CV, her parents and her three brothers moved to North Rocks. CV attended the local primary school and was, in 2012, in year 4. Following the move to North Rocks, the applicant became involved in CV's family's life. He not only helped with household tasks and odd jobs, but he also drove CV's parents from home to the train station so that they could attend work and picked up CV and her siblings from school.

6In about December 2012, the applicant was assisting CV's father, who was on the roof of the house, to install a television antenna. The applicant suggested that CV climb up the ladder so that he could take a photograph. When she climbed up the ladder, the applicant asked her to adjust her pyjama pants so that he could see her underpants. Although she declined, he adjusted them and took a photograph of her. When he subsequently asked her if he could print the photograph and stick it on his wardrobe, she said that she did not know. On another occasion when CV was riding her skateboard, he took a photograph of her with his iPad. She was not aware of his doing so at the time. When he later showed her the photograph she could see her underpants showing. She asked him to crop the photograph and he did so. It was common for the applicant to take photographs both with his iPad and his phone.

7From Christmas 2012, the applicant showed increasing interest in CV and wanted to spend time with her and buy gifts for her. 

Sequence 1: aggravated indecent assault on victim less than 16 years old

8In mid-January 2013, during the school holidays, the applicant asked CV to vacuum his car. At this time her father was inside the house with her brothers. When she had finished the task she was sitting on the back seat of the car when the applicant knelt outside on the concrete and told CV that she was not to tell her mother. He then used two fingers to rub her vagina on the outside of her shorts. He asked her to open her legs and asked whether she could feel a ""tingle"". She said that she could. He then rubbed her vagina for a further half a minute. He stopped when CV's brother came along. 

9After the offence, the applicant talked to CV about buying her a bicycle and drove her to K-mart to look at bicycles. On the way he asked if he could kiss her and tongue her and she said no.

Sequence 2: aggravated indecent assault on victim less than 16 years old

10On another occasion, while at CV's home, the applicant got CV to stand on the couch. He hugged her for a few seconds and pushed his body against her so that she could feel his penis against her stomach. CV described the feeling as ""weird"". Nothing was said between them on this occasion. 

Sequence 5: aggravated indecent assault on victim less than 16 years old

11It was the applicant's practice to interact with CV through her mother. He asked CV's mother if CV could come to his house to help him clean the drawers in his room as he had trouble bending down. CV's mother insisted on being present. The applicant, who knew that CV's mother usually worked on Wednesdays, came to collect her on Wednesday 13 February 2013 at about 4.30 pm, when her father, but not her mother, was at home. 

12The applicant drove CV to his home where she helped him clean out the drawers. After she had finished she sat on a chair. He closed the door and asked her to sit on his lap. She complied. He then rubbed her nipples with both thumbs on the outside of her clothing and lifted up her shirt and kissed her navel three times and also her neck. He then drove her to Red Rooster and where he bought dinner. On the way back to the applicant's house, CV spilled sauce on her shirt. She removed it at the applicant's direction so that it could be washed. He provided her with a pyjama top that he had purchased for her to put on. He also gave her the pyjama pants and a blue dress with a belt as a reward. CV, who did not want her brothers to know that the applicant had bought her gifts, asked for her wet shirt back so that she could put it on again before returning home at about 5.45 pm. 

13The following day, CV's mother, who was concerned that the applicant had taken her to his home without her permission, asked CV if the applicant had done anything wrong to her. CV burst into tears and told her mother that the applicant had been feeling her. CV's mother went to the police station the following day and reported the matter.

Sequence 4 (taken into account in sentence for sequence 1 as on Form 1): production and possession of child abuse material

14CV participated in a recorded interview on 19 February 2013. On 20 February 2013 the police executed a search warrant and seized items belonging to the applicant, including his mobile phone and iPad. He admitted knowing CV, whose photo he used as his screensaver. His iPad password included CV's name. The photographs on the applicant's iPad and phone included 15 images of CV lifting her shirt, revealing her stomach, lying down in a suggestive pose or close up shots of her genital area with her underwear on. The photographs fall into category one of the child exploitation tracking scheme categorisation of photographs. This gives rise to sequence 4 which was on the Form 1 and was taken into account in the sentence for sequence 1.

Victim EJ

15EJ was born on 17 December 2005. When she was interviewed on 5 March 2013 she revealed four occasions when the applicant had indecently assaulted her.

Sequence 6: aggravated indecent assault on victim less than 16 years old

16In November or December 2013, the applicant collected EJ and her 11-year-old brother from primary school. While they were in the street, at a time when EJ's brother was apart from them, the applicant tickled and squeezed EJ's vagina under her school skirt but on top of her underwear. His actions hurt her physically. 

Sequence 7: aggravated indecent assault on victim less than 16 years old

17When EJ's brother rejoined them, they continued to the car park and then went to Donut King. When they had bought food, the applicant seated himself between EJ and her brother. At one point, he leaned over to EJ, placed his elbow between her legs and rubbed her vagina on the outside of her clothes, which she said really hurt. 

Sequence 8: aggravated indecent assault on victim less than 16 years old

18The next day the applicant again collected EJ and her brother from school and drove to a shopping centre where he gave EJ's brother some money for ice creams. The applicant slapped EJ's bottom gently and instructed her to get in the back of the car. She complied. The applicant started to tickle and squeeze her vagina area on top of her underpants. He then pulled her shorts aside and asked her if he could kiss it. EJ, who did not feel that she had a choice, submitted while he kissed her vagina on the outside of her underpants. The applicant, who was about to do it again, stopped when EJ's brother returned.

Sequence 9: aggravated indecent assault on victim less than 16 years old

19On the last day of term in December 2012, the applicant picked up EJ and her brother from school. Her brother sat in the front seat and EJ sat in the seat behind her brother. He took them to a fast food outlet for dinner. On the way home he leaned over and used his left hand to tickle EJ's vaginal area.

The remarks on sentence

20After recounting the facts set out above, his Honour recorded the finding that the applicant had had a dysfunctional upbringing and had been dealt with as a neglected child at the age of 12. He abused substances in the past but there is no evidence that that continued, or played any part in his offending conduct. The applicant, who was 66 at the time of sentence, had substantial physical ailments but there was no evidence as to life expectancy or to indicate that he was not receiving appropriate treatment in gaol.

21He was divorced in 1990 after a marriage that lasted for sixteen years. He has six adult children, one of whom died eighteen months before the sentence hearing.

22His Honour addressed the applicant's criminal history and noted that he had previously been convicted of two counts of sexual intercourse with a person between 10 and 16, one count of sexual intercourse with a person under 16 while in authority, three counts of carnal knowledge and one of incest and one of aid and abet carnal knowledge. After an appeal to this Court in 1999 he received an overall sentence of 12 years, 6 months with a non-parole period of 9 years. The sentencing judge recorded that the applicant said that he had been on parole since 2007. He had not completed any custody-based courses for sex offenders.

23The sentencing judge accepted the evidence of Dr Furst, psychiatrist, whose report was tendered on behalf of the applicant at the sentence hearing, that the applicant is a paedophile who is driven to commit offences because of his sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children. His Honour found that the applicant had formed a relationship with the victims' families and that all offences involved significant breaches of trust.

24His Honour found that the offences were opportunistic but occurred in the context of grooming CV and that there was no evidence of physical injury to either victim.

25His Honour addressed the seriousness of such offences and their impact on the victims in the following terms:
""It is not unusual for a child who has been the attention of this sort of behaviour to suffer long term emotional and/ or psychological problems. Sometimes those sorts of problems will not be apparent until many years later.
The offences are serious, but not within the middle of the range of objective seriousness as denoted by the standard non-parole period of eight years.""

26The sentencing judge found that there was no evidence that the applicant did not know what he was doing, the consequences of his conduct (at least as far as he was concerned) or that his judgment was impaired. His Honour considered that there was no basis to consider his moral culpability to be compromised and referred to his buying of gifts and attempts to persuade his victims not to tell others of what had occurred. His Honour found the applicant to be remorseful but considered his prospects of rehabilitation to be ""very, very poor"". As to future dangerousness, the sentencing judge found:
""The Court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he poses a danger to the public in the future.""

27His Honour was not satisfied that there were special circumstances. The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing.

28His Honour allowed a discount of 25% for the applicant's plea of guilty.

Grounds of appeal

29The first two grounds of appeal are related in that the third ground, manifest excess, is a conclusion that is said to arise from the first two grounds. The first two grounds seek to explain the third. 

30A sentence reflects all relevant considerations. The weight to be given to each is not susceptible to mathematically determination or calculation. The first two grounds are, in substance, particulars of the third ground. 

Ground 1: alleged failure to give appropriate weight to the subjective features of the applicant

31The applicant submitted that his age at the time of sentence, his significant physical ailments and his remorse were not sufficiently taken into account by the sentencing judge and contended, that if they had been, the sentence would have been significantly lower. He contended that the notional starting point (before the deduction of 25% for the plea) of 16 years did not take adequate account of the subjective circumstances.

32The applicant argued that his Honour ought to have inferred from his ""substantial physical ailments"", which included, according to Dr Furst, emphysema resulting in a collapsed lung, degenerative spinal disease, arthritis, obesity and cardiomyopathy, that his life expectancy was compromised and that, accordingly the sentence was ""crushing"".

33The applicant's age at time of sentence and his age upon release is the result of his having committed serious sex offences at the age of 65. His age and relative infirmity did not prevent the commission of the offences. Indeed these attributes may have assisted his grooming of the victims and their families. On one occasion he used his lack of physical prowess as a ruse to have CV come and help him clear out the drawers in his bedroom in the course of conduct that became sequence 5. 

34Although subjective circumstances are a relevant consideration, the weight to be given to them is a matter for the sentencing judge. I am not persuaded that the weight given to them by the sentencing judge was insufficient.

Ground 2: alleged giving of undue weight to the finding of future dangerousness

35The applicant placed particular emphasis on the following finding in the remarks on sentence:
""It is clear [the applicant] is a paedophile. These offences were committed at the age of sixty-five. In the Court's view, his prospects of rehabilitation are very very poor. The Court is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he poses a danger to the public in the future.""

36The applicant argued that his Honour erroneously made a finding of fact, rather than considering the degree of risk of re-offending. He relied on the following passage from R v McNamara [2004] NSWCCA 42 in which Grove J (Sully and Bell JJ agreeing) said:
""[27] Counsel for the respondent contended that the test is ""whether the offender poses the risk of relevant future conduct"" and that the correct approach is for a judge to determine whether he is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that such risks exist. With respect to the contender, I do not find that formulation useful.

[28] In the span of human affairs risk can always be postulated and of its mere existence there can be no doubt. For example, there is risk . . . that a person of previously unblemished character may commit a crime, that a convict may offend again. The elimination of risk is something which is viewable only from hindsight. . . . The convict, to the end of his life, did not re-offend. What is of concern to a sentencing judge is, in my opinion, not the existence of risk - that I would see as a given - but a degree of risk. That does not require the certitude of proof beyond reasonable doubt nor the exercise of balance to determine what is more probable than not.

[29] On that approach, references to proof beyond reasonable doubt or proof on the balance of probabilities become otiose. . . . ""

37The applicant contended that his Honour's finding led him to attribute undue significance to future dangerousness. The applicant also argued that his Honour did not adequately consider the applicant's advancing age and infirmity at the time of release when assessing the risk of future offending.

38The applicant argued that his Honour was dismissive of the benefit that could be derived from custody-based programmes for sex offenders or pharmacological treatment to reduce his sex drive, both of which affected the degree of risk. The applicant relied on statements made to the sentencing judge by his counsel that he had not previously had such treatment but was willing to engage in it.

39The passage set out above from R v McNamara does not assist the applicant. It was not necessary for the sentencing judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant ""poses a danger to the public in the future"" since that is not the relevant test. But there was no reason for the sentencing judge not to express the finding in those terms. That the applicant had not undergone custody-based programmes for sex offenders and re-offended does not provide a basis for optimism that if he undertook such a programme he would not re-offend. That he has not had pharmacological treatment in the past to reduce his levels of testosterone does not establish that, even if he were to consent to such treatment, it would be effective in the future to control his urges and prevent recidivism.

40To protect the community from the offender is a relevant consideration in sentencing: s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Act). Whether the community requires protection requires an assessment of the offender's risk of re-offending. As Gleeson CJ said in Fardon v Attorney-General (Qld) [2004] HCA 46; 223 CLR 575 at [12]:
""No doubt, predictions of future danger may be unreliable, but, as the case of Veen [(No. 2) (1998) 164 CLR 465] shows, they may also be right. Common law sentencing principles, and some legislative regimes, permit or require such predictions at the time of sentencing, which will often be many years before possible release.""

41The sentencing remarks indicate that his Honour considered the risk to be high. I do not discern any error in the finding, either in the terms in which it was expressed, or in its substance. That a 65-year-old man, who has already been incarcerated for a significant period for more serious, but otherwise similar, offences against children, would re-offend by committing the index offences, thereby exposing himself to the risk of a further lengthy term of incarceration is a powerful indication either that he was unable or unwilling to control his paedophilic sex drive. Although the past is not always repeated in the future, it is a guide to what may occur, particularly when past conduct, as in the present case, arises from a mental condition which, when acted on, necessarily results in criminal conduct. 

42It was, in my view, open to the sentencing judge to regard as no more than speculative the prospect that there would be any substantial diminution in the risk of the applicant's re-offending by reason either of custody-based sex offender programmes or pharmacological treatment, neither of which had previously been tried, or of the applicant's increased age on release. It may be accepted that testosterone levels in younger men are generally considerably higher than in older men. However, one cannot infer from this truism that the applicant's risk of re-offending will be materially diminished by the increase in his age occasioned by the passage of the non-parole period.

Ground 3: the sentence was manifestly excessive

43The applicant submitted that the notional starting point of sixteen years was manifestly excessive and out of line with the statistics of similar offences. He referred to the ""relatively low level of his offending"" and relied on the fact that all contact with the victims' genital areas was outside the victims' clothing.

44Manifest excess is a conclusion: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]. As can be seen from the table at the commencement of these reasons, the offences of aggravated indecent assault each carry a maximum sentence of ten years and a standard non-parole period of 8 years. The offence on the Form 1 carried a maximum sentence of ten years and it was appropriate that it be taken into account with a view to increasing the sentence for sequence 1 due to the greater weight to be given to personal deterrence and retribution: Attorney-General's Application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No. 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [42] per Spigelman CJ. These legislative guideposts provide an indication of the seriousness with which Parliament views such offences: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. Statistics and previously decided cases are of limited value in the sentencing process: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54] - [55].

45The applicant manipulated and breached the trust of the victims, their parents and their siblings. He exploited the vulnerability, naivete and innocence of his victims. His use of fast food and gifts to corrupt his victims was cynical. The way in which he ingratiated himself with the victims' parents by providing driving and handyman services was calculated to engender trust, familiarity and facilitate access. He damaged his victims in a manner and extent that may not manifest itself fully for years and may well be permanent.

46Section 3A of the Act provides:
""Purposes of sentencing
The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,
(c) to protect the community from the offender,
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""

47It was open to the sentencing judge to give more weight to the purposes other than s 3A(d), in circumstances where his Honour did not consider rehabilitation to be a real prospect.

48I consider that the sentencing judge was entitled to assess the objective seriousness of the offending conduct as below mid-range but nonetheless potentially very damaging to the victims. Although the offending conduct for the index offences was not of the gravity of his earlier offending, this does not afford any basis to conclude that there has been any rehabilitation in the interim. That the offending stopped when it did was a reflection of CV's mother's vigilance and concern for her daughter which led to his apprehension rather than any self-control or moderation on the applicant's part.

49As referred to above, the weight to be given to the various, and at times conflicting, purposes of sentencing was a matter for the sentencing judge and could not be determined as a matter of mathematics: Veen (No. 2) [1998] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465 at 476; Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [39]. His Honour was obliged to act in accordance with the principles of totality and proportionality. In my view his Honour did so by allowing for a degree of implicit concurrence (of 3 years and 9 months) within the aggregate sentence.

50I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

Proposed orders

51I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal dismissed.

52BELLEW J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Adamson J. For the reasons set out by her Honour, I agree with the orders she proposes. I would simply add the following. 

53Her Honour noted (at [32]) that one of the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant was that the sentence imposed was ""crushing"". In R v MAK; R v MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 this Court (Spigelman CJ, Howie and Whealy JJ) observed (at [17]; 164):

"" ... an extremely long total sentence may be ""crushing"" upon the offender in the sense that it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there maybe of rehabilitation and reform.""

54However it is important to bear in mind that the Court then said: 

""Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint.""

55The present was a case of multiple offending. In my view, the various circumstances of that offending to which Adamson J referred, particularly those at [45] and [48], disentitled the applicant to the element of mercy to which this Court referred in MAK.

2704603,Balloey v R [2014] NSWCCA 165,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Adams J.
2ADAMS J:
Introduction
3On 13 December 2007 the appellant (rather than the ""applicant"" as, for reasons which will become clear, I propose leave to appeal should be granted) was sentenced for the offence that on 31 October 2003 he attempted to possess 195 kilograms of MDMA (ecstasy, 87.44 kilograms pure), which was not less than the commercial quantity, contrary to s 233B(1)(c) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).  The commercial quantity for MDMA is 0.5 kg pure and the maximum penalty for the offence is life imprisonment.  The appellant was sentenced to a term of 24 years of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years, commencing 1 November 2003.  This sentence resulted from applying to a starting point of 32 years a reduction of 15 per cent for his plea of guilty, given at the conclusion of the prosecution case, and an additional reduction of 10 per cent for ""the mitigatory effect of the element of coercion"".
4The appellant had been arraigned on 25 October 2004 with a co-accused, Joseph Breyne who was ultimately acquitted.  The appellant's sentence proceedings was ultimately listed for sentence before Dodd DCJ on 16 June 2005 but, because his Honour retired, the proceedings were adjourned to 24 February 2006 and ultimately concluded on 13 December 2007 when the appellant was sentenced.  The delay in sentencing the appellant was undesirable but it is not suggested by either party that the reasons for so doing are presently significant.  The notice of appeal was filed out of time but the Crown does not oppose an extension of time to allow the application for leave to appeal to be heard. 
5The grounds of appeal are, in substance, as follows - 
1(a)  The learned sentencing judge erred in concluding that the appellant was a ""principal"" in the commission of the offence for which he was sentenced; and
1(b) the learned sentencing judged erred in sentencing the appellant upon the basis that his offending conduct was aggravated by his having committed the serious offence of importation, with which he was not charged.
2.  The sentence imposed was excessive having regard to that imposed on co-offender Antonius Rutten. 
3.  Some other and lesser sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. 
6Rutten pleaded guilty in the Local Court to the same offence to which the appellant ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced on 11 June 2004 by Norrish QC DCJ to a term of imprisonment of 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years, dating from 1 November 2003, when he was arrested.  
Facts
7The facts relied on by the Crown were not substantially in dispute, the appellant's case both at trial and on sentence being that he had been coerced into participation in the importation.  Of course, his guilty plea necessarily implied that the defence of duress was not available but he gave evidence that he was subjected to threats which overcame his reluctance to participate.  I will return to this matter in due course.
8The appellant's involvement became known to the Australian Federal Police in the course of conducting a joint investigation with Belgian police into a criminal group based in Belgium involved in the international movement of drugs concealed in agricultural machinery.  The appellant had an agricultural machinery business which may well otherwise have been entirely legitimate.  However, he packed a large quantity of MDMA in a hose attached to an irrigator to be sent from Belgium to arrive in Australia in the first week of October.  Between June and July 2003 Rutten, a Dutch national, agreed with people in the Netherlands to travel to Australia to assist in the distribution of a large quantity of MDMA.  A local customs broker, who was not criminally involved in any way, was engaged to arrange storage for the consignment.     
9On 4 October 2003 the irrigator arrived in Sydney and was transferred to a facility for examination, when the drugs were discovered in the rubber hose attached to the irrigator.  The ecstasy tablets were replaced with harmless product and the irrigator reconstructed.  On 9 October Rutten flew into Sydney, hired a motor vehicle and checked into a serviced apartment in Sydney.  Between 22 and 30 October he had a number of coded conversations with a person named Sam, then in Europe.  Sam gave Rutten instructions about taking his vehicle to a hotel near the airport, parking it in the car park and collecting it once the ecstasy tablets had been placed in it and the vehicle returned to the hotel by an unidentified person.  On 30 October Rutten left his car in the car park of the hotel and checked into a room.  On the same day the irrigator was moved to storage premises arranged by the customs agent.  On that day, the appellant (a Belgian national) arrived in Sydney and booked into a room at the airport hotel.  
10On 31 October Breyne (the appellant's co-accused) also arrived in Sydney and travelled to the hotel where he met with the appellant.  The two men then went to a local hardware store and purchased an angle grinder with discs, an extension lead and other tools, shortly after travelling in the vehicle which had been hired by Rutten to the storage premises where the irrigator had been placed.  During the course of the day the appellant and Breyne, using the vehicle to tow and unreel the rubber hose in segments, cut the end of the unreeled hose with a circular saw and extracted bags of what they thought was ecstasy.  The appellant knew how to do this because he had packed the drugs into the hose before the irrigator was sent to Sydney.  The appellant and Breyne placed what they thought was the ecstasy into the vehicle and returned to the hotel, where it was left.  Later that day Rutten saw the vehicle and the bags containing white tablets on the back seat, retrieved a set of keys from one of its rear tyres and drove the vehicle and its contents to the underground car park of the building in which he had rented his apartment.  Later that night he removed all the bags from the vehicle and put them into various suitcases in his room, making an arrangement with a buyer who wanted to purchase some 200,000 of the 866,000 tablets.  Shortly after this conversation the police intervened and Rutten was arrested.
11At about 6.30pm on 31 October 2003 the appellant and Breyne went to the airport and booked flights leaving Australia the following day, staying overnight in a room at a nearby hotel.  On 1 November 2003 they purchased a broom from a nearby hardware store and went to the storage facility where the irrigator had been left, cleaning and sweeping the warehouse, obviously to remove any evidence of their earlier activities.  Later that day they travelled to the airport, where they were arrested. 
The appellant's role
12The primary judge rejected the suggestion that the appellant was merely a tool of others or merely a courier, pointing in particular to the fact that he had packed the drugs into the irrigator hose and unpacked them with Breyne's assistance in Sydney.  His Honour described his role as ""central"", a description with which no issue is presently taken.  However, his Honour deduced from the ""dozens and dozens of telephone calls"" which had been intercepted that ""he was a principal of this operation"".  It appears that it had been originally intended that one Sclabi would make the trip to Australia but that, for whatever reason, he could not do so and the appellant therefore flew to Sydney.  The judge said - 
""The offender Balloey says that he was under pressure from certain parties including van Wesenbeeck because of money which he said was wrongfully claimed against him by van Wesenbeeck.  On 30 September 2003 at 53 minutes past seven at night, there was a telephone call in which Balloey tells van Wesenbeeck that he does not have the money. Van Wesenbeeck calls him a dirty bastard and says, 'Tomorrow evening at five o'clock listen at six o'clock if you not be here I come and make you to pieces'. There is further abuse.  Marnix (Balloey) explains that the reason that he does not have the money is because he is waiting for the credit to be approved on Monday.  Janoice tells Marnix that he knows that he is 'playing with his life'.  This is taken from Exhibit BBBB on 30 September 2003, a telephone call of that date. 
Janoice tells Balloey amongst other things, 'I am the boss, you are nothing'. There are various other conversations between van Wesenbeeck and Balloey and I think it likely that Van Wesenbeeck arranged to have Balloey threatened or beaten up.  In general, I am satisfied that there was some pressure from van Wesenbeeck on the offender. Notwithstanding that, there is no doubt that Balloey continued with making detailed and complicated arrangements for the transportation of these drugs to Australia.  The offender, when he gave evidence about this, indicated that he was reluctant at all stages and felt under pressure.  As I will explain in due course, much of the offender's evidence is humbug, but the telephone call to which I have referred is one instance of objective evidence sustaining the suggestion of coercion.  I will come back to that.
In any event, the brief recitation I have gone through a few moments ago is a concise statement of the objective actions of the offender.  He was central in arranging the transportation onto the ship.  He packed the drugs into the irrigator.  He flew out to Australia and he participated in the exercise of extracting the drugs from the irrigator and putting them in a situation so that they could be taken onwards and no doubt sold in due course.""
13The sentencing judge concluded that the appellant ""played a significant and fundamental role in an extremely serious criminal enterprise ... [the purpose of which] was trafficking of a narcotic and the distribution of the drugs in Australia"".  He noted that this ""exercise required sophisticated methods of concealment and packing and unpacking, all of which was supervised by the offender"" whose role ""at the European end"" was described by his Honour as ""extensive"", established not only by the surveillance evidence but also by the evidence of the appellant in the sentence proceedings of how the drugs were delivered to him, how he took the machine to an area in his parents' property and placed the drugs into the irrigator's hose before its transportation to the port and thence to Australia.  Moreover, the appellant was involved in the shipment of a trial consignment.
14The appellant had told Dutch police when he was questioned by them in Australia that he put the ecstasy pills in the machine because he ""was seriously put under pressure by Roland Sclabi... [who told me] that the Dutch people would assault my family and kill them if I did not co-operate"". During the sentence proceedings, the following evidence was given - 
""Q.  What were you thinking of when you first arrived at the airport? A.  I was faced with an impossible situation because I knew that at home the criminals were capable of putting my company to fire.  To set fire to it or to kill my parents and I had no choice but to follow the list [sic] on the orders of the Belgian chap"".
The appellant said that he had repeatedly been threatened before he put the drugs into the irrigator hose and had been assaulted ""at least 20 times"".  Further evidence of the appellant was referred to by the sentencing judge, which it is not necessary to detail.  
15In sum, as the judge summarised it, the gist of the appellant's claim about coercion is that he had been wrongly accused of misappropriating a large sum of money, that he was beaten and threats and pressure put upon him to repay this money and he engaged in the enterprise of importing the drugs into Australia as the only means of possibly discharging the alleged debt.  His Honour observed that the appellant's evidence was almost worthless, given his lies when first arrested and the fact that he had multiple convictions for offences in the nature of fraud.  However, his Honour was satisfied that there was significant independent corroboration of some aspects of the coercion claim contained in mutual assistance material provided by an inspector of the Dutch police.  His Honour concluded - 
""In the present case, I am satisfied that the offender has proven on the balance of probabilities that his criminality is mitigated to some extent by threats and pressures.  That mitigation assesses towards the lower end of the scale of mitigatory impacts.""
In coming to this conclusion his Honour referred to the failure of the appellant to go to the police, declare the threats and expose the proposed transaction, which could have been done in Holland, Belgium or Sydney.  His Honour also pointed to the fact that pressures and threats of the kind described by the appellant are ""common coin in drug dealing"" given the illegal nature of the enterprise, observing - 
""Even though I accept... that [the appellant] was threatened by Hells Angels type characters and the like, and even though I accept on the probabilities that such threats relate to this importation, only a weak or compromised character like this offender would allow such pressure to push him towards major criminality of this kind."" 
The reference to the character of the appellant concerned his possible involvement in illegal activities in Belgium, where he had a significant criminal record for fraud offences.  
16The judge explained that he deduced from the material that, in substance, the reason why the appellant failed to go to the police was that he was concerned about exposure of what might have been his own criminal activities, though his Honour did not definitely conclude that he had been otherwise so engaged.  The third reason for giving the coercion little significance was that he thought that the appellant had exaggerated the nature of the coercion and its impact on him, rejecting the submission that it was the sole contributing cause of his involvement in the enterprise, although it had ""some weight"".  His Honour accepted that the appellant was involved ""partly out of fear"". 
17As the grounds make clear, the focus of the appeal concerns the findings of the judge as to the appellant's role.  Mr Rosser QC for the appellant points in particular to the following passages in the judge's reasons - 
""The multiplicity of telephone calls in which [the appellant] plays a leading role makes it perfectly clear that I can come to no other conclusion than that he was principal of this operation.  
He was a principal at the European end and he was a principal at the Australian end.  Whether he was the overall organiser is difficult to say and unnecessary to decide.  He was a principal.  Any suggestion that he was a mere tool of others, that is to say a courier is unsustainable.  He was not a mere courier.  He actually physically packed the drugs into the irrigator and he physically unpacked them at this end.  His role was central.  It was not the only role, but it was central and principal role.  Dozens and dozens of telephone calls support that proposition.""
18His Honour added - 
""The offender played a significant and fundamental role in an extremely serious criminal enterprise.  There is no doubt that the purpose of it was trafficking of a narcotic and the distribution of the drugs in Australia.  The exercise required sophisticated methods of concealment and packing and unpacking all of which was supervised by the offender.  I repeat that his role was that of a principal.  Perhaps than Van Wesenbeeck regarded himself as being more important, but nonetheless the offender was a principal."" 
19In explaining this finding, his Honour referred to ""the extensive role played by the offender at the European end"". 
20The judge concluded his assessment of the offence -  
""... by repeating that it is a grave offence, one of the most serious in the criminal calendar.  The offence involved a massive importation of prohibited drugs, and the organisation of the crime was highly sophisticated.  This is the kind of offence, and the offender's role in it is the kind of role, which prompts consideration of whether or not to impose a sentence of life imprisonment ..."" [Emphasis added.] 
Submissions
21Mr Rosser submitted, in brief, that the sentencing judge's characterisation of the appellant as a principal rested on his Honour's findings of what the appellant had done overseas to arrange with others for the importation of the drugs, as illustrated by his Honour's observation that the appellant was no ""mere courier"".  Put another way, the appellant had been punished for participating in the importation, an offence with which he had not been charged.  Mr Rosser contended that the activities for which the appellant was liable to be punished were those which occurred in Australia relating to his attempting to obtain possession of the ecstasy tablets which, as a happenstance, had been imported.
22When comparing the activities of the co-offender, Mr Rosser submitted that the appellant had done little more in Australia than, as he put it, perform the ""mechanical task of obtaining the material from where it was secreted and providing it to the ultimate distributor"": the evil of distribution of the drugs within Australia, to which the appellant's Australian activities was an initial step, was as much the responsibility of his co-offender and he ought not to have been punished for having been a party to the importation, even if he had made a major contribution to that part of the process, since importation was no part, let alone an element, of the offence for which he was being sentenced but was a different and separate offence for which he could not be punished. 
23It was submitted by the Crown, in substance, that it was necessary for the sentencing judge to refer extensively to what had occurred in Europe prior to the importation in order to deal with the appellant's case that he had been a reluctant but coerced participant.  The Crown submitted, in effect, that his conclusion that the appellant was a principal concerned the appellant's role in Australia, which would not be understood unless his involvement with the entire transaction which ended with the Australian collection was considered.  The prosecutor pointed to the following passage in the judge's reasons (immediately following the passage referring to the appellant's character set out above) - 
""Let me make it perfectly clear that I am not sentencing this man for any other offence than that for which [he] is specifically before this court.  But the way that he has raised this matter of coercion and pressure leads me to conclude that he was, and had been for some time, moving in a milieu where criminality of some kind was occurring.  I repeat, this is not to say that I am sentencing him for any other offence - merely that the kind of threats over alleged or disputed debts which are said to be behind the pressures and coercion in this case are a characteristic of drug dealing.  This ties in with first point that I made a few moments ago - that the offender failed at any point to go to the police.  I deduce that one of the reasons why he failed to go to the police was because in some senses he was a compromised character, though there is no specific evidence upon which I can definitely conclude that he himself was involved in any other particular criminal activity."" [Emphasis added.]
Consideration
24Were it not for the concluding passage set out above in [20], I would have accepted that the sentencing judge's consideration of the role played by the appellant in Europe was undertaken not only to assess the significance of his claimed coercion but also the extent of his role in Australia in relation to attempting to obtain possession of the large quantity of prohibited drugs.  It would have been impossible to accurately assess his responsibility in that regard without understanding his overall role in the enterprise of which what he did in Australia was the culmination.  However, the emphatic inclusion as incident of the offence for which the appellant was facing sentence of the fact that it ""involved a massive importation"" to my mind mandates the conclusion that, indeed, his Honour regarded the importation of the drugs as part and parcel of the criminality of the offence with which the appellant was charged and for which he was being sentenced.  
25The passage relied on by the prosecutor which is set out in [23] is, when read in context, confined to the likelihood that the appellant had been involved in crimes in Belgium which rendered him susceptible to pressure and the desire by the judge to make it clear that he was not taking those possible offences into account.  This is made clear by the context, which dealt specifically with evaluating the claim of coercion (as shown by the emphasised passage), and not at all with the appellant's role in the offence whether in Belgium or here.
26However, I reject the argument that the judge erred in characterising the appellant's role in the charged offence as a principal.  That description of what he did was entirely appropriate and his Honour was not only entitled, but bound, to look at the entirety of the appellant's involvement in the enterprise in order to properly assess the criminality of the charged offence, namely attempting to possess a very large quantity of prohibited drug.  
27There have been a number of cases in which this Court has considered the significance of the offender's prior involvement in an importation of the drugs of which he is charged with possessing after they have been landed in Australia.  In El-Ghourani v R [2009] NSWCCA 140; (2009) 195 A Crim R 208, Spigelman CJ (James and Simpson JJ agreeing) pointed out - 
""[22]  A similar issue arose in R v Lawless (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 June 1994, unreported) where the applicant had been found not guilty of being knowingly concerned in the importation, but guilty of an alternative charge of possession, of heroin. Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Gleeson CJ and Blanch J agreed, said (at 4-5): 
'The fact that the jury found the applicant not guilty of the charge of being knowingly concerned in the importation does not mean, as has been submitted, that the judge was restricted to the evidence of the admissions made by the applicant to the police. In Regina v Ferrer-Esis (1991) 55 A Crim R 231 at 239, this Court said that a particular circumstance relevant to both an importation offence and a possession offence may be taken into account upon the possession offence (to which the prisoner there had pleaded guilty) notwithstanding that it could also have been taken into account upon an importation offence (with which he had not been charged).
In determining the nature of the applicant's possession offence for the purpose of sentencing the applicant, it was appropriate for the judge to have regard to the entire transaction: Regina v Laurentiu & Becheru (at 415); including what he expected to take possession of and what he was going to do with it when he obtained possession - whether, for example, the drugs were for his own use, or whether he was in possession of them in the course of a commercial narcotic venture in which he was taking part as a middleman attached to an organized distribution chain: ibid (at 415-416); In other words, whether the possession related to that of an intermediary or principal in the course of an enterprise or whether it was merely that of an end user: ibid (at 418).
Nor are those facts upon which the judge relied denied relevance by the sentencing principle laid down in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. A sentencing judge may take into account all of the conduct of the prisoner, including that which would aggravate the offence, but may not take into account as matters of aggravation facts established in the evidence which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence or which would have rendered the prisoner liable to a more serious penalty than that which is prescribed for the offence of which he had been found guilty: ibid (at 389, 392). Both offences involved in this trial carry the same maximum sentence: Customs Act 1901 (Cth), s 233B. Moreover, as this Court also said in Regina v Ferrer-Esis (at 239), the offence of possession is not necessarily a less serious offence than that of importing the drugs; it may or may not be, depending upon the circumstances of the particular case, and in particular upon the involvement of the individual prisoner in each: and see Regina v Thiagarajah (1989) 41 A Crim R 45 at 50; Regina v Lam (1991) 53 A Crim R 118 at 119-120; Regina v Laurentiu & Becheru (at 419).'""
28The Chief Justice noted (at [30]) that, in light of the observations of the plurality in The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; 108 A Crim R 464 at [18], the suggestion that the principles in De Simoni do not apply where the offences have the same maximum sentence must be qualified, since the offender cannot be punished for an offence for which he or she has not been charged.  However (at [30]), ""the circumstances relating to the process of importation may also be relevant to a charge of possession"" (emphasis in text) and (at [31) cited, as an example, the following observations by Hodgson JA in R v Guiu [2002] NSWCCA 181; (2002) 129 A Crim R 387 -   ""[2] The sentencing judge noted that it would offend against the principle in De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383; 5 A Crim R 329 to have regard to criminality involved in crimes with which the applicant had not been charged, and undertook a very careful evaluation of the culpability of the applicant. Accordingly, when the sentencing judge found that the applicant's 'role in this importation' was 'of considerably more importance than that of Ferrer', that should not be understood as suggesting that the judge was proceeding on the basis that the applicant could be sentenced for her role in the importation: rather, 'importation' there must, in the light of the judge's reference to De Simoni, be understood as referring to the overall enterprise which included both importation and initial disposal within Australia.
[3] But even so, it seems to me that there was error in the sentencing judge's analysis. In this case, it was important to have firmly in view that the applicant was not being sentenced in respect of any role whatsoever in the actual importation of drugs, so that any finding as to knowledge or even involvement in the importation could only be used to assess her culpability in relation to the limited involvement with which she was charged, namely her attempt to obtain possession of drugs already brought to Australia.""
29The Chief Justice went on to say - 
""[33] ...[The] act of possession can be attended by a wide range of moral culpability. The circumstances in which a person charged with a possession offence came into possession of the offending matter, and what it was that the person intended to do with that matter, can all be relevant to determining the degree of moral culpability attached to the act of possession itself. 
[34]  In my opinion, her Honour made permissible use of the applicant's involvement in the overall transaction. Indeed, he himself gave evidence to the effect that he was involved in a drug smuggling syndicate. The issue her Honour had to resolve was the degree of his involvement. In assessing the evidence in this respect, her Honour did not lose the focus on the particular charge, namely that of an attempt to possess.""
His Honour (at [40]) agreed with the conclusion of the sentencing judge that the central role of the offender in the ""overall transaction ... identified the particular nature of the conduct constituting possession in the present case and which determined that his degree of moral culpability was of a high order"".
30The distinction is not always an easy one to make.  In Tu v R [2011] NSWCCA 31 Hall J said (citing, inter alia, Lawless and El-Ghourani)  - 
""[74]  Accordingly, in the present case, the fact of communications between both the applicant and Zhang and the exporters of the drugs prior to importation, whilst not an aggravating factor in relation to possession offences, may nonetheless be taken into account in elucidating the nature of the applicant's possession offence for the purposes of sentencing ... In other words, the possession if obtained in the context of a criminal narcotic venture may be different from possession obtained in unplanned or unsophisticated circumstances. In this way, the overall context becomes pertinent to an assessment of the culpability of an accused for an offence of possession by seeing it in its context...[so that] the circumstances relating to the process of importation may also be relevant to a charge of possession ..."" 
Nevertheless, as pointed out by McCallum J -
""[142]  The Crown submitted that it was appropriate for the Judge to have regard to ""the entire transaction"".  As correctly noted on behalf of the applicant, however, that approach must yield to the principle stated in De Simoni . To the extent that the entire transaction brought into consideration complicity in the importation by way of aggravation, such conduct could plainly have been made the subject of a distinct charge and accordingly ought not to have been taken into account.""  
31In the present case, so far as the judge used the evidence as to the appellant's involvement in the overall transaction to identify the particular nature of the conduct constituting the offence of attempting to possess the drug to determine the degree of his moral culpability and conclude it was of a high order (to adopt the language of Spigelman CJ in El-Ghourani v R at [40]), his Honour committed no error.  However, with respect, the passages cited above from his Honour's reasons demonstrate that he went much further and regarded the offence for which the appellant was being sentenced as involving also the importation.  This conclusion is strengthened by the very substantial sentence of 32 years which was his Honour's starting point and his considering whether a life sentence was appropriate.  
32Accordingly, I would propose that leave to appeal be granted, ground 1(a) be dismissed but that ground 1(b) be upheld.  As the court must, subject to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), resentence the appellant, it is not necessary to deal with ground 2.
Resentence
33The objective circumstances are sufficiently set out above.  It is appropriate to adopt the primary judge's factual findings.  Not only do they appear to be justified by the evidence but it was not submitted on the appellant's behalf that, apart from the conclusion that the appellant was a principal, his Honour erred.  I have concluded that the judge was entitled to look at the overall scheme involving the appellant for the purpose of defining his role in the offence and that his Honour did not err in describing him as a principal.  With respect, however, I do not find this appellation particularly informative in this case (vide Olbrich at [19] ff), though certainly the appellant played a more important role than that of courier.  For resentencing, it is more useful, to my mind, simply to consider the appellant's actual role, so far as it can be determined for the purpose of assessing both his culpability and bringing into account the sentence imposed on the co-offender Rutten.  
34I would accept the judge's conclusions about the very doubtful veracity of the appellant and the limited extent to which coercion was a significant factor in his offending.  Coercion is part of the objective circumstances of the offence and should be considered as part of the overall assessment of the appellant's culpability.  With respect, no specific discount (as undertaken by the primary judge) should be separately applied.  There was some evidence of assisting the authorities which his Honour (with respect, rightly) characterised as trivial.
35Summing up the objective factors, the appellant, as part of the drug distribution business of a criminal group, provided the agricultural equipment in which the MDMA was secreted, supervised its loading, and came to Australia to unpack the machine and ensure the drugs were delivered to the person (Rutten) responsible for ongoing distribution.  The intercepted telephone calls involving the appellant commence in April 2003 when the details of the purchase by the appellant of the machine are discussed in terms which indicate a much earlier involvement.  Frequent subsequent calls deal with many detailed aspects of the proposed importation, indicating that the appellant was, in important respects, managing this aspect of the business, no doubt with others.  He was party to an exploratory delivery.  I would accept that the appellant was not involved at the inception or overall organizational control level and, as found by the primary judge, that in part his cooperation was secured by coercion, though this was towards the lower end of the scale.  As mentioned, it was not initially the arrangement for him to go to Australia but this became necessary because another participant was unavailable.  Contrary to the submission made by Mr Rosser in this respect, the change did not suggest the appellant's minor role.  If anything, it suggests the opposite.  The details of what happened in Australia I have already set out.  The role in the attempted possession was as a significant, rather than incidental, participant in the fact that the drugs were present in the machine and their being removed for the purpose of being passed on and ultimately distributed.  Disregarding any aggravation that may have inhered from his involvement in the importation, the appellant attempted to ensure the accomplishment of the very point of the arrangement in which he had been an actively and significantly engaged for a considerable time.  It is not possible to determine the financial advantage the appellant hoped to gain, but it should be inferred from the very large quantity of drugs and the scale and character of his involvement that he expected it would have been substantial.  His criminal culpability was therefore considerable.
36As to the appellant's subjective features, the following matters have been taken largely from the primary judge's reasons.  The appellant was aged 51 years at the date of the offence and is now 57.  He is a Belgian national, married with two children, the family residing in Belgium.  The impact of his imprisonment on his family is a relevant consideration although it can play but a slight role in his sentence.  That he cannot be visited by his family is also a relevant factor, as is his lack of familiarity with English, but these are relatively insignificant matters, given they are present in many cases of this type involving an offender from abroad.  The appellant has a criminal record commencing in 1988 and has been imprisoned on five occasions for forgery, fraud, attempted fraud and the like.  He has no convictions involving drugs or violence.  He has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and requires medication for this and other conditions.  There is no suggestion that his medical condition is not being adequately managed in prison or that it renders his imprisonment significantly more harsh.  In light of the attempts of the appellant to minimise his responsibility both to police and less than candid evidence in the sentence proceedings, there is no evidence of remorse.  His plea was given in response to an overwhelming Crown case.  The judge considered the appellant's prospects of rehabilitation as not ""particularly good"" in light of his criminal history.  Given his age on release and, assuming the support of his family, I would assess the appellant as having some, though guarded, prospects of rehabilitation.
37The Crown in this Court did not suggest the allowance of a 15 per cent discount for the plea, albeit that it came late, was inappropriate.
38I now move to the sentence imposed on Rutten by Norrish DCJ of 10 years with a non-parole period 6 years.  This sentence followed the allowance of significant discounts.   Essentially, Rutten's role was as a trusted warehouser and distributor.  Allowing a discount of 25 per cent for the guilty plea to a starting point of 26 years and 8 months yields a sentence of 20 years imprisonment.   The judge allowed a further 50 per cent discount for cooperation (of which 25 per cent was for future cooperation), resulting in the sentence of 10 years.  So far as subjective features are concerned, Rutten was somewhat younger than the appellant, unmarried and without children; he was a truck driver with some previous, though vague, involvement with drug selling but no criminal convictions.  He was remorseful and contrite.  
39The crucial differences between these offenders, though, are their differing roles and the cooperation with authorities.  As to the former, the appellant was involved much more in the overall operation, though not in the proposed distribution which was Rutten's responsibility.  It is, however, essential to focus on the character of the charge, which is concerned with the attempt to obtain possession of the MDMA in Australia.  In this respect, it seems to me there is some merit in the contention of Mr Rosser for the appellant that, if anything, the involvement of the appellant was somewhat less than Rutten's was to be.  If it were proved, say, that the appellant was to receive part of the proceeds of Rutten's sales, so that he would in that way be a participant in the distribution, that would be a very different matter.  It was not suggested that he had any role in directing Rutten how to go about his job.  There is no evidence as to any continuing role that the appellant expected to play once the MDMA had been located in Australia and passed to Rutten.  Of course, the latter matter is very different, with the added advantage that it is quantified.
Decision
40I would grant the extension of time for leave to appeal, grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, quash the sentence imposed in the District Court and substitute a sentence as follows.  Taking into account the sentence imposed on Rutten, I would commence with a term of 23 years and 6 months imprisonment and reduce it by 15 per cent, resulting in a (slightly rounded up) sentence of 19 years imprisonment commencing on 1 November 2003.  I would set a non-parole period of 13 years.
41HALL J:  I agree with Adams J.

1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with Adams J.
2HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Adams J.
3ADAMS J:  
Introduction
4On 8 November 2011 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to 16 offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception under s 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), one offence of failing to comply with reporting conditions brought under s 17(1) of the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (NSW) and two offences of possessing child pornography under s 91H(2) of the Crimes Act.   He was sentenced on 26 October 2012 in the District Court in respect of these offences together with 18 further offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception on a Form 1 and one offence of possessing five grams of cannabis on a second Form 1.  
5An offence under s 192E(1)(a) attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, the offence of failing to comply with reporting conditions attracts a maximum penalty of 500 penalty units or 5 years imprisonment and the offences of possessing child pornography a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.  Each of the offences can be dealt with summarily.  
6Involving a measure of accumulation, the total effective sentence imposed on the applicant was a non-parole period of 12 years, 7 months and 28 days commencing 21 October 2010 and expiring on 17 June 2023 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 17 June 2025.  The overall sentence is not the subject of complaint and we have therefore said nothing about it.
Grounds of appeal  
7The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence upon the following grounds -   
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in failing to take into account the assistance provided by the applicant in relation to the sexual abuse he had suffered as a child.
Ground 1A: A miscarriage of justice resulted from the failure to put expressly the contents of Exhibit 3 forward as being relevant to a discount to be afforded in accordance with s 23 of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
Ground 2:  When sentencing the offender in respect of the child pornography offences, his Honour erred in failing to take into account the applicant's earlier attempts to rehabilitate himself in custody.
Ground 3:  When sentencing the offender in respect of the child pornography offences, his Honour erred in finding, contrary to the evidence, that the applicant had attempted to enter the CUBIT program only during the period June 2009 to November 2009.
Ground 4: The sentences in respect of the counts 1 and 3 of obtaining by deception were manifestly excessive.
8The application for leave to appeal was filed out of time.  Leave to appeal was opposed, essentially on the basis that the delay is unexplained but, principally, on the ground that the appeal has no merit and therefore the application for an extension of time should be refused.  
The child pornography offences
9The facts were not in dispute and the following account is taken substantially from the agreed facts as summarised by the primary judge.  In September 2010 police investigating a number of fraud offences identified the applicant as the perpetrator and arrested him on 21 October 2010.  At the time of his arrest the applicant was living in a boarding house.  On 9 November 2010 a cleaner found a thumb drive hidden in a desk in the room which had been occupied by the applicant and gave it to police.  On examination, the drive was found to contain about 30,000 images of child pornography, the subject of the first offence of possessing child pornography and 126 videos, the subject of the second of these offences.  As is conventional, random examinations of a selected number of images were undertaken.  These comprised 700 images, described in schedules created by two of the investigating officers.  It was agreed by the parties that the schedules were admissible as evidence of the nature and content of the whole of the material and the proportion of a type of child abuse material randomly examined should be taken to be present in the same proportion of the material as a whole.  
10In respect of the images to which the first offence is directed, almost 25,000 contained images of children and 5,000 were computer produced pictures of children.  It was estimated that about 400 images of children, some of whom were three or four years of age, and 1000 of the pictures depicted sadistic behaviour or sexual behaviour involving children and an animal (within the Copine Scale 10 rating).  Further details are unnecessary.   Within the Copine Scale 9 rating were almost 2000 images and just over 3,000 pictures of children.  These depicted sexual assaults of various kinds, including penetrative sex, mostly involving very young children in the age range of four to eight years.  About 250 pictures depicted children being subjected to sexual assault (Copine Scale 8) and 400 depicted pictures of explicit sexual activity with children (Copine Scale 7).  About 12,500 images and 200 pictures of children were within the Copine Scale 6 rating involving explicit erotic posing, something over 5,000 images and 170 pictures fell within the Copine Scale 5 rating and almost 3,000 images within the Copine Scale 4 rating with 84 images within the Copine Scale 3 (this last being surreptitiously taken photographs of children in play areas or other safe environments showing their underwear or varying degrees of nakedness).  So far as the videos were concerned, 101 involved children and 25 computer produced pictures of children.  Three videos came within Copine Scale rating 10, 59 within Copine Scale 9, one within Copine Scale 8, 34 within Copine Scale 7, and the others distributed between Copine Scale 6, 5, 4 and 3.  
11The primary judge was satisfied that the applicant possessed this material for his own use and not for dissemination and there was no evidence that it might be viewed by vulnerable or susceptible persons.  On the other hand, his Honour rejected completely the applicant's evidence to the effect that he found the material when he searched the internet looking for a child's movie for his niece.  
12For possession of the videos the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months and, in respect of the images, 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years.
Breach of reporting conditions
13So far as the offence under s 17 of the Child Protection Offender Registration Act 2000 (NSW) is concerned, this arose from the applicant being placed on the New South Wales Child Protection Register when he completed sentences imposed in the District Court for four offences with sexual intercourse with a child under the age of 10 years.  His supervision was due to cease on 9 December 2016.  He breached the reporting conditions by using false identities and not declaring the details of motor vehicles or a number of mobile telephones used by him.  His Honour rightly held that these could not be regarded as merely technical breaches but, rather, they were deliberate attempts by the applicant to circumvent the main purpose of registration, namely supervision in the community of child sexual offenders.  This also was not his first offence of this kind.  He had been sentenced on 11 March 2005 in the Local Court to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months for failing to comply with the reporting conditions.  He was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 months.
Dishonesty offences
14The dishonesty offences were committed over a five month period between May and October 2010.  A number of them had somewhat unusual features, which makes it necessary to provide some detail of their commission.  
15Offence 1 was dishonestly obtaining an Audi motor vehicle.  The victim advertised his vehicle for sale on the internet and was contacted on 21 May 2010 by the applicant who arranged to meet that day.  He purchased the vehicle with a bank cheque drawn on a non-existent account.  Three days later, on 24 May, the victim received a text message from the applicant telling him where the vehicle was parked and that the keys were in his mailbox.  The vehicle was then recovered by the victim who found, inside the glove box, a $20 note and a letter which read, ""Sorry to have conned you but I needed the car on Saturday to make some money.  You and your family are lovely"".  The applicant used a false identity to commit this offence.  
16Offence 2 was committed on 22 May 2010 when the applicant, using another false identity purchased a diamond ring from the victim with a cheque, again drawn on a non-existent account.  The applicant drove the Audi he had dishonestly obtained on the previous day to the meeting, obviously to impress the victim as, in effect, he admitted in his letter to the car owner.  The ring was later recovered from a Cash Converter shop.  
17Offence 3 occurred on 12 June 2010, involving the purchase of a BMW vehicle by using a fraudulent cheque and a false name.  On the following day, the applicant contacted the victim by text message informing him of the location of the vehicle and the keys.  The victim recovered the vehicle that day, finding a letter which read, ""Sorry to do this to you you're good folk.  This was not to hurt you.  I go after the bigger players"".  The vehicle was used as evidence of his bona fides for the purpose of offence 6 when the applicant attended at the home of another victim and purchased a diamond ring for $6,500 using a fraudulent cheque and false identification.  The ring has not been recovered.  
18On 4 July 2010 the applicant purchased a further diamond ring worth $15,000 using a fraudulent account and a false identity, using another BMW which he had purchased on the same day using what can be called his usual modus operandi.  The vehicle was subsequently recovered on 8 July 2010, having travelled over 1,000 kilometres since the applicant had acquired it.  
19It is not necessary for present purposes to describe in further detail the remaining offences.  So far as the offences to which the applicant pleaded are concerned, nine involved the acquisition of vehicles and five involved acquisition of jewellery.  In respect of the Form 1 offences, six involved the acquisition of motor vehicles and 11 the obtaining of either jewellery or camera equipment.  The applicant used the vehicles he had obtained for the purpose of committing at least five of the property thefts.  Of the indicted charges relating to motor vehicles, three were found undamaged, one had been abandoned and was damaged, with its contents missing and seven were not recovered; of the motor vehicle charges on the Form 1, all were recovered.  The vehicles which had not been recovered were sold by the applicant.  Otherwise, the only item recovered was the ring involved in offence two.  The total value of property unrecovered is $310,000. 
20Overall, for the dishonesty offences, the applicant's non-parole period was 7 years with an effective additional term of 1 year.  This additional term is, for practical reasons, immaterial since the sentence for the failure to comply with reporting conditions commenced on the expiration of the effective non-parole period for the frauds and the child pornography sentences were wholly accumulated on the sentence for failing to comply with reporting conditions.
The sentence proceedings 
21Of some significance in relation to the pornography offences was that, on 8 February 2001, a charge of possessing child pornography had been brought against the applicant in the Local Court and dismissed under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and, on 27 May 2005, the applicant was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months in respect of three offences of possessing child pornography (the non-parole period being reduced slightly when he appealed to the District Court).  Again, on 9 December 2008 the applicant was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years for two offences of disseminating/producing child pornography (reduced on appeal to this Court to 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months).  
22It is not surprising that the judge found the child pornography offences were ""of a very high order of criminality"".  Psychiatric evidence was called from Dr Richard Furst in respect of these offences. I will refer to this evidence in due course.  
23His Honour dealt with the dishonesty offences in the following way - 
""I now turn to the 16 dishonestly obtain property by deception offences in respect of which I am to sentence the offender brought pursuant to s 192E(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) together with 18 further offences of dishonestly obtain property by deception contained in a Form 1. 
The agreed facts pertain to each of the ... offences are [sic] contained in Exhibit A.  The offender committed the offences over a five month period between May and October 2010 and fraudulently appropriated in excess of $320,250 from victims.   Each of the offences committed by the offender involved the offender providing false ANZ bank cheques to victims who were vendors of motor vehicles, jewellery or cameras.  The offender sold all the property dishonestly obtained by him with the exception of two motor vehicles in respect of which he facilitated the return to their owners.""
24In respect of these motor vehicle offences, the applicant was sentenced to 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years for ten of the offences, 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months for one and 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months in respect of another, 12 offences in all.  It is not altogether clear why two of these offences received different sentences to the others but, since no issue was taken as to the correctness of any individual sentence, it is not necessary to consider this issue.  At all events, as this Court has previously stated, the crucial question in this Court (absent any patent error in respect of a particular sentence) will be whether the totality of punishment appropriately reflects the criminality involved.  In respect of the other stolen items, the applicant was sentenced to 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years for two of them and 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 4 months for two of them.  The overall sentence for the fraud offences was 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years commencing on 21 October 2010, the date of the applicant's arrest.  The Form 1 offences were taken into account with the offence for which a four year sentence was imposed.   
25The individual sentences reflect a 25 per cent discount as the applicant had pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity.  
26The applicant gave evidence to the effect that he used the proceeds of the frauds to purchase drugs for the purpose of committing suicide.  His Honour rejected this evidence.  At all events it was of very little mitigatory value, given the calculated methods used to effect the frauds.
27The judge noted the applicant's ""long history"" of committing fraud offences, his criminal record showing that he was first convicted of a fraud offence in 1991 and since that time had been convicted of 79 further fraud offences, being sentenced to terms of imprisonment on three occasions for this crime, last term of imprisonment imposed on 11 March 2005.  The applicant was released from custody on 23 April 2010 and was therefore at liberty for six months until arrested in respect of the current matters on 21 October 2010.  
28The subjective features to which the primary judge referred were that the applicant's life as a young child was affected by his father's drinking and gambling, his parents separating when he was six years of age and his being sexually abused between the ages of 12 and 13 by a clergyman at his school.  His Honour considered that this reduced his moral culpability with regard to the child pornography offences.  
29As mentioned, tendered on the sentencing proceedings was a report of 12 May 2012 by Dr Furst.  This indicated that the applicant had recently been diagnosed as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder for which he was receiving treatment.  Dr Furst noted the applicant's extensive history of substance abuse, mainly involving cocaine and amphetamines.  His opinion was that, as well as suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and a substance abuse disorder, the applicant suffered from anti-social disorder, had poor coping skills, and was affected by the long term effects of childhood sexual abuse.  
30Documents were tendered on the sentence proceedings which dealt with the applicant's attempts to gain entry into the CUBIT program during the period from June to November 2009 which was, no doubt, the basis for the judge's reference to this period as one during which he had sought assistance.  So far as any earlier period is concerned, Dr Furst's report recorded a history from the applicant of having made numerous requests from February 2005 to be accepted in the CUBIT program and had asked for this at every classification meeting from 2008 onwards.  The applicant gave evidence of these attempts, which was not the subject of cross-examination (the significance of the 2005 date was that, on 11 March 2005 he was sentenced in the Local Court to a term of imprisonment of 2 years for possessing child pornography and was eligible for classification from 27 May 2005).  
31It had been submitted, in effect, that the applicant had done his best whilst in prison to obtain counselling, which might well have enabled him to avoid the commission of at least the pornography offences.  The primary judge dealt with this submission as follows -  
""Insofar as the offender's rehabilitation is concerned, I find that the offender must have been aware of his unnatural sexual interest in children from the time of his first convictions for the offences of sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten in 1998.  The offender from that time up until the present, with the exception of the period from June 2009 to November 2009 whilst he was in custody, has not sought any treatment or counselling for his unnatural sexual interest in children.  I do not accept the offender's evidence regarding his belief that counselling was not available in the general community.  The offender is an intelligent man.  I am of the view that he had means to pay for rehabilitation whilst in the community after his release from custody on the last occasion, but that he chose not to seek such counselling.  The offender's record and his lack of motivation to obtain counselling leads me to the belief that the offender is unlikely to seek counselling and rehabilitation on his release from custody and I cannot, therefore find, that the offender is unlikely to re-offend, as was submitted to me by his counsel.""
In this Court, Mr Lange of counsel for the applicant points out that the Crown had not suggested below that the applicant had not sought treatment from 2005 onwards and this position appears to have been accepted by his Honour during argument, though his Honour expressed scepticism as to the reasons given by the applicant for not seeking assistance when he was released from prison in April 2010.  
32The primary judge (generously) found that, although the applicant had not indicated remorse or contrition in respect of any of the offences, he should infer that there was a degree of contrition from the offender's pleas of guilty.  His Honour summarised (sufficiently for present purposes also) the applicant's ""lengthy criminal record"" as ""involving not only possession of child pornography, failure to report and fraud offences but also offences of violence, weapon offences, break enter and steal offences and drug offences"", observing that the applicant had spent over 15 years of his life in custody.  In light of the criminal history, the primary judge's conclusion that the offences for which he was being sentenced could not be classified as uncharacteristic aberrations was (with respect) entirely justified.  His Honour further observed that the applicant's commission of these offences ""manifested a continuing attitude of disobedience and, that being the case, retribution, deterrence and the protection of society are factors to be considered ... in determining the totality of the offender's criminality"".  No doubt because of this strong language, the primary judge stressed that the effective non-parole period which the applicant was to serve did not involve any element of preventative detention.  Special circumstances resulted from the accumulation of a number of the sentences but the effective non-parole period remained greater than 75 per cent of the overall head sentence, a matter to which the primary judge referred, in this respect stating that this period ""has been determined by me to properly reflect the criminality of the offender"". 
Grounds 1 and 1A:  failing to take account of assistance 
33Detective Senior Constable Turnbull stated that, on 16 February 2012 he obtained a signed statement from the applicant concerning sexual acts committed upon him by a person of interest, a teacher at a Catholic school during the late 1970s and 1980s.  The person of interest was residing overseas and the officer was in the process of commencing extradition proceedings against him.  The officer, in effect, accepted the truthfulness of the applicant's allegations, noting that they were consistent with sexual acts committed upon a large number of other victims forming part of the investigation, which was current at the time of the applicant's complaint.  
34The applicant had, it may be accepted, provided a credible account to police relating to an identifiable individual who was to be the subject of prosecution and had offered to assist in that process by way of providing a statement.  However, counsel for the applicant did not suggest to the primary judge that any discount based upon s 23(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was appropriate.  His Honour referred to the fact that the applicant had been sexually abused as a mitigating factor, which was as it seems the reason for which the evidence was tendered, but did not address the relevance of the assistance provided by the applicant in terms of its significance for the purpose of reducing the penalty otherwise appropriate by virtue of s 23(1).  
35Section 23(1) does not exclude offenders who were themselves the victims of earlier sexual abuse from obtaining a discount where they are prepared to assist authorities in the detection and investigation of such offences:  RJT v R (2012) 218 A Crim R 490.  It does not appear from the Senior Constable's statement that the applicant had agreed to give evidence against the perpetrator, although it is fair to observe that this appears to have been the officer's assumption.  The clear public policy behind s 23(1) is to encourage persons to assist authorities where otherwise they might not do so.  Sexual assault is an area in which many victims are, for a variety of reasons, somewhat reluctant to come forward, let alone to give evidence.  However, in every case it is necessary to assess the significance of the assistance, given that the discount serves a utilitarian purpose.  
36As with all cases where a discount under s 23(1) is sought, the alleged victim has or might have a great deal to gain from making allegations of wrongdoing, so that issues of credibility will loom large in any consideration of the value of the victim's evidence.  Here, the applicant's credibility, it must be said, is very limited indeed given his extensive history of dishonesty offences.  Also, the actual usefulness of his information in the investigation of the perpetrator's alleged offences is incapable of assessment.  Obviously, the disclosure was not timely (s 23(2)(b)) and it appears the perpetrator had already been identified by other victims.  Moreover, it is impossible to assess the truthfulness, comprehensiveness and reliability of the applicant's statement without it being available for examination.  The officer declined to make it available to the defence but, obviously, had a subpoena been issued, the statement must have been provided at least to the Court.  This was not done.  
37In the result, the possibility that some slight discount might have been allowed under s 23(1) had it been sought does not to my mind bespeak error by the primary judge in not dealing with the matter in this way when he was not asked to do so.  
Grounds 2 and 3:  the applicant's attempts at rehabilitation. 
38Whilst I would accept that the primary judge should have proceeded on the basis that the applicant had persistently attempted to obtain this assistance from 2005, and this error to some extent affected his Honour's reasoning, the crucial fact (as pointed out by the judge) was that he made no attempts in this regard following his release.  Moreover, he was not punished in any sense for failing to attempt to avail himself of the relevant prison programs.  Rather, the question was whether, in all the circumstances and given the applicant's history, his prospects for rehabilitation were favourable.  In my view, the primary judge's inability to conclude that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend was inevitable and would not have been materially affected by a finding that he had sought assistance during the earlier period.  It is possible that, had he obtained that assistance, the applicant would not have committed the subsequent offences but it does not follow, of course, that these were in any sense otherwise than made in the exercise by him of a deliberate intention with the knowledge that they were not only criminal but morally culpable to a high degree and for which he was fully responsible.  I do not accept that this error materially affected the applicant's sentences.
Ground 4:  the sentences in respect of counts 1 and 3 were manifestly excessive 
39As I have already pointed out, the applicant received the same sentence in respect of each of these offences, in effect involving the return of the vehicle, to that imposed for a number of the other offences involving motor vehicles which, however, were not recovered.   The Audi involved in offence 1 was returned four days after it was taken, together with a $20 note, whilst the BMW the subject of offence 3 was left in an identified car park with the keys in the fuel cap area, the victim being notified by text message of the vehicle's whereabouts.  The extent of the loss suffered by a victim of fraud will usually be, and in this case is, the most significant (though not the only) measure of objective seriousness for this offence, so the fact that the vehicles were, in effect, returned undamaged to the victims shortly after they were taken, significantly reduces their objective seriousness.  Factors pointing in the other direction were that the offences were pre-planned and involved the use of false bank cheques and false identification and also using the vehicles to carry out other frauds.  
40It is essential for each offence to be separately considered from the point of view of assigning an appropriate sentence for it: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.  With respect, it seems to me that the primary judge did not undertake this course.  The maximum term of imprisonment for each of these offences is 10 years.  The starting point for each offence was four years imprisonment.  This represents, to my mind, a far greater proportion of the maximum term than is justified by the objective circumstances of the offences, even accepting as I do that there are no mitigating circumstances that justify affording the applicant any leniency.  
41It was submitted by the Crown in this Court that, even if error has been established, the appeal should be dismissed under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) since no lesser sentence, it is contended, is warranted in law or should have been imposed.  This submission is based upon the argument that, since (even accepting the error) the overall sentence for all the offences for which the applicant was sentenced is justified by the criminality involved, no further adjustment should be made.  In my view Pearce requires the Court to consider the appropriate sentence for each offence.  That being so, the sentence which should have been imposed for each of the first and third offences is 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months.  However, the four months accumulation imposed by the primary judge before commencement of the sentence imposed for charge two is appropriate and should be retained, as are the four months accumulations of the sentence for offence three on that for offence two and for offence six on the sentence imposed for offence three (these are consecutive sentences despite the numbering).  The consequence is that the overall sentence would remain unchanged and, accordingly, the appeals as to these sentences should be dismissed.  
Conclusion
42I propose that time to appeal be extended, leave to appeal against sentence be granted, the sentences for charges one and three be quashed and in lieu thereof the following sentences be imposed - 
(1)as to charge one, a non-parole period of 9 months commencing on 20 October 2010 and expiring on 19 July 2011 with an additional term of 3 months commencing 20 July 2011 and expiring on 19 October 2011;
(2)as to charge three, a non-parole period commencing 20 June 2011 and expiring 19 March 2012 with an additional term of 3 months commencing 20 March 2012 and ending on 19 June 2012.  
(3)In all other respects the sentences remain unchanged.

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Adamson J.

2ADAMSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed by Blackmore DCJ on 21 June 2013 of twelve years with an eight year non-parole period commencing 26 February 2013, after the applicant's plea of guilty to five offences.

3The offences for which the applicant was sentenced are as follows:






Offence

Facts

Maximum penalty/ SNPP


Count 1 
(Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (DMTA)
s 25(2))

Supply a large commercial quantity (more than 4 kg) of prohibited drug (gamma-Butyrolactone)

11,389.1 g of gamma-Butyrolactone

Life/ SNPP of 15 years


Count 2
(DMTA,
s 25(2))

Supply a large commercial quantity (more than 0.5 kg) of prohibited drug (3,4-methylenen-dioxymethyl-amphetamine)

991.35 g of 3,4-methylene-dioxymethyl-amphetamine

Life/ SNPP of 15 years


Count 3 (DMTA, s 25(1))

Supply prohibited drugs 

30.52 g of methylamphetamine

Maximum penalty 15 years/ no SNPP


Count 4 (DMTA, s 25(1))

Supply prohibited drugs

9.29 g cocaine

Maximum penalty 15 years/ no SNPP


Count 5 (DMTA, s 25(1))

Supply prohibited drugs

181.84 g ketamine

Maximum penalty 15 years/ no SNPP

4There were further offences on a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW): goods in personal custody ($8,765 and $4,550); possess prohibited weapon (taser); possess prohibited drug (.94 g of 4-methoxymethylamphetamine); and possess prohibited drug (9.29 g cocaine). The last-mentioned charge was dismissed because it was a back-up charge to the offence of supply to which the applicant pleaded guilty. The applicant pleaded guilty to the matters on the s 166 certificate except the two goods in personal custody offences.

5There are two grounds of appeal: first, that the sentencing judge failed to state the commencement date with respect to each of the sentences imposed; and secondly, that the sentence was manifestly excessive.

The facts

6The narrative of facts set out below derives from the agreed facts, which were recounted in the remarks on sentence.

7In the course of investigation through a Strike Force police investigators identified the applicant to be the supplier of methylamphetamine (also known as ice). They ascertained that he lived in Brumby Street, Surry Hills.

8At about 9.25 pm on Thursday 12 July 2012 police saw a black Honda motor cycle enter the Campbell Street entrance of a car park in Castlereagh Street, Sydney. The rider, who was the applicant, was wearing a black helmet, white motorcycle jacket with black markings, dark coloured pants and black motorcycle boots. Police observed the rider travel to P1 of the car park and meet with a man. A few minutes later the rider left the car park. Police noticed that ""AGV"" was written in white on the back of the rider's black helmet. When police stopped the rider, he was found to be in possession of a clear resealable bag which contained a number of small resealable bags that contained a clear crystalline substance thought to be ice.

9At about 3 am on 13 July 2012 police, pursuant to a lawful search warrant, gained entry to the foyer of the unit complex where the applicant lived in Surry Hills. At this time, the applicant came out of the lift wearing the same motorcycle helmet and jacket in which he had been observed previously. Police searched the applicant and found: a brown paper bag inside a bum-bag which contained $8,765 in Australian currency in two separate bundles; a blue pencil case in the rear pocket of his motor cycle jacket that contained a resealable bag that contained two separate resealable bags of clear crystal substance, a glass vial with an attached eyedropper containing a clear liquid substance and a glass pipe. They also found three keys: a front door key to the applicant's apartment, a key to a toolbox and safe in his bedroom and a key to a motor vehicle. The applicant told police that he lived by himself.

10The applicant was taken into custody and remained at the Surry Hills Police Station while the police executed the search warrant on his unit. Police found syringes, plastic containers, scales and ""drug ledgers"". There were numerous resealable bags in the bathroom cabinet. In the kitchen there was a ""Cornwell's Vinegar"" bottle that contained a clear liquid which was confirmed on analysis to be 502 g of gamma-Butyrolactone. Two further such bottles were found, which contained a total of 990 g of the same drug. On the top shelf of the fridge, police found a Glad container with paste inside which was confirmed on analysis to be 4.12 g of methylamphetamine.

11The toolbox in the bedroom was opened with the key that had been taken from the applicant. It contained various drugs in various drugs in separate resealable bags. The drugs were methylamphetamine, cocaine, ketamine and 3,4-methylene-dioxymethyl-amphetamine. The locked safe in the applicant's bedroom contained $4,550 in Australian currency together with further quantities of drugs. Additional quantities of drugs were found in the bedroom.

12A search of the motor vehicle that the applicant leased revealed a Taser, an electronic stun device in the driver's side door compartment, on which DNA closely matching the applicant's was found.

13The applicant's mobile phone revealed information relating to the supply of prohibited drugs, including what appeared to be the cost price for each one. The total amounts of the prohibited drugs found in the applicant's apartment are the amounts set out in the table of offences above. 

The remarks on sentence

14After recounting the facts which are summarised above, his Honour recorded that the applicant did not assert (nor could he, having regard to the quantities involved) that the drugs found in his unit were for personal use. His Honour noted that the two offences of supplying a large commercial quantity were neither at the bottom of the range, nor in the middle of the range for objective seriousness. The sentencing judge found that the applicant was ""plainly a large scale drug dealer"".

15The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was an end-supplier, in that he supplied to individuals rather than on-selling to other drug dealers, who would in turn supply to users.

16His Honour noted the applicant's lack of criminal record and the early plea of guilty for which a discount of 25% was allowed. The sentencing judge summarised the subjective circumstances and noted that the applicant was thirty years old and had had a difficult upbringing as his mother suffered from manic depression. He was apprenticed as a baker and was adjudged the best apprentice in his year. His strong work drive led him to manage a large restaurant in Perisher Valley.

17The sentencing judge referred to the opinion of Dr Hampshire, psychiatrist, who formed the view that the applicant might also be suffering from a form of manic depression and that his desire to work long hours through manic periods when he had almost limitless energy was indicative of that condition. At times he would take drugs to help him stay awake but at other times he would abstain completely.

18The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was running a successful personal training business and was struggling with a decision regarding a personal relationship. He returned to drug-taking as a result. His Honour addressed the effect of the applicant's mental illness (manic depression) on the offending in the following terms:
""It is submitted that his personality, which is influenced by his condition, is such that he is predisposed to drug taking. That is a view that Dr Hampshire expressed. Again I note that that is not challenged by the Crown. Despite this, there is a vast difference between taking drugs and dealing in those drugs to the extent that you are involved in possessing large commercial quantities of those drugs. Undoubtedly, the drug taking can be seen as a lead-in to the offence but the offence itself is so serious that it is only available as an explanation for conduct. It does not excuse it. It is possible that his manic depression should moderate the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence. Persons who suffer that condition are known to take risks that others would avoid. They also have a predisposition to drug taking. In my view, the fact that he likely suffers this condition is a factor that does reduce the need for the sentence to reflect general deterrence to some extent.""

19His Honour found the applicant to have good prospects of rehabilitation and accepted his expression of contrition as genuine. His Honour addressed the seriousness of the offending in the following terms:
""Given the seriousness of the offending, had these matters gone to trial and the offender been convicted, then a very lengthy head sentence would have been applied. Even allowing for the finding that his mental condition would ameliorate the need for the sentence to reflect general detention [sic deterrence], given the maximum penalties that apply together with the standard non-parole period, a sentence of less than sixteen years would have been extremely unlikely.""

20The sentencing judge found special circumstances on the basis of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation and his mental condition which will need to be treated and monitored in the future.

21As the first ground of appeal turns on an alleged inconsistency between the remarks on sentence and the sentence imposed, I shall set out the relevant passages:
""I will fix an aggregate sentence in relation to the offences of supplying a large commercial quantity of gamma-Butyrolactone and 3,4-methylene-dioxymethylamphetamine. In each case there will be a penalty of nine years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years. In the case of supplying ketamine there will be a sentence of two years and six months imprisonment. In each of the other two offences of supply there will be a sentence of two years imprisonment. The sentences will be partially accumulated.
... 
Would you stand, sir. You are convicted of each of the two offences of supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs and the three offences of supplying drugs as indicated. I sentence you to a non-parole period of eight years imprisonment commencing on 26 February 2013. That is a date which takes into account your pre-sentence custody. The non-parole period will end on 25 February 2021. I recommend your release to parole at that time. There will be a further period of four years on parole.""

Relevant statutory provisions

22The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) relevantly provides:
44 Court to set non-parole period
(1) Unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, when sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).
. . .
(2A) Without affecting the requirement to set a non-parole period for a sentence, a court imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in respect of 2 or more offences on an offender may set one non-parole period for all the offences to which the sentence relates after setting the term of the sentence.
. . .
(2C) The court need not indicate the non-parole period that would have been imposed for each offence had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence unless it is required to do so by section 54B.

53 Multiple sentences of imprisonment
(1) When a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender in relation to more than one offence, the court must (unless imposing an aggregate sentence of imprisonment in accordance with section 53A) comply with the requirements of this Division by imposing a separate sentence in relation to each offence.
(2) The term, and any non-parole period, set under this Division in relation to a sentence of imprisonment is not revoked or varied by a later sentence of imprisonment that the same or some other court subsequently imposes in relation to another offence.

53A Aggregate sentences of imprisonment
(1) A court may, in sentencing an offender for more than one offence, impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to all or any 2 or more of those offences instead of imposing a separate sentence of imprisonment for each.
(2) A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a record of, the following: 
(a) the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed,
(b) the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.
(3) Subsection (2) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.
. . .

54B Consideration of standard non-parole period in sentencing
(1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence, or an aggregate sentence of imprisonment with respect to one or more offences, set out in the Table to this Division.
. . .
(4) When determining an aggregate sentence of imprisonment for one or more offences, the court is to indicate, for those offences to which a standard non-parole period applies, the non-parole period that it would have set for each such offence to which the aggregate sentence relates had it set a separate sentence of imprisonment for that offence.

23Item 19 of the Table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Act stipulates that there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years for offences of supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the DMTA in the present case.

24Rule 12 of the District Court Rules 1973, Part 53 relevantly provides:
Entry and recording of judgments, orders, sentences, directions or recommendations
Any judgment, order, sentence, direction or recommendation given or made by a Judge in any proceedings shall be entered on: 
(a) the indictment in the proceedings,
(b) the appropriate court file, or
(c) the appropriate computer record,
and that entry shall, when signed by the Judge or entered on the appropriate computer record, be the record of the judgment, order, sentence, direction or recommendation.

Grounds of appeal

Ground 1: alleged failure to state the commencement date with respect to each of the sentences imposed

25There are two methods which may be adopted by a sentencing judge when sentencing an offender for multiple offences. The first method is to impose a sentence for each offence: s 53 of the Act. When this occurs, it is necessary for the sentencing judge to specify the commencement of the term, the non-parole period and the first day on which the offender will be eligible for parole. The degree of concurrence and accumulation between individual sentences will be apparent from the commencement dates for each sentence imposed. The second method is for an aggregate sentence to be imposed under s 53A of the Act. In that event the sentencing judge imposes an aggregate sentence for all the offences. However, the judge is obliged, by reason of s 53A(2) to stipulate indicative sentences for each offence, although such stipulation is not necessary for the validity of the aggregate sentence: s 53A(5) of the Act. 

26Where a sentencing judge adopts the second method, and imposes an aggregate sentence, only the commencement date for the aggregate sentence and the non-parole period need be stipulated. The degree of concurrence and accumulation is implicit, since the indicative sentences are not actually imposed. They merely indicate the sentences the judge would have imposed had separate sentences been imposed for each offence. 

27It is also open to a sentencing judge to adopt both methods. This will be appropriate where some of the offences are in a similar category and it is adjudged that an aggregate sentence is suitable in respect of them and others warrant the imposition of individual sentences.

28In the present case it is, on a first reading of the remarks on sentence, not immediately clear which method the sentencing judge applied. The applicant contended that his Honour purported to impose an aggregate sentence for the first two counts of supplying large commercial quantities of prohibited drugs. The applicant relied on his Honour's use of the language of imposition of sentence, rather than the language of an indicative sentence when he said:
""In each case there will be a penalty of nine years imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years.""

29The applicant also contended that, when his Honour came to deal with the offences of supply, his Honour purported to impose a sentence of two years and six months for the offence of supplying ketamine and sentences of two years each in respect of the other two supply offences. His Honour then said:
""The sentences will be partially accumulated.""

30The reference to the sentences being ""partially accumulated"" begs the question as to when each sentence was due to commence and when it was due to expire so that the accumulation would be evident, as it is required to be when the first method (individual sentences for individual offences) is selected. The applicant contended that his Honour intended to sentence him by reference to s 53 for the supply offences and had failed to specify a commencement date for any of the offences. The applicant submitted that the sentences imposed were erroneous and ought be set aside.

31There is an important distinction between the sentence imposed and the remarks on sentence. There is a right of appeal to this Court, by leave, from a sentence: s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The remarks are the reasons for the order, in this case, a sentence, and are given at the time the sentence is imposed. The remarks do not constitute the orders of the Court or the sentence imposed. In the course of delivering remarks on sentence it is not unusual for judges to foreshadow what the sentence is going to be, although some choose to refrain from disclosing it until the sentence is actually imposed. The only sentence actually imposed is the one pronounced at the conclusion of the remarks on sentence. 

32Since sentences for individual offences must be indicated (but not imposed) where aggregate sentences are imposed, they are to be found in the remarks on sentence. Although the applicant contended that his Honour was effectively imposing separate sentences for separate offences, such a reading would fail to give weight to the fact that no commencement date for sentence terms was given, which of itself is a powerful indication that they were all intended to be indicative sentences. Of greater importance, no orders were made imposing those sentences at the conclusion of the remarks. Further, the stipulation of non-parole periods for the two offences of supplying a large commercial quantity was unnecessary for practical purposes since an aggregate sentence was imposed, but required as a matter of law by s 54B(4) of the Act, with which his Honour complied.

33In the present case the only sentence imposed was a sentence of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years that commenced on 26 February 2013. This appears from the record of what his Honour said and is confirmed in the following extract of the formal order of the Court that recorded as follows:
""Indication of sentences
*2x Supply large commercial quantity (Seq 4 & 12) - 9 years imprisonment (non-parole period 6 years)
*Supply ketamine (Seq 13) - 2 years 6 months imprisonment
*2x Supply (Seq 6 & 7) - 2 years imprisonment

Aggregate sentence
*Sentenced to a non-parole period of 8 years imprisonment to date from 26/2/13 with an additional parole period of 4 years to expire 25/2/25
*Eligible for release to parole 25/2/21
*Whilst on parole Offender is subject to supervision by NSW Probation & Parole Service, in particular with regard to supervised treatment of mental condition""

34The official record of the sentence imposed is no mere formality. The importance of the record lies behind the general rule as to finality of orders, applicable to civil and criminal orders, which was expressed by Barwick CJ in Bailey v Marinoff [1971] HCA 49; 125 CLR 529 at 530:
""Once an order disposing of a proceeding has been perfected by being drawn up as the record of a court, that proceeding apart from any specific and relevant statutory provision is at an end in that court and is in its substance, in my opinion, beyond recall by that court.""

35The importance of the court's record was reiterated in the criminal context in Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218, per Gummow A-CJ, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan and Kiefel JJ in the following passages:
[17] . . . The premise for the arguments of both the appellant and the respondent was that the formal recording of the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal was a significant step. Why is that so? . . .

[18] The formal recording of the orders of a superior court of record is often referred to as the ""perfecting"" of that order. Whether a court may reopen a proceeding and reconsider the order that has been pronounced is often described as hinging about whether the order has been ""perfected"". 
. . . 

[20] Identifying the formal recording of the order of a superior court of record as the point at which that court's power to reconsider the matter is at an end provides a readily ascertainable and easily applied criterion. But more than that, identifying the formal recording of the order as the watershed both marks the end of the litigation in that court, and provides conclusive certainty about what was the end result in that court.
[Emphasis added.]
(See also Achurch v The Queen [2014] HCA 10; 306 ALR 566 at [14]-[18])

36The relevant part of the record of the District Court set out above was entered on the appropriate court record (JusticeLink)and accordingly is the record of the sentence by reason of rule 12 of Part 53 of the District Court Rules 1973 (see also Erceg v The District Court of New South Wales [2003] NSWCA 379; 143 A Crim R 455 at [22], [23] per Sheller JA and [115]-[116] per McColl JA).

37The court record of the sentence imposed is consistent with the sentencing judge's obligations under s 53A and s 54B(4) of the Act. It fortifies the conclusion that the sentences referred to in the remarks, which were not actually imposed by the judge at the conclusion of the hearing, are indicative sentences, stipulated to comply with s 53A(2)(b) of the Act.

38This Court should be slow to infer that a sentencing judge has not approached the sentencing task in accordance with the applicable law, where the sentence imposed and the accompanying remarks are capable of being construed in such a way that shows that the judge applied the law correctly. This approach is neither to forgive or conceal error, but rather to give appropriate allowance to some occasional infelicity of expression that may arise in the course of ex tempore judgments. Shorthand expressions, which may appear erroneous to those unfamiliar with sentencing practices, may simply be efficient abbreviations adopted by judges who are required to sentence immediately following a hearing and give their remarks ex tempore.

39It was open to his Honour, consistently with the Act, to impose an aggregate sentence of twelve years with a non-parole period of eight years, having regard to the finding of special circumstances. In that event his Honour was required to specify indicative sentences for each of the five offences, in respect of which there was no need to specify the commencement or expiry date. In my view, that is not only what his Honour ought reasonably be taken to have done, but also what his Honour actually did. 

40Accordingly, the first ground has not been made out. 

Ground 2: manifest excess

41The starting point of the sentence was sixteen years, before the allowance of 25% was made for the plea of guilty. The discounted total term of twelve years would have given rise to a non-parole period of nine years, but for his Honour's finding of special circumstances, which permitted his Honour to adjust the statutory ratio provided for in s 44(2) of the Act. The adjusted ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of the term was 2:1.

42The standard non-parole period for the offences under s 25(2) of the DMTA is 15 years. His Honour found that the applicant was ""plainly a large scale drug dealer"".

43The applicant contended that his Honour had failed to take into account sufficiently the applicant's mental condition, his contrition or his prospects of rehabilitation and relied on the passage in the remarks which is set out above in which his Honour said that if the matter had gone to trial a sentence of less than sixteen years ""would have been extremely unlikely"". The applicant submitted that what his Honour in fact did was to adopt sixteen years as the starting point and apply the discount for the plea. The applicant contended that his Honour did not further ""discount"" the sentence to take into account the applicant's mental condition, his genuine contrition or his good prospects of rehabilitation, all of which were mitigating factors.

44It is inapposite to talk of a ""discount"" for contrition, rehabilitation or mental condition. The only true ""discounts"" are those for which specific statutory provision is made, such as the discount for a plea (s 22 of the Act) and the discount for assistance to authorities (s 23 of the Act). Good prospects of rehabilitation are to be taken into account as a mitigating circumstance (s 21A(3)(h) of the Act), as is contrition, or remorse (s 21A(3)(i) of the Act). A mental condition cannot be regarded as either mitigating or aggravating since it depends on the circumstances: it may, for example, diminish moral culpability and lessen the requirement for general deterrence but may increase the risk of future offending: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 per Gleeson CJ.

45The applicant's argument is based on the practice of adopting a mathematical approach to particular factors germane to sentencing which was disparaged in Wong v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at [76]-[78]. As the High Court said in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [39]:
""Following the decision of this Court in Wong it cannot now be doubted that sentencing courts may not add and subtract item by item from some apparently subliminally derived figure, passages of time in order to fix the time which an offender must serve in prison.""

46The second matter is that the reference by the sentencing judge to the circumstance that it would be extremely unlikely that, if the matter had gone to trial, a total sentence of less than sixteen years would have been imposed ought not, in my view, be elevated beyond its terms. I do not consider that it ought fairly be read as amounting to a statement that the applicant would have been sentenced to a term of sixteen years if he had gone to trial and been convicted. The applicant's submission that the 16 years should be discounted by 25% (for the plea) and then further ""discounted"" for contrition, prospects of rehabilitation and mental condition rests on the incorrect premise that the sentencing judge's remark ought be read in that way. In my view, that observation made by the sentencing judge ought be taken to be no more than the type of hypothetical setting of limits that can occur in the course of delivery of ex tempore remarks on sentence. 

47Manifest excess is a conclusion: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [6]. As can be seen from the table at the commencement of these reasons, the drug offences of supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs each carry a maximum life sentence and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The other supply offences carry a maximum term of 15 years. These legislative guideposts provide an indication of the seriousness with which Parliament views such offences: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [27]. The difficulties of detecting drug offences and the great social consequences that follow from their commission are relevant features of such offences: Wong v The Queen at [64] per Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ.

48His Honour's finding that the applicant was a ""large scale drug dealer"" was not challenged and was amply open on the evidence. Although the sentencing judge found that the applicant was manic depressive, his Honour found him to he ""capable of controlling its effects in the future"". Whilst the sentencing judge considered the need for general deterrence to be modified in the present case, the fact that the applicant was found to be able to control himself in the future indicates that a susbtantial sentence was called for. 

49I do not regard the second ground of manifest excess as having been made out.

Proposed orders

50Accordingly, I propose the following orders:

(1)Grant leave to appeal.

(2)Order that the appeal be dismissed.

51Bellew J: I agree with Adamson J.

2704624,R v Reeves [2014] NSWCCA 154,"Judgment

1THE COURT: On 21 February 2013 this Court dismissed an appeal by Graeme Reeves (the respondent) against his conviction in the District Court for three offences and allowed a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of the sentences that had been imposed; Reeves v R; R v Reeves [2013] NSWCCA 34. (An appeal against conviction for a fourth offence was allowed but that is presently irrelevant.)

2On 18 December 2013 the High Court of Australia upheld the respondent's appeal concerning the resentencing by this Court on the basis that it had not given consideration to the possible exercise of the residual discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal notwithstanding the inadequacy of a sentence: Reeves v The Queen [2013] HCA 57; 88 ALJR 215.

3The High Court remitted the proceedings to this Court for further consideration of the Crown appeal against sentence ""in accordance with the reasons of the Court"": Reeves v The Queen, supra, at [62].

Sentencing History 

4The history of the proceedings, particularly those relating to the sentencing of the respondent, may be found in the first judgment of this Court. So too are the relevant objective facts and subjective factors as they existed at the time of that judgment. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that the original sentences imposed in the District Court on 1 July 2011 were as follows:

(1) In respect of the offence of dishonestly obtaining a benefit by deception (s 178BA Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)), a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing 1 June 2011 and expiring on 31 May 2012. 

(2) In respect of the offences of aggravated indecent assault (s 61M(1) Crimes Act), fixed terms of imprisonment for 1 year 6 months commencing 1 December 2011 and expiring on 31 May 2013, both concurrent to each other. 

(3) In respect of the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent (s 33(1) Crimes Act), a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year commencing 1 June 2012 and expiring on 31 May 2013 with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months expiring on 30 November 2014.

5The sentences imposed by the District Court resulted in an effective term of imprisonment of 3 years 6 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 1 June 2011 and expiring on 31 May 2013, with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months expiring on 30 November 2014. 

6In respect of the Crown appeal against sentence, the Court allowed the appeal and re-sentenced the respondent as follows:

(1) In respect of the s 178BA offence, a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months commencing on 1 June 2011 and expiring on 31 August 2012 with a parole period of 6 months expiring on 28 February 2013.

(2) In respect of the s 61M(1) offence, a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 2 months commencing on 1 June 2012 and expiring on 31 July 2013 and a parole period of 4 months expiring on 30 November 2013.

(3) In respect of the s 33(1) offence, a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 1 December 2012 and expiring on 30 November 2014 with a parole period of 2 years expiring on 30 November 2016.

7As a result of the sentences imposed by this Court, the first date upon which the respondent would have become eligible for release on parole was 30 November 2014. Accordingly, the respondent's effective non-parole period was increased by 1 year 6 months.

Respondent's Release on Parole

8In consequence of the High Court setting aside the orders of this Court, the original sentences imposed by the District Court were revived. The respondent (who was originally eligible for release to parole on 31 May 2013) was released on parole on 20 December 2013.

9As at the date of his release, the respondent had served approximately 2 years 7 months (including the entire combined 2 year non-parole period imposed by the District Court) in full-time custody.

10Since his release on parole, the respondent has been residing at a Community Offender Support Program (""COSP"") centre and subject to a number of conditions and requirements, including:

(1)a curfew between 6.00am and 6.00pm;

(2)random drug and alcohol testing;

(3)participating in COSP programs and meetings as instructed;

(4)random room and personal belonging searches;

(5)undertaking community work and chores;

(6)compliance with directions of staff;

(7)provision of phone numbers to staff, with records kept of contacts;

(8)giving at least 24 hours' notice of plans to be absent from the COSP centre;

(9)a need to obtain approval to leave the COSP centre;

(10)personal searches upon return to the COSP centre;

(11)provision of receipts in respect of all purchases;

(12)meeting with one of his two case managers each fortnight to discuss and review his budget (which can result in sanctions); 

(13)an inability to socialise with residents residing in certain parts of the COSP centre; and

(14)an inability to keep his own medication.

The Residual Discretion 

11Section 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) provides:

""The Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party and the Court of Criminal Appeal may in its discretion vary the sentence and impose such sentence as to the said court may seem proper."" (emphasis added)

12Accordingly, where error has been identified in a Crown appeal, the Court is not obliged to re-sentence a respondent. There remains a discretion to refuse or decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [2]; R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7. That discretion has become known as the ""residual discretion"".

13In exercising the residual discretion, it is for the appellate court to answer two questions:

(1) Whether, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the sentence, the Court should decline, in the exercise of its ""residual discretion"" under s 5D, to allow the appeal and thereby interfere with the sentence appealed from. 

(2) To what extent, if the appeal is allowed, the sentence appealed from should be varied: Green v R; Quinn v R at [35].

14In Green v R; Quinn v R it was noted by the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ), quoting Griffiths v The Queen [1997] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 at 310 [53] (Barwick CJ), that the primary purpose of Crown appeals against sentence is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"": at [1]. This was similarly expressed in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1 at [70]:

""... the purpose of a Crown appeal is not simply to increase an erroneous sentence imposed upon a particular individual. It has a wider purpose, being to achieve consistency in sentencing and the establishment of sentencing principles. That purpose can be achieved to a very significant extent by a statement of this Court that the sentences imposed upon the respondent were wrong and why they were wrong.""

15This purpose is a ""limiting purpose"" that does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. Rather, it provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion: Green v R; Quinn v R at [36].

16Accordingly, it has been held that it may be appropriate for the appellate court, in the exercise of its discretion, to dismiss a Crown appeal where ""circumstances may combine to produce the result that if the appeal is allowed the guidance provided to sentencing judges will be limited and the decision will occasion injustice"": Green v R; Quinn v R at [2]. 

17Additional factors that may favour the exercise of the residual discretion include:


Delay by the Crown in lodging the appeal: R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; 136 A Crim R 451; R v JW, supra.
The deteriorating health of the respondent since sentence: R v Yang [2002] NSWCCA 464; 135 A Crim R 237 at [46]; R v Hansel [2004] NSWCCA 436 at [44].
The fact that the non-parole period imposed at first instance has already expired (R v Hernando), or the fact that the respondent's release on parole is imminent (Green v R; Quinn v R).
The fact that the respondent has made substantial progress towards rehabilitation: R v Tortell [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [63].
The ""effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation"": Green v R; Quinn v R at [43].

18These circumstances are by no means exhaustive: Director of Public Prosecutions v Karazisis [2010] VSCA 350; 31 VR 634 at [100].

19In determining whether or not to exercise the residual discretion, it is open for the appellate court to look at material available at the time of the hearing of the appeal: R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; 176 A Crim R 1 at [28]; R v Todorovic [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [32]. Accordingly, the appellate court is not required to put itself back in the position of the sentencing judge at the moment of conviction:

""If a Crown appeal against sentence is successful, and the appellant court resentences the respondent, it does so in light of all the facts and circumstances as at the time of resentencing. Events which have occurred after the original sentencing may be relevant."" (R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562).

Submissions for the Respondent

20In written submissions on the further hearing of the appeal before this Court the respondent submitted the material facts supporting the exercise of the residual discretion were:

(a) The failure of the appellant on the first appeal to address in any meaningful way, factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion (cf. Crown submissions on the appeal para [117]).

(b) The failure of the appellant to prosecute this appeal on remitter in a timely manner, having regard to the late gathering of evidence and the late service of the submissions (received 10 days shy of the hearing of the appeal).

(c) The errors of this Court as conceded by the [appellant] in the High Court in failing to have regard to the residual discretion and failing to have regard to relevant evidence before the Court relating to the residual discretion, and the re-sentencing discretion.

(d) Incarceration in full time imprisonment for a period of approximately 7 months as a result of such errors.

(e) The respondent's relatively imminent release from custody at the time of the imposition of the second sentences by this Court without having regard to the residual discretion.

(f) The concession of the prosecutor only subsequent to the referral of the application for special leave to appeal to an enlarged bench of the High Court.

(g) The respondent's release from custody to parole without continuity and oversight of medical care ensured, despite knowledge of his serious medical condition by the authorities.

(h) The declining health situation of the respondent in evidence before this Court previously, which this Court did not refer to.

(i) The fact that the original and redetermined sentences for the s 61M and s 178BA counts had expired prior to the appeal concerning sentence being upheld by the High Court.

(j) The fact that on the s 33 count, as at the time the High Court determined his appeal the respondent had served the entire custodial component of the original sentence and slightly more than half of that imposed by this Court.

(k) The exacerbation of the respondent's mental health state as a result of the process.

(l) The anxiety, distress and uncertainty the respondent has suffered and continues to suffer, particularly the imminence of his release on the last occasion, the re-establishment of himself in the community and the prospect of a return to custody in his particular circumstances.

(m) The service of parole in circumstances that are akin to 'quasi-custody' since the respondent's release to parole.

(n) The extra-curial punishment that has been visited on the respondent.

(o) The unusual and unique nature of the offences and the denunciation of the conduct by both the sentencing judge, this Court and High Court, coupled with publicity attending the matter, is such that the purpose of general deterrence has been served.

(p) The deregistration of the respondent is such that the purpose of specific deterrence has been served, as has protection of the community.

(q) The extent of the inadequacy of the original sentence, having regard to the health of the respondent, the conditions he experienced in full time custody and other mitigating features is diminished.

21It was also submitted that the period in which the respondent has been held in custody is sufficient to fulfil all the purposes of sentence: s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

22On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that there was considerable significance in the above factors in the context of the limiting purpose of Crown appeals. 

Submissions for the Crown

23The Crown in its written submissions observed that for this Court to now determine the Crown appeal in conformity with the High Court's reasons, it would have regard, amongst other matters, to the evidence:

""a. that the Respondent was released to parole on 20 December 2013 and has remained on parole thereafter;

b. concerning the current state of the physical and mental health of the Respondent; and,

c. concerning the nature and extent of health care services and facilities that would be made available to the Respondent in the event that he is returned to custody."" (at [15])

24The Crown acknowledged that the fact that the respondent has been on parole for a number of months and that he would have to be returned to custody to serve the balance of any new non-parole period that might be imposed in the event of the success of the Crown appeal, are both circumstances that this Court may consider when determining whether the residual discretion to dismiss the Crown appeal should be exercised: at [17].

25However, the Crown submitted that the Court would be satisfied that the residual discretion should not be exercised by reason of either or both those considerations: at [18].

26The Crown addressed in detail certain aspects of the medical evidence, including in particular the evidence of Dr Luxton, the respondent's treating specialist in renal medicine, which included five questions that had been posed for his consideration and which are reproduced later in this judgment.

27The Crown noted that Dr Luxton had stated that both modes of dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were available to persons in custody.

28In addition the Crown referred to the report of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, details of which are discussed below. It was observed in the Crown's submissions that Dr Nielssen noted a well-documented history of chronic depressive illness suffered by the respondent. Dr Nielssen also noted that the respondent had reported concerns about access to an adequate standard of medical treatment if he was to be returned to custody, as well as asserted inadequacies in the availability of specialist review while in custody.

29The Crown's submission was that the Court would be satisfied that suitable treatment for renal dialysis, depression and any other medical needs would be met in the event that the respondent were to return to custody: at [42].

30The Crown further submitted that having regard to all of the relevant considerations, the Court would remain satisfied that the sentences imposed by the District Court were manifestly inadequate.

31Taking into account all the medical and other evidence, the Crown submitted that the Court would be satisfied that ""suitable arrangements"" were previously in place and would be made available in the future to provide for the appropriate treatment and management of the various medical needs of the respondent whilst in custody. This, it was said, would include the provision of suitable treatment for his kidney disease by the provision of renal dialysis as well as treatment for his depressive disorder: at [44].

32The Crown's further submission was that the Court would be satisfied that those arrangements were such that neither the medical needs of the respondent nor the provision of the requisite treatment in a custodial setting would result in the sentence being more burdensome upon the respondent: at [45].

33In relation to the sentences previously imposed, it was submitted that the Court would also be satisfied that the individual and total sentences originally imposed by this Court would remain appropriate having due regard to all relevant considerations, including the evidence concerning the health issues of the respondent.

34In its concluding submissions the Crown submitted that this Court should make orders upholding the Crown appeal and impose new sentences which made provision for individual and a total term and non-parole periods of equivalent duration to those that were originally imposed by this Court.

Delay

35The respondent was first arrested and charged for the s 33(1) offence on 10 September 2008. He was charged for the other offences on 15 December 2009. He was initially sentenced on 1 July 2011 and the Crown appeal was filed on 18 July 2011.

36The appeal was heard by this Court on 13 August 2012. Judgment was delivered on 21 February 2013.

37The respondent submitted that this delay occurred through no fault on his part, but it must be accepted that the lodgement of his appeals against conviction on 29 February 2012 and 2 April 2012 contributed to it. In any event, it was submitted (and we accept) that regardless of fault, the overall delay (being now over five and a half years since the initial charges) ""is such that the respondent now faces the prospect of a return to custody, having already served a significant portion of his sentence"": at [67].

38In Green v R; Quinn v R, supra, Bell J observed at [131]:

""The delay in the appellate process was not due to neglect by the Crown. The appellants applied for, and the Crown opposed, the adjournment of the appeals. Nonetheless, the appellants' progress to reform and the closeness to the date of their eligibility for parole were matters that the Court of Criminal Appeal was entitled to take into account as reasons for dismissing the appeals in the exercise of the residual discretion. However, the exercise of that discretion was a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal...""

The effect of re-sentencing on the respondent's rehabilitation 

39In his affidavit affirmed on 17 July 2012, the respondent noted the following:


He was hoping to work on his Masters degree while in custody, but that this was not possible due to the restricted access to computers. 
He hoped to complete his Masters degree upon release, and in the meantime, he continued to assist teaching adult literacy.
In custody he worked as a garbage man, six days per week.
He then obtained fulltime employment in the bakery.

40The respondent has since completed his Masters degree in Medicine and Human Genetics.

41In the written submissions for the respondent it was argued that he has worked towards re-integrating himself into the community, including by participating in programs and being employed whilst in custody, and with his family. He has also made arrangements for his ongoing medical treatment and arrangements for surgery: at [68].

42It was additionally submitted for the respondent that the present parole conditions amounted to ""quasi custody"". The respondent has been subject to these conditions since his release in December 2013. These conditions are outlined at [10] above.

43The respondent observed that in Renshaw v R [2012] NSWCCA 91, Hoeben JA held that although the sentencing judge had taken into account the positive effect of rehabilitation while in a rehabilitation centre, it was an error for him not to take into account time actually spent in that centre. The sentence was restructured by backdating the sentence to take that time into account at a ratio of approximately 50%. 

44In R v Anderson [2012] NSWCCA 175 it was observed that ""in appropriate circumstances an allowance can be made for periods on bail and the harshness of, or restrictions on liberty by, conditions on bail"": at [2]. This allowance gives rise to a discretionary range of credit to be given for between 50% and 75% of actual time spent in rehabilitation: Brown v R [2013] NSWCCA 44.

45This is a matter in the present appeal to which appropriate weight should be given.

Evidence previously before the Court concerning the respondent's health

46The relevance of a respondent's deteriorating health was considered a factor relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion in Director of Public Prosecutions v Karazisis, supra:

""The Court will be reluctant to disturb that situation...where there has been a significant deterioration in the respondent's health, or mental well-being, in the period between his/her having been sentenced and the hearing of the appeal."" (at [108])

47The evidence previously before this Court included the affidavits of Ms Janet Witmer, solicitor for the respondent, and Mrs Sharon Reeves, the respondent's wife. Annexed to Ms Witmer's affidavit were letters from Dr Baguley, Medical Officer at Junee Correctional Centre dated 8 June 2012, and Dr Badami, Staff Specialist dated 23 March 2012.

48Dr Baguley wrote that the respondent:

""...has renal failure and he is going to need renal dialysis very soon. He will need to be seen very regularly at Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick in preparation for this, and then ongoingly for dialysis at least twice weekly. To this end he needs to be placed in a metropolitan gaol for such access and treatment to occur. Without this treatment he will die. It cannot occur in the country"". 

49The respondent's affidavit affirmed 17 July 2012 indicated that he had been at Long Bay since June 2012. However, according to his evidence he had, as at the date of his affidavit, not received treatment from the renal clinic at Prince of Wales Hospital, as had been recommended.

50Dr Badami recorded that the respondent may need dialysis in the future and that he has other ""vascular risk factors such as hypertension and Hypercholesterolaemia"". As a result, ""his prognosis will depend on his stability"".

51On 1 August 2012, the Nursing Unit Manager at Long Bay indicated in a letter that diabetic diets were unavailable at Long Bay, but that she would ask for the respondent to be reviewed to receive a ""renal diet"" (Annexure ""D"" to Affidavit of Ms Gabrielle Drennan sworn 9 August 2012). The respondent submitted that it may be inferred from that at least as at 1 August 2012, the respondent was not on an appropriate diet while in custody, despite his multiple medical conditions: at [50].

52On 3 August 2012, Dr Ette, Associate Clinical Director Primary & Women's Health with Justice Health, wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In that letter, Dr Ette noted that the respondent ""has Micro and Macro vascular disease, Chronic Kidney Disease, Type 2 Diabetes, Hypertension, Hypercholesterolaemia, Benign prostatic Hypertrophy and Depression"".

Up-to-date evidence concerning the respondent's health

53Ms Drennan's affidavit sworn 20 May 2014 annexed a letter from Justice Health regarding suitable treatment options available for the respondent, should he return to custody.

54Ms Witmer's affidavit of 8 April 2014 annexed a report of Dr Grant Luxton, specialist in renal medicine, dated 27 February 2014. Dr Luxton observed that the respondent's current diagnosis is end-stage kidney disease (CKD stage V) due to diabetic nephropathy. Although the respondent was due to start dialysis in the first months of 2014, as a result of his progressive deterioration and severe symptoms of kidney failure, Dr Luxton directed that he commence haemodialysis on 6 February 2014. Dr Luxton noted that ""although he has improved from the time of his admission he is still not very well with lethargy, fatigue and depressed mood"".

55The respondent currently undergoes haemodialysis three days a week. He has also been prescribed a number of medications for high blood pressure, gout, elevated cholesterol, depression, anaemia and calcium balance as well as insulin injections for his diabetes. Dr Luxton considered that his prognosis ""is guarded"". Although his symptoms should slowly improve, it is likely that symptoms of fatigue and reduced exercise capacity will persist. Dr Luxton noted that the life expectancy of patients on dialysis is ""significantly reduced, more so in people with diabetes due to a high incidence of heart disease, stroke and infection"". Dr Luxton further advised that the respondent would require surgery in April/May 2014.

56Dr Luxton was asked to address a number of questions and provided answers in his report as follows:

""1. Would custody have had an impact on his condition and the timing and nature of his treatment?

Yes - there was some delay in him being referred to the renal clinic and earlier referral could have allowed us to initiate treatment that may have delayed progression of his kidney disease. There were also problems in arranging timely follow-up and in the transmission and activation of recommended changes in treatment. There were problems in him receiving adequate treatment of his blood pressure and receiving an appropriate diet.

2. At what percentage is dialysis usually commenced?

Dialysis is usually initiated when the patient has significant symptoms which is usually around 10% or less of kidney function. He did not need to start dialysis when in custody however he was discharged into the community without follow-up plans and this may have contributed to his emergency presentation and urgent initiation of dialysis.

3. What percentage of kidney function did [he] have when he went on dialysis?

This was 3% - dangerously low. It was 7% when last checked in November 2013.

4. Differences in treatment in custody and not in custody?

Both modalities of dialysis (haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) are available in custody. There is a haemodialysis unit at Long Bay. The dialysis provision is the same as outside in terms of machinery and nursing staff. However access to renal trained medical staff is not available and there have been difficulty in dialysis patients accessing appropriate diets and provision of medications at the correct times. Changes in treatment tend to be slower due to the need to communicate with the renal unit at [Prince of Wales].

5. Is surgery required for home dialysis?

Yes - he will need abdominal surgery for placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter. This has been deferred till he is more stable - probably in the next two months.""

57Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, interviewed the respondent on 17 March 2014. He had previously provided reports dated 14 June 2011 and 31 July 2012. Dr Nielssen noted the respondent's history of becoming more depressed since being transferred to the COSP centre, despite being able to go out during the day and attend to his own health care. The respondent also expressed ""what seemed to be realistic concerns"" about access to an adequate standard of treatment if he were to return to full time custody. Further, that his preferred method of dialysis was peritoneal dialysis, but that he was not eligible for that method while living at the COSP centre, as it required having an en suite bathroom that was not shared with another person.

58On examination, Dr Nielssen observed that there were no signs of neurological disorder and his cognitive function seemed to be unimpaired, but that his underlying mood was assessed to be anxious and depressed from his demeanour and the quality of his responses.

59Dr Nielssen's opinion was that the respondent was experiencing a relapse of chronic depressive illness. Factors contributing to this recurrence ""include his disappointment at the lack of support from his family after his release, the progression of his kidney disease, the current circumstances of his detention and his anxiety about his future"". 

60Dr Nielssen noted that the respondent had continued to take the antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft) at the minimum dose of 50mg per day, prescribed by his general practitioner at Little Bay. The respondent told Dr Nielssen that he had considered asking to have the dose increased as he was aware of the return of symptoms of depression in the form of increased anxiety, lack of sleep, low energy and pessimism about the future.

61Since the hearing of the first appeal, the respondent's wife visited him every three or four weeks whilst he was at a metropolitan gaol. During these visits she ""noticed his worsening bad health"", including being more depressed and anxious: affidavit of Sharon Reeves affirmed 17 April 2014.

62In his affidavit affirmed on 2 April 2014 the respondent stated that he was anxious about returning to custody as he was concerned about his medical condition and frustrated by difficulties he experienced in getting timely attention whilst he was in custody.

63The respondent submitted that the ""combined impact"" of the medical evidence available on the remittal hearing:

""...is that gaol has had a crushing impact on the respondent, his mental and physical health have declined to a substantial extent during the period of his sentence and particularly since the hearing of the CCA appeal."" (at [53])

64In R v Hansel [2004] NSWCCA 436, Sully J (with whom Hidden and Howie JJ agreed) observed in respect of a man suffering from lymphoma, for which he had received chemotherapy, and other medical conditions, ""no appellate Court could lightly send now into full-time custody a person with those health conditions and problems"": at [44]. The Court proceeded to apply the residual discretion, observing that the prospect of an inadequate sentence ""cannot be allowed to overwhelm what justice requires in the particular case"": at [45]. Similarly, in R v DKL [2013] NSWCCA 233 this Court exercised the residual discretion on the basis of deterioration to the respondent's mental and physical health since the commencement of his incarceration, notwithstanding the manifest inadequacy of the sentence imposed.

Time in quasi-custody

65The conditions under which the respondent has lived following release on 20 December 2013 may be properly characterised as quasi-custody. In particular, he has been required to abide by a curfew between 6.00am and 6.00pm and has submitted to stringent conditions of residence. We accept that the conditions are similar to those that operate in certain rehabilitation programs and warrants a reduction in any sentence that might be imposed.

Conclusion

66For reasons outlined in this Court's previous judgment, the sentences imposed by the District Court were manifestly inadequate. However, it is for this Court to now consider, notwithstanding that finding, whether the Crown appeal should nonetheless be dismissed in the exercise of the residual discretion: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 at [24].

67As noted in Green v R; Quinn v R, supra, ""the guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual"": at [43].

68In determining the requirements of justice in the present Crown appeal, proper attention is required to be given to the evidence, in particular, the specialist medical evidence concerning the respondent's physical and mental health conditions, and the capacity for health care facilities and services available in full-time custody to satisfactorily treat such conditions.

69As to the respondent's physical condition, there is no dispute. He has chronic kidney disease and there has been a significant deterioration whilst in custody and since.

70When first seen in 2012, his advanced kidney function measured only 15% of normal. At that level most people are prepared for dialysis. When he went onto dialysis he had 3% of kidney function - a dangerously low level. The only specialist medical opinion - that of Dr Luxton - establishes:

(1) The respondent's period in custody impacted on his renal condition - delays in treatment occurred whereas earlier referral may have delayed his kidney disease: Dr Luxton's report, answer 1 at p 2. Delays also occurred in custody in actuation of recommended changes in treatment.

(2) Whilst there is a haemodialysis unit at Long Bay gaol, ""access to renal trained medical staff is not available and there have been difficulty [sic] in dialysis patients accessing appropriate diets and provision of medications at the correct times"". 

(3) Without criticism of the treatment services available at Long Bay, those services are not adequate to ensure optimal treatment of the respondent's end-stage kidney disease.

71We have concluded that there is an insufficient basis for the Court to decline to re-sentence the respondent in the exercise of the residual discretion but the material now available is of such moment that the extent of intervention should be moderated. The combined effect of the added delay in the final disposition of the matter, the evidence of what has transpired in relation to the respondent's ill-health (both physical and mental) and the conditions under which he has been held in a form of quasi-custody since being released on parole, call for an amelioration of the Court's response.

72On the disposition of the first appeal we imposed sentences in respect of the offences of dishonestly obtaining a benefit by deception and aggravated indecent assault which have already expired. We propose to maintain those sentences. However, in respect of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, we propose to impose a sentence of 3 years in lieu of the initially imposed sentence of 4 years (and the sentence imposed in the District Court of 2 years 6 months).

73The finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that was made on the first appeal should be maintained and for the same reasons.

74The total effective sentence will be one of 5 years with a non-parole component of 3 years. This is in contrast to the District Court sentence of 3 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 2 years and the sentence imposed by this Court on the first appeal of 5 years 6 months with a non-parole component of 3 years 6 months.

Orders

(1) Crown appeal against sentence allowed. 

(2) Sentences imposed by the District Court on 1 July 2011 are set aside. 

(3) The respondent is re-sentenced as follows:

(i) In respect of the offence of dishonestly obtain benefit by deception contrary to s 178BA of the Crimes Act, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months commencing on 1 June 2011 and to expire on 31 August 2012 with a parole period of 6 months to expire on 28 February 2013. 

(ii) In respect of the offence of aggravated indecent assault of CA contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year 2 months commencing on 1 June 2012 and to expire on 31 July 2013 with a parole period of 4 months to expire on 30 November 2013.

(iii) In respect of the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 1 year commencing on 1 June 2013 and expiring on 31 May 2014 with a parole period of 2 years to expire on 31 May 2016.

(4) The Court notes that the non-parole period in respect of the sentence in (iii) above expired on 31 May 2014. Accordingly, the respondent is to remain on parole.

2704646,Wilson v R; Barrie v R [2014] NSWCCA 150,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  I agree with Hulme AJ.
2BUTTON J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Hulme AJ, and with his Honour's reasons.
3HULME AJ:  This is yet another case where this Court is asked to reduce sentences on the ground of disparity with a sentence, manifestly and obviously inadequate, imposed on a co-offender and this in circumstances where the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was insufficiently organised to even tell the judge who imposed the lower sentence of the sentences previously imposed on the Applicants.  
4Phillip Wilson and Scott Barrie seek leave to appeal against sentences imposed on them by Charteris DCJ on 11 October 2012.  The sole ground of appeal advanced on behalf of Mr Wilson is that he has a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity between his sentence and one imposed on a co-offender Anthony Crisp.  Mr Barrie relies on an identical ground.  His grounds of appeal are:-
(1) The learned judge erred in failing to give appropriate weight to the subjective features of the applicant.
(2) The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the totality principle in his accumulation of sentences.
(3) The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the time served on bail for the applicant, given the restrictive nature of those conditions.
(4) The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentences imposed upon him and his co-offender Crisp.
5Messrs Barrie and Crisp were sentenced in respect of a number of charges.  However the only one that founds any complaint of disparity is, as expressed in the case of Mr Wilson, that on 14 September 2010, being armed with dangerous weapons namely a replica pistol and a replica firearm and being in company with Scott Barrie, Anthony Crisp and others, he did rob Desmond Clarken of money the property of Vertigo Pty Ltd, trading as the Petersham Inn Hotel.  The offence was one arising under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and rendered each offender liable to 25 years imprisonment.  (In the case of Messrs Barrie and Crisp the expression of the charge varied somewhat but is of no consequence for present purposes.)
6The sentences imposed by Charteris DCJ in the case of Mr Wilson and Mr Barrie and by North DCJ in the case of Mr Crisp were:-
Mr Wilson 8 years and 3 months, including a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months.
Mr Barrie 9 years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months.
Mr Crisp 5 years including a non-parole period of 3 years. 
7However to look solely at that table is to oversimplify matters.  Each offender had taken into account when being sentenced for the Petersham Inn offence a further offence or offences on a Form 1.  These were:-
In Mr Wilson's case, being an accessory after the fact to an armed robbery of the Newington Inn at Petersham on 25 August 2010 and secondly, receiving a subwoofer removed from a stolen motor vehicle used in the commission of the robbery at Petersham Inn.
In Mr Barrie's case, robbery in company on 10 April 2010 whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, on 13-14 October 2010 breaking entering and stealing and, on 19 October 2010, possession of 3.1 grams of cannabis and 0.07 grams of heroin.  
In Mr Crisp's case, stealing a motor vehicle.
8Also, Mr Wilson received a discount of only 10% for his plea.  Messrs Barrie and Crisp each received a discount of 25%.  In the context of a sentence of 5 years, the extra 15% represents 9 months.  In the context of a sentence of 7 years, the extra 15% represents about 12½ months. 
9There were also other differences and I shall attempt to summarise the situation of each.  In the case of Mr Wilson, his being an accessory was said to have been constituted by throwing out of a car window a balaclava used in the Newington Inn robbery.
10In sentencing Mr Wilson, Charteris DCJ observed that the offenders assembled patrons and staff in the main bar and forced them to the floor, forced the manager to his office and that, ""when 2 of the offenders were downstairs another offender kicked a patron"" who was unaware that a robbery was occurring ""down a flight of stairs as he emerged from the toilet"".  His Honour also concluded that the offences were well planned and not impulsive.  He described them as extremely serious and organised criminal behaviour.  His Honour regarded this latter circumstance and that a number of victims were put in fear as additional aggravating factors.  
11Mr Wilson was born in January 1992.  His parents separated before he was nine.  He had been in much trouble at school and left soon after the commencement of year 10.  He had never been in employment.  He started smoking marijuana when 12 and heroin at 16.  He had a significant criminal record for offences of break, enter and steal and one offence of robbery in company, the sentence for which expired in January 2010.  His Honour regarded the record as robbing Mr Wilson of leniency.
12His Honour accepted an opinion of a psychologist that Mr Wilson had a conduct disorder and a substance abuse disorder and the opinion of Mr Wilson's mother that since being incarcerated he had become more responsive, more compassionate and caring.  His Honour concluded that Mr Wilson had good prospects of rehabilitation ""provided he can address his abuse of illicit drugs"".  
13Mr Wilson had been arrested on 11 February 2011 and remained in custody until sentenced.  Three months of that time was the subject of a sentence for another offence although Charteris DCJ commenced Mr Wilson's sentence on 1 April 2011. 
14Mr Barrie was sentenced both in respect of the offence for which Mr Wilson was sentenced and in respect of a charge that on 25 August 2010 he robbed a victim of $4,500, the property of the Newington Inn at Petersham whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, to wit a replica firearm and in company.  It was to this robbery that the accessory offence on Mr Wilson's Form 1 related.  
15Charteris DCJ sentenced Mr Barrie as follows:
In respect of the Newington Inn offence, imprisonment for 7.5 years including a non-parole period of 4.5 years, both periods commencing on 1 January 2011
In respect of the Petersham Inn offence, imprisonment for 9 years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months, both such periods commencing on 1 January 2014
16The effective sentence imposed was thus one of 12 years including a non-parole period of 7 years and 9 months.  To the extent of the 1 month period from 18 January 2011, the sentence was concurrent with sentences imposed for other offences.
17The armed robbery offence was committed by three men against the staff and patrons of the Henson Park Hotel at Marrickville with a replica pistol and 25 cm knives.  Almost $10,000 was stolen.
18The break and enter offence related to a theft of copper from a metal recycler or waste premises.
19In sentencing Mr Barrie, his Honour recorded that Mr Barrie was the offender who kicked the patron down the stairs at the Petersham Inn and that the manager of the hotel had been struck a number of times.  Again his Honour found that there had been considerable planning involved and the number of victims was an aggravating factor.  His Honour regarded the instilling of fear into these persons as serious.
20Mr Barrie was born in December 1989.  His parents separated when he was young and he had problems with his stepfather due to the latter's conduct.  Mr Barrie suffered from problems throughout his school career.  He completed year 10 and had been briefly employed.  He was assessed by a psychologist as functioning at a borderline disability level.  His record included some three offences of dishonesty, and four of destroying or damaging property.  In 2007 he was convicted of larceny, of having goods suspected of being stolen in his custody and of possession of a prohibited drug.  He was placed on a bond.  In February 2010 he was fined for possession of a prohibited drug.  In May 2010 he was sentenced for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, destroying or damaging property and using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence.  Two bonds imposed by the Children's Court were current at the time of the offences for which he was sentenced by Charteris DCJ, a factor his Honour regarded as aggravating.  Mr Barrie had never been sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
21Mr Barrie seems to have used cannabis since the commencement of high school, graduating to the use of heroin at age 16 or 17.  He also used cocaine and methylamphetamine.  Whilst in custody he failed prescribed urine tests in March 2011 and February 2012.  After his arrest he was released on bail for a time to Miracle Haven, a rehabilitation facility but was discharged for using marijuana there and returned to custody.  He was later released again to reside at the William Booth facility but removed and returned to custody because of the nature of the offences charged against him.  His Honour recorded that Mr Barrie had had a total of about 87 days on bail since his arrest and said that he intended to backdate the sentence to commence on 1 January 2011.  His Honour accepted a psychologist's diagnosis of substance abuse disorder.
22In response to a submission put on behalf of Mr Barrie, Charteris DCJ said that the offence was far more serious than the typical offence described in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.
23His Honour referred or recommended that both Mr Wilson and Mr Barrie be considered for placement in the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre at Parklea.
24Mr Anthony Crisp was sentenced in respect of 3 matters, viz:-
that on 14 September 2010 being armed with dangerous weapons namely a pistol and a shortened shotgun he robbed Desmond Clarken of certain money the property of Vertigo Pty Ltd trading as the Petersham Inn Hotel; and  
that he on 25 September 2010 while armed with a dangerous weapon namely a shortened shotgun he robbed David Deboos of a wallet containing personal cards and money.  This charge also arose under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment; and
that on 3 October 2010 he was armed with weapons namely a replica pistol and a taser device and while being in company with others with intent to commit an indictable offence namely robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon at the Little Bottler Liquor Store.   This charge arises under s 114(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum punishment of 7 years imprisonment.
25Taken into account in relation to the first of these offences was an offence of stealing a motor vehicle on 14 September 2010, obviously for the purposes of it being used in the robbery at the Petersham Hotel.  Taken into account in relation to the second of the offences were offences of:-
(i) Aggravated break, enter and steal on 29 September 2010 at residential unit at Homebush West, and
(ii) Aggravated armed robbery with a shotgun and in company of the Boulevarde Hotel in Enfield on 29 September 2010.
26Sentence was imposed on 12 December 2012, the effective total sentence being 5 years and 6 months including a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, made up of:-
On count 3 a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 3 October 2010;
On count 2 imprisonment for 5 years including a non-parole period of 3 years, both such periods commencing on 3 October 2010;
On count 1 imprisonment for 5 years including a non-parole period of 3 years, both such periods commencing on 3 April 2011.
27In arriving at his decision concerning Mr Crisp's involvement in the Petersham Inn offence North DCJ found he could not conclude that the firearms used were genuine or loaded and that apart from the patrons being forced to the ground and the manager forced into his office, there was no actual violence.  His Honour found that there was some degree of planning and organisation as the car used had to be stolen, weapons obtained and disguises and gloves organised and that the property stolen was $9,000 and two mobile phones.  
28His Honour observed that Mr Crisp was not an offender with little or no criminal history, observing that his antecedent report extended to some 17 pages and his record disentitled him to leniency.  His Honour also remarked that the guideline judgment in R v Henry was of assistance in the case before him though observing that the planning and amount stolen were more than was contemplated in that case.  His Honour observed:
Prior to looking at the issue of the offender's substance dependency and mental health at the time of the offences and noting his role as the driver on balance it looks as if in this case, given the uncertainty over the condition of the dangerous weapons themselves and the discount for the plea, that it falls into the area covered by the Henry guideline.
29Turning to Mr Crisp's subjective circumstances, his Honour accepted evidence that as a young child he had been repeatedly physically abused by his father, that he had commenced smoking marijuana at age 14, ice at 15, and when aged 16 commenced using ecstasy and experimented with cocaine at age 20.  His Honour observed that it could be said that Mr Crisp's ""taking drugs was not really attributable to personal choice"" and accepted the opinion of a psychologist that Mr Crisp's capacity to exercise judgment was to some extent impaired by his constant use of drugs and that over the two week period of his offending he was ""not acting rationally and thinking clearly but that he did understand the nature of his acts"".  He concluded that Mr Crisp was remorseful.
30Mr Crisp had been in prison since his arrest on 3 October 2010 and had acquired a significant number of certificates.  His Honour observed that this was a long period to spend in prison without knowing his ultimate fate resulting in suspense and uncertainty.   He observed that he had been able to show progress through rehabilitation in the meantime and that there had only been one infraction for possessing prohibited goods.  His Honour found special circumstances in the need for lengthy supervision.
31A number of comments must be made about the findings of North DCJ.  Firstly, it would seem that the evidence of violence before North DCJ was less than before Charteris DCJ.  Secondly, his Honour's acceptance of the psychologist's conclusion that that Mr Crisp's capacity to exercise judgment was to some extent impaired by his constant use of drugs and that he was not acting rationally and thinking clearly is a finding favourable to Mr Crisp that was not made in respect of Messrs Wilson and Barrie.  (It is not presently to the point whether his Honour's conclusion was correct.  There is much to be said for the view it was not.)
32More significant is the conclusion of North DCJ that Mr Crisp's offence fell into the area covered by the Henry guideline.  That conclusion was wrong and it is impossible to understand how his Honour arrived at it.  The R v Henry guideline applies to an offender and offence exhibiting the following broad characteristics, at [161] - [165]:
(i) young offender with no or little criminal history;
(ii) weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;
(iii) limited degree of planning;
(iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;
(v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;
(vi) small amount taken; and
(vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.
33Mr Crisp was a young offender but not one with no or little criminal history.  As I have said, his criminal antecedents report extended to 17 pages.  His record included four offences of stealing a motor vehicle, another three of being carried in a stolen vehicle, three offences of breaking and entering, three others of stealing, one of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and one of robbery in company.  He had been sentenced on at least a dozen occasions, and by the courts had been given chance after chance after chance.  He might fairly be described as a recidivist.
34While there was no weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, the baseball bat was certainly capable of being so used and that other weapons, a pistol and shortened shotgun, even if unloaded, were calculated to inflict significant emotional trauma, possibly long lasting, on those threatened.
35Mr Crisp's involvement did not involve only a limited degree of planning.  At Mr Crisp's request, a co-offender picked him up, drove him to meet other offenders, and then to a railway station in order for Mr Crisp to steal a car.  When that was done Mr Crisp drove the car and picked up the other offenders, weapons and clothing to be used as a disguise, and drove them to the Petersham Inn.  He then waited in the car while the others carried out the robbery and after that occurred he drove them away.  He then attended premises where the proceeds were shared.  His offending was ""planned or organised criminal activity"", an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
36There was not one ""victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver"".  There were a number of victims, staff and patrons who were assembled by the offenders in one room and there forced to the floor.  The manager was forced to his office.  ""Multiple victims"" is another aggravating factor under s 21A(2).
37The amount taken was not small.  It was $9,000 in cash and two mobile phones.
38There were, of course other differences.  Mr Crisp was in the company of four other offenders, a matter which s 21A(2)(e) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act regards as aggravating.  His Honour had also to take into account the offence on the Form 1 of stealing of the car.  Operating in the other direction was his Honour's conclusion that Mr Crisp's ""taking drugs was not really attributable to personal choice"".  However, when allowance is made for all of the differences, Mr Crisp's offence and circumstances were far worse than those contemplated in the guideline in R v Henry and the sentence imposed on him for the offence he had in common with Messrs Wilson and Barrie was, as I have said, manifestly inadequate.
39There were obviously substantial differences between the sentences imposed on Messrs Wilson and Barrie on the one hand and that imposed on Mr Crisp on the other.  When regard is had to the different factors operating, were the differences unjustified?
40So far as the non-parole periods are concerned I do not believe they were.  The difference in the non-parole periods imposed on Mr Crisp and Mr Barrie can reasonably be justified by the difference in their Forms 1 - in the case of Mr Crisp, stealing a motor vehicle and in the case of Mr Barrie, robbery in company of the Henson Park Hotel whilst armed with a dangerous weapon and breaking entering and stealing - and by the fact that Mr Barrie was subject to conditional liberty at the time.
41Mr Wilson's offence of being accessory after the fact is not as obviously serious as Mr Barrie's of actually being involved in a robbery whilst armed, and Mr Wilson's offence of receiving is not as serious as Mr Barrie's of breaking entering and stealing.  The offences on Mr Wilson's Form 1 were still more serious than the one offence on Mr Crisp's but in the result I do not regard the difference between Mr Wilson's and Mr Crisp's Forms 1 as justifying the difference in their non-parole periods.  However, when one has regard also to the fact that Mr Wilson received a discount for his plea of only 10% while Mr Crisp received a discount of 25%, I do not think that there is unjustified disparity in their non-parole periods.
42However, the head sentences fall into a different situation.  Even making allowances for the difference between the offenders' circumstances, I am unable to see justification for the difference in the head sentences.  To take Mr Barrie by way of example, he did not merit a head sentence for the relevant offence almost twice as long as that imposed on Mr Crisp.
43The disparity gives rise to a power in this Court to interfere.  It does not oblige the Court to do so particularly when the disparity is the product of a manifestly inadequate sentence imposed on one of the offenders.  However, in this case I believe that the Court should interfere particularly as it can do so without imposing another manifestly inadequate sentence.  
44Before turning to what should be the consequences of the conclusion, it is convenient to consider the first and third of Mr Barrie's grounds of appeal.  The second should be left until later.
45The first ground was that:-
The learned judge erred in failing to give appropriate weight to the subjective features of the applicant.
46In support of this ground attention was given to the evidence that Mr Barrie had come from a disrupted home, findings of a psychologist that Mr Barrie had low intellectual functioning and his substance abuse disorder.  Attention was drawn to the fact that Mr Barrie had not previously been in prison.  However, having read the totality of Charteris DCJ's remarks I am by no means persuaded that his Honour did not give these matters the weight they deserved.  Certainly they operated in Mr Barrie's favour but they must be set against, inter alia, his record, the chances that courts had given him and what his court appearances must have made crystal clear, that anti-social behaviour could not be tolerated.  I would not uphold this ground.
47The third ground was that:-
The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the time served on bail for the applicant, given the restrictive nature of those conditions.
48Mr Barrie was arrested on 22 October 2010.  Between then and 1 January 2011, the date fixed for the commencement of his sentence, is a period of 71 days.  As his Honour recorded, the Applicant had spent about 87 days on bail during which periods he was obliged to participate in residential rehabilitation facilities at Miracle Haven and the William Booth Centre in Sydney.  Before Charteris DCJ the Crown had conceded that because of the onerous bail conditions to which the Applicant had been subject it would not be inappropriate to backdate the commencement of the sentence to 22 October 2010.
49However, counsel for Mr Barrie also made a concession.  When his Honour, having raised these matters said that he was minded to commence the sentence on 1 January 2011, and asked counsel what he wanted to say about that, Mr Santisi said that he did not wish to be heard.  He confirmed that stance after his Honour had formally passed sentence but invited comment.  In this Court the Crown drew attention to Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; 223 A Crim R 460 at [80] - [82] where the Court emphasised its reluctance to depart from concessions made in the Court below.
50Section 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires a court to take into account any time an offender has spent in custody in relation to the offence.  In practical terms this means that had the Applicant never been admitted to bail, his Honour would have been obliged to backdate the commencement of the sentence to 22 October 2010.  Because the Applicant had been on bail for 87 days he lost the benefit of 71 days backdating.  Commonly when the conditions of bail are such that time spent on bail amounts to quasi custody some of the time spent on bail is disregarded.  Not infrequently when this time is spent in a residential rehabilitation facility, the allowance is 50% of the time spent.  However, as a general proposition if an offender seeks this allowance there is an onus on him to provide evidence of the conditions to which he was subjected - see for examples of this, R v Eastway (unreported, NSWCCA, 19 May 1992), R v Campbell [1999] NSWCCA 76, and R v Delaney [2003] NSWCCA 342.  Of course, in some cases a judge may have become aware of the particular circumstances of an offender without such evidence - see Renshaw v R [2012] NSWCCA 91.
51In an appropriate case the Court can take judicial notice of these conditions - Bonett v R [2013] NSWCCA 234 at [56].  The members of the Court who are involved in its criminal jurisdictions commonly become aware of the conditions many of the residential rehabilitation facilities impose.  That said, in Bonett v R the Court also held that although quasi-custody may be a relevant consideration it is not a mandatory relevant consideration and in that case there was insufficient evidence before the sentencing judge to enable his Honour to determine the conditions of the applicant's residence so as to show it amounted to quasi-custody and to oblige him to have regard to it.  
52Here also the evidence was sparse although Charteris DCJ having been prepared to act on what there was and, it may be inferred, to some extent on the concessions made, this Court should adopt a generally similar approach. 
53But there still remains the question of what allowance should be made.  A difficulty the Applicant has is that he was discharged from the Miracle Haven facility because he had partaken of marijuana.  He clearly had not adhered to the conditions imposed on him.  To what extent he departed is a matter upon which there is no evidence so while I think it appropriate that he received some credit for his not insubstantial time in the residential rehabilitation facilities, that credit should not be as high as 50% of the time spent there. Credit for a third of the 87 days would not be inappropriate and that would mean that 58 days were not to be treated as pre-sentence custody:  58 days is only 13 days less than the 71 days Charteris DCJ denied the Applicant credit for.  In circumstances where the quantum of the allowance is discretionary and Mr Barrie's counsel elected not to debate his Honour's choice of 1 January 2011, there is no ground for concluding that his Honour erred in what he did. 
54That said, if this Court is to adjust the sentence imposed on Mr Barrie, it would be appropriate for the further 13 days to be allowed.   
55I return to the consequences of the disparity I have found.  If it was not to be manifestly inadequate, the head sentence imposed on Mr Crisp for the offence they had in common should have been substantially higher than it was.  Mr Barrie's Form 1 required that, other things being equal, a higher sentence should have been imposed on him than on Mr Crisp.  The fact that Mr Barrie was on conditional liberty argues in the same direction.  I am not persuaded that there was a great deal to choose between their respective subjective circumstances.
56The principal difference between Mr Wilson and Mr Crisp lies in the different discounts that they received.  
57In the result I would reduce the head sentences in respect of the Petersham Inn Hotel offence to, in the case of Mr Wilson, 7½ years and in the case of Mr Barrie, 8 years.  As I indicated above, I see no justification for reducing the non-parole periods.
58I turn to Mr Barrie's remaining ground of appeal, viz
The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the totality principle in his accumulation of sentences.
59As has been said, Charteris DCJ sentenced Mr Barrie as follows:
In respect of the Newington Inn offence, imprisonment for 7.5 years including a non-parole period of 4.5 years, both periods commencing on 1 January 2011;
In respect of the Petersham Inn offence, imprisonment for 9 years including a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months, both such periods commencing on 1 January 2014.
60Thus his Honour accumulated on each of the non-parole period and the full term imposed for the Petersham Inn offence, a further 3 years.   Put another way - though it seems to me preferable to consider to what extent the longest sentence has been increased - he accumulated on the non-parole period and full term imposed for the Newington Inn offence a further non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months and a further 4½ years on the full term.  
61In R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at [7], Simpson J, in a passage that has been often cited, observed:-
Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with established principle. Features common to two or more offences are all matters relevant to be taken into account (pointing towards concurrence) as are features indicating the disparate nature of the offences (pointing the other way). There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong.
62However, as Howie J said in R v Merrin [2007] NSWCCA 255; 174 A Crim R 100 at [36]:-
Statements such as those in R v Hammond (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] to the effect that questions of concurrence or accumulation are a discretionary matter for the sentencing judge ""has to be read subject to what is required in a particular case to reflect the totality of the criminality before the Court.""  
63Furthermore, as was said in R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at [16]:-
The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship. That is to say severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence. 
64I made a similar point in R v Spiteri [1999] NSWCCA 3 at [39]:-
I take the view that actual imprisonment for say 10 years is more than twice as severe as one of imprisonment for 5 years. Having regard to the sorts of terms under consideration for drug dealing a sentence of one of the longer periods is likely to have an impact on an offender's life in terms of wife, children, job prospects and the like from which he may well never recover and these sorts of considerations also have to be borne in mind.
65The point has application to the circumstances here.
66The matters just referred to mean that it is not just a case of comparing the 3 years increase in sentence with the 4½ years imposed for the Newington Inn offence.  Three years as an addition to the 4 years 9 months non-parole period for the Petersham Inn offence has a greater impact than a simple 3 years sentence.  How much greater is a matter of judgment.
67The offences for which Mr Barrie was sentenced were discrete.  Committed some three weeks apart, they each involved their own separate criminality by him and their own separate victims.  Sacrificing some accuracy for brevity, the only matter of arguable significance linking them was Mr Barrie's motivation - the need to feed his drug addiction.  I would afford that some, but limited weight.
68However, I am satisfied that, given the non-parole period imposed in respect of the Petersham Inn offence, accumulation by 3 years on account of the 4½ years non-parole period for the Newington Inn offence was excessive.  His Honour gave no reasons why he adopted that figure and, although I do not suggest he should have, the absence of reasons means that this Court does not have the benefit of knowing why his Honour chose that figure.  In my view the extent of the accumulation of the non-parole should be reduced to 21 months.  The effective non-parole period will be 6½ years, no insubstantial period.  The extent of accumulation of the full terms should also be reduced.  The effective full term will thus become 9 years and 9 months.
69As I have said, Mr Wilson's non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months should not be reduced but his full term should be reduced to 7½ years.  
70I should record that Charteris DCJ made findings of special circumstances - expressly in the case of Mr Wilson and implicitly in the case of Mr Barrie.  There was no challenge to these findings and there were clearly grounds for them.
71In the result I propose the following orders:-
In the case of Mr Wilson:-
(i) Grant leave to appeal against sentence;  (ii) Allow the appeal;(iii) Quash the sentence imposed by Charteris DCJ on 11 October 2012.(iv) In respect of the offence of, on 14 September 2010, being armed with dangerous weapons and being in company, robbing Desmond Clarken of money the property of Vertigo Pty Ltd trading as the Petersham Inn Hotel, sentence him to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months commencing on 1 April 2011 and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 1 July 2016.(v) Record as the date when it appears to the Court that Mr Wilson shall be eligible for parole, 1 July 2016.
In the case of Mr Barrie:-
(i) Grant leave to appeal against sentence;(ii) Allow the appeal;(iii) Quash the sentences imposed by Charteris DCJ on 11 October 2012.(iv) In respect of the offence of, on 25 August 2010, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon robbing Patricia Tselepi of property of the Newington Inn, sentence him to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 18 December 2010, together with a further term of 3 years commencing on 18 June 2015.(v) In respect of the offence of, on 14 September 2010, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon robbing Desmond Clarken of property of Petersham Inn, sentence him to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 4 years and 9 months commencing on 18 September 2012, together with a further term of 3 years and 3 months commencing on 18 June 2017.  (vi) Record as the date when it appears to the Court that Mr Barrie shall be eligible for parole, 18 June 2017.**********

2704650,R v Booth [2014] NSWCCA 156,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hamill J.

2BEECH-JONES J: I agree with Hamill J.

3HAMILL J: This is a Crown appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Toner on 18 December 2013. 

4It is a case which brings into very sharp focus the decisions of the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 and Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 294 CLR 600. The case presents a particularly difficult and complex application of sentencing discretion. The principles of sentencing pull in opposite directions in terms of the appropriate outcome. The respondent stood to be sentenced in relation to offences of a very serious kind in circumstances where he had a bad criminal record and had breached parole. However, his personal circumstances are such that principles of general deterrence had little role to play and he was, to a very large degree, a product of the distressing circumstances of disadvantage and deprivation in which he grew up. Those circumstances involve the marginalisation of rural and outback aboriginal communities and were described by Judge Toner as ""a national disgrace"". 

5The appellant asserts that the total sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate and relies on the following five grounds of appeal: 
""Ground 1: His Honour erred in imposing sentences for each of the counts 1,2 and 3 which are disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offences. 

Ground 2: His Honour erred in the manner in which the sentences were accumulated leading to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate total sentence.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in the manner in which the finding of special circumstances was applied.

Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to have any regard to the principles of deterrence leading to the imposition of a manifestly inadequate sentence 

Ground 5: His Honour erred in imposing a total sentence which in the circumstances is manifestly inadequate."" 

6Counsel for the respondent contends that the individual sentences are not so lenient that they can properly be described as ""unreasonable"", ""plainly unjust"" or ""manifestly wrong"": Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 per Gaudron and Gummow JJ at [22]. She contends that the errors particularised in the five specific grounds of appeal have not been established. She relies on the breadth of the sentencing discretion and the fact that there is ""no single correct sentence"". However, she properly and sensibly concedes that there is ""greater force in the contention that the total effective sentence was manifestly inadequate because of the high degree of concurrency between the sentences and the sharp variation in the ratio between total effective non-parole period and total effective sentence"".

7The respondent stood to be sentenced in relation to three offences on an indictment and asked that two further offences on a Form 1 to be taken into account under s 32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). The offences were as follows:
(1)Aggravated break, enter and steal in circumstances of aggravation: Section 112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

(2)Specially aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence (assault occasioning actual bodily harm with wounding): Section 112(3) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

(3)Robbery with the reckless infliction of actual bodily harm: Section 95(1) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).

8The offences on the Form 1 were two further offences of aggravated break enter and steal under s 112(2) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). They were taken into account in sentencing the respondent in relation to the second count. 

9In respect of both the first and third counts there was a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment while the second count invoked a maximum penalty of 25 years. There is a standard non-parole period of five years for the first count and a standard non-parole period of seven years for the second count. The guideline judgment on armed robbery (4-5 years) had some peripheral relevance to count 3: R v Henry and ors [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346.

10The sentencing judge imposed a total effective sentence of six years and six months with a total effective non-parole period of two years and six months. This was achieved by imposing the following individual sentences:
Count 1 - a total sentence of four years with a non-parole period of 18 months.
Count 2 - a total sentence of six years with a non-parole period of two years.
Count 3 - a total sentence of four years with a non-parole period of 18 months. 

11The commencement date of the sentences imposed on counts 1 and 2 were staggered to achieve the total effective sentence to which I have referred. The commencement date for the sentence for count 3 was the same as the commencement date for the sentence on count 1. 

12The facts of the case were not in dispute and were set out in the remarks on sentence as follows: 
""Form 1 AGG BES

About 9:00pm on Monday the 6th February, 2012 the victims Beverly Falzonand Anthony Manning went to sleep in the master bedroom located on the top floor with all windows and doors locked and secured.

About 6:30am on Tuesday the 7th February, 2012 the victim Falzon heard a loud banging sound corning from the ground floor area of the residence. At this time the accused had gained entry to the dwelling and stolen the victim's handbag and laptop bag. These contained two wallets, items of identification, bank cards, Nokia mobile phone, reading glasses, make up and house keys and keys to her husband's Audi motor vehicle.
The accused immediately left the dwelling.

The victim went down stairs to investigate. As she walked down the stairs she was able to see directly into the laundry and noticed the fly screen covering the laundry window had been removed and the front door to the house was open. Police were contacted and arrived a short time late. A crime scene was established.

During the subsequent forensic examination of the premises a palm print was located on the internal edge of the laundry window sill facing downwards. Swabs of the area were also obtained.
On Wednesday 8th of February, 2012 police received notification that the located palm print had been matched to that of the Accused, Daniel Booth. At no time did the victims give permission for anyone to enter their premises.

The total amount of property stolen in the break and enter totaled over $800, in addition to this the victims were required to pay approximately $1200 to replace the locks to the Audi motor vehicle and their home. The victims seek compensation to cover these costs.

COUNT 2 
Specifically Aggravated BE& commit serious indictable offence -AOABH then being in company and did wound the victim.
11 Charman Avenue, Maroubra is a single storey three bedroom detached house.

On the evening of Monday 6th February 2012, victim Colin Davis (59 years old) was at the address with his brother Gary Davis (65 years old), also a victim. Gary Davis was visiting his brother and staying with him whilst in Australia. This evening they went to sleep in their respective bedrooms.
About 7:00am the accused Daniel Booth and another male forcibly entered the address from the rear door damaging the lock and the door frame. Colin and Gary Davis both heard noises within the house as they roused in their bedrooms.

Colin Davis got up out of bed believing it to be his brother. He entered the dining room and saw one of the offenders standing with his back to him. The male turned around, he was wearing a black hooded jumper with the hood up over his head and a bandanna covering the lower half of his face. 

Colin Davis then saw the second offender standing in the living room with his back to him. This offender was wearing a grey hooded jumper with the hood over his head.

The offender in the black jumper then quickly approached Colin Davis demanding money and physically assaulting him to his head and face. The force of this assault caused the victim to collapse and lose consciousness.

The accused and other male have entered the bedroom of victim, Gary Davis and demanded money. The offender wearing the black hooded jumper came over the top of Gary Davis who was lying in his bed struck him to the left side of his head with a metal bar approximately 30cm in length. The force of this strike caused a 5cm horizontal laceration (into the dermis) to his left parietal region with a small arteriole bleed. This head laceration subsequently required suturing.

Gary Davis watched as the accused and other male rifled through his bedroom stealing his watch, Apple Mac Air laptop, his wallet containing his drivers licence, credit cards and other cards in his name, Holden Commodore Utility car keys, Nokia mobile phone, a small silver safe containing his passports, airline ticket, cash and other personal documents in his name.

Property stolen by the offenders belonging to Colin Davis included his wallet with identification, credit cards and other cards in his name, two watches, a digital camera and personal documents in his name.

Shortly after the males left the dwelling stealing Gary Davis' vehicle, a white Holden Commodore utility registration QGC654 (NSW). The accused was seated in the front passenger seat and the unknown male being the driver.

Gary Davis left his room and contacted police who attended within minutes. Police began to render aid to the victims. Gary was extremely confused suffering from a head injury and losing a large amount of blood. Shortly after ambulance officers arrive and both Colin and Gary Davis were conveyed to hospital.

As a result of this attack Gary Davis received five (5) stitches to the wound to left side of his head. Colin Davis has a bruised and swollen right eye, a largelump to the top of his head, the skin on the left side of his forehead has been grazed off, his left ear is swollen and purple with several small cuts around his ear along with two lacerations to the back of his neck. He also had defensive injuries which included bruising and grazing to his right arm.



COUNT 3
Aggravated Robbery inflict Actual bodily harm.
About 7.45am on Tuesday 7th February 2012 the victim, Philippa Griffith and witness, Debora McAlpine, were packing personal effects into their vehicle in the driveway to their residence located on Brook Street, Coogee.
At this time they observed the accused, Daniel Booth, to be walking backwards and forwards past the front of their vehicle looking at the victim and McAlpine. These actions by the accused started to make the victim and McAlpine feel uncomfortable.

The victim was standing next to the passenger side of the vehicle. She was carrying her handbag, a light blue purple leather bag, over her right shoulder. Contained in this handbag was her Apple iPhone 4, her blue purse, her New Zealand Passport, credit card and bank card issued to her from Kiwi Bank, her New Zealand Drivers Licence, a pair of Stella McCartney sunglasses valued at over $200, a $200 Mitre 10 gift voucher and other personal property.

The accused ran towards the victim, grabbed her handbag and pulled it forcefully from her shoulder causing her pain. The victim has fallen to the ground hitting her head and left elbow on the concrete driveway. She sustained an abrasion to her right elbow.

The accused ran to a white Holden Commodore Utility QGC654 (NSW) which was parked a short distance away. Being the vehicle stolen from 11 CharmanAvenue, Maroubra 20 minutes earlier. He got into the passenger seat of this vehicle. The vehicle drove away in a northerly direction on Brook Street, Coogee.

The victim was assisted by her friend Debora and an independent witness, Nathan Garlick. Police were contacted and arrived a short time later. As a result of this incident the victim sustained considerable bruising to the inside of her right bicep and the top of her shoulder, as well as abrasions from the contact with the concrete.

On the 9th February 2012, the victim and Debora McAIpine completed photographic line up presentations. They both identified the accused as the person who had committed this robbery. The victim is seeking compensation for the items stolen from her.""

13It needs hardly be said that this represented criminality of a very high order. In view of the agreed facts, maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods, the total sentence imposed on the respondent was very lenient. It is even more lenient when one takes into account the criminal history of the respondent and the fact that the offences were committed whilst he was on parole for similar offences. Indeed the commencement date of the sentences was during the period of parole which was revoked, thus creating a further degree of concurrency in the sentences.

14To understand how his Honour came to impose such a lenient total sentence it is necessary to consider the personal case of the respondent and the observations of the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen (supra), Munda v Western Australia (supra) and Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120. 

15Counsel for the respondent provided a thorough and accurate summary of the respondent's subjective case. I unable to improve upon it. Accordingly, I set it out as it was presented in counsel's written submissions:
""8.The respondent was born on 9 May 1988 and was accordingly 23 years of age at the time of commission of the offences and 25 when sentenced. 

9.The applicant's paternal grandparents were forcibly removed from family as part of the stolen generation and this was likely to have impacted on his father's upbringing and in turn his father's upbringing of his own children. The respondent's early childhood was on a mission in Bourke where he lived with a large extended family. He has two younger biological sisters. He remained at the mission until he was about six and was both the victim of violence and witness to his father's violence towards his mother, the latter resulting in his father's incarceration. He was surrounded by widespread alcohol abuse including by both parents. His parents were unemployed. They often left him unsupervised. He was cared for by members of the extended family at times and at times learned to care for himself. He spent time with older cousins who did not provide suitable guidance.

10.The family moved into the town of Bourke when the respondent was aged about 6. Although other adults in the community attempted to assist the respondent's care was inadequate and he and his sisters were removed from their parents and made State wards when he was aged 10. He moved frequently (estimating at least 20 different foster homes altogether to Ms Pratley, five or six, after being cared for by his aunts, to Dr Hayes) between then and 16 years of age including in Dubbo, Gilgandra and Coonabarabran. He was initially with his sisters but once, missing his extended family, he encouraged them to run away with him. He was thereafter separated from them.

11.The respondent suffered sexual abuse in one foster home in Bourke, apparently resulting in a custodial sentence for the perpetrator. The respondent has not received counselling in connection with this trauma. Problems with placements otherwise seem to have arisen because the respondent had a lot of energy, found some of the rules imposed on him too strict, and did not understand why some of his carers did not let him simply 'hang around with other boys'. This caused friction and misbehaviour.

12. The respondent is illiterate. He left school in approximately year 6, never having learned the alphabet. He had been in remedial classes. Due to his parents' violence and alcohol abuse he did not attend school on a regular basis.

13. Ms Pratley said that 'Mr Booth grew up in an environment that normalised substance use and this has likely played a role in his own extensive history of polysubstance use.' He first used cannabis at age seven or eight. He started sniffing petrol at age 10 and this has likely caused neurological damage. He ceased sniffing petrol at 11 or 12 by increasing cannabis usage, which relaxed him. He continued to smoke on a daily dependence level. The order of commencement of these, and the basis for stopping petrol sniffing, was different in the report to Dr Hayes. From age 18 he commenced amphetamines with rapidly increased dependence, and commenced heroin usage at age 19. There were unreliable aspects of his reports of alcohol consumption but Ms Pratley thought his usage problematic and related to the offending. His counsel informed his Honour that he was being maintained on the methadone programme in custody and this is also referred to in Dr O'Dea's report at [12].

14. At some stage the respondent travelled by train from Dubbo by himself to Sydney because his mother and father (who had separated), two sisters, two half-brothers from his father's side and two stepsisters live here. He told Dr Hayes this was in 2002 (when he would have been 13/14) although it is unclear how this relates to his remaining in state care until age 16 or 17. He told Dr Hayes that his mother is becoming older and needs his help with cleaning and other chores. Both parents had re-partnered. He was living with his mother in the Redfern / Waterloo area at the time of the 2008 offences and as will be indicated below was also having contact with her there prior to the commission of the offences now before the Court (although telling Dr O'Dea he was aware that '..people reckon I can't go to Redfern.'): [7].

15. The respondent's first charge on his criminal record was for larceny at age 10, which was dismissed with a caution. At 14 years of age he commenced a control order for robbery in company. Throughout his childhood and young adulthood he has been convicted for numerous offences including larceny, driving a conveyance taken without the owner's consent, assault, assault officer in execution of duty, wounding a police officer, destruction of property, escaping custody, multiple break and enter offences, stalking / intimidating, possessing implements to enter / drive conveyances, custody of a knife in a public place, and possession of drugs. Some of the break and enter offences are described as aggravated - normally because of knowledge of people present but on at least one occasion because in company. There are references in the terms of parole granted on a number of occasions to the respondent's disability and drug and alcohol problems.

16. On 16 July 2009 the respondent was sentenced by his Honour Finnane DCJ to three terms of imprisonment commencing 22 July 2008 and 22 July 2009 for three break and enter offences (one aggravated by persons present). The longest sentence was one of five years with a non-parole period to expire 21 July 2011 and total term to expire 21 July 2013. The respondent was released to parole on 30 September 2011. His liberty was accordingly conditional at the time of the offences before his Honour. This parole was revoked on 2 February 2012 prior to the commission of these offences, effective from his incarceration on February 10. This revocation must have been in the respondent's absence. There was no information before the sentencing judge as to why it was revoked (although it was apparent from the material available that it was not because of the commission of these offences).

17. The respondent was first incarcerated in an adult gaol on 19 September 2006,18 years old. Since then the longest he has been at liberty was a period of a little less than three months between 18 December 2006 when he was released to parole, and his readmission to custody on 9 March 2007. He was otherwise in custody until his release to parole before these offences on 30 September 2011, except for 6 days in October / November 2007, about 6 weeks in May / June 2008, 9 days later in June 2008 and in July of that year one period of 8 days and later on another 5 days: see pages 6 - 8 of Corrective Services records.

18. Professor Susan Hayes assessed the respondent prior to the sentencing process in 2009. He is deaf in one ear and wears glasses for long distance vision impairment. Psychometric testing demonstrated mild intellectual disability on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test with an IQ composite Standard Score of 68, at a level lower than 98 percent of the population. He was particularly disadvantaged in his verbal abilities. The Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales-II assess the degree to which the individual is able to function and maintain him or herself independently, and the degree to which he or she meets satisfactorily the culturally imposed demands of personal and social responsibility. Dr Hayes reported that the results of this testing were consistent with the intelligence testing' indicating that the respondent had a diagnosis of mild intellectual disability, as he has significant deficits in both cognitive and adaptive behaviour skills.In adaptive behaviour, his lowest area of functioning is communication.' In a table on page 5 of her report she demonstrated his skills in the communication areas to be equivalent to 4 years 11 months to 6 years 10 months.

19. Ms Pratley's testing in 2013 was said by the Sentencing Judge to be essentially consistent with the report of Dr Hayes. It is noted that in the intervening period the respondent was seemingly subjected to a significant head injury. Dr O'Dea at [37] says 'Mr Booth reported experiencing a number of head injuries through his life, ""..that's why I get all my days confused and that... I in Cooma in 20111 nearly died twice ... I was in hospital for four days [in relation to a head injury]..."".

20. Ms Pratley administered a Mini Mental State Exam that indicated mild-moderate cognitive development. Performance was possibly underestimated due to illiteracy as the assessment does not provide information about the nature of the impairment.

21.The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence demonstrated borderline to low average ability (better than 13% for normed age) for nonverbal ability and extremely low range (bottom 0.2% of normative age range) for verbal ability. Ms Pratley thought it not meaningful to report overall cognitive capacity because there was a relatively high performance on one nonverbal subtest which may have artificially inflated his nonverbal functioning score.

22. Of these results Ms Pratley said at [30]:
Mr Booth's poor verbal capacity means that he is likely to act both more impulsively due to an inability to engage in self-talk and restrain his behaviour, and also be more likely to react in concert with peers as he is less able to voice his own opinion or argue his case. Mr Booth struggles with abstract reasoning and this was evidence during the course of our interviews. Compared to the general population he is functioning in the bottom 2% for overall ability and hence is significantly impaired.""

23. In terms of the respondent's mental health otherwise, Ms Pratley described at [26] the respondent's extremely poor coping skills. She said his report of substance use as an effort to cope with difficult situations and avoid experiencing negative feelings can be a common coping strategy for children raised in environments that feature multiple child protection risks, as the respondent did. She said he did not appear to have a capacity to self-soothe and this was also commensurate with his level of intellectual functioning. Dr O'Dea noted a history in a report provided to him of an attempt on the respondent's part to hang himself at age 10: [14].

24.The respondent has regular contact with extended family members. He named to Ms Pratley a number of family members who have attempted to behave protectively towards him and continue to offer him support and encouragement around regaining abstinence from substances.

25. The respondent reported that prior to these offences he was initially on parole and attempting to comply with the support of an aunt. He told Dr O'Dea he was living with an aunt and uncle. He was unemployed, 'they had me going to a disability project... they reckon I've got a disability ... I don't know the days and that.': [5]. He told Ms Pratley two aunties and two cousins died within a short period of time and he was unable because of his parole to travel to Bourke to grieve with his family. He went to his mother's at Waterloo and reconnected with peers who had been a negative influence in the past. Ms Pratley reported at [33] that 'At his time of grief, Mr Booth's poor coping skills meant that he was highly susceptible to relapse. Mr Booth said that he 'stopped caring' at that time and he ceased his methadone program and resumed using heroin.' He reported heroin and alcohol usage during the night of the offences. He told Dr O'Dea he was using drugs and alcohol only when away from his aunty, when he went to the city and drank with cousins.

26. The respondent said he was not a leader in the offences and was adversely influenced by peers, some of whom he had known since childhood. His report to Dr O'Dea was also of being induced into this offending by others, but in more strongly exculpatory terms not consistent with the agreed facts. Ms Pratley's formulation at [36] - [39] is important, and set out and accepted by his Honour at ROS 11 (although with less optimism arising from the respondent's hope for employment on release) and set out also in the applicant's written submissions at [15].

27. She also said at [40] that 'As outlined above, Mr Booth has significantly impaired intellectual capacity and this calls into question his capacity to make informed, responsible decisions. His low intellectual functioning increases his susceptibility to influence by others, and this, combined with his personality characteristics of wanting to be liked and to fit in with others, means that he is vulnerable to being led by others.'

28. In the context of the importance in this formulation of the respondent's malleability to influence by negative peers, it is noted that count 2 on the indictment specifies that '... .the said Daniel Booth was in company with another unknown person and the said Daniel BOOTH thereby did wound Gary DAVIS.' It is submitted however that the Crown at sentence clearly did not contend that the respondent was the offender in the black hooded top who personally inflicted the violence on the two victims the subject of this count. The facts do not allege the respondent was the actual perpetrator, which would be expected if that was actually what was being alleged. The submission was made in writing and orally by counsel appearing on the respondent's behalf that it was not clear from the facts who the actual perpetrator of the violence was, and the Crown was unable to assert this beyond reasonable doubt: Defence submissions page 2.7, TRP 12/12/13 10.22. There was no demur from the Crown regarding this proposition.

29. It is further noted in this regard that the respondent's extensive criminal record does not include many offences of violence. There was little before the sentencing judge as to the break and enter offences for which his parole was revoked although they were submitted to be similar. They were aggravated because of persons being present in the premises. When Professor Hayes asked him why he committed these offences he said he was stealing money because no-one looked after him and he could not buy food. He said he tried to apply for a Disability Support Pension, but the staff at Centrelink told him that he was fit and healthy. They also told him that if he wanted to apply he would have to obtain a Medical Certificate. This process was too complicated for him and so he did not apply.""

16The offender's criminal history commenced when he was just 11 years of age. He had more than ten appearances in the Children's Court for various offences including break, enter and steal and robbery. He was incarcerated for nine months on a control order on his fifteenth birthday. He has been in and out of various custodial institutions ever since. He has many offences of dishonesty and some offences of violence. He has breached bonds and parole conditions more than once. 

GROUND 1: HIS HONOUR ERRED IN IMPOSING SENTENCES FOR EACH OF THE COUNTS 1,2 AND 3 WHICH ARE DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE GRAVITY OF THE INSTANT OFFENCES. 

17In assessing this ground it is important to keep firmly in mind that sentencing is a discretionary exercise, that a great deal of latitude is given to sentencing Judges and that there is no single correct sentence: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [46], Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [27], [133]. In Hili and Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 450 Heydon J said:
""76. When the second category [of House error] is relied on, the usual complaint is that the sentence is 'manifestly excessive' or 'manifestly inadequate'. Mere excessiveness or inadequacy will not reveal that there is an error of either an identifiable or an unidentifiable nature. The difficulty which the principles in House v The King create for appellants in sentencing appeals - whether defendants complaining of 'manifest excessiveness' or the prosecution complaining of 'manifest inadequacy' - is that they give sentencing judges 'a wide measure of latitude which will be respected by appellate courts.' But it does not follow that, when a sentencing judge in one case looks back on the reasons for judgment of an earlier sentencing judge in a similar case, the later judge should give the earlier one 'a wide measure of latitude' in the sense of not departing from the outcome unless it is plainly wrong.

77. Sentences must be reasonably consistent. But it does not follow that disparities between them may not exist. Within the boundaries of reason, and leaving aside the special instance of co-offenders, where marked disparity renders sentences vulnerable on appeal, it cannot be said that any particular disparate sentence is necessarily wrong merely because it is disparate. Indeed, even within a single jurisdiction, one court, while bound by whatever this Court or the intermediate appellate court for that jurisdiction has held to be the correct legal principles (statutory or common law), may arrive at sentencing results in particular cases which are different from those reached by earlier courts in that jurisdiction without being open to appellate reversal or criticism for 'error' merely because of those differences.""

18The appellant has pointed to nothing in Judge Toner's sentencing judgment which suggests that his Honour was not acutely aware of the seriousness of the offending. His Honour was dealing with an offender with a bad record but also had to give principled and significant weight to a series of subjective circumstances which plainly caused him to believe that while a substantial gaol sentence had to be imposed, that sentence must be tempered with considerable compassion and be structured in such a way as to foster his rehabilitation. It is trite to say that the rehabilitation of such an offender is more apt to protect the community from further offences of violence than the imposition of a lengthy or crushing gaol sentence.

19Judge Toner referred to the High Court's judgments in Bugmy v The Queen and Munda v The Queen. It is appropriate to consider those two cases together, remembering that the High Court heard them sequentially because they gave rise to similar and profound issues concerning the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders who come from deprived, dysfunctional and marginalised backgrounds.

20The High Court emphasised in both decisions that offenders are not to be treated differently because of their ethnic or racial background. Unlike the situation in Canada, there is no legislative warrant to do so: contra R v Gladue [1999] 1 SCR 688, R v Ipeelee [2012] 1 SCR 433. 

21In Bugmy v The Queen French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keane JJ said at [36]:
""There is no warrant, in sentencing an Aboriginal offender in New South Wales, to apply a method of analysis different from that which applies in sentencing a non-Aboriginal offender. Nor is there a warrant to take into account the high rate of incarceration of Aboriginal people when sentencing an Aboriginal offender. Were this a consideration, the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders would cease to involve individualised justice.""

22In Munda v Western Australia French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ said at [53]:
""Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, but they must not be allowed 'to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence.' It would be contrary to the principle stated by Brennan J in Neal to accept that Aboriginal offending is to be viewed systemically as less serious than offending by persons of other ethnicities. To accept that Aboriginal offenders are in general less responsible for their actions than other persons would be to deny Aboriginal people their full measure of human dignity. It would be quite inconsistent with the statement of principle in Neal to act upon a kind of racial stereotyping which diminishes the dignity of individual offenders by consigning them, by reason of their race and place of residence, to a category of persons who are less capable than others of decent behaviour. Further, it would be wrong to accept that a victim of violence by an Aboriginal offender is somehow less in need, or deserving, of such protection and vindication as the criminal law can provide""

23The reference to the ""principle stated by Brennan J"" is a reference to what his Honour said in Neal v The Queen (1982) 149 CLR 305 at 326:
""The same sentencing principles are to be applied ... in every case, irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group. But in imposing sentences courts are bound to take into account, in accordance with those principles, all material facts including those facts which exist only by reason of the offender's membership of an ethnic or other group. So much is essential to the even administration of criminal justice. That done, however, the weight to be attributed to the factors material in a particular case, whether of aggravation or mitigation, is ordinarily a matter for the court exercising the sentencing discretion of first instance or for the Court of Criminal Appeal.""

24Similar sentiments were articulated by Wood J in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 63:
""[I]n sentencing persons of Aboriginal descent the court must avoid any hint of racism, paternalism or collective guilt yet must nevertheless assess realistically the objective seriousness of the crime within its local setting and by reference to the particular subjective circumstances of the offender.""
This passage was referred to with approval in Munda v Western Australia at [51]. 

25In Bugmy v The Queen the joint reasons at [37] commended the following observations of Simpson J in Kennedy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 260 at [53]:
""Properly understood, Fernando is a decision, not about sentencing Aboriginals, but about the recognition, in sentencing decisions, of social disadvantage that frequently (no matter what the ethnicity of the offender) precedes the commission of crime.""

26The High Court observed at [37] that ""an Aboriginal offender's deprived background may militate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate"" noting that the same principle applies to a non-Aboriginal offender. The joint reasons went on to say at [43]:
""The experience of growing up in an environment surrounded by alcohol abuse and violence may leave its mark on a person throughout life. Among other things, a background of that kind may compromise the person's capacity to mature and to learn from experience. It is a feature of the person's make-up and remains relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence, notwithstanding that the person has a long history of offending.""

27And at [44]:
""An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender.""

The Court adopted remarks that had been made by Gleeson CJ in this Court in relation to the sentencing an offender with a mental condition: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68. 

28In addition to the circumstances of shocking deprivation, alienation and dislocation established on behalf of the respondent, the other critical subjective feature concerned his intellectual disability. In terms of the relevance of deterrence, this feature of the case was of great significance. The language used by the experts was in very similar terms to that applied to the appellant in Muldrock v The Queen. In that case, the High Court confirmed that such a condition is extremely important to the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. It cited with approval the Victorian decision of R v Mooney (Court of Criminal Appeal (VIC), 21 June 1978, unrep) in the following passage commencing at [53]: 
""Young CJ, in a passage that has been frequently cited, said this:
'General deterrence should often be given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others.""

In the same case, Lush J explained the reason for the principle in this way:
'[The] significance [of general deterrence] in a particular case will, however, at least usually be related to the kindred concept of retribution or punishment in which is involved an element of instinctive appreciation of the appropriateness of the sentence to the case. A sentence imposed with deterrence in view will not be acceptable if its retributive effect on the offender is felt to be inappropriate to his situation and to the needs of the community.'

54. The principle is well recognised. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender's mental illness and the commission of the offence. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender's moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community. 

55. In this case, there was unchallenged evidence of the causal relation between the appellant's retardation and his offending in the reports of Dr Muir and Ms Daniels. The fact that the appellant possessed the superficial understanding of a mentally retarded adult that it was wrong to engage in sexual contact with a child and that he told childish lies in the hope of shifting the blame from himself were not reasons to assess his criminality as significant, much less to use him as a medium by which to deter others from offending.""

29The High Court said (at [32]):
""An offence of sexual intercourse with a child aged under 10 years falling within the middle of the range of objective seriousness has a standard non-parole period of 15 years. That circumstance says little about the appropriate sentence for this mentally retarded offender and this offence.""

30In the present case, the evidence established that the respondent's substantial intellectual deficit placed him in the bottom 2% of the population and in some respects (verbal ability) in the bottom 0.2% of the population. While Dr O'Dea (who provided an opinion as to whether the respondent was fit to plead) described his intellectual disability as ""mild"" according to the psychologist the disability meant that he was ""significantly impaired"". It made him vulnerable to peer pressure, less able to voice his own opinion, more likely to act impulsively and to be unable to restrain his behaviour. 

31It was for Judge Toner, not this Court, to determine the extent to which these compelling subjective circumstances impacted on the sentences to be imposed on the respondent. It was for his Honour to determine the appropriate weight to be given to them. I can discern no error in his approach to assessing the appropriate sentence for each individual offence. His approach was a model of orthodoxy and sensitivity. 

32In the individual and particular circumstances of this case, I am unable to conclude that the individual sentences are inadequate and disproportionate to the gravity of the offending.

33I would reject ground 1.

GROUND 2: HIS HONOUR ERRED IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SENTENCES WERE ACCUMULATED LEADING TO THE IMPOSITON OF A MANIFESTLY INADEQUATE TOTAL SENTENCE.

34The appellant contends that ""the significance of the manifestly inadequate individual sentences is exacerbated by the manner in which his Honour structured the total sentence"". In spite of this submission, I do not understand Ground 2 to be dependent on a finding that the individual sentences were manifestly inadequate. If it were, the ground would fail as it presumes success on ground 1 which I would reject. However, I take Ground 2 as standing alone and tied, if anything, to ground 5 which contends that the total effective sentence is manifestly inadequate. 

35Counsel for the respondent, properly and correctly, acknowledged that there is force in this ground. However, she submitted that a large degree of discretion is afforded to sentencing judges to determine the extent to which sentences are accumulated.

36It is correct to say that the degree of accumulation and concurrence is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing Judge: see, for example, R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 per Simpson J at [7], Johnson v the Queen [2004] HCA 15; 205 ALR 346; 78 ALJR 616 at [26]. However, the discretion must be exercised in a principled way and if wholly concurrent sentences are to be imposed for distinct and separate crimes, the explanation for such an approach must be compelling. It is not sufficient that the offences were of a similar nature or formed part of one crime ""spree"": see for example R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130.

37In my opinion this ground is made out and error is established.

38The sentencing Judge commenced the sentence for count 2 six months after the commencement for count 1. The practical upshot of that approach was that the very serious offending encompassed by count 1 resulted in an effective penalty of six months imprisonment. That is a very small degree of accumulation given that the offences took place on different days (albeit within about 24 hours of each other), involved different premises and, perhaps most importantly, impacted on different victims. While it is correct to describe the offences as part of a ""continuum"", they were distinct and separate crimes. While the degree of accumulation between count 1 and 2 is very small, I am unable to conclude that it fell outside of the wide discretion residing in the sentencing Judge.

39However, when his Honour sentenced in relation to count 3, he imposed a sentence which was wholly concurrent with the other two sentences. This means that there was no effective punishment for count 3 which, while not the most serious example of an aggravated robbery, was a very serious offence.

40The respondent snatched the victim's bag, causing her to fall to the ground and hit her head. She suffered an abrasion to her elbow and bruising to her upper arm and shoulder. By itself, count three carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and there is a guideline judgment for a similar (not identical) offence suggesting a sentence of 4-5 years for a young offender with little or no criminal history: R v Henry and others (supra). It is difficult to conclude that it did not warrant some additional and distinct punishment.

41Apart from the reference to the temporal proximity of the offences and noting that they were part of a continuum, no real explanation was given for the manner in which his Honour exercised the discretion. I am unable to discern anything in the judgment which justifies, or even attempts to explain, the imposition of a wholly concurrent sentence for count 3. 

42In my opinion, the discretion miscarried. Subject to a consideration of the residual discretion, it will be necessary to re-sentence the respondent. 

GROUND 3: HIS HONOUR ERRED IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE FINDING OF SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES WAS APPLIED

43The appellant asserts that the proportion of the non-parole period to the total sentence for each individual sentence (37.5% in respect of counts 1 and 3 and 33.3% in respect of count 2) resulted in individual non-parole periods which do not reflect the objective gravity of the offending. The same submission is made with respect of the total effective sentence where the non-parole period is 38.5% of the total sentence.

44It was not contended that the finding of ""special circumstances"" was not correct (or at least open). To my mind it is a case where special circumstances clearly existed and also one where it was open to the sentencing Judge to make a substantial adjustment to the proportions between the total sentence and the non-parole period. 

45The degree of departure from the proportions dictated by s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is a discretionary decision that raises ""so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court will be very slow to intervene"": R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]; Trad v R [2009] NSWCCA 56; (2009) 194 A Crim R 20 at [33].

46I reject ground 3. However, if the respondent is re-sentenced to ensure some level of accumulation in relation to count 4, the ratio between the non-parole period and the total sentence will be altered. 
GROUND 4: HIS HONOUR ERRED IN FAILING TO HAVE ANY REGARD TO THE PRINCIPLE OF DETERRENCE TO THE IMPOSITON OF A MANIFESTLY INADEQUATE SENTENCE

47This ground appears to be directed predominantly to personal, rather than general, deterrence. As I understand it, the appellant concedes that the circumstances of the respondent's case, and in particular his intellectual disability, the role of general deterrence was limited. I have dealt with this in disposing of ground 1. However, it is submitted that the respondent's criminal record and the fact that there were two additional offences to be dealt with on the Form 1 meant that personal deterrence had an important and significant role to play. 

48The appellant's written submissions in relation to this ground elide questions of deterrence, rehabilitation, remorse and proportionality in a way that makes it difficult to assess precisely what is being submitted. Having said that, it is important to recall what the High Court said Munda v Western Australia at [54]-[58]. French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keane JJ made it clear that even where deterrence ""has little rational claim upon the sentence discretion"" it is important to recall the other purposes of punishment especially in cases involving violence. For example, ""the obligation of the state to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence"" and to ""express the community's disapproval of that offending"". Their Honours also noted that drug addiction can sometimes mean that personal deterrence has a greater role and went on to adopt the words of Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1994) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 that it is ""erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances."" 

49The appellant relies on the absence of any reference to deterrence in the remarks (judgment) on sentence. The respondent submits that ""in circumstances where the respondent's adaptive communication behaviour is equivalent to that of a five year old it must have a greatly reduced scope"". This submission accords with the observations of Spigelman CJ in R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [25]: 
""Furthermore, mental illness may also lead to the conclusion in a particular case that the element of personal deterrence, not just general deterrence, is also entitled to less weight in the sentencing exercise than it may otherwise have because, as the Victorian Court of Appeal put it: 
... specific deterrence may be more difficult to achieve and is often not worth pursuing as such."" (Tsiaras, supra, at 400)

That passage is part of a succinct analysis of the various ways in which mental illness and intellectual disability impact upon the sentencing discretion: see R v Israil at [21]-[27] and R v Tsiaras [1996] 1 VR 398.

50The respondent accepts that it would have been ""preferable"" for the sentencing Judge to articulate his approach to deterrence but says that ""in so squarely indicating his engagement with Muldrock and Bugmy it should not easily be inferred that his Honour was not conscious of such a basic sentencing principle."" 

51I accept the submission of the respondent. The respondent was not a suitable vehicle for general deterrence. The extent to which specific deterrence was relevant, given his disability, was questionable. Each of those sentencing principles had some role to play but it was not a determinative role. In any event I am unable to accept that the sentencing Judge failed ""to have any regard to the principle of deterrence"". 

GROUND 5: HIS HONOUR ERRED IN IMPOSING A TOTAL SENTENCE WHICH IN THE CIRCUMSTNACES IS MANIFESTLY INADEQUATE

52It follows from my conclusion in respect of ground 2 that this ground is also made out.

53The absence of any degree of accumulation in relation to count 3 means that the respondent received effectively no punishment for that offence. That outcome is unreasonable or plainly unjust and results in a total effective sentence that is, in all of the circumstances, manifestly inadequate. 
RESIDUAL DISCRETION

54In R v RD [2014] NSWCCA 103 I provided the following summary of some of the case law relating to the residual discretion following the introduction of s. 68A Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 (NSW):
""46. Section 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review Act) 2001 (NSW) provides:
""Double jeopardy not to be taken into account in prosecution appeals against sentence
(1) An appeal court must not:
(a) dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence, or
(b) impose a less severe sentence on any such appeal than the court would otherwise consider appropriate,
because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again.
(2) This section extends to an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912and accordingly a reference in this section to an appeal court includes a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal.""

47. The extent to which this provision circumscribes the 'residual discretion' has been considered by this Court: see, for example, R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49, 77 NSWLR 7 per Spigelman CJ (with whom Allsop P agreed) at [92]-[95] and [141]; per McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ at [209] and R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 per Basten JA at [21]-[26]. The High Court has also considered the exercise of the residual discretion in recent times: see, Green & Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 per French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ at [26], [43] and per Bell J at [131]; Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALJR 1022 at [24].

48. These cases establish that this Court retains a 'residual discretion' to decline to intervene to increase a sentence on a Crown appeal even where error is established and even when it concludes that the sentence imposed at first instances is plainly wrong or manifestly inadequate. 

49. In Green and Quinn v The Queen the majority said at [35]-[36]:
'...assuming the Court of Criminal Appeal considers the sentence under appeal to be inadequate on account of error by the primary Judge, two questions arise. Their answers involve the exercise of the different discretions conferred by s 5D. They are:
1. Whether, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the sentence, the Court should decline in the exercise of its 'residual discretion' under s 5D, to allow the appeal and thereby interfere with the sentence appealed from.
2.To what extent, if the appeal is allowed, the sentence appealed from should be varied.
A primary consideration relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion is the purpose of Crown appeals under s 5D, which ....is 'to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of Courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons'. That is a limiting purpose. It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing Judges. It provides a framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.'

50. And at [43]:
""Other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed. They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation. They are relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion. The guidance afforded to sentencing judges by allowing the appeal should not come at too high a cost in terms of justice to the individual.""

51. In JW v R Spigelman CJ (at [44]-[141]) undertook an extensive review of the law of ""double jeopardy"" in the interpretation of s. 68A. He concluded (at [141]):
""The following propositions emerge from the above analysis:
(i) The words ""double jeopardy"" in s 68A refer to the circumstance that an offender is, subject to the identification of error on the part of the sentencing judge, liable to be sentenced twice.(ii) Section 68A removes from consideration on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal the element of distress and anxiety to which all respondents to a Crown appeal are presumed to be subject.(iii) Section 68A prevents the appellate court exercising its discretion not to intervene on the basis of such distress and anxiety.(iv) Section 68A also prevents the appellate court from reducing the sentence which it otherwise believes to be appropriate on the basis of such distress and anxiety.(v) Section 68A prevents the Court from having regard to the frequency of Crown appeals as a sentencing principle applicable to an individual case by taking either step referred to in (iii) or (iv), or otherwise.""

52. Allsop P agreed with the Chief Justice at [205] and McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ, while taking a different view on some issues, agreed (at [209]) 'with all the Chief Justice has written about the effect of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001'.

53. In Green and Queen v The Queen French CJ, Crennan and Kieffel JJ said (at [26]):
'It is not necessary for this Court to review the correctness of the construction of s 68A in JW. On any view of its operation it does not extinguish the residual discretion'""

55The respondent has adduced evidence of his sadness and disappointment when he heard of the Crown appeal. He says he is sad and disappointed in himself. He spoke of the time that he has spent in custody, the difficulties he has had and his attempts at gaining education. He says that he gets a visitor from his family about once a month. He says that he wants ""to try to be more like my cousins when [he] gets out of gaol"" and explains that his cousins ""work and don't drink or take drugs"". The respondent is involved in an intensive drug and alcohol treatment programme (IDATP) and is trying to learn to read and write. He is also getting lessons in painting and works on his art in his cell. He says ""I would rather do my culture than come back to gaol."" 

56An affidavit of the respondent's solicitor annexes various documents which confirm the respondent's involvement in the IDATP. Another document shows that in January 2013 the respondent was contacted by Corrective Services and told them that he would not apply for parole because he was expecting to be sentenced to gaol ""for some time"". 

57The material is relevant to the exercise of the residual discretion and to the question of the appropriate degree of accumulation and the commencement date of the sentence. The material does not persuade me that the Court should exercise its discretion not to intervene at all to ensure that there is a degree of accumulation and some separate punishment for the robbery offence. However, I am satisfied that discretionary considerations require that the degree of intervention should be moderate. 

RE-SENTENCING

58I agree with counsel for the respondent that the commencement date chosen by Judge Toner (18 December 2012) was an appropriate one. While it is true that the early period of custody was at least partially referable to the revocation of the parole, it is also true that the respondent did not seek parole because of the outstanding sentencing proceedings. Further, he sought to be sentenced on 12 April 2013 but the case was adjourned because his legal representative was forced to withdraw. A transcript of the proceedings on 12 April 2013 records his lawyer as saying ""Mr Booth is saying that he wants to have the matter dealt with today"". The respondent was in custody from 10 February 2012 when he was arrested in relation to the aggravated robbery. An affidavit filed on behalf of the appellant shows that parole was revoked on 2 February 2012 as a result of non-compliance with parole conditions. The material before the sentencing Judge suggested the balance of parole was to expire on 15 August 2013 but the evidence also showed that the respondent did not seek parole because he was awaiting the outcome of the sentencing hearing. 

59The selection by Judge Toner of 18 December 2012 as the commencement date struck an appropriate balance and was in compliance with s 47 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 

60In re-sentencing it is necessary to ensure that there is a greater degree of accumulation and in particular that there is a clear and separate (not concurrent) penalty imposed in respect of count 3. Taking into account the material tendered on re-sentence, in my judgment this should result in an increase in the sentence of 12 months. The outcome of such accumulation would be a total sentence of 7 years and 6 months and total non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. There remains a substantial degree of concurrence. I have taken into account the principles of totality in arriving at this conclusion. As I have said, with the exception of the failure to accumulate at all with respect to count 3, I am in substantial agreement with the approach adopted by Judge Toner. The result of the intervention that I propose will be an adjustment of the proportion between the total sentence and the non-parole period. A greater proportion of the sentence (about 47%) will be spent in gaol. 

61The most appropriate and convenient way to achieve this is by the imposition of an aggregate sentence pursuant to the provisions of s 53A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The proper approach to the imposition of an aggregate sentences is demonstrated by the judgment of Fullerton J in SHR v R [2014] NSWCCA 94: see also R v Nykolyn [2012] NSWCCA 219 per RA Hulme J at [56]-[60], Brown v R [2012] NSWCCA 199 per Grove AJ at [17], [51] and R v RD (supra) at [62]-[66]. 

62For the purpose of s 53A(2) I record that I would have imposed the same individual sentence as imposed by the learned sentencing Judge namely:
(i)Count 1 - a sentence of 4 years
(ii)Count 2 - a sentence of 6 years
(iii)Count 3 - a sentence of 4 years

However, I would have accumulated the sentences to a more substantial degree. Taking into account the principles of totality I would have accumulated the sentence on count 2 by a period of six months on the sentence for count 1 (as did Judge Toner). I would have accumulated the sentence imposed on count 3 by a further twelve months. 

63For the reasons set out in the body of this Judgment, and for the reasons given by Judge Toner, I find that there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2B). It is in the interests of both the respondent and the community that he is given a lengthy period on parole to foster his chances of rehabilitation, to ensure that he does not commit further offences and to assist him in assimilating into the community. 

64The orders that I propose are as follows:
(1)Appeal allowed.

(2)Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court.

(3)In lieu thereof, the respondent is sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 7½ years commencing on 18 December 2012 and expiring on 17 June 2020. There will be a non-parole period of 3½ years commencing on 18 December 2012 and expiring on 17 June 2016. 

(4)The respondent will become eligible for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.

2704669,R v Firebrace [2014] NSWDC 274,"Judgment


	
	Wesley Firebrace is charged with rape. Ms M Knowles, who appears for the Director of Public Prosecutions, is tendering some evidence from a witness. The witness - a man named Shane Williams - was called on the voir dire. He was drinking with Wesley Firebrace on the day that the rape is said to have happened (7 March 2013). Mr Firebrace was arrested four days later, on 11 March 2013. Shane Williams is a relative of Mr Firebrace.
	
	
	Mr Williams said on the voir dire that the accused ""told me he was in trouble"". He said that Mr Firebrace referred to ""that young girl"", saying that ""he's in trouble for that girl or something, and we might have to come to Court for it."" Just before giving that account, he said that Mr Firebrace had said those things to him ""probably two days later or something"".
	
	
	Ms Knowles understandably wants to use the evidence in this way. Wesley Firebrace is said to have committed the offence on 7 March. He is not arrested until 11 March. Before his arrest - that is, about two days after 7 March - he was acknowledging to his relative that he might be in trouble and might have to go to Court. The issue in the case is not whether Wesley Firebrace had sex with the woman who is complaining that she was raped but whether it was consensual or not. Obviously, Ms Knowles wants to rely upon this acknowledgment by Wesley Firebrace before he was arrested that there might be some trouble surrounding the circumstances in which he had sex with the complainant.
	
	
	Ms K Stares, who appears for Wesley Firebrace, objects to the evidence. She is relying on s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). In discussing how the evidence was likely to be tendered, Ms Knowles acknowledged that she would call Mr Williams and ask him about that conversation that he has already acknowledged he had with Wesley Firebrace and when it occurred. If Mr Williams says that it occurred two days later, as he said before, then she has a firm basis for making a submission that Wesley Firebrace has made some kind of admission.
	
	
	However, Mr Williams has said other things about when he had that conversation with Wesley Firebrace. Having acknowledged in the first place that it was ""probably two days later or something,"" he later said that he was not really sure and it ""could have been a week, it could have been four or five days, it could have been three days. I'm not really sure.""
	
	
	Ms Knowles would argue, in part getting around that difficulty, that Mr Williams also said, at first recounting the conversation, that the next thing he knew ""Wes ended up in lockup."" That suggests that the conversation was before he was arrested and is therefore more likely to be an admission.
	
	
	Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides that I “must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice” to the accused.
	
	
	Having said that, I should make this observation about Mr Williams. Ms Knowles called him on the voir dire and applied during his evidence in chief to cross-examine him. Her application for that leave was not opposed by Ms Stares. Ms Knowles relied upon the provision that Mr Williams’ evidence was “unfavourable” to her case. That seemed obvious to me. What also seemed obvious to me, and it may have been something that Ms Knowles also relied upon, I just cannot recollect, is that this proposition is also true of Mr Williams (and I’m quoting from s 38(1)(b)). There was “a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence”.
	
	
	I got the impression that his evidence was vague and evasive and that he was not making a real attempt to answer questions.
	
	
	So we have a situation where either one of two things could happen. Ms Knowles calls Mr Williams and he gives the answer which she anticipates. In that circumstance Ms Stares will cross-examine him about the various other estimates which he has given about when her client said these things, suggesting that they were beyond the time that he knew that he was in trouble. Alternatively, Ms Knowles will call Mr Williams who will not give the answer which she anticipates and she will then apply for leave to cross-examine him in front of the jury, relying upon the fact that he has given his original evidence of the two day estimate as a prior inconsistent statement.
	
	
	Either course means, in my opinion, that Mr Williams as a witness and his evidence will be exposed as quite unreliable. It will be apparent that his answers appear to shift according to what he perceives may or may not be of assistance to Mr Firebrace, a relative of his. (I must say, I make those remarks in his absence and publicly and I acknowledge that he does not personally have an opportunity to say anything about these critical remarks about him. But I need to make these remarks in order to determine the question.)
	
	
	The admission of the tendered evidence would introduce into the trial a dispute over a few lines of evidence said to amount to an admission uttered by a witness who, it seems, is regarded by counsel as unreliable and whom I regard as unreliable. It raises obviously the issue of how reliable his original estimate was.
	
	
	It seems to me that the probative value of the evidence from Mr Williams is not at all high. The danger, however, to Mr Firebrace is that the jury will put too much weight on his original assertion despite the arguments about Mr Williams’ unreliability.
	
	
	There is another danger. That is that the jury may be distracted from what seems to me to be its main task, to determine whether they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of the evidence given by the complainant in this case, supported, as her evidence is, in other ways which the Crown will rely upon.
	
	
	In my opinion, the probative value of the evidence which Ms Knowles seeks to tender is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and I refuse to admit it under s 137 of the Evidence Act.

2704670,R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1078,"ex tempore Judgment

Ruling on admissibility of documents at pages 83 and 1022 of MFI 2


	
	There has been a somewhat discursive debate about the tender of various documents concerning a parallel transaction which had its origins some time around 2002-2003. The transaction has been referred to in argument as the “Nilnav transaction”.
	
	
	I describe the features of the transaction the subject of count 1 of the indictment in R v Dickson; R v Issakidis (No 1) [2014] NSWSC 1068 (the “Neumedix transaction”). The Nilnav transaction is of a similar structure, however the Crown has made some important disclaimers in respect of it. I will not recite all of them, but the most critical is that the Crown accepts that there is no evidence, and it will not assert, that any deductions claimed by Nilnav in respect of depreciation of intellectual property it purchased were, in effect, bogus.
	
	
	The current debate started as an application by the Crown to lead evidence referable to the Nilnav transaction on a coincidence basis (see s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)). It emerged during the course of that debate that the Crown is contending that most of the evidence concerning the Nilnav transaction was admissible in the case against both accused on bases that did not rely on coincidence reasoning. Further, the Crown has refined the form of coincidence notice it seeks to rely upon and has indicated that it may be further refined.
	
	
	Accordingly, the pragmatic position has been reached that at present the Court is not being asked to determine the admissibility of material which solely rests upon coincidence reasoning, although we will need to do so in the very short future. Instead the parties considered the documents identified by the Crown as relevant to the Nilnav transaction and have sought to identify what parts of that material are solely admissible for coincidence purposes, in which case their tender is deferred and whether objection is taken to the balance because it is not admissible for other reasons.
	
	
	This process ultimately led to senior counsel for Mr Dickson objecting to one document which is replicated in two places in the folder of materials which will be marked MFI 2, namely pages 83 and 1022. The document in question is headed “Nilnav HIP Cash Flows – this diagram not to be provided to ATO”. The balance of the document sets out a flow chart which identifies the various entities involved in that transaction and the flow of moneys to and from the various parties. At the bottom of the page there exists a note which reads:
	


“Nilnav must not give documents to which it is not a party to ATO eg assignment from Sherry and Egan to IPOCL. Check all docs before just handing everything to ATO. It can be a serious breach of confidentiality, etc, etc.""


	
	In my view the document is clearly relevant. During the course of argument I was taken to various documents that indicate that the origin of the Neumedix transaction was the Nilnav transaction. In particular the various persons who were communicating about the Neumedix transaction appear to be doing so with some common understanding of what was involved in the Nilnav transaction and using that as a basis for their discussions. In my view it would follow that a document such as this which explains at least some aspect of the Nilnav transaction is relevant to the Crown case.
	
	
	During the course of argument I raised with the parties whether the words “This diagram not to be provided to ATO” should be blanked out in effect by the operation of s 137 because it might be thought that they were prejudicial. The Crown Prosecutor indicated that at this point he cannot identify some fact or matter in the Crown case that is sought to be proved by the inclusion of those words in evidence. However, bearing in mind the additional note to which I have referred, I do not propose to take that course provided that it is made clear by the Crown at an appropriate time that they accept that the words “This diagram not to be provided to ATO” is to be read in light of that note, namely, concerns about confidentiality. If the Crown proposes to take a different course it will need to raise that matter with the Court in advance.
	
	
	Finally, for the sake of completeness, I should note the position of Senior Counsel for Mr Issakidis. His position, as I understand it, was that his client does not object to the tender of material concerning the Nilnav transaction subject to two matters. The first is that he wishes to be heard before there is any determination of whether the Crown can rely on such material by the use of coincidence reasoning. Second, he has stated that the admission of this material, and indeed all material in the case, is subject to a reservation that whether evidence of the acts and declarations of any alleged co-conspirator is evidence against his client must be determined in accordance with what is stated in Ahern v R [1988] HCA 39; 165 CLR 87 at 103-104.
	
	
	Accordingly, pages 83 and 1022 of MFI 2 will be admitted. I note otherwise that the Crown will defer its application for a ruling in respect of the admission of pages 734, 735 and 918-1007 of MFI 2.

		14 June 2016",2014-08-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704676,R v Peterson (No. 5) [2014] NSWSC 1080,"extempore Judgment

1Earlier today, after special hearing under the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW), I found the accused not guilty of the murder of Rafik Makaradi but on the limited evidence available in the special hearing found that he committed the offence of the manslaughter of Rafik Makaradi on 30th May 2012. I am now required under the provisions of the legislation to nominate what is referred to as a limiting term. 

2The provisions of the legislation relevant to this task were summarised by Adamson J in R v Goodridge (No 2) [2012] NSWSC 1180 at [24]-[27] in the following terms: 

A verdict that the Forensic Patient committed the offence charged (s 22(1)(c)) is a ""qualified finding of guilt"" made in the absence of a conviction (s 22(3)(a)). Accordingly, by reason of s 23(1)(a), the court must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.

Section 23(1)(b) of the Act defines limiting term as:

... the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence.

The effect of s 23(1)(b) of the Act is that the court is obliged, when determining a limiting term, to adopt and apply all the statutory and common law principles of sentencing that apply to the sentencing of a person convicted of that offence: R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at [13]. A limiting term is the period beyond which a person cannot be detained for the offence which was the subject of the special hearing: R v Mitchell [1999] NSWCCA 120; 108 A Crim R 85 at [30].

In R v Mailes[2004] NSWCCA 394; 62 NSWLR 181 (Mailes), Dunford J, with whom Adams and Howie JJ agreed, said, at [32] that the purpose of a limiting term:

... is not to punish the person who has not been convicted of any crime, but to ensure that he or she is not detained in custody longer than the maximum the person could have been detained if so convicted following a proper trial ... 

From this I understand that it is no part of my duty today to give any indication about what might have been any appropriate non-parole period. Naturally in a case of manslaughter very seldom, if ever, would it be appropriate not to impose a term of imprisonment and I am satisfied that if this had been a normal trial, rather than a special hearing, no other sentence than a term of full-time custody would have been imposed. 

3It is unnecessary for me to reiterate all of the circumstances of the manslaughter of Mr Makaradi. Those circumstances are fully discussed in the judgment I gave earlier today. It will be necessary however to say something about what is usually referred to as Mr Peterson's subjective circumstances. 

4At the outset it is well to bear in mind that when sentencing any person for the crime of manslaughter the starting point must always be the law's concern for the vindication of human life. The law treats all life as equal and does not inquire into the circumstances or worth of the deceased. 

5It is well known, and I will return to this point, that when sentencing an offender who suffers from mental illness or intellectual disability many of the principles which underpin sentencing law are attenuated, indeed some will have no application. But it is well to bear in mind, given that my finding in relation to manslaughter was based upon the success of the defence of substantial impairment, the decision of R v Blacklidge (unreported, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). In that seminal decision Gleeson CJ said: 

The abnormality of mind substantially impairs the offender's mental responsibility for his or her act but it does not negate such responsibility. The reduction in capacity for self-control which results from the abnormality of mind diminishes the responsibility but does not excuse the act.

6I accept the argument advanced by the Crown Prosecutor that the authorities indicate that any sentence must reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and even in a case where an offender suffers from a serious intellectual disability, like Mr Peterson, particular care must be taken not to allow undue emphasis to be given to the subjective circumstances of the offender. 

7Before dealing with the circumstances of this particular case I think it appropriate that I refer to the well-established principles for sentencing the intellectually disabled. Recently in R v McKnight (No. 4) [2014] NSWSC 1029, I summarised those principles in the following way at [74] to [77]:

There are certain well recognised principles that come into play when sentencing a person suffering from mental illness, especially where as here, the mental illness was a significant cause of the commission of the offence. In such cases, the impairments arising from the mental illness substantially reduce the offender's moral culpability for the offence. 

I am conscious that this offender's criminal liability has been reduced by his reason of his substantial impairment, but his condition continues to have relevance for sentencing purposes. Moral culpability, as distinct from legal liability, is an issue of particular relevance in sentencing (see Chung). Moreover, ""the retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of [a mentally ill] offender and to the needs of the community."" Muldrock v the Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at 139 [54]. Additionally, it is well recognised that general deterrence should ""often be given very little weight"" in the case of the [intellectually disabled] ""because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others"" (R v Mooney (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal (Vic), 21 June 1978). 

The relevance of specific deterrence may also be diminished (R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [41] - 42]).

I recognise that the application of these principles relating to mental illness does not always lead to a lesser sentence than that which would be imposed upon an offender of ordinary capacity. (Veen No. 2 at 476 - 477; R v Engbert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at [71]). Sometimes an offender's mental illness will make him a particular danger to the community. This factor may require a heavier sentence, proportionate to the offending, than that appropriate in the case of an offender of ordinary capacity. Moreover, in a given case, a need for specific deterrence of the offender may have a similar effect. 


8Had I been uninstructed by the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229; (2012) 227A Crim R 217, I would have thought that the effect of s23(1)(b) was really to reduce legal responsibility as opposed to moral culpability, but Johnson J's judgment at [33] makes clear that in determining liability reduced moral culpability is a salient factor. That being so, although I am of the view that the principles most recently discussed in Muldrock continue to apply when sentencing a person with Mr Peterson's disabilities, care needs to be taken not to double count, as it were, and I will take that care. Having said that I adhere to the view I expressed in McKnight that moral culpability is of particular relevance to sentencing. 

9In terms of objective seriousness of the offence I bear in mind that because of his mental disability Mr Peterson so far lost self-control that he subjected Mr Makaradi to a ferocious attack with a wooden bat and inflicted upon him the most severe injuries. At the time of the attack with that weapon Mr Makaradi was a vulnerable person in that, to Mr Peterson's knowledge, he was very heavily intoxicated. I am satisfied that Mr Peterson was not heavily intoxicated. And on the evidence I have accepted from Dr Duflou the attack continued whilst Mr Makaradi was in a prone position on the ground. Clearly this was offending of significant objective seriousness. 

10I turn then to the subjective circumstances of Mr Peterson. He, it must be said, comes from circumstances which, putting aside the commission of this offence, would evoke great sympathy. He was probably born with the mild to moderate intellectual disability from which he still suffers. One should not be misled by the diagnostic label of ""mild to moderate"". There can be no doubt on the evidence I heard, and accepted in the special hearing, that Mr Peterson's disability is a very serious one. It is compounded by the condition of epilepsy from which he suffers and also by the frontal lobe damage which probably results from that epilepsy. His personal life has been tragic. He was abandoned by his parents when he was only two years of age and was raised in an institution where, according to the histories received by the psychiatrists, he was both physically and sexually abused. He left the institution at about the age of seventeen and was for a time reunited with his family but his intellectual disability is such that he has always incapable of participation in the open labour market. His life has been spent as an invalid pensioner, or a disability support pensioner in more modern terminology. 

11Of concern in sentencing him is that a feature of his disability and of his frontal lobe damage is that he has very limited capacity to exercise powers of self-control. I have found that it was a loss of control due to his underlying condition which was the most significant factor accounting for his attack on Mr Makaradi. His criminal record has been tendered and given what I have said about his intellectual disability and his unfortunate social circumstances, the record is not a long one. It does not show a pattern of consistent offending or of resolute disregard of the law. However, of some concern is the nature of the offences on the record. They include malicious injury, common assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and destroying or damaging property. I know nothing of the circumstances of his past offending but what I know of his condition suggests to me that his inability to control himself appropriately probably contributed to it. 

12I record that Mr Peterson, in his unfitness to plead had the advantage of representation by Mr Smith of Counsel and Ms Shaw from the Legal Aid office. On 3rd March 2014, bearing in mind his incapacity to plead, Ms Shaw wrote a very careful letter to her counterpart at the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions suggesting that the outcome of the case was likely to be a finding of manslaughter rather than murder and making submissions that the charge in the indictment should be downgraded. Given Mr Peterson's unfitness it is understandable that the Crown were not in a position to accede to those submissions. Nonetheless, consistently with the position expressed in the letter, the trial has been conducted on the basis, effectively, that had this been a normal trial Mr Peterson would have pleaded guilty to manslaughter, and Mr Smith in the most admirable way has refined the issues, running only those which were germane to reducing his client's legal liability from murder to manslaughter. 

13There are obviously conceptual difficulties in treating the letter of 3rd March as an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter in circumstances where Mr Peterson has been found unfit to plead. On the other hand s 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 permits a court to impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender who was tried on indictment having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence whether by disclosures made pre-trial, during the trial or otherwise. The lesser penalty, of course, may not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offending. In my view s 22A is engaged by the letter of 3 March 2014 and the manner in which Mr Smith conducted the hearing. 

14In the limiting term I am about to nominate I have borne in mind my finding in relation to objective seriousness having regard to the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Blacklidge and I have also had regard to the attenuation of the relevance of denunciation and general deterrence referred to in the cases culminating in Muldrock. It seems to me in the circumstances of this case given the nature of Mr Peterson's illness that specific deterrence still has some part to play as a cause of the manslaughter of Mr Makaradi, as I have said, was his inability to control himself which is part of his disability. Nonetheless some degree of specific deterrence would still have been called for had this been a sentence imposed after a normal trial. 

15I think also that there is some scope, perhaps not very much, in bearing in mind the need to protect the public as his inability to control himself does manifest itself in crimes against the person from time to time. I bear in mind the comments of the majority justices in Veen (No 2) that, although this is a factor which may point more towards a higher sentence than some other factors which arise out of his intellectual disability, any sentence imposed must nonetheless remain proportionate to the crime. 

16I also have regard to his age. He is now 62 years of age. Many of the doctors who have examined him have observed that he looks old for his years, and having seen Mr Peterson in court I think that is an apt comment. It may be that because of his deprived background his life expectancy could be reduced and any term imposed might involve, were he fit to be tried, a large proportion of the years remaining to him. This is a factor that cannot be given much weight, but I bear it in mind. 

17But for the provisions of s 22A had this been a sentence imposed after a normal trial I would have imposed a term of imprisonment of ten years notwithstanding the schedule of other sentences that Mr Smith handed to me, but given what I have said about the facilitation of the administration of justice I will reduce that indication or nomination by twenty per cent. Mr Peterson has been in custody since 31 May 2012 so the limiting term I nominate will be backdated to take account of his previous custody. 

18I record my finding as follows. If the special hearing had been a normal trial of a person fit to be tried and a verdict of guilty of manslaughter had been returned I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment. My best estimate of the term of such a sentence is one of eight years. I nominate a limiting term of eight years then to date from 31 May 2012. It should be pointed out for the benefit of interested members of the public that given his unfitness Mr Peterson's case will be reviewed regularly by the Mental Health Review Tribunal who will monitor his condition and in due course assess when it considers him ready to be released into the community. 

19I make the following orders. 

(1)Under s 24 of the Mental Health (Forensic Procedures) Act I refer Mr Peterson to the Mental Health Review Tribunal in light of the limiting term I have nominated. 

(2)I order that in accordance with the previous order of the Mental Health Review Tribunal he be held in custody in an appropriate correctional centre until further assessment by the Tribunal.

2704678,Mallegowda v Sood (No. 2) [2014] NSWDC 216,"Judgment

1This proceedings consist of a claim and cross-claim, each seeking damages for defamation, brought by members of the Indian community in the Newcastle area. Bozic SC DCJ allocated a 7-day hearing date commencing 18 August 2014 in the defamation list on 28 March 2014. This hearing date was given over the objections of the plaintiff/cross-defendant, who complained of outstanding particulars and answers to interrogatories by the defendants/cross-claimants. 

2The answers to particulars and interrogatories provided after the matter was set down for hearing consisted largely of refusals to answer. This resulted in the plaintiff/cross-defendant filing the notice of motion which first came before me on 20 June and, following an exchange of submissions, was relisted on 1 July 2014. As is set out below, the plaintiff/cross-defendant not only sought orders for answers but orders to vacate the hearing date. 

3The circumstances in which I came to hear this notice of motion were as follows. The plaintiff's notice of motion for further and better answers to interrogatories and particulars, and for vacation of the hearing date of 18 August 2014, was initially sent to the registry, but not processed through the defamation list as the proceedings had been allocated a hearing date. It was eventually filed 19 June 2014, and a copy sent to me by the registry as the appointed trial judge. Given the urgency of an application to vacate the hearing date, I listed this application the following day, on 20 June 2014, on the understanding that argument would not take place on that day but that directions could be made.

4In the notice of motion, the plaintiff sought the following orders:

(1)That the first defendant/cross claimant and second defendant answer the outstanding requests for further and better particulars outlined in the letter dated 24 April 2014 from the plaintiff's solicitors to the defendants' solicitors.

(2)That the first defendant/cross claimant and second defendant answer the outstanding interrogatories referred to in the letter dated 22 April 2014 from the plaintiff's solicitors to the defendants' solicitors.

(3)That the hearing date of 18 August 2014 be vacated.

(4)Costs.

5In accordance with my orders of 20 June 2014, the parties provided me with written submissions as to the interrogatories and particulars arguments. Although I had intended to deal with these matters in chambers by a written judgment sent to the parties, I was unable to do so, in part because the application to vacate the hearing date could not be dealt with in such an informal fashion, and in part because Mr Connell's submissions were of a general nature.

6When the proceedings came before me on 1 July 2014 for argument on the outstanding particulars and interrogatories, Mr Potter, the counsel then appearing, had another concern: his instructing solicitor had been served, either late on Friday or over the weekend, with a supplementary expert's report. In this report, the defendants/cross-claimants' expert changed his position on a vital issue of timing in relation to the sending of certain emails. Mr Potter made an oral application that this report, served late and without leave, should not be able to be relied upon at the trial. 

7The first issue for determination on 1 July was, however, the outstanding issues in the plaintiff's notice of motion. The defendants' written submissions in relation to the request for particulars generally asserted (paragraph 6, answers 2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14; paragraph B answers 2 - 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 28, 30, 31, 38 - 41) that these were not proper requests for particulars, or by a reference to an affidavit, or by the statement that these were matters for evidence. The basis for objection to answering these questions was that these were not proper requests for particulars for the reasons stated by the court in ""Bass v Permanent Trustee"". 

8No citation for this apparent decision was given, but there is a decision Bass v Permanent Trustee (1999) 198 CLR 334. This decision deals with constitutional law issues concerning suits to which the State is a party and whether the State was a ""person"" for the purposes provisions in the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). (This decision is of no assistance in this litigation, although I found the section ""Responding effectively to complex litigation"" at pp 363 - 4 of assistance on case management issues). The defendants/cross-claimants probably intended to refer to Bass v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 343 at [43], where Hunt AJA explained that the obligation to give particulars did not require a party to disclose the evidence upon which he proposed to prove his case. This is no answer to the obligations to provide proper particulars under Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") r 15.4(1) for particulars of the plaintiff's state of mind, which is the principal request.

9Similarly, on the issue of interrogatories, the parties had sent me written submissions in order that I could deal with the issues ""on the papers"" without need for further argument. The letter from the plaintiff's solicitors dated 22 April 2014 at page 65 of the affidavit set out each of the unanswered interrogatories pressed by the plaintiff. The objections were based on claims of lack of relevance, or that the interrogatory was outside the leave granted in the order of 21 February 2014 by Elkaim SC DCJ.

10Elkaim SC DCJ's order on 14 February 2014 (one of a long series) was:

""Leave to the plaintiff to administer interrogatories limited to the defences of truth and comment and the issue of malice as particularised on 19 February 2014 to both defendants.""

11Elkaim SC DCJ did strike out a number of particulars set out in the above two letters dated 19 February, but nevertheless gave leave to interrogate on these other issues. The submission to the contrary was misconceived. 

12Mr Connell's submissions of 23 June 2014 shed little light on why these interrogatories have not been answered, beyond asserting that the plaintiff ""seeks to abuse the indulgence by administering interrogatories going beyond the leave"" (submissions, paragraph 13) and (at paragraph 14) that further interrogatories are ""not necessary"", ""oppressive"", ""a trial by interrogatory"", and ""such over-use of interrogatories in contrary [sic] should be discouraged"", as his clients ""will be giving evidence at trial and will be available for cross examination"". 

13Mr Connell supplied additional written submissions on the morning of the hearing of the argument and, in light of the defendants/cross-claimants' revised expert's report (discussed in more detail below); Mr Potter reduced the number of particulars and interrogatories in dispute. I then heard the parties' oral argument as to the adequacy of answers to particulars and interrogatories. 

14The defendants/cross-claimants were unsuccessful in resisting the orders to provide further and better answers. I made orders in relation to answers, and also in relation to the plaintiff/cross-defendant's application for pre-trial expert evidence in conclave and by joint report, aimed at minimising the impact of the late-served report. I canvassed with the parties whether the giving of reasons and the making of costs orders was appropriate. The parties did not ask for reasons, but asked for leave to provide further submissions (on the next day these proceedings were before the court) on costs. Those submissions were forwarded to the court, but no costs argument was heard on 5 August 2014. The parties did not mention the issue of costs of this argument, presumably due to the imminence of the hearing.

15When making these orders, given the hearing date was so close, and the possibility of further dispute about the answers or the expert reports could not be ignored, I stood over the plaintiff/cross-defendant's Notice of Motion part-heard to 5 August 2014. Both parties were therefore on notice that the application to vacate the hearing date had not gone away just because the argument had been heard and orders made about the expert evidence, and that compliance with these orders was expected. The orders I made were as follows:

(1)No further affidavits, notices of motion or other documents are to be filed without leave of the Court.

(2)First Defendant is to answer plaintiff's interrogatories 26, 32-40, 46-51 in 14 days.

(3)Second Defendant is to answer plaintiff's interrogatories 8-10, 21, 22 and 35-40 in 14 days.

(4)The defendants are to answer plaintiff's request for particulars in 14 days.

(5)The defendants are to provide the comment particulars sought pursuant to r 15.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rule 2005 (NSW) (paragraph F of the Defence).

(6)Pursuant to r 31.4 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), the parties exchange lists of witnesses they propose to call (other than the paries themselves) in chief, along with an outline of the evidence that witness is likely to give, by 1 August 2014. 

(7)The respective experts for the parties are to meet without legal representatives by 11 July 2014, to identify all matters which are agreed between the experts and all remaining areas of disagreement and to provide to the parties a joint report outlining those issues by 25 July 2014.

(8)The plaintiff's Notice of Motion filed on 19 June 2014 is stood over part heard to Friday 1 August 2014 at 9:30am.

(9)Costs of today reserved.

(10)Grant leave to the parties to exchange an outline of submissions concerning costs which will be dealt with on the next occasion.

16Although the date of 1 August 2014 was chosen to suit the convenience of the parties, this date was later found to be inconvenient to counsel for the defendants/cross-claimants, and the Notice of Motion was stood over to 5 August 2014, just under two weeks before the hearing date of 18 August 2014, to suit their counsels' convenience. 

17When the proceedings came before me on 5 August, Mr Dibb appeared for the plaintiff, having received a brief to appear at the hearing in the place of Mr Potter late on the day before. He told me he had received two boxes of material, but that he had ""not yet found"" the answers to interrogatories and particulars inside them. He could not tell me how many witnesses he was calling as he had not yet interviewed them, and would need a week to do so. He was aware a list of 12 witnesses had been sent to the solicitors for the defendants/cross-claimants, but agreed that it was deficient, as were the proposed outlines of evidence which had been served only on 1 and 2 August 2013. 

18Although Mr Dibb conceded he was not yet in a position to say the proceedings were ready for hearing, he said that he was instructed that the plaintiff wanted the hearing to proceed. He was confident that he would be ""up to speed in a couple of weeks"". Unfortunately, the hearing is in a couple of weeks.

19Mr Tobin QC, for the defendants/cross-claimants, said that his clients were ready, and the vacation of the hearing date would result in a significant costs burden to his clients. He asked that the hearing proceed on 18 August, and submitted that a further listing of these proceedings on Wednesday 13 August, to monitor compliance with any outstanding steps would be sufficient to ensure the matter was ready for hearing. If the matter was still not ready on Wednesday 13 August, then what Mr Tobin QC called ""the case management axe"" could fall on the parties. Mr Tobin QC reminded me that both parties were keen for the hearing to take place, as the factual matrix of events was ""a running sore"" in the Indian community in Newcastle, New South Wales.

20These proceedings have a long procedural history and appear to have been conducted with some hostility on both sides. This should not prevent the matter from being ready for hearing, but there are outstanding issues which concern me in my capacity as trial judge:

(a)The defendants/cross-claimants' objections to answers were general and without merit. While answers have been provided, counsel for the plaintiff, who came into the matter yesterday, has not yet read them and cannot tell me if the answers are satisfactory. Copies were not provided to Mr Dibb, or to me, although this would have been an easy way for this issue to be resolved.

(b)The plaintiff/cross-defendant has not properly complied with the order for the provision of a list of witnesses and outlines of evidence. Mr Dibb tells me he will require a week to interview the relevant witnesses, and that this will make a further extension of the timetable for a return date before me on Wednesday 13 August, which is only three days before the hearing is due to start.

(c)There are outstanding issues about the experts' reports and a supplementary joint report will need to be filed. It is hoped that this can be prepared before the hearing. However, on the morning of 6 August 2014, when I was about to hand down judgment at 10 am, I received an email headed ""urgent"" from the solicitors for the plaintiff/cross-defendant raising issues about the timing of a telephone call from a Mr Visweshwariah in relation to the deletion of a gmail account, seeking leave to issue a subpoena urgently. In addition, the serious allegation is made that the defendants have not complied with my orders of 1 July 2014 to send a witness list. While I propose to disregard this extracurial communication, it is of concern to me that the ambit of the expert evidence has been only very recently considered by the parties, apparently only as a result of my making orders for a conclave and joint report. I have marked the correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors as MFI 1 in this application. It is also of concern to me that claims of this kind are made in correspondence to my associate, even though it was sent to the solicitors for the defendants/cross-claimants, and which is contradictory to the statements made by Mr Dibb in court.

(d)These proceedings were set down for hearing for 7 days, the parties having told Bozic SC DCJ that the hearing would take 5 - 7 days. The defendants/cross-claimants have provided witness outlines for 15 witnesses. In addition to the defendants themselves and their expert, three of those witnesses will give evidence on what Mr Tobin QC called ""technical"" matters and three on justification issues, including alleged admissions by the plaintiff. It is hard to know how many witnesses the plaintiff will call as Mr Dibb has not yet commenced to interview them, but prior to his coming into the matter it would appear that the names of 12 witnesses and partial outlines of evidence were served. Mr Tobin QC agreed that there were ""a lot of witnesses"" and that completion of the hearing in 7 or even 10 days might not be possible.

(e)Although these are minor matters, some interlocutory steps remain outstanding, such as the parties' applications in relation to the costs of the particulars and interrogatories, while others have never been brought. For example, the defences and cross-claim plead numerous imputations which have not been the subject of any rulings. These will add to the time taken for the conduct of the hearing. 

21It would be only in the most extreme circumstances that a court would vacate a hearing date where both parties assure me (notwithstanding the fact that one of them has a part-heard application before the court to vacate the hearing date) that they wish the hearing to proceed. The circumstances in which a court would, of its own motion, vacate a hearing date against the wishes of the parties would need to be exceptional. The question is whether that is the appropriate order to be made in the circumstances, having regard to the overriding principles of ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). This requires a careful examination of the pleadings and procedural history, as well as of the correct approach to case management as set out in ss 56 - 62 and 66 of the Civil Procedure Act.

The statement of claim and defences

22These proceedings were commenced by statement of claim filed on 12 November 2012 in the Newcastle registry. The defendants brought a series of applications to strike out the statement of claim and were successful at one point in having the whole claim struck out. A second application to strike out the statement of claim (or alternatively parts thereof) came before me for argument on 12 June 2013.

23On 12 June 2013 I was asked to hear a motion in these proceedings, which was sent to me while they were being case managed by the defamation list judges. I made rulings in relation to the plaintiff's imputations and aggravated damages which resulted in the filing of the current pleading, the third further amended statement of claim: Mallegowda v Sood [2013] NSWDC 98. At that stage, the successive versions of the statement of claim were the only pleadings on the file, but it transpired, during the hearing of this application, that the defendants had, contrary to accepted practice in general and defamation in particular (Buswell v Carles [2012] WASC 509; Scott v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 169 at [8] - [10]), issued a large number of subpoenae, including a further 18 subpoenae which came to light after I hear the pleadings argument. All these subpoenae had been issued in the Newcastle Registry of the Court, although the Practice Note requires defamation proceedings to be conducted in the Sydney Registry. I made orders for the return of these documents.

24Since that time these proceedings have been before the defamation list judges many times. While some of these applications have related to pleadings issue, the principal focus seems to have been continuing complaints from both sides about the issuing of subpoenae, the contempt of court proceedings and assertions of an uncertain but clearly hostile nature in the solicitors' correspondence which is attached to a series of affidavits. I can readily understand why, given this history, these proceedings were set down for hearing while there were outstanding issues, but regrettably the outstanding issues were matters of some importance, as was the question of expert evidence. 

25This brings me to the current form of the pleadings. At all relevant times, whether pleaded satisfactorily or not, the plaintiff has relied upon two publications, namely two comparatively short emails dated 21 and 24 September 2012. The imputations pleaded in the first publication are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff is a false accuser (the entire matter but particularly paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 22, 24 and 25);

(c)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of corrupt or fraudulent conduct in that they misused IAN resources and funds to benefit their own needs (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);

(d)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of misusing his position as IAN treasurer in that Amit Sood collected funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function based upon a false promise to promote their business (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);

(e)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of misusing his position as IAN treasurer in that Amit Sood collected funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function for which Amit Sood did not account to the IAN or the sponsors (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25);

(f)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of forcing out two members of the IAN committee in an attempt to keep their corrupt conduct hidden (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(g)The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood and Amit Karla of misusing public funds (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(h)The plaintiff sends vicious emails in order to sow the seeds of suspicion in the community against Amit Sood and Amit Karla (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(i)The plaintiff is deceiving the members of IAN by trying to cover up his involvement with a group of people who send vicious emails in order to sow the seeds of suspicion in the community against Amit Sood and Amit Karla (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21, 22);

(j)(i) The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of not being a true believer in Lord Ganesha because his actions were so malicious (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24);

(k)(i) The plaintiff falsely accused Amit Sood of maliciously trying to divide the Indian Community in the name of Lord Ganesh Festival (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24);OR(ii) The plaintiff is maliciously trying to divide the Indian Community in the name of Lord Ganesh Festival (the entire matter but specifically paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25);

26The imputations pleaded in relation to the second publication are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff has caused Amit Sood trauma by maliciously responding to his hard work with a vicious brickbat (the entire matter but specifically lines 1-4);

(b)The plaintiff is a villain (the entire matter but specifically lines 19-22); 

(c)The plaintiff sent a slanderous email about Amit Sood (the entire matter but specifically lines 23-24);

(d)The plaintiff has been deceiving the members of IAN by hiding his involvement with a group of people who sent a slanderous email about Amit Sood (the entire matter but specifically lines 23-26).

27The defendants have pleaded defences of justification, contextual justification and a ""Hore-Lacey Plea"".

28The contextual imputations pleaded in the first defendant's defence filed on 12 July 2013) to arise from each of the publications are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of being a fraudster.

(b)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of being corrupt.

(c)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant, while being IAN treasurer, of having conspired with Amit Kalra to defraud IAN.

(d)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of misusing his position as IAN treasurer to dishonestly obtain for himself funds from sponsors of an IAN Independence Day function by deception, namely by giving false promises to promote their business.

(e)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of, while IAN treasurer, fraudulently misappropriating money that he had obtained from sponsors of an Independence Day function on IAN's behalf.

(f)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of, while IAN treasurer, having induced sponsors of an IAN Independence Day function by false promises to promote their business, to provide funds ostensibly to IAN, but which he intended to and did apply to his own use.

(g)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of having conspired with Mr Amit Kalra to sack a committee member of IAN in order to prevent that member from standing in the way of their engaging in continued corrupt conduct.

(h)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of having together with Amit Kalra sacked a committee member of IAN in order to make easy their continuing in corrupt conduct.

(i)The plaintiff falsely accused the first defendant of having, while IAN treasurer, misappropriated cash which he had collected from members for tickets to an IAN function.

(j)The plaintiff made a cowardly attack on the first defendant by making grave allegations of misconduct against the first defendant to members of the first defendant's Indian community while hiding his own identity.

(k)The plaintiff made a malicious attack on the first defendant.

(l)The plaintiff is a person with a malicious character.

(m)The plaintiff, being Indian, by falsely attacking the first defendant, acted in a way calculated to cause suspicion and division within the Indian community.

29There are some differences in the spelling of the names in the imputations set out above, which I assume is as a result of translation issues. Leaving aside the difficulties of pleading the same set of contextual imputations for two publications, these differ from the contextual imputations pleaded by the second defendant in his defence (filed on 27 September 2013) which are as follows:

(a)The plaintiff sent a hoax e-mail to the members of IAN and other persons in the Newcastle Indian community about the first defendant, accusing him of misconduct.

(b)The plaintiff sent a hoax e-mail to the members of IAN and other persons in the Newcastle Indian community about the first defendant.

(c)The plaintiff sent out a malicious and defamatory e-mail about the first defendant under a false name.

(d)The plaintiff acted in a cowardly manner in sending out an e-mail attacking the first defendant under a false name.

30The roles of the case managing judge and the trial judge are different, and indeed there is a tension between them. The case managing judge is concerned to ensure cases are ready for hearing, and as such may take a proactive approach: Sporting Shooters Association of Australia v Judge (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1821. This may include pointing out pleadings or limitation problems, checking that a defendant has been served or ensuring that arguments about pleadings have been raised. The case managing judge's role is to ensure that the trial is ready for hearing. 

31The judge hearing the application enjoys no such case management powers, for the reasons explained by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Bidner v Queensland [2000] QCA 368. A party in litigation may be keeping a pleading or other error made by an opponent as a trump card to play at the trial, or may have deliberately constructed a case in a particular fashion. A trial judge who queries pleadings or complains about poorly conducted proceedings runs the risk of complaints of apprehended bias. I preface my comments on the pleadings on the basis that I would never have raised, or have been able to raise, these issues if I were still the trial judge.

32Without seeking to prejudge the issue, there does seem to be a degree of similarity or overlap between these contextual imputations, as well as a degree of similarity with the plaintiff's imputations, in circumstances where it may have been desirable to determine these issues on an interlocutory level rather than in the time constraints of a trial. Additionally, the same set of contextual imputations is pleaded for both publications. Other than in Burrows v Knightley circumstances (Burrows v Knightley & Nationwide News Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 651) (the basis for which must be specifically pleaded) a plaintiff may not plead one set of imputations for a series of publications, and it is novel for a defendant to do so. Further confusion is added because the defendants have not (unlike the plaintiffs) identified the passages of the respective matters complained of which give rise to the contextual imputations. In addition, the Hore-Lacy imputations are not identified.

33The particulars of truth suffer from the following deficiencies:

(a)The defendants do not identify those particulars relied upon for each of the imputations or contextual imputations, but set out a general narrative in discursive form identical in both pleadings, although different imputations are conveyed about each defendant. I am unaware whether the latest set of particulars addresses this issue.

(b)There is little factual material contained in the particulars of justification in the defence. Almost half of those particulars (see (vii) - (xv)) consists of claims that the plaintiff sent an email on 21 August 2012 (called ""the attacking email""), to which the first defendant had to send ""the refuting email"" ((xvi) and following). Despite having different contextual imputations, the second defendant, in a ""cut and paste"" arrangement, repeats the same generalised particulars.

(c)In the answers to particulars which I ruled upon on 12 June 2014, the defendants have answered most of the plaintiff's requests for particulars concerning the particulars of justification by saying these requests are not proper, or are matters of evidence. That is an unsatisfactory approach to the task of providing particulars in defamation proceedings, where failure to provide adequate particulars has, in jury proceedings, resulted in the aborting of the trial. Mr Tobin QC assures me that these particulars have now been provided and that they are adequate, but Mr Dibb is simply not in a position to do so.

34It is unclear from the particulars of justification appended to the defence what the nature and extent of the evidence at trial will be. An affidavit of Dr Allan Watt, a digital forensics expert, suggests that there will be forensic evidence of some degree of complexity in relation to ""the attacking email"". This evidence appears to relate to the cross-claim, but the central role of ""the attacking email"" in the defences of justification and contextual truth is clear from the particulars of justification in the defence, as is set out above. I have been provided with a joint report from the experts, but the interaction between the expert evidence and the particulars of justification remains unexplained.

The cross-claim

35On 12 July 2013 the first defendant filed a cross-claim in relation to ""the attacking email"" of 21 August 2012. The plaintiff has filed a defence denying publication. No substantive defence is pleaded.

36The imputations pleaded in the cross-claims are as follows:

(a)The cross-claimant is a fraudster (entire MCO, 6)

(b)The cross-claimant being IAN treasurer conspired with Amit Kalra to defraud the IAN (entire MCO, 6 - 9, 13 - 15)

(c)The cross-claimant together with Amit Kalra was guilty of corrupt and fraudulent conduct in that they misused IAN resources and funds to benefit their own needs (entire MCO, 6 - 8)

(d)The cross-claimant, misusing his position as IAN treasurer, dishonestly obtained for himself funds from sponsors of an IAN Independence Day function by deception, namely by giving false promises to promote their business (entire MCO, 6, 9 - 12, 31)

(e)The cross-claimant, while IAN treasurer, fraudulently misappropriated money which he had obtained from sponsors of an Independence Day function of the IAN's behalf (entire MCO, 6, 9 - 11, 31)

(f)The cross-claimant, as IAN treasurer, induced sponsors of an IAN Independence Day function, by false promises to promote their business, to provide funds ostensibly to IAN, but which he intended to and did apply to his own use (entire MCO, 9 - 12)

(g)The cross-claimant misused his position as IAN treasurer in that he collected funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function based on false promises to promote their business (entire MCO, 9, 10)

(h)The cross-claimant misused his position as an IAN treasurer by collecting funds from sponsors of an Independence Day function for which he did not account to IAN or the sponsors (entire MCO, 9 - 11)

(i)The cross-claimant had conspired with Mr Amit Kalra to sack a committee member of IAN in order to prevent that member from standing in the way of their engaging in continued corrupt conduct (entire MCO, 6 - 7, 13 - 15)

(j)The cross-claimant together with Mr Amit Kalra had sacked a committee member of IAN in order to make easy their continuing in corrupt conduct (entire MCO, 6 - 7, 13 - 15) [Note: this imputation is wrongly labelled (i) in the list of imputations].

(k)The cross-claimant while IAN treasurer misappropriated cash which he had collected from members for tickets to an IAN function (entire MCO, 6, 9, 19 - 20). [Note: this imputation is wrongly labelled as (j) in the list of imputations].

(l)The cross-claimant together with Mr Amit Kalra had misused public funds (entire MCO, lines 6 - 8, 27 - 28).

37In addition to the undesirability of assertions that imputations arise from the whole of the matter complained of and the numbering errors for the last four imputations, they have not been the subject of rulings on form or capacity which, given their similarity, may have been an advisable pre-trial step. The particulars of aggravated damages include extensive particulars of malice: cf s 46(3)(b) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW).

The parties' correspondence with the court

38The combative approach that the parties have taken to the litigation has resulted in extensive, and at times intemperate, correspondence being exchanged between the parties. This file has expanded from the usual court file of pleadings to seven large volumes of correspondence, court documents, affidavits, documents tendered on applications, judgments and miscellaneous material, such as the plaintiff's complaint to the Hunter New England Health District concerning unauthorised access to his medical health records and applications by both parties in relation to the many subpoenae issued both in this court and the District Court at Newcastle.

39It is unclear how much of this material is to be put before the court. I asked Mr Dibb about whether the Hunter New England Health District documentation was likely to be relied upon. He indicated that he was aware of this issue, and that it could well be tendered, but that he was not yet in a position to say. 

40The nature and extent of these documents are of relevance only to one issue: the length of the trial. The plaintiff's failure to file adequate outlines of evidence means that the relevance of this documentation, and its capacity to impinge upon the trial's length, are unknown. 

The plaintiff's part-heard application to vacate the hearing date

41Mr Dibb has not sought to rely upon his client's part-heard application to vacate the hearing date. He did not ask me to dismiss the notice of motion; I assume he wishes to preserve his position, in relation to the other orders sought, in the event that the particulars and answers to interrogatories are insufficient.

42Mr Tobin QC informed me that Mr Potter had indicated that the application to vacate would not be pressed in relation to the outstanding proceedings in the Supreme Court for contempt of court before the Prothonotary or, indeed, at all. However, the basis of the application in the Notice of Motion, as I understood it, was that it related to the readiness of these proceedings for hearing. The application to vacate appears to remain on foot, at least insofar as the particulars and interrogatories are concerned. Mr Tobin QC did not raise this issue of what was to happen to the notice of motion (although, given his reference to ""the case management axe"", I assume he expected it to be stood over to August `3), and I was reluctant to raise it with Mr Dibb in those circumstances. This is one of the difficulties a trial judge has when confronted with cases that are not ready for hearing, where a proactive role in case management really is not appropriate.

43Mr Dibb has not yet read the answers to particulars or interrogatories. He does not know which witnesses he will be calling. He needs another week in order to get on top of the matter and interview the witnesses so that he can comply with the orders I made on 1 July 2014. This means he cannot tell me how long the case will take. These are confident views for a counsel who has come into the case for less than a day, and who has not read (or even found) the relevant documents for the application before the court on 5 August. The solicitor with conduct of the matter, who I am informed has been on holidays, is not in court to assist. Mr Tobin QC has been of very great assistance, but his assistance unfortunately comes too late.

Adjournments of hearings and the overriding purpose in the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)

44Section 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides:

""56 Overriding purpose

(1) The overriding purpose of this Act and of rules of court, in their application to civil proceedings, is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings.

(2) The court must seek to give effect to the overriding purpose when it exercises any power given to it by this Act or by rules of court and when it interprets any provision of this Act or of any such rule.

(3) A party to civil proceedings is under a duty to assist the court to further the overriding purpose and, to that effect, to participate in the processes of the court and to comply with directions and orders of the court.

(4) Each of the following persons must not, by their conduct, cause a party to civil proceedings to be put in breach of a duty identified in subsection (3):

(a) any solicitor or barrister representing the party in the proceedings,

(b) any person with a relevant interest in the proceedings commenced by the party.

(5) The court may take into account any failure to comply with subsection (3) or (4) in exercising a discretion with respect to costs.

(6) For the purposes of this section, a person has a ""relevant interest"" in civil proceedings if the person:

(a) provides financial assistance or other assistance to any party to the proceedings, and

(b) exercises any direct or indirect control, or any influence, over the conduct of the proceedings or the conduct of a party in respect of the proceedings.

Note: Examples of persons who may have a relevant interest are insurers and persons who fund litigation.""

45The role of case management is set out in s 57. The checklist of matters for a court to consider, in the dictates of justice, is set out in s 58 which provides:

""58 Court to follow dictates of justice

(1) In deciding:

(a) whether to make any order or direction for the management of proceedings, including:

(i) any order for the amendment of a document, and

(ii) any order granting an adjournment or stay of proceedings, and

(iii) any other order of a procedural nature, and

(iv) any direction under Division 2, and

(b) the terms in which any such order or direction is to be made,

the court must seek to act in accordance with the dictates of justice.

(2) For the purpose of determining what are the dictates of justice in a particular case, the court:

(a) must have regard to the provisions of sections 56 and 57, and

(b) may have regard to the following matters to the extent to which it considers them relevant:

(i) the degree of difficulty or complexity to which the issues in the proceedings give rise,

(ii) the degree of expedition with which the respective parties have approached the proceedings, including the degree to which they have been timely in their interlocutory activities,

(iii) the degree to which any lack of expedition in approaching the proceedings has arisen from circumstances beyond the control of the respective parties,

(iv) the degree to which the respective parties have fulfilled their duties under section 56 (3),

(v) the use that any party has made, or could have made, of any opportunity that has been available to the party in the course of the proceedings, whether under rules of court, the practice of the court or any direction of a procedural nature given in the proceedings,

(vi) the degree of injustice that would be suffered by the respective parties as a consequence of any order or direction,

(vii) such other matters as the court considers relevant in the circumstances of the case."" 

46Mr Tobin QC and Mr Dibb both assert that injustice will occur if these proceedings are not heard (s 58(2)(b)(vi)). Neither party referred to the other matters in sub-sections 58(2)(b)(i) - (v) in response to the concerns I expressed. In my view, these concerns are as follows:

(a)As to (i), both parties agree that the expert evidence is complex, and additionally there are unresolved issues in relation to the pleadings and evidence which will render the hearing of the proceedings difficult.

(b)As to (ii), while expedition is desirable, undue haste is not. These proceedings should not have been set down while there were unresolved issues about particulars, interrogatories, expert evidence, witnesses and the form and content of the pleadings.

(c)As to (iii), the lack of expedition with which these proceedings have been approached by both parties since the hearing date was allocated is a significant problem.

(d)As to (iv), neither party has fulfilled his or their duties under s 56(3). It should not be left to the trial judge to hear a series of interlocutory applications of the kind that should be heard in the defamation list. To do so invites problems of the kind that have led appellate courts to criticise judges at first instance: Bidner v Queensland, supra.

(e)As to (v), both parties should have dealt with these issues in the defamation list rather than bringing such applications before the trial judge.

(f)As to (vi), I acknowledge the desirability of the hearing proceeding. However, the intangible prejudice that may arise to either party from a hasty consideration of the very serious allegations made by both parties should also be given weight.

47Sections 56 and 58 contemplate that proceedings regularly fixed for hearing should commence on the hearing date and proceed until they are finished. The evils of part-heard trials are well-known. However, the court has a specific power under s 66 to adjourn the hearing of a matter in appropriate circumstances, providing the discretionary power is exercised in accordance with the overriding purpose of s 56 and in accordance with the dictates of justice in s 68. 

48While these proceedings are a good example of the dangers of setting proceedings down when there are outstanding issues and arguments, the parties' conduct of the proceedings, rather than case management by the court, is responsible for this. The judges case managing the proceedings did all they could, but all they could do was to respond to the parties' applications. The 19 June motion was specially listed by me the following day, in order to avert the hearing date being compromised, but until the motion was listed, there was nothing I could do in my capacity as trial judge. The position of the judge in the common law system ( as to which see Lord Thomas, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, ""Reshaping Justice"", 3 March 2014), although somewhat strengthened by the provisions of ss 56 - 58, remains responsive rather than proactive. The responsibility for adequate preparation of proceedings lies with the parties, not the court. 

49However, the need for ""flexibility of procedural rules"" in complex litigation, including the use of ""novel procedures"" was considered appropriate by Kirby J when reviewing the case management which had occurred in Bass v Permanent Trustee, supra (at 367). Kirby J noted that, to those ""brought up in the common law system of pleading"", these new procedures appeared ""a trifle untidy and potentially risky"" (at 367 - 8), but that the new and flexible procedures increasingly a part of modern litigation meant that courts should take a constructive approach to case management, notwithstanding the apparent shift from common law principles, in the interests of ensuring that justice really is done between the parties. These remarks reinforce the importance of case management principles in litigation, even if that includes taking the novel step of vacating a hearing date where the trial judge, if not the parties, is of the view that the proceedings are not ready for hearing.

50Taking all of the above matters into account, I am satisfied that the exceptional circumstances required for a court to adjourn proceedings, notwithstanding the views of the parties, have been made out in the present circumstances. Although Mr Tobin QC and Mr Dibb seek a further opportunity for compliance and ask the court to stand these proceedings over once more, in the hope that the parties will be ready on the next occasion, this would simply result in the incurring of further costs by both parties. The case should have been ready when it was set down, or when the answers were provided in April, or when plaintiff filed his motion on 19 June and the matter could have been dealt with in chambers, or when the matter had to be before me on 1 July. It is better to cut the Gordian knot now than to give a further date so close to the hearing to see if the case is ready. The risk is that starting proceedings beset with so many uncertainties is too great, in circumstances where the prejudice pointed to by Mr Tobin QC is essentially the issue of costs.

51As the application to vacate has effectively been made by the court, I accept the submissions of the parties that the costs thrown away should be reserved. These proceedings will be listed for directions in the defamation list, and in my view should be referred to the List Judge for a fresh hearing date only where the legal representatives for both parties provide a statement to the court confirming that these proceedings are ready for hearing, and that no outstanding interlocutory steps remain. It is to be hoped that any interlocutory arguments concerning, for example, the Hore-Lacey pleading, the contextual imputations or cross-claim imputations, should be considered prior to the trial. If not, challenges to these pleadings at the trial, if of the kind that should have been dealt with in the defamation list, may not be well received by the trial judge (although I express no concluded view on this matter). 

52I do not consider myself part-heard in any application in these proceedings apart from the costs in relation to the interrogatories and particulars arguments. However, there is no reason why that application, for which there are written submissions, could not be heard by another judge. I do not consider myself part-heard for the hearing, or to have any continuing role as trial judge, after handing down this judgment.

		11 December 2014",2014-08-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704680,R v Peterson (No. 4) [2014] NSWSC 1056,"Judgment

1These reasons are my determination of the question of whether the accused murdered Rafik Makaradi sometime between 6 pm on 30th May 2012 and 6 am 31st May 2012 at Lethbridge Park, or, in the alternative, committed the offence of manslaughter.

Introduction

2On 26th July 2013, Bellew J found that the accused was unfit to stand trial (R v Peterson [2013] NSW 1002). Upon referral, on 2nd October 2013 the Mental Health Review Tribunal determined that the accused would not become fit to be tried during the period of 12 months following Bellew J's finding. This finding was renewed on 11th April 2014 following the Tribunal's review of the accused as required by s 46 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (the Act). 

3After Tribunal's first determination, the Director of Public Prosecutions advised the court that he intended to proceed with the charges under s 19(1)(a) of the Act. The Court fixed the required special hearing to commence on 21st July 2014 before me. Neither party elected for a jury hearing. On 22nd July 2014 I ruled that I had the power to conduct the special hearing beyond 26th July 2014, the anniversary of the making of the finding of unfitness by Bellew J (R v Peterson (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 966).

Special hearing

4 At the commencement of the special hearing, the accused was arraigned on an indictment presented in the following terms:

On the 2nd of July 2014, the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of her Majesty charges that John Francis Peterson between 6 p.m. on 30th May 2012 and 6 a.m. on 31st May 2012 at Lethbridge Park in the State of New South Wales did murder Rafik Makaradi.

S 18(1)(a) Crimes Act 1900

Law Part Code: 2

Signed: C. Maxwell Crown Prosecutor on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions.

I caused a plea of not guilty to be recorded in accordance with the provisions of s 20 of the Act. The Act requires an accused person to be legally represented; his unfitness is ""presumed not to be an impediment to the person's representation"". Mr C Smith of Counsel appeared for the accused. In opening Mr Smith refined the issues to be determined by making five points which I summarise as follows: 

(1)There is no real issue that the accused, at the time of his conduct intended to cause the deceased grievous bodily harm; 

(2)There is no issue that the act of the accused caused Mr Makaradi's death;

(3)The evidence admitted at the hearing may properly raise for my consideration the partial defences of manslaughter by provocation and excessive self-defence;

(4)But the main issue would be substantial impairment under s 23A Crimes Act 1900; 

(5)The main thrust of the case for the accused is that my verdict should be that the accused is not guilty of murder, but on the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence of manslaughter (s 22 of the Act).

5The main thrust of the Crown case was that at some time either late in the evening of 30th May or in the early hours of 31st May, the accused bludgeoned his friend, Mr Makaradi to death with what appears to be a wooden table leg fashioned into a bat by the application of tape to one end, like a handle. The killing occurred in the living room of the accused's home.

Statement of general principles

6Before proceeding further with my reasons, I record that my determination must include the principles of law I will apply and the findings of fact on which I rely. I think it appropriate to commence with a short statement of some general legal principles germane to this case. It may be convenient, however, to identify the principles applicable to provocation, excessive self -defence, and substantial impairment later when discussing the evidence relevant to those matters.

7The basis of Bellew J's finding that the accused was unfit to plead was his undoubted mild to moderate intellectual disability. Amongst other things, his Honour accepted that this condition compromised the accused in his capacity to give instructions to counsel because of his comprehension difficulties, difficulties with hearing and problems with communication (at [22]). As I understand his Honour's judgment, he accepted evidence that ""although the accused was able to provide an account of his version of events, there were significant concerns regarding his ability to instruct counsel, to make out his defence and to decide the material upon which his defence would rely"". He would be unable to make informed decisions about what best to do in his own defence ([14]).

8In these circumstances I remind myself that the purpose of a special hearing is to ensure that the accused is not prejudiced any more than his unfitness already may do. Moreover, the prosecution representing the community has an interest in seeing that justice be done by being in a position to proceed with the case against the accused, who himself is given the opportunity of being found not guilty (in which event the charge will cease to hang over his head) (Subramaniam v The Queen (2004) 79 ALJR 116). I will keep in mind what the Act describes as the limited evidence available. In this particular case, it seems that I should remember that ""the accused ... may have been unable to give evidence, or unable, by reason of his mental unfitness to give adequate instructions to his lawyers concerning the calling of witnesses who might assist his case, or, as to matters on which cross-examination could be based"".

9Most importantly, my duty ""is confined to deciding whether on the limited evidence available, the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence charged"". 

10If I find him not guilty of the offence charged, or of any available alternative charge, he will be released from custody back into the community. Any further treatment he requires will be given outside the criminal justice system.

11On the other hand, if I find that the accused committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, I must, in due course, indicate whether, had this been a normal trial of criminal proceedings, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment; and if so I must nominate my best estimate of the sentence I would have considered appropriate. This is referred to as the limiting term, which represents the maximum time the accused may be held in custody for the offence. 

12The presumption of innocence is the most critical part of the criminal justice system. The accused is presumed to be innocent of the offence of murder unless, and until, the Crown persuades me beyond reasonable doubt that he committed the offence. The partial defence of substantial impairment is a central issue in these proceedings. The accused carries the onus of actually persuading me of the partial defence. But it is sufficient if he proves it on the balance of probabilities, that is that he establishes the elements of the defence as more likely than not.

13To find that the accused committed the offence of murder, I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused caused Mr Makaradi's death by voluntarily striking him a number of times with the bat, neither in self defence nor under provocation, intending either to kill him or inflict really serious personal injury. As I have said, there is no real issue that the accused intended to inflict really serious personal injury. There is no issue that the accused caused Mr Makaradi's death, or that his actions were voluntary in the relevant sense. The real issue for me to decide, if fairly raised on the evidence, is have the Crown negatived self defence on the one hand, and provocation on the other, beyond reasonable doubt. As I have said I will deal with the elements of self-defence, provocation and substantial impairment later.

14I bear in mind that in every criminal trial an accused person may or may not choose to give evidence. Here, the accused has not given evidence. There is no obligation upon him to do so. He is entitled to say nothing and make the Crown prove its case to the high standard of beyond reasonable doubt. I will not use his decision not to give evidence in any way against him. It is not an admission of guilt, or a matter capable of founding an adverse inference; nor may I speculate about what he might have said. Moreover, as this is a special hearing, I bear in mind that an unfit person may not be capable of making a reasoned decision about whether or not to give evidence and this is one sense in which the evidence at a special hearing is properly referred to as ""limited"". 

15Much expert evidence has been called in the case orally and in report form. An expert, of course, is entitled to express opinions based upon his or her specialised knowledge. The value of those opinions is very much dependant upon whether the facts assumed for the purpose of expressing the opinion are sufficiently like the facts as I find them to be. I am not obliged to accept the opinion of any expert. Like other witnesses, I may reject the evidence especially where the facts upon which the opinion is based do not accord with the facts as I find them to be.

16In any event, there was very little difference of opinion between the experts; rather they were in substantial agreement about the only issue to which their evidence now goes. 

17The only issue to which the expert evidence goes is whether at the time he struck Mr Makaradi the accused was suffering from a substantial impairment. I ought not reject it except for good reason.

18The expert evidence of Dr Duflou about the cause and mechanism of death was not seriously challenged. On the same basis, I should not reject it except for good reason. 

19Each of the experts who gave evidence about the substantial impairment issue recounted the history received from the accused on which the expert relied to form his or her opinion. That material was admitted for that purpose despite the fact it is hearsay. However, the material is in and I am entitled to rely upon it, not merely as statements made to the expert upon which to evaluate his or her opinion, but also as evidence of the truth of the facts contained in those statements. I bear in mind that as hearsay the statements may be unreliable. Moreover, they were not tested by cross-examination and for that additional reason might be unreliable. However, the accounts given by the accused to the experts may well be of value unless the Crown persuades me that they could not possibly be true versions.

The accused's intention

20The first question is whether the accused in striking Mr Makaradi intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. This means really serious personal injury. Intent and intention are ordinary words, the question is really by striking Mr Makaradi as he did, did the accused mean to cause really serious personal injury.

21Intention is a matter ordinarily provable only by circumstantial evidence. In a criminal case, this means I must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt from all the circumstances established by the evidence I find acceptable that the only rational inference available is that the accused meant to inflict really serious personal injury, in this case, to Mr Makaradi. There must be no reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence available. 

22In reasoning inferentially, I am entitled, not obliged, to draw natural inferences arising from the facts themselves. An example commonly given is that if a person strikes another on the head with a hammer it is easy to infer that the first person meant to inflict really serious injury. This is clearly a similar case.

23On the morning of 31st May 2012, the accused attended the home of some other friends and informed them that he had killed his friend, Mr Makaradi. What he said exactly is relevant to some issues and I will return to it. After his report, one of his friends, Mr Hannan, took the key to the accused's place and went there. He saw Mr Makaradi lying in a pool of blood in the living room apparently dead. Mr Hannan rang triple 0 and, with his wife, persuaded the accused to accompany them to the police station.

24Photographs taken later by crime scene officers depict the scene as described by Mr Hannan. There was a lot of blood. The blood is splashed, or splattered over the living room walls and furniture. Investigating police also recovered the bat fashioned from the table leg with tape wrapped around one end. It too, had blood marks on it.

25Dr Duflou, a specialist forensic pathologist examined the body of the deceased at the crime scene and by way of autopsy. His autopsy report was admitted as Exhibit C. In oral evidence (114.5T) he said that the main injuries to the body were to the head and to the left leg. The head injuries were almost exclusively to the left side of the head. He said:

There was massive injury with associated deformity of the head as a result of blunt forced application to the head. 

There was very wide-spread and overlapping fracturing of the skull to such an extent that the expert was unable to separate, or identify the consequences of separate blows (115.5T). He thought the time of death was closer to 9:00pm on 30th than 9:00am on 31st.

26On autopsy, Mr Makaradi's brain was found to be extensively lacerated on the left side producing bleeding over the surface of the brain. Subsequent examination by a neuropathologist demonstrated extensive traumatic brain injury (116.20T). There was also evidence of a prior stroke, which did not contribute to death. It was not possible for Dr Duflou to be certain, but the ""very, very extensive skull fracturing"" (117.20T) suggested more than two blows. His best estimate was of four blows to the head. 

27There were four discrete blows to the left leg identifiable from separate bruises consistent with the bat. One of the blows to the leg resulted in a fracture of the fibula or ""the narrow shin bone which is on the outside of the shin"" (116.50T).

28Dr Duflou was of the opinion that because of the severity of the skull fracturing, the blows causing it were likely to have been inflicted when Mr Makaradi's head was on the ground. He could not exclude the hypothesis that some initial blows were struck when Mr Makaradi was erect and subsequent blows after he fell. Dr Duflou regarded this as an ""entirely reasonable"" scenario (120.45T).

29I regard it as having been established by acceptable evidence that the accused attacked Mr Makaradi with the bat whilst the latter was standing erect. It may well be that the first blows were struck to the leg causing him to fall when the shin bone fractured and that the head blows were struck after he fell to the floor. In all probability, 8 blows were struck in a single series delivered in rapid succession. From these circumstances, I am satisfied that the only rational inference available is that when the accused struck Mr Makaradi, he intended to inflict really serious injury upon him.

30Subject to self defence, provocation, and substantial impairment, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved all of the elements of murder.

Self-Defence

31A person is not criminally responsible for what would otherwise be murder if the person acts in self-defence. The Crown has the legal obligation of negativing self-defence where it arises on the evidence. In a case of murder, self-defence may be either a complete or partial defence. In the present case, if it arises, it is not said to be a complete defence. Mr Smith accepts that the assault of Mr Makaradi involved excessive force. In this context only s 421 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is invoked. 

32Had this been a hearing before a jury, my primary obligation would have been to identify the real issues for the jury and explain to them only so much of the criminal law as is relevant to the resolution of those issues. Bearing this in mind, it is sufficient that I focus on s 421.

33Ordinarily, there are two limbs to self-defence. The first necessary condition is that the accused believed bludgeoning Mr Makaradi was necessary to defend himself. The second is that the bludgeoning was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them. In a murder case, self-defence operates as a partial defence, reducing murder to manslaughter where the first condition is not negatived, but the second is. Given the issues in the present case it is sufficient for me to consider the first condition only.

34As I think Mr Smith acknowledged, however, there is a threshold issue about whether the question of self-defence arises at all in the present case.

35The Crown submitted that self-defence does not arise.

36The only matter which in any way has anything of the flavour of self-defence about it arises out of Court statements by the accused that Mr Makaradi hit or punched him first. I bear in mind the warning I have given myself about the potential unreliability of hearsay evidence of this type.

37After he told Mr Hannan that he had killed his friend the accused said ""He was hitting me in the head so I hit him with the bat"" (19.50T). He told Mr Hannan's wife, Ms Mata:

We were drinking and I asked my friend to stay over for the night cause he was drunk. Ralph turned around and started to hit me so I started to hit Ralph (26.30T).

He told Ms Mata's daughter ""I've done something wrong"" (29.40T). He gave a similar account as that given to her mother. He said that his friend ""started to punch me in the face and mouth"" and ""I picked up the bat and hit him"" (29.40 -.45T).

38Similar accounts were given to the various experts qualified to provide opinions in relation to his fitness to be tried and the substantial impairment issue. For instance, he told Dr Allnutt that he and Mr Makaradi were drinking at his home. Mr Makaradi suddenly punched him in the face. He could not explain why he got the bat. He said ""I don't know why"", ""he hit me first"" (Exhibit A.2, page 2). Dr Furst received a similar account. The accused told him ""I don't know why I hit him. I was upset because he hit me first"" (Exhibit 2, page 3). It is unnecessary to multiply references to the reports.

39Bearing in mind the Crown's onus, the potential unreliability of self-serving, out of court statements, and the limited nature of the evidence because of the accused's disability I cannot say the accused's account of the deceased striking the first blow is not possibly true.

40But it does not follow from this that self-defence fairly arises on the evidence. There is nothing in any of the evidence I have recounted that lays a foundation for finding that the accused genuinely believed that bludgeoning Mr Makaradi was necessary to defend himself, always accepting that the Crown must negative this proposition. The statement that ""he hit me first"" is redolent of retaliation not defence. Likewise the statement to the younger Ms Mata ""I did something wrong"" is not consistent with justification, even allowing for the limited understanding of the accused.

41If I were wrong to say that self-defence does not arise on the evidence, I wish to record that in any event I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown have negatived any reasonable possibility that the accused believed what he did was necessary to defend himself. To put it another way, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not genuinely believe that what he did was necessary to defend himself. 

42Other evidence that I have not so far recounted establishes that it was in the nature of the relationship between the accused and Mr Makaradi that when they had been drinking together they would sometimes fight and come to blows. Both Ms Wilson and Mr Birks gave evidence of an occasion sometime prior to 31st May 2012 when the accused and Mr Makaradi were fighting about who owned what was left in a bottle of whiskey. They disagree about when this occurred relative to the killing of Mr Makaradi, but that is a matter of no consequence.

43A Mr Reeves gave evidence that on one occasion he witnessed the accused and the deceased arguing and pushing and shoving each other. No punches were involved (41.30T). And Mr Sells, the owner of a bottleshop where they occasionally bought liquor, recalled an occasion when Mr Makaradi and the accused were approaching his shop and Mr Makaradi was yelling abuse at the accused before punching him 3 times in the face (43.35T). The accused did not retaliate or react in any way. Mr Sells ejected them from the shop. 

44Dr Stark, Director, Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit, NSW Police, examined the accused on 31st May 2012 at Mt Druitt Police Station. She found no evidence of injury of any kind about the face of the accused. This did not exclude the possibility that Mr Makaradi punched the accused (106.25T, 108.5T; 109.40T), but it tended to exclude a punch of sufficient force to knock him down, as the accused claimed. 

45Taking this evidence together with the evidence I have referred to above, including that it was in the nature of their relationship that they would sometimes fight and come to blows, I am satisfied that sometimes one would get the better of the other, but on no prior occasion had the accused been unable to handle himself; it had never been necessary for him to resort to the use of a weapon. Moreover, if Mr Makaradi struck him, the possibility of which I cannot exclude, it did not involve sufficient force to inflict any actual injury. From all of these circumstances, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did not genuinely believe what he did was necessary to defend himself. I am equally satisfied that he attacked Mr Makaradi in retaliation as a result of a loss of control.

Provocation

46The present case is not covered by the amendments to s 23 of the Crimes Act effected by the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014 (NSW) because the offence against Mr Makaradi was committed before the commencement of those provisions on 13th June 2014. (S 23(9) Crimes Act). Under the former 23 which did apply, provocation operated only as a partial defence. Again, it was for the Crown to satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was not provoked. If the Crown fail in that endeavour the accused is not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

47The partial defence of provocation has two elements. An act causing death is done under provocation where:

(a)the act or omission is a result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by conduct of the deceased (towards or affecting the accused); and 

(b)that conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased.

48It's not necessary that the conduct of the deceased occur immediately before the act of the accused. In the present case the only potential conduct is the blow of Mr Makaradi.

49Given my findings that the possibility that Mr Makaradi struck the accused immediately before he lost control and bludgeoned him cannot be reasonably excluded, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown have excluded the first element. It is necessary therefore to consider the second element.

50The question then is whether Mr Makaradi punching the accused was not such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self control as to have formed an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Makaradi.

51In dealing with this element, it is important to bear in mind that an ordinary person is one who has the minimum powers of self-control expected of an ordinary citizen who is sober and of the same age and consequent level of maturity of the accused. As will become obvious when I deal with substantial impairment, the accused does not have the minimum powers of self-control expected of an ordinary citizen within the meaning of the Act. His subjective susceptibility arising from his mental disability must be put to one side for the purpose of assessing the defence of provocation. Viewed from the largely objective standpoint of the ""ordinary person"", the response of the accused whether it was to the punch or to Mr Makaradi's decision to go home was an extraordinary one viewed against the provocative force of those events. In my judgment, no ordinary person in the position of the accused could have so far lost self-control by virtue of a punch insufficient to cause injury, and a decision to leave the accused's place and go home, to form the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Mr Makaradi by bludgeoning him with the bat eight times in rapid succession. This was really a deliberate act of retaliation by the accused and I am satisfied that the Crown have excluded this second element of provocation beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the accused is not entitled to have a finding that he committed the offence of murder reduced to manslaughter on this score. 

Substantial impairment

52The partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind is established by the provisions of s 23A Crimes Act 1900. To make good to the defence it is necessary for the accused to prove that it is more likely than not that:

(a)At the time he bludgeoned Mr Makaradi the accused's capacity to understand events, or to judge whether his actions were right or wrong, or to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a pre-existing mental or physiological condition; and

(b)The impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 

Both matters must be established by the accused. The first element is a mere question of fact to be decided on all of the evidence including the expert opinion of the qualified psychiatrists and clinical neuropsychologists. The second aspect requires me to make a value judgment. It is not permissible for me to defer to the opinions of experts, rather the second question must be determined by the application of the standards of ordinary, well-informed members of the community. Moreover, in deciding the second question, I am to disregard the effects of any self-induced intoxication.

53In the context of the first question, substantial means more than trivial; real, not fanciful; of substance. 

54I also record for the purpose of this defence that I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Makaradi probably hit the accused, before the accused attacked him. In arriving at this conclusion I have borne in mind what I said at [22] about out of court statements of the accused, and their potential unreliability. But I also bear in mind the disadvantage that the accused suffers having regard to his mental disability, including his difficulty in making a rational decision about whether or not to give evidence. I have heard evidence that his intellectual disability does not preclude him from lying if it suited him. Reconsidering the evidence in the light of these considerations, I remain of the view that Mr Makaradi probably ""started it"" by punching the accused and telling him he was leaving. The first three people the accused saw were Mr Hannan and the two Ms Matas. He told each of them that Mr Makaradi hit or punched him. In the telling, he did not hide that he had beaten Mr Makaradi with his bat. In addition to the evidence I have recounted at [40] and [41], the accused told Dr Stark, the Director of Clinical Forensic Medicine for the New South Wales police that Mr Makaradi punched him in the face (106.25T). As I have said that examination took place on 31st May. The point is, that from the earliest accounts given by him, and throughout, the accused has consistently said that Mr Makaradi hit him first. Notwithstanding his ability to confabulate, the consistency of the story in one who suffers from his difficulties is to my mind a telling point.

55Further, the contextual or relationship evidence provided by Ms Wilson, Mr Birks, Mr Sells and Mr Reeves makes it likely that such an event could have occurred. And I am satisfied that it did. 

56The psychiatrists, Dr Allnutt, and Dr Furst, and the clinical neuropsychologists, Dr Hepner and Dr Pulman all agree, from their different standpoints, that Mr Peterson has an underlying condition. Dr Allnutt, in his in his report of 23rd February 2014 described the accused as suffering from an intellectual disability on the lower end of the mild range possibly in the moderate range. He said that as a consequence of his mental disability he has ""an abnormality of mind"" that impaired executive functioning and produced difficulties with speed of thought processing, inflexibility of thinking, problems with attention, and working memory.

57In oral testimony he said (at 48.49T):

I believe he had an abnormality of mind arising out of an underlying condition. That underlying condition being a combination of two things, intellectual disability, which is a developmental lifelong condition and executive dysfunction caused by frontal lobe damage which was in my view more recent.

He understood the neuropsychological evidence to be consistent with that diagnosis. It should also be added that the accused has a long history of epilepsy which is unmedicated. He has frequent seizures which may be related to the frontal lobe damage. Dr Allnutt said seizures could cause brief periods of a lack of oxygen which could cause brain damage (49.15T).

58Dr Furst's opinion was similar (Exhibit 2 page 8). Dr Furst also said, in his oral testimony at (125.15T), that the underlying condition was the combination of the intellectual disability and a broader cognitive impairment resulting from the frontal lobe damage. 

59Dr Pulman, a clinical neuropsychologist, in her report of 10th June 2014 (Exhibit H page 7-8), explained that epilepsy was more prominent in persons suffering intellectual disability although the relationship between the two ""is not always clear"". Clinical studies of adults with intellectual disability who had epilepsy demonstrate that they have higher rates of behavioural and psychological problems than those without epilepsy. Persons suffering intellectual disability and epilepsy ""were also significantly more likely to have severe or fleeting behavioural problems, with mood swings being most prominent"". I accept this evidence. From her testing she described Mr Peterson's level of intellectual functioning as falling in the extremely low range, below 99.8 percent ""of his same aged peers"". I am also persuaded that the accused's abnormality of the mind resulting from his underlying condition resulted in the substantial impairment of his capacity to understand events and control himself at the time he bludgeoned Mr Makaradi. Probably he had the capacity for moral judgment, after all, he told the younger Ms Mata he had ""done something wrong"".

60Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst disagreed somewhat about the significance of the impairment of his ability to understand events. Dr Allnutt accepted that impairment, but thought he could understand the nature of the events as they unfolded on 30th or 31st May 2012. On the other hand, Dr Furst (at 126.20T) said because of the severity of his intellectual disability and frontal lobe impairment it would be ""difficult for him to understand or appreciate the consequences of his actions as in, for example in this case, whether hitting the victim as alleged would lead to the very serious injuries that occurred""(my emphasis).

61Having regard to the severity of the intellectual disability, as described by Dr Pulman and Dr Hepner, and the long history of behavioural problems including problems with aggression summarised in Exhibit 5, I prefer that part of the evidence of Dr Furst to that part of the evidence of Dr Allnutt. Dr Allnutt did not really address the issue of the accused's appreciation of the consequences of his actions.

62In terms of loss of self-control, no one described the nature of the accused's problems better than Dr Allnutt. Dr Allnutt accepted that the impairment in self-control was substantial, if that word was defined as ""more than trivial and of substance"" (54.15T). He gave the following metaphor in oral evidence (55.10T):

Like all of us we are prone to react at one point in anger to a certain situation and at one point in time it may not at another, so you've got to bear that in mind. If I could put it this way is that as a consequence of his frontal lobe damage his ability to inhibit a strong emotional response was compromised. So in simple terms his brake pads were eroded so he had more difficulty to put on the brakes than you and I might have and that difficulty was probably also compounded by his disability but not necessarily.

He went on to say (55.20T):

In his case if we said that he felt anger by what he perceived as something that was an affront to him and then erupted with rage, his ability to inhibit that was diminished by virtue of his executive dysfunctional frontal lobe damage more than trivially. 

I accept this evidence.

63This leaves the second question. Before answering it, I think it worth considering the evidence in relation to intoxication as I am required to disregard the effects of self-induced intoxication on his impairment when deciding the second question.

64It seems to me that it is for the accused to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities either that he was not intoxicated in the relevant sense, or if he, was what effect that had on his impairment. There is no doubt that Mr Makaradi was very intoxicated. His blood alcohol reading was 0.277. The accused told Dr Stark (Exhibit B [4.5]) that he and Mr Makaradi ""had shared most of a standard bottle of whiskey with coke"" on the night Mr Makaradi was killed. Some alcohol had been left in the bottle. Blood tests taken later on 31st May 2012 from the accused were negative for alcohol but positive for cannabinoids. Nothing in Dr Stark's written or oral evidence suggested that she noticed anything of the after effects of severe intoxication on the part of the accused. So far as the cannabinoids were concerned, Dr Duflou said that the pathology results demonstrated that the accused had used cannabis ""in the prior week to weeks"" (119.7T). I infer that cannabis is metabolised at a much slower rate than alcohol. From this evidence I would not infer that he was intoxicated by cannabis at the time he killed Mr Makaradi.

65The accused told Dr Allnutt that prior to striking Mr Makaradi he had consumed ""about 4 cups of whiskey and coke"". Dr Pulman received a history that Mr Makaradi had shown up with a bottle of whiskey but received no history of how much the accused had consumed. The accused told Dr Allnutt that he had been drinking with Mr Makaradi between about 10 pm and midnight and estimated he had drunk about 4 to 5 whiskeys and coke and did not feel intoxicated. The accused said Mr Makaradi was drinking the whiskey straight and he also explained that he was concerned about Mr Makaradi leaving to go home because Mr Makaradi was drunk.

66From this evidence, although I am satisfied that the accused had taken some alcohol, the quantity involved is not so great as to have any significant effect on his substantial impairment due to the abnormality of mind caused by his underlying condition.

67Dr Allnutt said that the impairment in terms of his capacity to control himself was substantial, independent of intoxication by substances, ""alcohol or otherwise"" (68.25T).

68Dr Furst said that he assumed the ingestion of alcohol made no difference at all to his opinion about the accused suffering from substantial impairment because (128.35T):

... the intellectual disability he suffers from and the epilepsy are both longstanding conditions present from early life, irrespective of alcohol intoxication. ... [the] neuropsychological testing conducted after his arrest was in the absence of alcohol, and both tests by Dr Hepner and Susan Pulman revealed the global impairment which I relied on to form my opinion. 

69I am satisfied that a degree of intoxication by alcohol would not have added materially to the accused's impairment, or the seriousness of it, at the time of his assault on Mr Makaradi. 

70I remind myself that the second question is whether the accused's impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. Counsel were divided about the nature of the inquiry. Learned Queens Counsel for the Crown argued that the focus was on the expression ""so substantial"". The question was about the magnitude, or perhaps seriousness, of the impairment of the mental capacity of the accused. Mr Smith argued that the second question was a single expression of a composite idea. The seriousness of the impairment was clearly relevant but a broader inquiry was called for. Both counsel relied on the analysis of Johnson J in Potts v R [2012] NSWCCA 229 at [33] and the authorities his Honour considered. 

71Omitting citations Justice Johnson said:

It has been said that the issue under s 23A(1)(b) is a task for the tribunal of fact, which must approach that task in a broad commonsense way, involving a value judgment by the jury representing the community, and not a finding of medical fact:. It is often put to juries ... that an impairment is substantial if it is such as warrants the reduction of the crime from murder to manslaughter: .. In R v Majdalawi, Adams J observed... that the ""value judgment by the jury representing the community"" to which Hunt CJ at CL referred in R v Ryan ""is a decision about culpability"" and hence ""is not a medical question"".

I observe that to warrant the reduction in legal liability it is not enough that the impairment is substantial, something more is required. The impairment must be ""so substantial"" before the reduction is warranted. Another way of putting this may be that the impairment is substantial enough to warrant the reduction. 

72This statutory language makes it natural to consider the seriousness of the impairment of the accused's mental capacity. But as the second question is not a medical question, that consideration cannot be of decisive importance. The question is about whether legal responsibility for the most serious crime of murder should be attributed to the accused. Seriousness of his condition is of central but not necessarily decisive importance.

73As the inquiry relates to the appropriate level of culpability other considerations are relevant. For instance, it is relevant to consider the effect of his impairment on his actions. The decision in Potts demonstrates that merely having an undoubted underlying condition which produces relevant impairments will not suffice unless those impairments were operative at the time of the offending; that is to say, unless the impairment explains in a significant way what happened. Clearly the impairment need not be total for that would constitute the mental illness defence. Partial mental incapacity is sufficient, but the extent necessary to reduce the legal liability of the accused is a matter for judgment.

74Moreover, in my opinion, the value judgment is not entirely at large. The decision involves normative considerations and the relevant legal norms must be derived from legal principle. One of the norms the statute embodies, derived from the criminal law generally, is that frequently, but not always, the criminal acts of the mentally ill or mentally disabled, justify less severe punishment than the criminal acts of persons of ordinary mental capacity. (cf Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree (t/as R Tambree and Associates) [2005] HCA 69; (2005) 224 CLR 627 at 639 [28] - [29] per Gleeson CJ).

75Applying these principles and disregarding the effect of the alcohol he had drunk, I am persuaded that the accused's impairment was so substantial as to justify reducing his criminal liability from murder to manslaughter.

76I am persuaded by the evidence I have recounted at [59] to [65] that, in lay terms, the accused's impairment was severe; particularly in his appreciation of the consequences of his actions, and his capacity for self-control. This severe impairment results from the combination of his mild to moderate intellectual disability, a lifelong disability in his case, and the frontal lobe damage, probably resulting from the affects of his unmedicated epilepsy. It is worth bearing in mind Dr Pulman's evidence that the accused's level of intellectual functioning falls in the extremely low range, 99.8 per cent of mature persons function at a higher level than him.

77The commission of the offence involved no planning or premeditation. It was a spontaneous attack without any thought at all to the consequences. The attack consisted of a series of blows lasting no more than a few seconds. His inability to control himself and his lack of appreciation of the consequences of his actions were the direct result of his substantial impairment. Applying the norms of the criminal law, which the statute embodies, as serious and severe as the attack was, his moral culpability is greatly reduced. Were this a normal criminal trial, I think the appropriate verdict would be manslaughter by reason of substantial impairment.

Verdict 

78The accused is not guilty of murder. On the limited evidence available, the accused committed the offence of the manslaughter of Rafik Makaradi on 30th May 2012.

2704682,R v Mereb; R v Younan [2014] NSWCCA 149,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceOn 18 June 2013 a jury found each of the respondents guilty of conspiring with each other, Carol Abibadra, Kevin Zerafa and others including Owen T Daniels and Robert Agius with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth contrary to s135.4(3) of the Criminal Code (Cth).
2Sweeney DCJ sentenced each of the respondents to a term of imprisonment of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 7 February 2014.
3The Crown has appealed against those sentences on the following grounds:
1. The sentencing judge erred by taking into account as ""a significant extra curial punishment"" the past payment of tax and interest and the possible future payment of interest and penalties.
2. The sentencing judge erred by imposing a single non-parole period of 2 years without having regard to the provisions of Pt 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and in particular the requirement in s16A to make an order of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence having regard to general sentencing principles.
3. The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate.
Factual Background
4The respondents operated a successful electrical business, PHY Electrical Contractors Pty Ltd (PHY).  They were clients of an accounting firm known as Owen T Daniel & Co (OTD).  Owen T Daniel (Daniel), an accountant, and Robert Agius, an accountant based in Vanuatu, promoted an illegal scheme to clients of OTD.  
5The accountant from OTD who dealt directly with the respondents was Carol Abibadra (Abibadra).  The respondents did, however, also deal with Daniel and Kevin Zerafa (Zerafa).
6In about August 2000 at a meeting with Daniel and Abibadra, the respondents were offered an opportunity to participate in an offshore ""round robin"" scheme.  The intention behind the scheme was to evade payment of company and personal income tax.  The respondents agreed to enter the scheme.
7In summary, the respondents transferred money from PHY's account to New Zealand bank accounts of companies controlled by Agius and others.  Following further transfers of most of those moneys into other accounts in New Zealand, the moneys were transferred back to PHY, initially, and then directly to accounts operated by each of the respondents.  False claims were made in the income tax returns of PHY, those claims matching the amounts transferred overseas.  In 2003 and 2004 false claims were made for future expenses (based on the accrual system) and then moneys were subsequently transferred overseas (and received back) to match those claims.
8Each year ""preliminary"" accounts were prepared for PHY by OTD staff, including Abibadra and Zerafa.  In each of the relevant years, those preliminary accounts revealed the expected profit for PHY.  The respondents met with Daniel, Abibadra and later Zerafa to discuss those figures.  On the basis of those figures, the accountants and the respondents agreed on the value of the false claims to be included in the upcoming income tax return for PHY.
9The period of offending in the indictment was between 24 May 2001 and 11 April 2006.  The first date is the date of the commencement of s11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth).  Her Honour found that the respondents had agreed to participate in the ""illegal dishonest scheme"" from about August 2000 and continued to participate in the conspiracy through to the lodgement of the final false return in April 2006.
10The respondents made 19 international transfers of money.  The first payment into the scheme by the respondents was made on 8 September 2000.  The last payment into the scheme by the respondents took place on 11 April 2005.  Between those dates, the 19 international transactions resulted in the transfer of a total of approximately $1.74 million dollars to companies operated by and on behalf of Robert Agius.  Of those amounts, approximately $1.66 million was returned to the accounts of PHY and the respondents.
11The first false income tax return was lodged with the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation on 24 May 2002.  The final false income tax return was lodged on 11 April 2006.  The resultant tax shortfall for PHY was $860,859 and for the respondents of the order of $140,000.  Her Honour sentenced the respondents on the basis that they were jointly responsible for an overall tax shortfall of approximately $1 million.
12The Crown noted that this scheme had been considered by the courts on a number of occasions.  R v Hili; R v Jones [2010] NSWCCA 108 - Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence upheld.  Hili v R; Jones v R [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 - Appeal to High Court dismissed.  R v Boughen and Cameron [2012] NSWCCA 17 - Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence upheld.  R v Stephen Victor Hawkins [2013] NSWCCA 208 - Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence upheld.  R v Kevin Zerafa [2013] NSWCCA 222 - Crown appeal against inadequacy of sentence upheld.  R v Liles [2012] NSWSC 1249.  R v Sakovitis [2013] NSWSC 464.
Proceedings in District Court
13Her Honour made a number of findings, some of which have been challenged by the Crown.  In relation to their complicity, her Honour found:
""While I accept Mr Mereb and Mr Younan relied on Owen T Daniel it is one thing to rely on one's accountant to prepare the company's accounts and tax returns, it is another to cede control of your business to him and permit him to make arrangements for the company without your knowledge and agreement.  There is no rational reason why Owen T Daniel's staff would perform illegal acts on the company's behalf to obtain benefits for the company without the knowledge and agreement of Mr Mereb and Mr Younan.
I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Owen T Daniel and his staff had Mr Mereb's and Mr Younan's knowledge and agreement to participate in the illegal dishonest scheme from the 2000 meeting and throughout the period specified in the indictment.  I have no difficulty accepting that Owen T Daniel suggested the arrangement to them.  Mr Mereb and Mr Younan seemed to be essentially decent hard working men who agreed to become involved in the scheme Owen T Daniel was promoting for the financial benefit of their company paying less tax than it should properly and lawfully have paid.
As part of the scheme there were 19 transactions in which the offenders sent money from PHY's bank account to bank accounts in New Zealand of companies controlled by Robert Agius, the scheme's promoter.  The moneys were sent overseas to give the appearance of payments of legitimate business expenses which were then claimed in the company's tax returns.
The first transfer of money occurred on 8 September 2000, the last on 11 April 2005.  Only one amount of just over $2,000 was sent in June 2003 and no moneys were transferred in 2004.  (ROS 7.6 - 8.4)
...
 In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, the amount of financial loss to the Commonwealth is a relevant factor though not determinative of sentence, as is the time over which their offending conduct continued, being almost five years although with a break of over two years in 2003 and 2004.  I also take into account the part played by the offenders in the conspiracy by attending to the money transfers, each on a number of occasions. 
The scheme was essentially simple, although putting it into effect required preparation of false invoices and other documents, as well as false accounts, to provide a screen of legitimacy to the money transfers and false expenses claimed.  The creation of those documents was done by others, although with the concurrence of Mr Mereb and Mr Younan.  The offending was planned and sustained, although much of the planning and implementation was done by Owen T Daniel's staff and others.""  (ROS 9.4 - 9.9)
14Her Honour found:
""Although Mr Mereb and Mr Younan dispute the precise amounts of the tax shortfalls for them personally it was agreed I could proceed on the basis that the total tax shortfall is approximately $1 million.  Mr Mereb and Mr Younan have repaid the total tax shortfall from their offences, having repaid, on their count, $1.12 million and on the Crown's calculation $1.17 million.  There are significant amounts of penalty tax and interest owing, in a similar amount to that already paid.  Each of Mr Mereb and Mr Younan said in evidence they will pay the penalty tax and will have to sell their homes to do so.  I accept their evidence to that effect.  The past and intended future repayments are a significant extra curial punishment and I have taken them into account to reduce the sentence I have imposed on each offender.""  (ROS 12.5 - 12.9)
15Her Honour noted that the Crown had conceded that the respondents co-operated with the police during the investigation and that their conduct at the trial in consenting to the tender of the documents in the Crown case and requiring only a few of the proposed witnesses to give evidence, greatly shortened the time taken to conduct the trial.  Her Honour took their co-operation in those respects into account.
16Her Honour also took into account the delay of more than 7 years between the end date of the offences and the sentencing of the offenders.  That having been said, her Honour accepted that there was a need for a lengthy period of investigation and to assemble the evidentiary material.  In that regard, she noted that much of the delay was due to decisions by the respondents.  However, their first trial had ended with the jury not being able to agree upon a verdict and her Honour had adjourned the sentence proceedings for two months in September 2013 because of the demands of another trial.  Nevertheless, her Honour accepted ""that the offenders and their families have been in suspense and experienced high levels of anxiety in that period"".
Factual challenges
17The Crown disputed her Honour's finding that ""the time over which their offending continued, being almost five years, although with a break of over two years in 2003 and 2004"".  The Crown submitted that there was no break of over two years in 2003 and 2004.  This was because the period was in fact 15 months and during that time a number of false documents were filed pursuant to the scheme including PHY's taxation return for the financial year ended 30 June 2003 and misleading correspondence had been sent by the respondents to the ATO during that time.
18It was incorrect of her Honour to say that there was a ""break of over two years in 2003 and 2004"".  Clearly fraudulent activities associated with the scheme took place during that time.  Nevertheless, looking at her Honour's remarks on sentence as a whole, it is not at all clear that this factual finding had any effect on the sentences which her Honour passed.  
19This is particularly so when one has regard to her Honour's specific finding at ROS 7.8 that ""I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Owen T Daniel and his staff had Mr Mereb's and Mr Younan's knowledge and agreement to participate in the illegal dishonest scheme from the 2000 meeting and throughout the period specified in the indictment, i.e. 24 May 2001 - 11 April 2006.""   Accordingly, although looked at in isolation it was not correct to say that there was ""a break of over 2 years in 2003 and 2004"" I am not persuaded that this had any effect on the sentencing process.
20The Crown noted that in her Honour's remarks on sentence she did not refer to the fact that each of the respondents took steps to ensure that their bookkeeper recorded moneys returned to their accounts as loaned and that payments out were recorded as expenses.  It is correct that her Honour did not set out each step taken by the respondents to implement the scheme.  Her failure to specifically refer to that matter does not mean that her Honour did not take it into account nor does it mean that her Honour did not have regard to the whole of the scheme as disclosed by the evidence at trial.
Ground 1 - Extra Curial Punishment
21In written and oral submissions the Crown refined this ground of appeal to a submission that while her Honour was entitled to have regard to the imposition of additional penalties following the failure to pay tax as extra curial punishment and therefore a matter which could be properly taken into account by way of mitigation, her Honour had given too much weight to that factor.  The Crown submitted that the respondents had not fully disclosed their personal financial positions and as such, it was impossible to determine the exact extent to which any penalties would impact upon them.  It submitted that as a result, it was not open to her Honour to characterise these potential payments as ""significant"" extra curial punishment.
Consideration
22There are a number of difficulties with that submission.  The first is a factual one in that the respondents said that they would have to sell their homes in order to pay the penalty tax.  That evidence was accepted.  That of itself would indicate considerable hardship and family disruption for the respondents.
23Another and perhaps more fundamental difficulty with the submission is that referred to in R v Lamella [2014] NSWCCA 122 where Price J (with whom Garling and Bellew JJ agreed) said:
""33 It is well established that a complaint that a judge failed to attribute sufficient weight to an issue on sentence will not generally be a material error. As Johnson J said in Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121 at [40]:

""The second, third and fourth grounds of appeal complain that the sentencing Judge had given ""insufficient weight"" to different aspects of the Applicant's subjective case in passing sentence. In Stephens v R [2009] NSWCCA 240, Grove J (McClellan CJ at CL and RA Hulme J agreeing) observed at [16]-[18], that there are inherent problems in a ground expressed in that fashion succeeding, as the ground tacitly concedes that some weight had been placed upon the factor by the sentencing Judge. Circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by this Court are narrowly confined, whether the proceeding is a Crown appeal or an offender's application for leave to appeal with respect to sentence: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [11]; Ryan v R [2009] NSWCCA 183 at [33]; Cao v R [2010] NSWCCA 109 at [57].""""
24In those circumstances, it was open to her Honour to find that the past and intended future penalty payments constituted ""significant extra curial punishment"".  There was a factual basis for the finding in that the amount of their penalties was large and the selling of their houses would involve hardship.  No convincing basis has been demonstrated to establish that her Honour gave ""too much weight"" to this factor.
25This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - Error in imposing a single non-parole period of 2 years.Ground 3 - The sentence was manifestly inadequate.
26The Crown submitted that the High Court's approval of the statement of principle in Ruha v R [2010] 198 A Crim R 430 at [45] in Hili and Jones at [41] made it clear that the necessary deterrent and punitive effects of sentences for serious tax fraud must be reflected both in the head sentence and in any provision for earlier release from custody.  The Crown submitted that this was another way of stating the requirement in s16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) that a court should make an order which was of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances to the offence.  The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed in this case did not satisfy those tests.
27The Crown supported these grounds of appeal by quoting extensively from Hili and Jones where the High Court identified considerations which were indicative of manifest inadequacy:
""62 In the present matters, the inadequacy of the sentences imposed at first instance was evident from consideration of all of the matters that were relevant to fixing a sentence (and making a recognizance release order) ""of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence"". The chief considerations which pointed to inadequacy in these cases were the nature of the offending, and the sentences that had been imposed in cases most closely comparable with the present.
63 The applicants' offending was sustained over a long time. It was planned, deliberate and deceitful, requiring for its implementation the telling of many lies. The applicants acted out of personal greed. The amount of tax evaded was not small. Detection of offending of this kind is not easy. Serious tax fraud, which this was, is offending that affects the whole community. As was pointed out in Ruha, the sentences imposed had to have both a deterrent and a punitive effect, and those effects had to be reflected in the head sentences and the recognizance release orders that were made.""
28The Crown then reviewed some of the cases to which reference has already been made (at [12] hereof) which involved other participants in this scheme.  The Crown stressed that this was not a case where the offenders had admitted guilt but guilt had only been established after a trial and consequently no discount of sentence was involved.
29The Crown focused particularly upon the decision of this Court in Hawkins and compared salient features of this case with those in Hawkins.  The Crown submitted that in this case the respondents' conduct was slightly longer in duration than that of Mr Hawkins by a period of 4 months and that the monetary amount involved was significantly greater, i.e. $1 million as opposed to $606,000.  The Crown submitted that the respondents were jointly responsible for that overall amount, even though their individual liability was of a similar scale to that of Hawkins.
Consideration
30The Crown accepted that as a Crown appeal, the Court needed to be mindful of the principles which govern Crown appeals generally.  The Crown accepted that the relevant principles were summarised by Wood CJ at CL (with whom Meagher JA and Bell J agreed) in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]:
70 ...  it is important to note the principles which apply in relation to the determination of a Crown appeal against sentence: 
(a)  The normal restriction upon appellate review of the exercise of a discretion, as set out in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, applies to Crown appeals against sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321; with the result that this Court cannot merely substitute its opinion, as to the appropriate sentence, for that of the sentencing judge: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671; rather, it may interfere only where error either latent or patent is shown; R v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386 at 388; and Wong and Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 76 ALJR 79 at para 58 and 109.
(b)  Appeals by the Crown should generally be rare; Malvaso v The Queen [1989] HCA 58; 168 CLR 227 at 234, and unless there is a clear error of principle identified, it would be exceptional for the Court to interfere: R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85.
(c)  A Crown appeal against sentence is concerned with establishing matters of principle ""for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons"": per Barwick CJ in Griffiths v The Queen [1977] HCA 44; 137 CLR 293 but this power extends to doing what is necessary to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing, that is, where the sentence is definitely outside the appropriate range for the case in hand: Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 299; Dinsdale v The Queen  (2000) 202 CLR 32, at paras 61 and 62, and Wong & Leung v The Queen at para 109.
(d)  The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal: R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561, R v Papazis (1991) 51 A Crim R 242 at 247, and Wong and Leung v The Queen at para 110.
(e)  A sentence which is imposed as a consequence of a successful Crown appeal will generally be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court: R v Holder and Johnston (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, and will generally be towards the lower end of the available range of sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen at para 62.""
31Leaving aside the reference to double jeopardy (Bui v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] HCA 1; 244 CLR 638), those principles remain valid and were restated by the plurality (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 where their Honours said:
""1 The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (""Crown appeals"") under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Criminal Appeal Act"") is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.""  That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the ""residual discretion"".""
32To succeed on either of these grounds, the Crown must demonstrate that her Honour's orders were ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).  Another way of expressing the same concept is that the Crown must demonstrate that the non-parole periods and total sentences imposed were outside the range of sentences that could have been imposed.  The discretion conferred on a sentencing judge is wide.  There is no single correct sentence.  What reveals manifest inadequacy of sentence is consideration of all the factors relevant to fixing the sentence (Hili and Jones at [60]).
33It is clear from her Honour's remarks on sentence that she did what she was required to do and took into account all the factors relevant to fixing this particular sentence.  While it might be that other judges would have reached a different conclusion and while it might be that the sentences ultimately imposed were towards the bottom of the range, the fundamental question is whether these sentences are unreasonable or plainly unjust, or that their severity has failed to match the seriousness of the offending.  
34In that regard, there is nothing inappropriate in the non-parole period being half of the head sentence.  This matter was considered by the High Court (Mason CJ and McHugh J) in Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18;169 CLR 525 at 531 - 532.  There their Honours said:
""19 Once this is accepted, it follows that the considerations which the sentencing judge must take into account when fixing a minimum term will be the same as those applicable to the setting of the head sentence.  Obviously, the weight to be attached to these factors and the way in which they are relevant will differ due to the different purposes behind each function.
20  A prisoner's prospects of rehabilitation will be relevant to the fixing of a minimum term, both by way of mitigation and because the community benefits from the reformation of one of its members.  Conversely, the community needs to be protected from a violent offender, especially one whose prospects for rehabilitation are bleak.  Likewise, the nature of the crime will be relevant because a more serious offence will warrant a greater minimum term due to its deterrent effect upon others.  But the nature of the offence does not assume the importance which it has when the head sentence is determined.  There, the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence (Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465, at p 477), whereas the minimum term represents a portion of the head sentence during which the offender will not be considered for parole.""
35It was these kinds of discretionary issues which her Honour clearly took into account when determining what non-parole period she should impose.  Error has not been demonstrated in this approach.  
36Central to the Crown's submissions in support of these grounds is that the sentences can be demonstrated to be manifestly inadequate by reference to other cases where clients of OTD were involved.  It is true that in some cases, e.g. R v Hawkins, the sentence imposed was higher.  That, however, is not indicative of error.
37In Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 585 at [58] Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said:
""58 ...  Secondly, there is the residuary category of error which, in the field of sentencing appeals, is usually described as manifest excess or manifest inadequacy. In this second kind of case appellate intervention is not justified simply because the result arrived at below is markedly different from other sentences that have been imposed in other cases.  Intervention is warranted only where the difference is such that, in all the circumstances, the appellate court concludes that there must have been some misapplication of principle, even though where and how is not apparent from the statement of reasons.""
38Similarly, in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 249 CLR 600  there is a discussion at [38] - [40] by the majority (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Gageler and Keene JJ) as to the use of comparable cases as a yardstick in determining the appropriate sentencing range for a given offence.  At [39] their Honours said:
""39 ...  But in Hili it was distinctly not said that a yardstick derived by reference to comparable cases was an essential precondition of a conclusion that a sentence was manifestly inadequate. It was acknowledged that such a disparity is one pointer towards inadequacy; but French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ expressly approved the statement of Simpson J in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa that previous sentences may be used to establish a range of sentences that have been imposed but not that the range is correct.  In particular, the range of sentences that have been imposed in the past does not fix ""the boundaries within which future judges must, or even ought, to sentence.""""
39In any event, leaving aside R v Hawkins, the sentences here are not markedly out of step with those imposed in other cases involving clients of OTD.  In this case her Honour was in a uniquely favourable position to assess the competing factors in the case because she had presided over the trial and could assess the evidence of the respondents.  One of the difficulties in comparing sentences imposed in other cases without identifying some unifying principle is that the circumstances of the offending and the personal circumstances of the offenders are so varied.  I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed were outside the range of sentences for offences of this kind so as to be properly regarded as manifestly inadequate.
40There is another consideration which should not be ignored.  In determining a Crown appeal the Court has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with the sentence even though the sentence might be erroneously lenient (Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen at [1]).  In Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 249 CLR 571 the majority (French CJ, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel, Bell and Keene JJ) said at [24]:
""24 ...  However, within a range of sentences for this offence and this offender, the weight to be given to the evidence and the various, conflicting, purposes of sentencing was a matter for Judge Lerve. The authority of the Court of Criminal Appeal to substitute a sentence for that imposed by Judge Lerve was not enlivened by its view that it would have given greater weight to deterrence and less weight to the appellant's subjective case. The power could only be engaged if the Court was satisfied that Judge Lerve's discretion miscarried because in the result his Honour imposed a sentence that was below the range of sentences that could be justly imposed for the offence consistently with sentencing standards. In that event, the Court was required to consider whether the Director's appeal should nonetheless be dismissed in the exercise of the residual discretion.  ...""
41It follows that even if I had been persuaded that the sentences imposed by her Honour were manifestly inadequate in the exercise of the residual discretion I would have declined to interfere with the sentences.
42These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
43The order which I propose is that the Crown appeal should be dismissed.
44McCALLUM J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons stated by his Honour in respect of the three grounds of appeal relied upon by the Crown.  The evidence before the sentencing judge established that, as to some tax years, the exact amount of primary tax payable remained in dispute, but on any view it was open to conclude that the extent of each offender's liability for penalty tax (including their liability for interest on penalty tax) was significant.  The sentences imposed were undoubtedly lenient, in my view, but her Honour's remarks on sentence reveal a thoughtful exercise of discretion with careful regard to the relevant considerations, including the strong subjective case for each offender.  I have not been persuaded that the sentences were unreasonable or plainly unjust in all the circumstances.  I agree with the order proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.      
45GARLING J: I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL, for the reasons which he gives.  As well, I am not of the opinion that a more severe sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed: s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

		06 August 2014",2014-08-05 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704686,R v Gaven [2014] NSWDC 189,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 1 August 2014 a jury of eleven, after lengthy deliberations, found the offender, John Gaven, guilty on count 3 on an indictment containing five counts. The jury were unable to reach a verdict on counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 and so they were discharged from delivering verdicts on those counts. Thus it is my task to now sentence the offender on count 3.

2The offender was a Brother at a Catholic boys high school. The school took both borders and day boys. The offender held the position of Vice President and was responsible for discipline and also had other duties which involved supervising, on occasions, the borders' dormitories.

3A boy, now a man, who I will identify by the name of ""W"", was a border. In 1988 he was in Year 8 and thus living in the Year 8 dormitory. W gave evidence that one evening, whilst in that dormitory and in his pyjamas, the offender approached him, put his arm around him and ran his hand down his back until his hand was inside W's pyjama pants touching his bare bottom. W's evidence was that there were other boys around at the time. One of them must have been H because he was an eye witness to the events which W described. H gave evidence which strongly corroborated W's evidence. 

4That the offender would do what he did in the presence of numerous other students indicates quite clearly his appreciation of the power he had over boys in the school and his expectation that he could conduct himself as W described.

5Further evidence as to the offender's attitude towards boys at the school can be found in the evidence of what the Crown called the tendency witnesses. Counts 1, 2, 4 and 5 concern three other complainants. Given that the jury did not return verdicts of guilty on those counts it would be inappropriate for me to take their allegations into account in sentencing the offender. But there were six other witnesses relied on by the Crown. H's evidence has already been mentioned. The jury clearly accepted his evidence beyond reasonable doubt and so do I. SW gave evidence of similar conduct described by both W and H but said that the student involved was not W but HB. The evidence suggested that HB was unlikely to have been the boy involved and so I will proceed on the basis that SW's memory as to what occurred was accurate but that he is mistaken as to which boy was involved; thus I find that he was a further eye witness to the conduct described by W and H.

6Then there was evidence given by four other witnesses, also men at the time of giving evidence but boys at the school at the time of the acts they described. N and P gave evidence of very similar conduct on the part of the offender. They each testified that whilst they were showering, the accused displayed an obvious interest in their genitals, staring at P's genitals for five to ten seconds and commenting on the size of N's genitals.

7Another tendency witness was B. He gave evidence he saw the accused sitting on a skateboard with a younger student on his lap and that when the accused got up B was able to see that the accused had an erection.

8Finally there was the evidence of K whose evidence was that as he was walking back from football and heading into the showers he saw the accused with his arm wrapped around a boy with the accused's hands on the boy's back just above his belt line. Although K described contact between the offender and the unnamed boy which may have been relatively innocuous, K himself did not consider it so and his evidence was that other boys in the vicinity had the same reaction as he did. In any case the conduct described by N, V and B clearly establishes a great deal about the accused's behaviour and attitudes. I accept the evidence of the tendency witnesses beyond reasonable doubt.

9Of course the offender is not to be sentenced for offences for which he has not been found guilty. My purpose in referring to the evidence of S, W and H was to make it clear that I am satisfied that they were describing the very incident which was the subject of count 3. My purpose in referring to the evidence of N, P, K and B is because their evidence establishes that the conduct of the subject of count 3 on the indictment was not an isolated act of sexual misbehaviour by the accused. In addition, such conduct does demonstrate an attitude on the part of the offender that he could behave in a sexual way towards young boys at the school, boys under his authority, and get away with it. Fortunately he has been proved wrong in that regard. 

10I suppose now is the right time to mention other misconduct of the offender. He faced trial at an earlier stage before Garling J on a number of other offences committed against two other boys. He was found guilty and indeed his appeal against his conviction on those matters was dismissed during the course of the trial at which I presided. The offences for which the offender is currently serving a sentence involve an offence of buggery committed against a teenage boy in the mid 1960s and various sexual offences including a serious example of offences involving the penetration of different boys' anus. The sentences imposed total seven years and six months with a non-parole period of four years and six months.

11Authority which binds me says that the offender is to be sentenced by me for an offence committed in 1987 according to the tariff which existed at the time he would have faced sentence for such misconduct. Cleverer people than me have commented on the inappropriateness of that rule of sentencing. It is undeniable that the last thirty years has seen an increase in awareness on the part of the Courts of the harm that sexual offences, particularly against children, can cause. In this trial P, a grown man, cried as he gave evidence that the accused stared at his genitals for five to ten seconds. 

12The Courts have only belatedly understood the seriousness of conduct such as that for which the offender must now be sentenced. Thus to sentence the offender according to standards which existed in the late 1980s is to perpetuate the errors that were made by sentencing Courts at that time. Offenders such as Mr Gaven benefit from earlier mistakes made by sentencing Courts even where we now know that these earlier decisions were wrong. 

13It is a rule of sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender's conduct but even that rule, often described as fundamental, gives way to the rule that an offender must be sentenced according to the standard which existed at the time of the offence. As will be obvious I do not agree with the present stage of sentencing law so I should make it abundantly clear that I recognise that my views must be put aside. I am entitled to suggest that the law is wrong and that it should be changed; I am not entitled to ignore it.

14Accordingly, I will sentence the offender as though he was dealt with at the time of or soon after his offending conduct occurred. This causes a number of problems. Two are immediately apparent; first, would the offender have been sentenced under the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 or the Act which replaced it on 25 September 1989, the Sentencing Act 1989. Secondly, there is the difficulty in obtaining information about what sentences were actually imposed in earlier times.

15The Courts have told sentencing Judges that we are entitled to use our own experience. Fortunately in this case I did my first criminal trial in 1987 and for the next ten or eleven years my practise involved criminal matters alone. Just what a Judge with less experience in criminal matters in the late 1980s was supposed to do is not clear to me. Also, I have been greatly assisted by the submissions of Mr Walsh and the Crown. Their submissions confirm my memory. Sentences for conduct that is described by W were significantly lower in the late 1980s than they are now.

16On the other hand, as I raised with Mr Walsh in the course of submissions, it is important not to just focus on the physical actions of the offender. Although in the vast repertoire of conduct whereby one person can sexually assault another, placing a hand on a young boy's bare bottom is well towards the lower end of that range, a number of things must nevertheless be borne in mind. Firstly, the appropriate range is conduct which amounts to indecent assault. Secondly, as I mentioned above, this offence was not isolated. And thirdly, as the jury's verdict makes clear because it was an element of the offence, the complainant was under the authority of the offender at the time. This last aspect is quite significant. People can be under the authority of others in various circumstances perhaps ranging upwards from a relationship of employer and employee. The relationship between W and the offender is very much at the higher end of the scale. The offender held an enormously powerful position over boys at the school, which allowed him to sexually assault not only W, but also engage in other conduct I have described. Just as all indecent assaults are not equal, nor are all positions of authority. Notwithstanding that, for example, the offender did not touch W's genitals, the offence was a serious example of an indecent assault by a person in authority. 

17Of course, despite the fact that the offender has been convicted of various offences involving the sexual abuse of young boys and that I have found beyond reasonable doubt that he engaged in other improper behaviour, the offender is entitled to have me take into account his otherwise good character. Evidence as to the good work that Mr Gaven has done in the community was adduced before me, as it was before Garling J. In my Court most reliance was placed upon the offender's work with those suffering from HIV/AIDS. His work with such people began in the early 1990s at the time when attitudes to that condition were much less enlightened than they are today. People with that condition were discriminated against. There were wellknown examples. 

18A great deal of publicity was directed to bringing to community attention the harm which contracting that disease occasioned to sufferers of it. Who can forget the image of the grim reaper knocking down crying children with a bowling ball. This in turn, although no doubt well intentioned of course, led to attitudes towards sufferers of the condition which were, with the benefit of hindsight, regrettable in the extreme. In addition there was, and to some extent still continues to be, an attitude that some people suffering from the disease are innocent victims, while others such as intravenous drug users and homosexual men do not fall into that category. Thus, the offender's decision to involve himself in caring and counselling for sufferers of HIV/AIDS in the early 1990s was a highly commendable one. 

19At that time people suffering from HIV/AIDS usually died within a relatively short space of time. The offender's good works involved caring for those people who had often been shunned by their own families. 

20The offender's good works extended to informing himself about the nature of the infection. He was given permission to conduct funerals of those he had cared for and indeed conducted 84 funerals over a period of six years. The offender was often the only person with sufferers of HIV/AIDS as their lives ended. He did such work in the early 90s in Adelaide. He came to Sydney in 1997 and continued to work as he had done in Adelaide. He did so up until his arrest in September 2008. 

21The offender is entitled to me to treat his otherwise good character without there being any discount on the weight to be given to that circumstance because of his offending. Indeed, this is not a case where the offender's good work, as I have just outlined it, enabled him to commit the offence against W, or the other offences which have been proved against him, and so I will regard, very much in the offender's favour, the circumstance that he has done enormous good work in the community, work of which he is entitled to be proud. 

22I have recognised also that there has been a significant delay between the offender's crime and today's sentencing. On the other hand, there is no suggestion that the offender has spent the intervening years fearing the knock on the door which would reveal him to all as the person he truly was and which would lead to him facing sentence for his offending. 

23I take into account - as did Garling J - that there has been a degree of public humiliation. Many offenders, even sexual offenders, are dealt with in Courts where there is not a single person in the public gallery and there are no media reports of any aspect of their prosecution and sentencing. This is far from the case for the present offender.

24I turn now to an issue raised on evidence concerning the conditions of the offender's custody. It is possible and perhaps even likely that he will serve the entirety of his sentence, both that imposed by Judge Garling and that which I am about to impose, in protective custody. But it is no longer the case that there is an automatic assumption that those who serve sentences in protective custody will do so in conditions which are less favourable than those of the general prison population. Indeed, the evidence of the offender was that his conditions of custody varied according to which gaol he was at. So I will take into account that there is a risk that his conditions of custody will be harsher than those of the prison population but that is all that the evidence establishes. In any case, when looking at other sentences for those who have sexually assaulted children it must be borne in mind that any reduction in sentence because of the conditions of custody has usually already been built into those comparative sentences. 

25Mr Walsh asked that I make a finding of special circumstances in his client's favour. The Crown does not speak in opposition to that. Two issues justify that finding, the first is the issue of accumulation which I will shortly address, and the second is the difficulty in knowing under what sentencing regime the offender would have been sentenced in the absence of any delay. As is well known before the introduction of a statutory ratio in the last days of Parole of Prisoners Act (and then in the Sentencing Act) non-parole periods were often less than half of the head sentence, often significantly so. 

26The principle of totality of course applies. I have no doubt that had Judge Garling sentenced the offender for this offence at the time he was sentencing the offender for the matters before him his Honour would have partially accumulated the sentence to be imposed for this matter. I will do that also. His current non-parole period expires on 21 September 2017. In order to give effect to the principle of totality my sentence will commence on 21 June 2017 three months before the expiry of his current non-parole period. 

27I impose sentence as follows: I impose a non-parole period of nine months to date from 21 June 2017 and to expire on 20 March 2018. I set a head sentence of eighteen months. The offender is thus eligible to be released to parole on 20 March 2018.

28In effect, that means, Mr Gaven, six months extra in custody before you will be considered for parole.

2704695,R v Quinnell [2014] NSWDC 156,"sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Bradley Paul Quinnell appears today for sentence in relation to three offences to which he pleaded guilty in the Wagga Wagga District Court on 28 April 2014. There are two offences of wounding Kristie Worth at Batlow on 11 August 2012 with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to her. Those two charges represent counts 2 and 5 of the indictment. Those pleas of guilty were accepted by the Crown in discharge as alternative charges to allegations of wounding the victim with intent to murder her.

2The third charge with which I am concerned is an offence committed on the same day at the same place of assaulting Kristie Worth occasioning to her actual bodily harm. The maximum penalties for the offences of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm are 25 years imprisonment with a standard nonparole period of seven years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm when on indictment is five years imprisonment.

3There is a matter on a Form 1. This matter is to be considered in relation to the principal offence of a wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm in count 5. This is the second offence in time of that type. The matter on the Form 1 involves a charge of assault committed at the time of the more serious offences when another victim, other than Kristie Worth, was pushed against a wall. In the scheme of things it is a matter of minor importance save for one aspect, and that is the assault committed on that victim was in the course of that victim endeavouring to dissuade or prevent the offender from committing further offences against the primary victim, Ms Worth.

4When dealt with summarily the offence on the Form 1, as I understand it, carries a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment. When dealt with on indictment it carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. The prisoner has been in custody since his arrest on 11 August 2012. The offence has been committed in the early hours of the morning. The pleas of guilty were entered after a committal for trial in relation to various charges and after the matter had been listed for trial. But the pleas of guilty and discharge of the original indictment proposed by the Crown followed upon negotiations that were well in hand before the trial date.

5This is not a case of pleas of guilty being entered at the door of the Court, so to speak. It is submitted in very careful written submissions prepared by learned counsel for the prisoner that all things considered that are set out in those written submissions and supplemented by oral submissions, the appropriate discount to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty should be 15% upon the otherwise appropriate sentence for each offence.

6The learned Crown Prosecutor accepted that the discount as submitted was within the legitimate range of discretion available to the Court. Thus, having considered the matters raised by counsel for the prisoner, noting the position of the Crown, I have concluded that it is appropriate in this matter to accord the prisoner the discount in relation to each sentence otherwise appropriate as submitted by counsel.

7The facts of the matter are that the primary victim, Ms Worth, was the partner of the prisoner living in premises at the relevant time, occupied also by the prisoner's younger brother, who has provided evidence to the Court about material matters and a young woman who is the victim of the assault that appears on the Form 1. The prisoner and the victim, Ms Worth, had been in a relationship, as I understand it, for approximately five to six years before the events of this night.

8There is no victim impact statement, although the victim was in court and was present when the prisoner offered his apology to her. It goes without saying, as was noted in the submissions, that the victim at various points of the proceedings was distressed. But in the absence of any other information I could not draw an inference adverse to the prisoner that either the apology was rejected or the apology itself distressed the complainant. It may have done so, but, in any event, in the context of the matters that I need to consider so far as the prisoner's evidence is concerned, the willingness or otherwise of a victim to accept an apology is really a matter of little moment in sentencing proceedings as a number of authorities have made clear.

9Although I do not have a victim impact statement, it is clear that the conduct of the prisoner was obviously terrifying for the victim at the time of the relevant events and no doubt had a very profound impact upon her. I would have no doubt from the facts of this matter that the distress of that particular early morning caused by the conduct of the prisoner and the violence metered out to her would still cause the victim considerable distress and concern.

10The fact that there is no victim impact statement is a matter that is neutral in the proceedings and certainly no inferences adverse to the victim or favourable to the prisoner as far as the effect of his conduct is concerned could be drawn from the absence of such a document. The facts of the matter reflect upon events that are not only revealed in the statement of facts but come from the evidence of the prisoner and various histories he has given as well as other material tendered in the proceedings.

11I have a statement prepared for the proceedings by Dr Margaret Stark, who is the Director of the Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit of the New South Wales Police Force. She is a suitably qualified expert in interpreting matters relating to drug and alcohol ingestion, the effect upon individuals by the use of combinations of drugs and related matters. Her statement provides a great deal of information which is actually not in the facts relating to the investigation of this matter; the presentation of the prisoner at the time of his arrest and observations made of him by ambulance officers, police and others over an extended period of time following upon his arrest; his presentation during the interview; the history he has given; as well as her opinions as to matters arising from the history he has given. I will deal with the detail of that material when I, firstly, set out what I understand the facts to be based upon, of course, the statement of facts and some evidence about relevant matters given by the prisoner himself. 

12On the afternoon of 10 August 2012 both the victim and the prisoner, apparently separately, travelled to a funeral at Tumut from Batlow where they both lived at the relevant period of time. It is clear on the evidence that the prisoner throughout the afternoon had consumed a quantity of alcohol. The victim was in company with another friend. By about 7 o'clock when the parties were about to leave Tumut to return to Batlow, the prisoner was affected by alcohol and the victim was angry at him having been intoxicated at the funeral.

13It turns out from the material available to the Court that the deceased, whose funeral the prisoner and victim attended, had died from an overdose of drugs including the ingestion of the commercially labelled drug, Xanax, which the prisoner himself consumed during the night of the 10th and the early morning of the 11th.

14The victim went back to the home she shared with the prisoner and the prisoner's brother (Shane) and the partner of Shane Quinnell, Maddie Callaway, the victim of the assault on the Form 1. The prisoner went out again with his brother and Ms Callaway and the victim eventually went to bed whilst they were out. The facts state that the prisoner and the other people, including, as I would understand it, his brother, continued to consume alcohol and other drugs were consumed including, a quantity of Xanax up until 2am, when the prisoner, his brother and Ms Callaway returned to the house they occupied.

15The facts state the prisoner was highly intoxicated at this particular time. He obviously had some recriminations or anger within him concerning the conduct of the victim. Whether it was paranoid or not, on his part he believed that she had hidden some money that he believed he had won gambling at the TAB agency the previous day, I assume at the hotel at Tumut. Where that occurred it does not really matter very much.

16The prisoner started to cook himself a meal and became increasingly agitated and had an argument with his brother. Eventually the prisoner walked into the bedroom, I take it he shared with the victim, who was asleep. He stood over her and asked, ""Where the fuck is my money?"" She woke up and observed that he had a pair of scissors in his hand. She turned on the bedside light and asked him what he was doing with the scissors and then without further ado the prisoner stabbed her to the righthand side of her face with the scissors. She could obviously immediately feel blood running from her face and tried to get up while the prisoner tried to push her back onto the bed. He then left the bedroom.

17There is a shortage of medical evidence in this case concerning the injuries of the victim, but I take the blow to the right cheek to be the 1.5 centimetre would on her right cheek for which she subsequently received one suture or stitch. The victim got up from the bed and walked out of the bedroom screaming and bleeding heavily. Ms Callaway came to her aid and the prisoner's younger brother tried to calm him down. During this period the prisoner accused Ms Callaway and Shane Quinnell of calling the police. I do not know what else he would have expected them to do whether sober or affected by alcohol.

18He smashed two mobile phones. He said about the victim, ""Fuck the dog, don't worry about her, she's nothing but a dirty slut anyway."" Then, without warning, he ran towards the victim, who was in the hallway of the house between the bedroom and the bathroom, this time armed with a second pair of scissors, which he held in one hand and kitchen knife which he held in the other. The victim heard the prisoner's brother yell out, ""Run"". Ms Callaway then stood in front of the prisoner and tried to reason with him as he tried to push past her. She was pushed against the wall and slumped to the ground. This constitutes the assault on the Form 1.

19By this time the victim was in the bathroom and had closed the door. She tried to hold the door knob to keep the prisoner entering but eventually the prisoner forced his way in with the door flying inward. The victim ended up lying on her back on the floor. He was brandishing the knife and scissors. She began pleading with him and pulled herself into a foetal position for protection. He approached her and raised his left hand above his shoulder in readiness for a downward strike. He then began repeatedly stabbing her to the face and neck while she screamed for him to stop.

20The victim was so scared that she closed her eyes and held her hands above her head in an attempt to protect her face from the stabs. She was repeatedly struck to her hand, neck and face in quick succession and for obvious reasons she feared for her life. In relation to these aspects of the facts I probably should have sought some clarification, but the facts do not say whether she was being struck with the scissors or the knife. It really does not matter a great deal because at the end of the day she had a five by three centimetre laceration to the back of her right hand, which is clearly a defence wound, but more than a simple cut, with complete transection of the extensor tendons of the right index and middle fingers.

21I am not informed one way or the other whether she suffers a permanent disability from that injury. She has a small wound in the nature of a defence wound, it would seem, between the right, middle and ring finger. She has a two centimetre wound in her mid forehead for which she received three stitches. She had a .5 centimetre wound on her left mid cheek for which she received two stitches. She had two wounds in her right lateral neck, one being 1.5 centimetres long, which required four sutures, and the other being one centimetre long, requiring three sutures. She had a one centimetre wound on her left lateral neck which required three sutures.

22As the stabbing ceased she managed to unbalance the prisoner and she wriggled out from underneath him. She ran straight through the lounge and out the front door with the prisoner in pursuit of her. By this time Ms Callaway and Shane Quinnell had run from the premises and were encouraging the victim to run. Obviously neither of them could quell the prisoner's anger or his momentum. The victim continued down the road in the direction of what is described as the Batlow Hotel. How far that is away I am not informed. She ran until she felt she was going to pass out. By this time the prisoner caught up to her and jumped on top of her. This was on the footpath outside the Batlow Hotel. Standing above her with her facing down he took hold of the by her hair and, using his body weight and arms, smashed her face into the concrete footpath. 

23Her right cheek and forehead were the primary point of impact. He then lifted her head off the ground and, using his body weight and arms, again smashed her head into the footpath. By this time, his brother had alerted two other people about what was happening, Mitchell Cornby and another man, Michael Collins. They drove to the scene where the prisoner still had hold of the victim by her hair. They ran over to him and by pushing him, kicking him and prying his hands from her hair, they managed to move him away from her. Both the prisoner and the victim were covered in her blood and she was obviously in a very distressed state. These men carried her to the car and drove her to the Batlow Hospital emergency department and are to be commended for their intervention. 

24Once at the hospital, Mr Collins passed her to medical staff. During this particular assault, the offender also bit the victim causing pain and bruising to her hand. The other injuries, which are described in the fact sheet, include bruising from a bite to the left hand, abrasions to the back and left shoulder, abrasions to her left upper arm and bruising to her right and left thighs. It is extraordinary that she did not suffer further serious injury, particularly to her face and head from the conduct of the prisoner at that time. 

25The prisoner was taken into custody. The report of Dr Stark reflects upon his presentation in the period of time from the time he came to Tumut police station, which was 3.39am on 11 August. He was clearly intoxicated. He had cut himself before arrest with an unknown weapon and had injuries to his arms from selfinflicted injuries. He was very aggressive. The police believed he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol. He told police that he had taken ""shit loads of Xanax"", he was obviously intoxicated, he refused to answer questions that were asked of him, he called the police ""cunts"", and ""dogs"", and was described by an observer as ""very irrational"". 

26He was placed under constant supervision to ensure he did not cause any further injuries to himself and made various allegations about the way he had been treated by the police. Ambulance officers came to treat him a short time later and he was still quite intoxicated throughout the early morning. By 8.58 he was still unsteady on his feet and not very coherent, with slurring speech. By 10.50 it was thought that he had sufficiently recovered from his intoxication to be spoken to, but he was not willing to assist police. 

27At 10.55 am he told a police officer that he did not understand his rights under the relevant legislation that the custody manager is required to bring to his attention. He said, ""No, my brain is fried by Xanax, I don't know a fucking thing."" He did not appear to understand what he was being told. His speech remained slurred throughout the rest of the morning. He claimed that he did not understand what was being put to him. He told police that his body was sore, he thought his body was shutting down and he continually referred to the use of Xanax and the marks upon his body. They would have included, of course, what were selfinflicted injuries. 

28The Director of the Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit had observed the recording of the interview, such as it was, that was conducted with him and made various observations about his recollection in that interview, in which he said he had no recollection of the incident or how he sustained his injuries, although he was primarily concerned about his injury to his arm. The expert comments upon the use of alcohol and the use of the medication alprazolam - which is sold under the trade name Xanax - describing it as a benzodiazepine drug used for the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders. These are drugs that act principally by potentiating inhibitory neurotransmitter activity in the brain. 

29She made the observation that regular use of benzodiazepines and alcohol results in tolerance of the drugs, being metabolised more quickly and the duration and peak intensity of the desired effects reduce. She made various comments about the combination of intoxication with benzodiazepines and alcohol. She made the observations that benzodiazepine use may lead to paradoxical increase in hostility and aggression, ranging from talkativeness and excitement to aggression and antisocial acts. Rage reactions with violent behaviour are most likely in people with a history of aggressive behaviour or unstable emotional behaviour such as a history of anxiety related disorders. She expresses opinions about the half life of the medication, the way in which the medication may be snorted and the like. 

30She formed the opinion that the prisoner was under the influence of alcohol and alprazolam on the night that the assault occurred. His intoxication could account for his amnesia, as both alcohol and drugs may cause amnesia and the effects of amnesia are compounded if the drugs are taken together. She made observations about the effect of snorting Xanax tablets, which increases the effect of those tablets. He was unfit to be interviewed due to the combination of drugs and alcohol, and possible sleep deprivation, and discomfort from his injuries - although she did say in her report she could not give an accurate level of the prisoner's intoxication. 

31The prisoner who is 37 at this time, was 35 and a half years of age at the time of the commission of the offence. He has, up until the present time, developed a very formidable criminal history. A number of appearances in the Children's Court for acts of dishonesty, acts of violence and, at one point, possession of a shortened firearm. As he moved into adulthood and commenced his appearances in the Local Court, his behaviour giving rise to police intervention did not improve and he was, on a number of occasions, sentenced to terms of imprisonment. 

32For example, in August 1996 he was convicted of stealing and sentenced to a minimum term of 18 months with an additional term of two years. Likewise, he received the same sentence for malicious damage and resisting arrest offences, as well as breaking and entering with intent to commit obviously a serious indictable offence on two occasions, and a charge of breaking entering and stealing. He was dealt with other stealing offences in a like manner. In 1999 he was convicted of common assault, as I understand the matter, in respect of three charges - the record is a bit ambiguous - and sentenced to fixed terms of one month and two months in relation to those offences. 

33He appealed against the severity of those penalties and the District Court, in June 2000, converted the terms of imprisonment into Community Service Orders. In May 2002 he appeared at the Wagga Wagga District Court. He was convicted of common assault, for which he was sentenced to a term of six months imprisonment, and convicted of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, for which he was sentenced to three imprisonment with a nonparole period of six months. As I understood his evidence - and I do not have a transcript of that evidence, obviously, the matter was only heard two days ago - he suggested that the offence for which he received the threeyear imprisonment term was an offence in which he produced a knife to his mother.

34I must say in passing - and it is no criticism whatsoever of the very professional way the matter has been conducted by the parties - the time has long past where judges are not provided with the facts of matters where prisoners come to Court to be sentenced in relation to similar crimes for which they have previously been sentenced in the District Court or Supreme Court. In fact, I believe Judges are entitled to have the facts of all matters where people have previously appeared in Court to be sentenced, particularly sentenced to terms of imprisonment, given access to that information by digital retrieval.

35Be that as it may, the prisoner appeared at the Tumut Local Court on 27 May 2003 and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a ninemonth non-parole period for common assault. On the same date he was convicted of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order. In respect of three such charges he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months. He was also convicted on that occasion for 'intimidation' for which he was sentenced to 12 months with a ninemonth nonparole period and convicted of other offences.

36In October 2005, at the Tumut Local Court, he was convicted of three charges of common assault for which he was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment with a 12-month non-parole period, and intimidation for which he was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment with a 12-month non-parole period. He appealed to the District Court in relation to those orders and in respect of the sentences for the common assault matters the penalty of imprisonment was adjusted to nine-months imprisonment without a non-parole period in each case.

37The prisoner was again convicted of common assault on 10 September 2007 for which he was fined a modest amount. The matter was heard ex-parte. In January 2008 he was convicted of either possessing or attempting to possess a prescribed restricted substance, which I take to be prescription medicine, the details of which I am denied. He was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months. He was convicted of possessing equipment for administering prohibited drugs and fined, as well as possessing a prohibited drug for which he was fined. He was also convicted of possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit and sentenced to 16 months with a non-parole period of 12 months. On that date he was also convicted of resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty and two counts of common assault, for which he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of nine months. There was another conviction for possessing drugs. 

38The last relevant convictions, the last convictions before the current matters in 2012, were convictions recorded, as I understand it, on 22 November 2010 of destroying or damaging property, breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to steal, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and affray. For the first two charges he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, commencing on a date in May 2010, with a non-parole period of six months. For the last two offences of affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm he was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment which was backdated to 20 February 2010 with another non-parole period of six months. 

39As I understand those sentences, they were sentences upon which the first two orders were partially accumulative. The prisoner has convictions in Victoria, too, back in the mid-90s for which he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment that were suspended.

40It is in this context that I consider the evidence in the pre-sentence report which stands at some odds with the evidence given by the prisoner. The pre-sentence report of the Community Corrections Service presents what might be described as a negative view of the prisoner seen from the perspective of those that have had the responsibility over a period of time of supervising him in a range of ways. The report notes that supervision in the past has had varying degrees of success. 

41Whilst he has successfully completed three parole orders in 2005, 2007, and 2009 the case management required him to address his alcohol and other drug abuse issues and maintain his mental health regime. However, the prisoner had failed to complete a community service order in 2000 and he had a parole order revoked in 2003. The most recent interaction of Community Corrections with him was as a result of the orders made at the Tumut Local Court in 2010. In respect of those matters, during the period of parole supervision a breach report was submitted to the State Parole Authority on two separate occasions in relation to drug use and the State Parole Authority issued warnings on both occasions. 

42A further breach of parole was submitted and Mr Quinnell's parole order was revoked effectively on 15 September 2011 in relation to failing ""to obey all reasonable directions of the officer, fail to reside at an address agreed on by the officer, and not to use prohibited drugs, obtain drugs unlawfully, or abuse drugs unlawfully obtained"". He served the balance of parole without any further grant of parole. 

43This information, of course, is relevant both in considering the utility of parole supervision and the issue of special circumstances which ultimately I have found in his favour for reasons I will explain in a moment. But it also underlines the fact which is self-evident from his own evidence, particularly in the cross-examination of the prisoner, that for quite a number of years before this incident the prisoner had well and truly been on notice of the impact upon him of the use of alcohol and the use of drugs, whether they be prescribed or prohibited drugs, and the aggression, reflected in his criminal history, arising from abuse of both alcohol and drugs of various types.

44The prisoner, in terms of his family circumstances, had what could be called a reasonable upbringing. There was no major dysfunction. His father, according to the prisoner's brother in his affidavit, drank alcohol occasionally but was not a heavy drinker. The prisoner was not exposed to significant or substantial domestic violence. The prisoner, the mother thought, had been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and was prescribed medication. However, his mother thought it was, ""too late to do any good"". The prisoner himself has no recollection of taking medication for any such disorder and whether he was ever diagnosed with such a disorder appears to be a questionable matter.

45He said that he ""gravitated towards older antisocial peers"" and thus, ""commenced his interactions with the judicial system at around this time"", and thus developed the criminal history that is apparent from his appearances in the Children's Court. He does have the support of his mother, according to the Community Corrections Service, but he does not have a particularly good relationship with his father who rarely contacts him. He also has the support of his brother and he would wish to live with his brother on his release from custody. 

46The brother, who had tried to help him on this particular morning to no avail, prepared as I mentioned earlier, an affidavit in support of the prisoner. He made the point in relation to the prisoner's presentation at the time of these assaults as being in a manner that the brother had not seen before and acting in a way that clearly reflected the extent of his intoxication. 

47The prisoner had been in a relationship with another woman for seven years before he met his current partner and has two children. His relationship with his children has not been particularly productive, bearing in mind his exwife would not permit them to see him for many years. He tried to establish contact with his children but each time he started that process he wound up back in gaol as his criminal history makes clear. 

48The victim of the indictable matters with which I am concerned has had no children to the prisoner and I was informed - and there was no dispute from the bar table - that the prisoner had previously been convicted of assaulting her, although again I do not have the details of any matters of substance in relation to that. The prisoner gave evidence before me that he works in casual labouring work and concreting and the like and he is keen to work, but the truth of the matter is, as far as the Community Corrections Service is concerned, that having underachieved at school and having left at Year 9 after a lot of antisocial behaviour leading to suspensions and the like, the prisoner has only had several short-term labouring type positions. He spent the majority of his adult life unemployed and in part this was due to his long-term alcohol and other drug abuse. He also said that having a bad name in his hometown - and Batlow is a relatively small town - it prevented him from getting work. 

49I note, given the evidence of the prisoner and the background information as to his presentation on arrest, the prisoner was in a psychotic condition when he was admitted into the Junee Correctional Centre. He was placed in a type of segregation. At first blush this might have been seen as a punitive measure, but it turned out that it was purely for self-protection given his state, at least over a number of weeks after his arrest. The prisoner claimed that he was in segregation for three months. Whether that is entirely accurate or not is difficult to judge, but it is clear for a number of weeks the prisoner was in a quiet dishevelled state as a consequence of his ingestion of drugs and alcohol on 10 and 11 August 2012.

50The prisoner has been on protection since release to segregation. Again, in one breath this is said to be for the protection of his safety, but on the other hand there is other evidence made available in this Court over a period of time that Junee Correctional Centre is largely a protection gaol where there are a number of prisoners on 'protection' for reasons that have nothing to do with their own personal safety. Whilst in custody he has not incurred any internal charges.

51The Community Corrections Service report cites his attempts at abstinence and correction of his abuse of drugs over a number of years, but it also notes that the only rehabilitation that Mr Quinnell had attempted to control his alcohol and other drug abuse was a three-week program at O'Connor House several years ago. He claimed that he had not gained much from that program. Perusal of service records - that is records of the Corrective Services - indicated that the Community Corrections organisation had put in place ""various community-based interventions that the offender had failed to take full advantage of in the past"".

52The mental health nurse at Junee Correctional Centre noted that the diagnosis of the prisoner, as I pointed out earlier, was of the prisoner being in a psychotic state upon his entry to custody and that he had remained in that state for an extended period of time. At the present time he is compliant with the medication being provided to him in respect of his mental health issues. The Probation and Parole Service states,

""Given the offender's propensity for violence and the level of violence and the current offence it would appear that an assessment for inclusion in the Violent Offenders' Therapeutic Program (VOTP) would be warranted. It is worth noting that if the offender is assessed as suitable for inclusion (in that program) there is an earliest possible release date prioritised waiting list for inclusion of up to 12 months and the time required to complete the program is approximately 12 months.""

53Of course the seriousness of this series of offences and the other matters all taken into account require the prisoner to spend much longer in custody than a mere 12 months. This brings me to what the Community Corrections Service reflected upon as the prisoner's attitude to his offending. It struck me reading the account of the Probation and Parole report that whilst he expressed regret for the offence happening he felt that what punishment he had received up till the present time by being remanded in custody was sufficient for his purposes. 

54It noted that he failed to verbalise any feelings in relation to the victim in his dealings with the Probation and Parole Service other than saying he was sorry that it happened. He was given ""several opportunities to express remorse toward the victim"" but he failed to do so. The offender appeared more concerned with how the offence had affected him and stated, ""The Court doesn't need to punish me. I've punished myself enough since it happened"".

55The presentation of the prisoner in giving evidence before me sought to paint a different picture. Mr Quinnell told the Community Correction Service that he probably needed residential rehabilitation, but was very equivocal about whether he would undertake such a program. He said that he had done it before and it had not helped him. He felt that the two years on remand had helped him, bearing in mind that he has been required to be abstinent. The report of the Community Services officer states, 

""Given the offender's lengthy and largely unaddressed alcohol and other drug abuse issues, his willingness to address these issues in a formal setting was challenged.""

56The challenges put down to him by the Community Corrections Service in relation to a number of matters are recorded in the report. The conclusion, or assessment, of the prisoner by the Community Correction Service was that the prisoner was a person with a significant history ""who demonstrated little insight into the effects his unresolved substance abuse, outstanding mental health issues, and propensity to violence had on his personal life and the wellbeing of those close to him"".

57In relation to his time in custody it was noted he had not had access to particular programs because of the lengthy time on remand and that his longstanding alcohol and other drug abuse issues remain largely unaddressed and that he would need intensive assistance both in custody and on release from custody, preferably with access to a residential rehabilitation program.

58The Community Corrections Services report has been most helpful, as has the report of Dr Furst that I will come to in a moment. When the prisoner gave evidence he said that he was much heavier now than he was when he was taken into custody and he gave me details of the medication he was taking. He is also on the methadone program. He said he had no memory of relevant events. That is an impenetrable claim, although the potential for a lack of memory is supported by the report prepared by the police medical practitioner.

59He said in his evidence before me that he accepted responsibility for his conduct; that he felt bad for what he did. He said he was really sorry. He said that he could not imagine what the victim went through. He likened it to a nightmare where you cannot wake up. He said he would take the consequences as surely he must. He also asked his partner who was sitting in Court, as I mentioned earlier, for forgiveness. He asked that his apology be accepted and expressed a happiness that she was finding new happiness herself.

60He gave some details of his use of Xanax and I accept from his evidence and the researches of Dr Furst, the psychiatrist who has prepared a report for the defence, that he was first prescribed Xanax, at least by one medical practitioner that we know of, in late June 2012 for anxiety and depression and that he had filled a prescription for Xanax a couple of days before the offences. Apparently, he obtained about 100 tablets.

61He gave evidence, as I understood the situation, he was supposed to take with that prescription half a tablet twice a day. He said that throughout the day before the offending he had been consuming or eating a lot of the tablets and consuming alcohol. It is quite clear from the evidence he gave me, and his other history of abuse of alcohol and other drugs, that he was fully aware of the effects upon him of the combination of alcohol, prescription drugs, and/or prohibited drugs.

62He gave a history of having commenced using cannabis at 14, although as I said earlier, he could not remember being given any medication for ADHD. He claimed that his offending in the past was largely because he got mixed up with the wrong crowd. He was questioned very closely about what his alcohol consumption was in the period of time leading up to the offending. The evidence he gave was a little confused. There was reference made to binge drinking and he had to be asked by me to define what exactly 'binge drinking' was. His idea of binge drinking was drinking for 12 to 14 hours at a time. He would stop and have a break and then he would return to drinking or taking more drugs.

63I must say that he was a somewhat unreliable historian in relation to his drinking habits and the detail of his evidence was somewhat vague and in parts contradictory, although I do accept that for a period of time before this offending he was prone to 'binge drinking'. In fact, he has probably been involved in binge drinking for many years beforehand. When questioned about his abuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs he freely admitted that he had had opportunity to be deterred from taking them in the past but had not taken up those opportunities. He had not taken up opportunities to address his drug-taking in part because he said it was difficult to give up drugs and he freely admitted that he felt good taking drugs.

64He said that the relationship between himself and the victim was somewhat drug and alcohol co-dependent and there is some other history relevant to this, but in this particular matter there can be absolutely no suggestion on the facts available to this Court that the crimes with which I am concerned had anything at all to do with any alcohol or drugs that the victim had consumed. This is not a case of two drunken people sitting in a kitchen getting into an argument over something trivial, escalating into serious violence. As the facts make clear, the victim was in bed asleep when the prisoner decided to take out his frustrations upon her.

65The prisoner said he was prepared to undertake programs for relapse prevention and the Violent Offenders' Program. He said that the offending had led to him ""losing everything"" and going nowhere and he wanted to get away from Batlow and start a new life with the assistance of his brother. If he was going to move to Adelong, of course, he was not moving very far away from Batlow. 

66He talked about his time in segregation and his condition whilst in custody, particularly his medical condition in the first few weeks or months, and he also gave evidence about his limited association protection. I accept that he has been denied access to programs but that would also follow from him being in remand, which is precisely what the Community Corrections Service wrote. The prisoner has been on remand now for over two years.

67The Crown's cross-examination of the prisoner concentrated on a very important issue in this case, an issue that seems to be quite self-evident when one closely examines the pre-sentence report and the prisoner's criminal history. The prisoner has been subject to parole on a number of occasions. The Crown concentrated on two such occasions. The sentencing in the District Court in 2002 and the sentencing in the Local Court in 2010. In relation to both of those sentencing exercises from the criminal history there are identified as conditions of supervision the need for the prisoner to undertake identified drug and alcohol counselling and rehabilitation.

68Although the Crown did not take him through all of his criminal history, one would be surprised if, in fact, he was not required to undertake similar programs when he was on parole on other occasions, even if judicial officers did not fix conditions of parole. One would have throughout the Parole Authority, with the extensive history it would have available to it, would know that this was necessary in the prisoner's case.

69He accepted in his evidence that his gaoling in 2002 was a 'wake-up call' as to the dangers of mixing alcohol and drugs and agreed that likewise in 2010 he got another wake-up call in relation to those issues. Yet he never heeded the warning. He said that although he got some benefit from the Getting SMART program as it is described, he had not really addressed the fundamental issues that contributed to his offending on this occasion. He gave evidence that when he was at large if he took drugs he did not think he would drink alcohol. Alcohol made him black out and would cause him to do things that he could not remember, whereas taking drugs did not have that effect.

70However, he admitted that he knew that by taking Xanax and drinking alcohol he would 'black out'. In fact, it is not clear, at least implicit in his evidence, that whilst he had only been taking Xanax on the history available to me for a period of some six weeks before this offending, clearly he had abused Xanax and alcohol in that period of time. He knew that taking drugs and drinking alcohol was part of his problem and he really had not addressed those matters. He said whilst he wanted to take issue with some of the contents of the Community Corrections report he really offered no detail as to what, if anything, could be said of the report to be inaccurate. He believed that the current term of imprisonment, being the longest term of imprisonment that he had been subject to, had assisted him greatly by forcing upon him sobriety. 

71Dr Furst's report I have already referred to, and I must say I have seen a number of reports of Dr Furst's over the years. This is one of the more detailed reports prepared by him, and it seems to me quite a balanced report in a range of ways. It notes a number of aspects of his history, both generally and medically. It is to be said, however, that the prisoner has no history of admissions to psychiatric hospitals in the community, although his GP once referred him to a psychologist in Batlow in 2011. Whilst GPs have been obviously providing him with prescriptions for treatment of anxiety and perhaps depressive symptoms, there has been no diagnosis before he came into custody on this occasion of the existence of a major depressive illness or any other mental illness.

72So far as his history of drug use he, as I have said earlier, he commenced using cannabis from the age of 14 to 17 years. The picture sought to be put by his counsel in submissions was that the evidence suggested that he had been effectively a drug 'addict' since he was 14. There is nothing in the material available to this Court, even on the material dependent entirely upon the history provided by the prisoner, to support such a contention. But I do accept that he has been a user of drugs from time to time for a lengthy period of time and may have been dependent on some drugs from time to time.

73What he did tell the psychiatrist of some significance was that he had been taking up to 15 to 20 Xanax pills per day and also took Rohypnol pills in the period before his arrest. I took this to mean, as I have already outlined, not just on the night before or the morning of the commission of the offences but for some weeks beforehand. He had also been using what are described as Fentanyl patches, a potent opiate, on a daily basis, drank alcohol, and used a small quantity of ice in the days before his arrest. He estimated using drugs, especially Xanax and Fentanyl, for about 10 months at a problematic level. I go back to what I said earlier in passing that the medical records of him being prescribed Xanax in late June 2012 do not reveal necessarily, from his own history, his use of Xanax commenced at that particular point of time.

74I have noted the history of the prisoner's recollection of relevant events. I note the matters that are raised in what is described as other history. Dr Furst observed that he saw the prisoner on three occasions, which is an exhaustive and extensive period of consultation for psychiatrists preparing a report for the Court. He saw him on 12 October 2012, 19 June 2013, and 25 July 2014. The clinical observations show considerable improvement, particularly since the first consultation, although the prisoner's mood was somewhat depressed, if I could use that expression, in July 2014. There was no evidence of thought disorder. He was not paranoid and had no thoughts of harming himself, nor was he suicidal. His cognition was intact.

75The doctor also extensively examined the Justice Health records and the medications provided. The prisoner was by late October 2012 still ""bewildered"". He was claiming hearing voices and had other paranoid ideation, although by November 2012 he was much more settled. The diagnosis of Dr Furst is, firstly, a substance abuse disorder, which is selfevident; acute intoxication with alcohol, Xanax to use the commercial name, and Fentanyl on 11 August 2012; a prolonged period of drug-induced psychosis, including, as I would understand it, a period of time over which the attack occurred, and what is curiously described as ""diagnosis of personality deferred, likely antisocial traits"". I must confess that aspect of the report I found somewhat bewildering. One would not need a great deal of understanding of the concept of antisocial personality disorder to see a long history of antisocial personality disorder in the conduct of the prisoner. The criminal history in that regard is very much the 'proof in the pudding'.

76The doctor, under the heading 'Psychiatric and Psychological Mitigating Factors', reflects upon the effect of a combination of benzodiazepines and alcohol and in his opinion he said that, self-evidently so one might have thought, intoxication with the drugs and the alcohol had made him ""more disinhibited and affected his judgment about his actions and the likely consequences of his actions"". Whether, of course, this is in any way a mitigatory factor is a matter of some debate as was reflected in the discussion I had with counsel about that matter. He noted in the report that the prisoner was not ""obviously paranoid about the victim"" at the time of the attack, but at that time ""his actions in attacking her in such a serious way suggests he was very angry, agitated, irrational to a degree, and lost control as a consequence of his acute intoxication and likely drug-induced psychosis at the time"". The prisoner does not have any psychological or intellectual disability.

77Dr Furst opines that ""optimising his psychiatric treatment and targeting his substance abuse may reduce the risk of Mr Quinnell reoffending. His drinking and substance abuse will require specific and ongoing drug and alcohol counselling when he is released into the community. Future factors to address in reducing his risk of reoffending include the provision of stable accommodation, psychological counselling, and ensuring compliance with psychotropic medication should this be indicated in the future"".

78He also notes, of course, that the prisoner's history, reflecting upon his offending behaviour and substance abuse issues, presents him as an impulsive person ""somewhat antisocial"", his risk of reoffending is probably moderate to high. That must be self-evidently true without the benefit of a psychiatrist to tell us that.

79I just turn briefly to his brother's evidence in the affidavit. He noted the prisoner struggled at school. He noted the prisoner's pattern of using drugs and alcohol never really stopped in his late teenager or adult years. Sometimes he would reduce his intake, get some work, but he would never cease taking drugs and alcohol for any period of time. He said that the prisoner and the victim used a lot of alcohol and drugs throughout their relationship, but at the end of the day the prisoner cannot accord any blame to the victim for his conduct on this particular day.

80He notes that when he first saw the prisoner in custody in November, December 2012 the prisoner was not himself. He was asking what had happened. He was very upset. He was teary. He seemed shocked and worried. Of course, he no doubt would be presenting reactive to the fact, as I would understand it from the original indictment, that he was charged with offences more serious than the ones with which I am concerned. He indicated that the prisoner would like to relocate to Queensland where his mother lived before trying to get some work in Northern Queensland. He noted, in his intelligent assessment of the matter, that the prisoner had a long way to go but he knew him well and truly believed that he has finally committed to giving up his past lifestyle. It was noted the period in custody had been difficult for him and this was the longest time he had been off the grog and drugs for the time since his teenage years and that he believed that he had turned the corner and that he would support him in the future. 

81When the learned counsel for the accused rose to address me on this matter I had read through her written submissions in a very brief and superficial way and I had not fully appreciated the skill and detail of her written submissions and the relevance of those written submissions to some of the oral submissions that she made. It might be fairly said in the context of the Crown in its submissions concentrating on particular aspects of what was put that there is not much by way of disagreement concerning the principles to be applied in this matter between the Crown and the accused.

82In deference to the great skill of the counsel for the prisoner in terms of the treatment of legal principle, I propose to deal with those matters now and return to some consideration of aspects of those written submissions by reference to the very authorities that she has cited. The plea of guilty I have already dealt with and the Crown's submissions in relation to that. With regard to the significance of the standard non-parole period in relation to counts 2 and 5, very accurately, learned counsel for the prisoner has submitted in accordance with the provisions of Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act and the preceding authority of Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120, that the setting of a non-parole period is but one part of the sentencing task and it was not to be treated as a starting point where there was a standard non-parole period to be considered. 

83The correct approach, in accordance with Markarian (2005) 228 CLR 357, particularly at [51], is to identify all the factors, both statutory and common law factors that are relevant to the sentence, endeavour to discuss their significance and make a value judgment as to what the appropriate sentence is given all the factors in the case.

84The Court is to continue to assess the objective seriousness of the offence but there is no need to classify the offending or assess whether it falls from the middle range of objective seriousness. That having been said by citing [27] and [28] of Muldrock, it is to be borne in mind that s 54A(2) of the Act, which came into force in October last year subsequent to the decision of Muldrock, provides,

""For the purposes of sentencing an offender the standard nonparole period represents the nonparole period for an offence in the table to this division that taking into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence is in the middle of the range of seriousness."",

85Section 54B(2) of the Act provides,

""The standard nonparole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by a court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.""

86It might be said, of course, that reflects as I have summarised from the submissions of learned counsel for the prisoner, the 'Muldrock' position. Of course, as the High Court in Muldrock pointed out,

""The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.""

87The revised legislative provision in s 54A(2) makes that clear. In this particular matter, if I might just step ahead a little bit, it was the submission of both the Crown and the defence that the first wounding with intent offence was the lesser of the two offences in terms of objective seriousness. That is selfevidently true. The detail of that I will touch in a moment. It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that the first offence might be seen as below the middle range of objective seriousness, but the second offence in time, for the reasons advanced both orally and in writing, could be seen within the middle range of objective seriousness.

88The Crown, however, said that the second offence in time was above the middle range of objective seriousness. With regard to the assessment of the objective seriousness, it was conceded in the written submissions of counsel for the accused, quite obviously so, that the conduct of the prisoner was ""brutal and sustained"". There were three ""unprovoked attacks on the victim"". The first attack occurred upon the victim when she was laying in bed and I would suggest really defenceless, as she was on the second occasion. She was within her own home. The prisoner was within his own home too, but that does not, in my view, lessen the aggravation of the victim being entitled to believe that she might be safe in her own bed, or in her own home, from violent attack.

89It is not to be forgotten, of course, in relation to, for example, matters of domestic homicide and the like and serious acts of domestic violence, such as this, that the attacks do occur within the homes of the victims where they should be entitled to believe that they are safe. In relation to both count 2 and count 5 there is an absence of planning. There is an absence of premeditation in relation to count 2. One might have thought on the objective facts that whilst there was not a great deal of premeditation, probably a matter of some minutes in relation to count 5, there was greater premeditation in that matter than in the offence reflected in count 2 for several reasons. Firstly, the prisoner had completed his first attack on the victim, the victim had left him. Then the prisoner had been confronted by his brother and his brother's girlfriend who was promptly assaulted. They tried to dissuade him from causing the victim any further harm and then he went to where the victim had sought refuge and forced his way, notwithstanding her resistance, into the room. 

90In relation to the count 2 I accept the submission that the injury to the victim, if not superficial, was not as serious an injury as inflicted later. The weapon involved was a pair of scissors. Although I do not think there is any doubt that a pair of scissors is quite capable, if administered to the right part of the body, of causing a fatal injury to the victim. In relation to count 5 there are other considerations, however, allowing for the lack of planning. Firstly, that attack occurred after the initial attack upon the victim and then an interregnum of some short period of time, although the prisoner was still as highly affected by alcohol and drugs as he was on the first occasion. The victim would have been particularly fearful having regard to what had happened to her before. The prisoner attacked her in the bathroom armed with a pair of scissors and a knife to occasion the wounds. In what order I was not informed either from the bar table, from the facts, or any other source of information. The prisoner knew that the victim was defenceless because she had laid in a foetal position and made herself obviously, by her body action, unwilling to resist him, although she had pleaded with him not to assault her. But he went ahead and assaulted her. 

91It is submitted that he inflicted seven wounds, I am prepared to accept that enumeration, which injuries are said to be superficial injuries. The truth of the matter is the injuries to the hands are clearly defence injuries. The victim, very forlornly, was trying to protect herself from the blows of the prisoner and being stabbed or cut in the hands despite the fact she was putting up her hands indicating to the prisoner to stop. As to the seriousness of the injury to the tendons I cannot reach any concluded view about that because I do not have sufficient evidence, but it is not ""superficial"".

92However, both in relation to count 2 and count 5, there is the fact that the wounds were primarily directed at the head, in the first instance, and the head and the throat in the second instance, and whilst the weapons in question do not necessarily represent as lethal a weapon as might be seen in cases of this type, it is correctly identified in the submissions that there is no need to have a weapon in order to commit the offence upon the victim. There was, as I said earlier, discussion about the location of the wounds in the context of the injuries that are identified in the facts. 

93In relation to this aspect of the matter, the seriousness of the injuries suffered by a victim of such an offence is an important aspect of determining the level of culpability in relation to an offence under s 33, as it then was in the Crimes Act. I was taken to particularly the decision of Mitchell and Gallagher v R [2007] NSW CCA 296. The facts of that are not important for particular analysis, save for the fact that in that particular matter the victim, who was aged 25, suffered a catastrophic brain injury that left him in a vegetative state like a living death. The prisoners in that matter, the respondents to the Crown appeal, were very young men, 21 and 20 years with almost negligible criminal histories. The Court of Criminal Appeal said this at [27],

""The nature of the injury caused to the victim will, to a very significant degree, determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. This is not to underestimate the intent component of the offence. After all, that is the element that makes the offender liable to a maximum penalty of 25 years as opposed to seven years for an offence under section 35 (of the Act) but there is less scope for variation in the nature of the intention to do grievous bodily harm when determining the seriousness of a particular instance of the offence than there is for variation in the nature of the injury inflicted. It should be borne in mind that if the victim had died the respondents would have faced a charge of murder. The injury suffered by the victim was, as her Honour noted, little short of death.""

94In that case it was held that the nature of the injury could be envisaged in the very worst category. Ultimately, their Honours concluded that the finding by her Honour that the offending was within the middle range was in error. The offending was above the middle range and thus the sentences were adjusted. I have come to the conclusion in the context of all relevant matters that having regard to the nature of the injuries, taking into account the location of the injuries as well, the offence reflected in count 5 is within the middle range of objective seriousness. I bear in mind, of course, that it has been said that the 'middle' range of objective seriousness is not necessarily a ""narrow band"". The matter that saves the offence from being above the middle range of objective seriousness is the character of the injuries and the fact that fortunately for the victim - and it may, as I said earlier, be only a matter of good fortune given the intoxication of the prisoner - the injuries were not as serious as they might have been. 

95There are some other features of the matter, however, that fall from the written submissions and from the authorities that I have to take into account. It is correctly pointed out that the offences with which I am concerned are offences of domestic violence of a most serious nature. In such matters, as is pointed out and is long held by courts of high authority, matters of specific and general deterrence, denunciation and the protection of the community are important considerations. 

96This brings us to the issue of the significance of the prisoner's intoxication. For the purposes of determining the relevance of that in the context of the submissions made by learned counsel for the prisoner, I have considered its relevance in assessing the ultimate penalty to be imposed. In the decision of Mitchell, to which I earlier referred, the Court of Criminal Appeal said at [34],

""There was little mitigation of the objective seriousness of the offence from the fact that the respondents were intoxicated by alcohol and the use of illegal drugs and that this, in some way, caused their uninhibited violence towards the victim. The Court cannot permit a person to rely upon the fact that he had been ingesting illegal drugs as in any way excusing offending conduct or its consequences. It may be mitigating insofar as it indicates that the offence was impulsive and unplanned and that the offenders' capacity to exercise judgement was impaired Waters v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 219 [38]. In this case its chief relevance was as to the prospect of the respondents' rehabilitation in light of the evidence that they had both been addressing that issue.""

97The decision of Waters, to which I was referred, states (at [38]),

""The fact that an offender was intoxicated at the time of committing an offence is not of itself a reason for mitigating the sentence that should be imposed on the offender. However, the fact that an offender was intoxicated at the time of committing the offence may be taken into account as mitigating the objective criminality of the offence, insofar as it indicates that the offence was impulsive and unplanned and that the offender's capacity to exercise judgement was impaired (citing Henry v The Queen [1999] 46 NSWLR 346, particularly as per Woods CJ and CL [273]). In the present case it is clear that by reason of his state of intoxication the applicant's conduct was impulsive and unplanned and his capacity to exercise judgement was seriously impaired.""

98I am prepared to make that finding in relation to this prisoner in respect of count 2. That finding has some resonance and relevance to the assessment of the conduct of the prisoner in relation to count 5, but it is somewhat limited or restricted by the fact that the prisoner's conduct as demonstrated, in relation to count 5 and again in relation to count 7, followed upon the intervention of third parties. The entreaties upon the prisoner to desist from his conduct fell on 'deaf ears'.

99In the decision of The Queen v Coleman ((1990) 47 A Crim R 306) which has been cited in the written submissions of counsel for the prisoner, Hunt J, then himself the Chief Judge at Common Law, said (at 327),

""The degree of deliberation shown by an offender is usually a matter to be taken into account. ... intoxication would therefore be relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the offender's breach of the law. In some circumstances it may aggravate the crime because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated. In other circumstances it might mitigate the crime because the offender has, by reason of that intoxication, acted out of character.""

100The first thing to be observed about this prisoner is that the prisoner had not ""acted out of character"". He may not have acted with such violence before towards a partner or some other person, but his acts of violence when affected by alcohol and drugs or a combination of both were reflected in his criminal history. It should also be pointed out that the prisoner, in my view, was well aware of the potential for risk to him and others by his ingestion of prescription drugs and alcohol and yet he went ahead and ingested what he would describe as copious quantities of Xanax and alcohol reflecting what could fairly be described as recklessness on his part as described by Hunt CJ at CL.

101There is one other decision I wish to quote in the context of the very interesting and helpful discussion I had with learned counsel about this aspect of the matter, given detailed written submissions, the full quality of which I had not fully appreciated last Tuesday. I refer to the citing of Antonio Jose Mendes v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 103. In that judgment Davies J, quoted with approval the observations of Rothman J in a decision of Stanford [2007] NSWCCA 73, particularly at [52] - [55] which includes the passage that I have cited from Coleman. Davies J said at [75]; 

""In the present case the intoxication came about from two selfadministered drugs as well as alcohol. There was deliberation involved in both the drug taking and the alcohol consumption or at the very least recklessness. The statements made by the applicant to Mr Glancy suggest that the ingestion of the drugs for the specific purpose of becoming aggressive was not out of character. In all the circumstances, far from drug taking being a mitigating factor, it was an aggravating factor, although the sentencing judge did not specifically regard it as such.""

102With respect to the submissions, as I have said earlier, it also becomes an aggravating factor in the way in which Hunt J particularised in Coleman in this particular case. Having said that I note what Wood J said in Henry, reference to which I have already made. It is to be pointed out that the particular matters that he reflected upon, having relevance to the assessment of objective facts and subjective circumstances, arising out of drug addiction as a motivation for committing the offence of armed robbery, are also concerned with the issue of motivation for committing other crimes. There is nothing relating to the prisoner's ingestion of alcohol or drugs that is in any way concerned with the prisoner's 'motivation' here. Of course, what his Honour says about 'impulsivity' of the offending, has relevance at least in relation to count 2, as with the lack of planning in relation to that count, and to some extent in relation to count 5. I have taken that into account in this matter.

103I accept that the prisoner's ingestion of drugs also affected his capacity to exercise judgement, to appreciate the consequences of his act. But as Davies J pointed out, these were actions by him following upon entirely voluntary abuse of alcohol and drugs in circumstances where there was no compelling reason for him to have ingested the alcohol or drugs and where he was well on notice of the dangerousness of this conduct. So far as the origins of his dependency on the Xanax or prescription drugs and alcohol, there is little in the way of his background that casts any light upon this. 

104There is no reason to believe that simply because he had behavioural problems as a 13yearold he was preordained to be an abuser of drugs and alcohol. In any event, any causal connection between his developmental problems and his circumstances at 35 were well and truly severed by the effluxion of time and the multiple interventions of agencies trying to assist him following upon offending, whose assistance he refused to accept or could not accept with any dedication. Furthermore, in relation to the Henry matters, I note as well that Wood J pointed out that a person's background of abuse of drugs in the general sense may reflect or impact upon their prospects of recidivism and rehabilitation, which, as he points out, may be a ""two edged sword"". Such is the case here.

105The reference to drug addiction and related addictions not being the matter of personal choice was the matter of debate in Henry. I know that Simpson J disagreed with the Chief Justice's analysis, but nobody could argue that issues of free choice or personal choice or some other force operating upon the prisoner which compelled him to behave the way he did here could offer any mitigation in this particular case.

106With regard to the submissions of counsel for the prisoner, I have taken into account her analysis of what Dr Furst said and other histories relating to the prisoner's upbringing. Again, I have already pointed out it offers little in the way of explanation and nothing in the way of mitigation for the prisoner's conduct on this night. I have noted what has been put about protective custody and I have taken those matters into account. Of course, the lengthy remand of the prisoner has been a result not of the prisoner's fault, of course, but also a result of the matter being committed for trial and the time that it has taken for the matter to be finally resolved.

107The prisoner, once sentenced, will be classified and will have access to programs, subject to any claims of protection I cannot predict what will happen in the future in that regard. So far as his segregation in the first ""three months of custody"" I take that to be entirely a matter of preservation of the prisoner. So far as his rehabilitation and future prospects are concerned, it is submitted that because of his admission of his guilt, the fact that he states that he is genuinely sorry, the fact that he ceased illicit drug taking (as he must whilst in custody one would have expected) and claims no interest in returning to his past lifestyle and is mentally stable, as well as his good behaviour in custody and the support of his mother and brother, speaks favourably of his prospects of rehabilitation.

108I have taken all those matters into account. But I also have to take into account his failure to take advantage of the opportunities offered in the past. I am fully appreciative of the time that he will be required to spend in custody he will come out a changed man and hopefully that change will be for the better. But I am unable to conclude that he has real prospects of rehabilitation that could be found favourably to him on the balance at the present time.

109So far as totality of criminality is concerned, I have structured the sentences to be imposed by reference to the totality of criminality. I have afforded a marginal accumulation of count 2 upon count 7. The sentence for count 7 must of necessity be the least sentence. I have also accumulated the sentence to be imposed for count 5 upon count 2. I am usually reluctant to multiple accumulations in respect of three separate offences, as opposed to more than three separate offences, particularly occurring close in time, but it seems to me, with respect, that bearing in mind the assault occasioning actual bodily harm occurred last, that the prisoner pursued it with such vigour having inflicted wounds upon the victim inside the house, had chased her and had attacked her with much severity, albeit without causing substantial or significant injury, that particular crime in this context requires some further term of custody to reflect its individual seriousness.

110The commencement of the date of sentence shall be from 11 August 2012. I have favourably considered the issue of ""special circumstances"" to the benefit of the prisoner, apart from those arising from the partial accumulation of sentences (see s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). There clearly is a need, if the prisoner is prepared to take it up, for an extended period of supervision to assist the prisoner to adjust to community living and to give him an extensive opportunity to demonstrate his capacity for reform by taking up those avenues of drug rehabilitation, alcohol rehabilitation and the like that, of necessity, he will need to undertake. Six years or five years, or three years or two years, of abstinence is no cure for a person who has abused drugs and alcohol over what he claims to be a 20 year period. The minute he goes back into the community he is vulnerable to and susceptible to outside influence. He needs just more than abstinence to avoid the temptations of the future. 

111I have referred, in part, to the Crown's helpful submissions. I have already pointed to what the Crown had concentrated upon. The Crown properly put to the Court that it was of significance in this sentencing exercise that the prisoner's offending behaviour, that is, aggressive, violent behaviour when affected by alcohol and drugs, was not uncharacteristic and the prisoner was well on notice of the dangers of that and had denied himself the opportunity, when it was given to him, to address these matters even when under the compulsion of parole.

112The prisoner is correctly to be identified as a person who presents in certain circumstances, not when sober of course, but when affected by drugs and alcohol, a danger to others in the community and the prisoner had failed opportunities to rehabilitate himself. I have already dealt with the assessment by the Crown in its very helpful submissions as to the categorisation of the objective seriousness of the offending. I have already dealt with the issue of the submission that the offending in count 5, whilst more serious than the offending in count 2 to some degree, was above the middle range of objective seriousness and I have already pointed out whilst I accept some of the features of the matter are selfevident, as the Crown points out, the ultimate injuries that were suffered need to be considered as well even, if they are, in part, a matter of happenchance.

113I have dealt in passing with the matters that arise under s 21A(2) and (3), that is the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors that exist in addition to those that are selfevidence from the pleading in the elements and the facts understood in the context of common law principles. In regard to the issue of aggravating factors in relation to counts 2 and 5, I have pointed to the fact that the victim was attacked in her own home albeit in the home of the prisoner himself. It is to be pointed out, of course, sometimes it is thought that attacks upon strangers might be viewed more seriously than attacks upon persons that are known to the assailant, but that is not necessarily the case. 

114The approach of the Courts to the treatment of domestic violence offences, particularly those involving extreme violence or significant violent attack is consideration, as the defence correctly pointed out, to greater weight being given to personal deterrence and general deterrence. With regard to mitigating factors, I found, as I earlier indicated, that the offending was not planned or organised criminal activity. That is selfevident. I am prepared, ultimately, notwithstanding the equivocation of the prisoner in his discussions of this matter with the Community Corrections officer, that the prisoner has sought to show remorse by, in his evidence here, accepting responsibility for his actions and acknowledging the harm that he had caused to the victim. But these offers of remorse, which I do accept as a mitigating factor on balance, have to be seen in the context of the delay that has taken place before the prisoner got to this position.

115I am prepared to accept as well, because of his ingestion of prescription drugs and alcohol, the prisoner was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions. But as I have earlier pointed out, the prisoner's past behaviour had certainly put him on notice of the dangers of such behaviour and that matter in mitigation is not of great significance. I must say in passing the report of Dr Furst does not point to any mental condition or mental illness such as to warrant consideration of lesser weight being given to general deterrence as discussed in cases such as Engert or Scognamiglio. I am mindful, of course, of the summary of the relevant principles undertaken by McClelland CJ in the decision of De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194, to which I have referred in earlier matters in these sittings. His Honour, in that decision, sought to analyse those authorities prior to 2010 that dealt with the relevance of a mental illness or a mental disability in sentencing.

116As I understood the submissions put to me, no submission was made that lesser weight should be given to general deterrence in the way in which the matter has been assessed in the authorities to which I have referred. In any event, in this particular matter there is nothing in the character of the prisoner's condition or mental condition which warrants consideration of hardships of custody as might exist for someone who is mentally ill or suffering from a mental disability.

117Even if it could be said properly that the prisoner by reason of a selfinduced drug psychosis was entitled to lesser weight being given to general deterrence, need would be given to consider what Gleeson CJ said in Engert ((1995) 84 A Crim R 67), that the very character of the condition that would give rise to that consideration would need greater emphasis to be given to specific or personal deterrence having regard to the criminal history of the prisoner.

118The Crown conceded that the prisoner's criminal history was not an aggravating factor, but it certainly is not a matter that entitles him to any particular leniency. It has been pointed out in the cross-examination of the prisoner that it demonstrates the past failure of the prisoner to take up the opportunities offered to him in the course of parole supervision. Nothing was put to suggest in any way that the prisoner's condition in any way reduced his moral culpability for the offending with which I am concerned. 

119His plea of guilty is, of course, itself a mitigating factor. That is reflected, too, in the discrete discount he gets for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. Ultimately, in this matter when all is said and done, even though there is a need to promote his rehabilitation despite his mature age and his past criminal history, this is a case where issues of personal and general deterrence, adequate punishment, protection of the community, denunciation of the conduct of the offender, and recognition of the harm to the victim and making the prisoner accountable for his actions have significant roles to play.

120The last matter I wish to refer to is the material contained in the statistics that have been provided. Again, they do not assist a great deal. The most they do is provide the Court with some general range of penalties that have been imposed by the 'Higher Courts', as I would understand it, between 2008 and 2013. In fact, in the decision of Mendez there is a discussion of ranges of penalties in relation to cases involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm or acting with intent, as is the case in the decision of Mitchell. But no cases were provided to me for any comparative purpose. Ultimately, all the statistics can tell me is the general range of penalty imposed in relation to a range for conduct, facts of which are largely denied to the Court.

121Ultimately, for the prisoner, Mr Quinnell, I have concluded that the starting point of any sentence in relation to count 7, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, should be two years and nine months in the context of a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. In relation to the offence identified in count 2, the starting point of any sentence imposed should be five years imprisonment and the starting point for any of the sentence in relation to count 5 should be seven years and six months before the discount for the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty. The total sentence upon which I have settled for this prisoner is a sentence of nine years two months imprisonment with a non-parole period of six years. 

122Could you stand up, thanks very much, Mr Quinnell? I am sorry to have taken so long, but there is quite a deal of territory to cover.

123In relation to count 7 you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years four months to date from 11 August 2012 and to expire, on my calculation, on 10 December 2014. 

124In relation to count 2, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of nonparole period of two years and six months. That will commence from 11 December 2012 and expire, on my calculation, on 10 June 2015. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of one year, nine months. 

125In relation to count 5 you are convicted. In sentencing you in relation to that matter I have taken into account the matter on the Form 1. You are sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and two months to date from 11 June 2015 to expire on 10 August 2018. In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of three years and two months to expire on 10 October 2020.

2704696,R v Seller; R v McCarthy (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 1288,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	In the complex circumstances of this case, I consider that to tender a document without an accurate copy having been provided to the opponent for his consideration as to its admissibility and other matters denies that opponent procedural fairness.
	
	
	I also consider that, in the absence of an accurate working copy, which I have respectfully repeatedly requested, I am unable to fulfil properly my role as the tribunal of fact on the motion, in light of the plethora of documents, evidence, and legal issues that I will be required to assess and resolve.
	
	
	I note that the motion was originally listed for three days and is now in its fourth. Yesterday, the proceedings ground to a halt because of the logistical difficulties experienced by the legal team for Mr McCarthy. Without the need for any persuasion, I granted, in effect, an adjournment of a full day, and by that I mean almost 24 hours, to permit those logistical difficulties to be overcome.
	
	
	At 10am this morning, when it became apparent that my simple request for three identical folders with regard to each documentary exhibit was still not able to be complied with, I indicated that I would grant a further adjournment of one hour, but no more. Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy expressly agreed with that way forward.
	
	
	It seems that proposed Exhibit 11, namely, exhibit PH15 volume 5, does not comply with my request. In particular, the copy that has been provided to senior counsel for the Crown is not identical to the copy that is proposed to be tendered. I consider that the tendered document denies procedural fairness to the Crown. I reject its tender on the motion.
	
	
	It goes without saying that if, before the close of the documentary evidence, a proposed tender document can be “whipped into shape” (if I may use that expression), and if it can comply with my request with regard to procedural fairness, and with my request with regard to me properly fulfilling my role as the tribunal of fact, there can be a further application for it to be tendered.

		24 September 2015",2014-07-30 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704701,Milsom v R [2014] NSWCCA 142,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Charges and sentenceThe applicant entered a plea of guilty before the Chief Judge of the District Court on 2 May 2013 to a charge that he did, on 18 April 2012 at Glebe in the State of New South Wales, being armed with an offensive weapon namely an axe, rob Gurmit Singh of certain property, namely a sum of cash, a number of packets of cigarettes and a quantity of telephone credits and at the time of that robbery, did wound the said Gurmit Singh.
2The plea of guilty was accompanied by a three and a half page Statement of Agreed Facts signed by the applicant.  His co-accused, James Simon (Simon), also entered a plea on the same charge.  The offence was contrary to s98 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum sentence was imprisonment for 25 years and which had a standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 7 years.
3The sentence proceedings were heard before Maiden DCJ on 28 June, 19 July and 9 September with judgment delivered on 13 September 2013.  The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing 25 July 2013 and expiring 24 January 2016, with a balance of term of 3 ½ years expiring 24 July 2019.  Simon was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and with a balance of term of 3 years.
Grounds of Appeal
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal from that sentence on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - The sentencing proceedings miscarried because:
(i) His Honour cross-examined the applicant about the circumstances of his acquisition of the tomahawk on 28 June 2013.
(ii) His Honour asked the Prosecutor to obtain and tender the applicant's Custody Management Records.
(iii) His Honour refused bail at the conclusion of proceedings on 28 June 2013 without any application being made by the Prosecutor and without hearing from the applicant.
(iv) His Honour dismissed an application that he disqualify himself for apprehended bias without delivering any reasons.
(v) His Honour initiated a conversation in the court ante room with counsel which was not recorded in which he indicated that he could not send the applicant to gaol and in which he urged the Prosecutor to tell the DPP not to appeal his decision.
(vi) On 19 July 2013 his Honour granted bail without the applicant making any application for bail.
(vii) His Honour extensively cross-examined the applicant about his drug related offending on 9 September 2013.
(viii) His Honour failed to indicate to the applicant that he was actually contemplating a sentence of about 6 years' duration.
Ground 2 - His Honour erred by failing to mitigate penalty as a result of the applicant's mental illness.
Ground 3 - His Honour erred in finding that the applicant knew that his offending was going to be a consequence of his bingeing on dangerous substances.
Ground 4 - His Honour erred by failing to mitigate penalty as a result of the applicant's intoxication.
Ground 5 - His Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried because of his findings that the applicant had engaged in criminal behaviour which occurred over a long period of time and that he was involved in significant drug offending.
Ground 6 - The sentence proceedings miscarried because the applicant had been left with a justifiable sense of grievance given the sentence imposed upon his co-offender, James Eric Simon.
Ground 7 - The sentence was in all the circumstances manifestly excessive.
Agreed Facts
5The following is extracted from the Statement of Agreed Facts signed by the applicant.  The applicant was born in 1975 and was aged 36 at the time of the offending.  Simon was then aged 26.
6The applicant and Simon spent the evening of 17 April 2012 together and early on the morning of 18 April agreed to ""do a job"".  The applicant took a hand axe/tomahawk which he had purchased the previous day and placed it in the pocket of his shorts.  He and Simon decided to go to the 7 eleven store in Cowper Street Glebe which was about 200 metres from the applicant's residence.  Both he and Simon had been to the store on previous occasions as customers.
7At about 2.45am on 18 April the applicant walked into the store followed by Simon.   The staff member on duty, Mr Singh (Singh), was sitting on the right side of the store.  The applicant, who had a blue scarf wrapped around his head partially covering his face, walked straight up to Singh while holding the axe in one hand.  Simon, who had followed the applicant into the store, approached Singh from the other side.  Simon also had his face concealed behind a grey coloured scarf with a black baseball cap.  Both offenders grabbed hold of Singh and pushed him into the storeroom where he could not be seen from outside the shop.  
8Once inside the storeroom, the applicant and Simon punched Singh around the head and shoulders.  Simon demanded money from him while the applicant demanded the ""safe key"".  One of them threatened Singh by saying ""I will kill you if you don't give us the money"".  Simon was holding a knife with a blade 15 cms long.
9As the applicant held onto Singh by his shirt, Simon held the knife by the handle with the point towards Singh.  When Simon pushed the knife towards him, Singh grabbed it by the blade to protect himself.  Singh was cut on his left hand around the ring finger as a result of catching the sharp edge of the blade with his bare hand.  The wound immediately starting bleeding.
10Singh was struck several more times and then Simon produced a metallic pistol (subsequently shown to be a toy).  Simon pointed the pistol towards Singh's face and said ""I have the gun where's the money?""  Singh believing the pistol to be real was in fear of his life and said ""The money's at the front, I will take you there.""  The applicant and Simon continued to threaten Singh.  The applicant swung the axe at Singh's legs forcing him to step back.
11The applicant and Simon found a backpack which belonged to Singh on a cabinet nearby.  They looked through the bag and removed a small amount of cash.  The applicant and Simon kept Singh inside this room for a few minutes before escorting him to the front counter where he was told to open the cash register.  Simon pulled a cordless phone off the counter and smashed it against the floor to prevent its use.  Singh was in such fear that he co-operated with the commands given to him as best he could.  He entered the code on the cash register to release the till.  
12Simon took several notes from the till and placed them in his pocket before loading the rest of the cash into small 7 eleven plastic bags.  The offenders noticed a safe under the counter and demanded that Singh open it.  Singh was unable to do so as he did not know the code.  Simon and the applicant became angry and pushed Singh around again.  Simon punched Singh in the face knocking him back into a corner.
13The applicant told Singh to open the cigarette cabinet and put cigarettes into a plastic bag.  He was unhappy with the way Singh was loading the plastic bag and swung the axe in Singh's direction in a threatening manner and started placing his preferred brand of cigarettes into the plastic bag himself.  The applicant found a bundle of Vodafone phone credit cards on the counter which he pocketed.
14The applicant saw another cabinet next to the safe and tried to force it open by hacking it with his axe but was unsuccessful.  The applicant and Simon remained inside the store for about 10 minutes in total.  The entire incident was recorded on the surveillance cameras inside the store.
15During the robbery a witness was walking along Glebe Point Road with the intention of entering the shop.  He saw what was happening and heard a loud voice coming from inside the store saying ""Open it up or we'll shoot you"".  The witness hailed a taxi and the taxi driver contacted the police.  The police arrived on the scene with full lights and sirens a short time later.
16The applicant and Simon heard the sirens and ran out the door carrying the cash and cigarettes.  They dropped the plastic bags containing the cash and the cigarettes in front of the store.  The applicant ran south along Glebe Point Road and was apprehended by police officers.  A search of the applicant resulted in police seizing the axe, the knife and the ""firearm"" used in the offence.  A bundle of Vodafone credits and some cigarettes were found inside his pockets.
17Simon was also apprehended nearby.  He was arrested and cautioned.  Police recovered an amount of cash which he had taken from the cash register inside his pants pocket.  Police became concerned that Simon was at risk of self-harm and took him to the Royal Prince Hospital for a mental health assessment.
18Singh was taken to Sydney Hospital.  He was in pain from a number of bruises which he sustained around his face, shoulders and arms, as well as from the wound on his left ring finger.  He received four stitches to that wound.  He was discharged from the hospital shortly afterwards.  Singh was traumatised and distraught from the experience and was unable to work for several days.
19The applicant was taken to the Newtown Police Station where he agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview in which he admitted the offence.  The property taken in the robbery included $644 in cash, 18 packets of cigarettes valued at $294 and Vodafone credits valued at $918.  Of this all but $67 in cash was recovered by the police and returned to the owner.
The applicant's subjective case
20It is necessary to say something about the applicant's subjective case in order to understand the issues which arose during the sentence proceedings.  The applicant at the time of the offending was a successful artist, having won the prestigious ""Sulman Award for Modern Art"" which is awarded by the Art Gallery of New South Wales.  Unfortunately, in the course of celebrations accompanying this win, a friend provided him with a quantity of methylamphetamine and heroin on which he proceeded to binge in the weeks leading up to the offence.  
21The applicant had no prior convictions (in 1996 he was dealt with under s556A of the Crimes Act for larceny).  In addition to being a well recognised artist, he had a Masters Degree in Fine Arts and had completed a number of years of study towards a PhD in Fine Arts.  He had a long standing issue with depression and had been diagnosed in the past with a Major Depressive Disorder.  He had a history of substance abuse and had been using methylamphetamine and heroin for about 18 months before the offence. 
22The applicant had been exposed to a number of tragic episodes.  In 2000 he found his cousin dead in their shared premises, an event which caused him great distress.  In 2009 a sister died of a drug overdose.  He commenced his drug abuse in the year following her death.  His PhD supervisor was murdered by his son.  This event significantly affected the applicant who discontinued his PhD studies thereafter.  
23The applicant had experienced a dysfunctional childhood and upbringing.  His parents divorced when he was four or five years old.  His mother regularly relocated the family to hide them from his father, who was an alcoholic.  Five of his paternal uncles had suicided.  His maternal grandfather had an alcohol problem.  The applicant has a younger brother on a methadone maintenance program and his youngest brother abuses methamphetamine.
24In the past the applicant had engaged in suicidal behaviour while intoxicated, including three suicidal gestures following his arrest.  He ran at a police officer, he banged his head against the cell wall and he attempted to suffocate himself with a seatbelt in the back of the police car after his arrest.
25The applicant was granted bail following his arrest and spent time in the Sydney Clinic under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr Samson F Roberts.  Following his discharge, he succeeded in maintaining sobriety.  At the time of sentencing, he had been on bail for 14 months and he continued to be treated successfully in the community by Dr Roberts and a psychologist.
26Dr Roberts provided three reports for consideration by the Court (31 July 2012, 26 June 2013, 4 September 2013).  In the report of 31 July 2012 Dr Roberts took a history that in the period before the offence the applicant was consuming a minimum of 15 beers a day with whiskey on occasions.  He had used opiates since the age of 18 and his use had escalated over the 12 months before his admission to the Sydney Clinic.  He had been using ice for more than 18 months before the offence.
27Dr Roberts took a history that all of these substances were used ""as an escape from depression"".  The applicant had been prescribed Zoloft for depression, but had ceased to take it before the offending.  He had been treated for depression for 7 years.  At page 11 of the 31 July 2012 report, Dr Roberts said:
""In the period before the events for which Mr Milsom is before the court, he had experienced a relapse of his depression, having ceased antidepressant medication and resumed substance use.  Severe depressive illness is typically associated with apathy for consequence, impaired cognition and reasoning and vulnerability to coercion.""
The sentence proceedings in the District Court
28The sentence hearing commenced before his Honour at 2pm on 28 June 2013.  Counsel for the applicant called his partner of 6 years, Ms Crouch.  She provided background information as to their relationship, his artistic endeavours and his abuse of drugs leading up to the offence.  Ms Crouch gave evidence about the applicant's psychiatric difficulties and how he had tried to deal with them over the years.  At the time of the sentence hearing, the applicant had moved from Glebe to stay with his family in Newcastle.
29It was while Ms Crouch was giving evidence that an exchange took place between his Honour and counsel for the applicant to the effect that his Honour would not be able to make a finding of fact that at the time the applicant purchased the axe he was not intending to commit the robbery unless the applicant gave evidence (28.6.2013 - T12 - T13).  
30Character evidence was called on behalf of the applicant from Mr King, after which the applicant gave evidence. The clear inference from the transcript is that counsel appearing for the applicant had not intended to call him but did so as a result of the comment from his Honour to which reference has been made.
31The applicant gave evidence that he had little recollection of the offence.  In relation to the purchase of the tomahawk or small axe, he referred to other items bought at the same time which were consistent with him performing some painting work and handyman work at home.  He said that he had purchased the tomahawk in order to split some small pieces of wood, which were to be used in the project.  The applicant then gave evidence as to taking substantial quantities of drugs leading up to the offence.  He said:
""Well I smoked some ice in the morning, smoked some heroin sort of in the afternoon.  Smoked some more ice, took some Xanax, Rivotril, smoked some more heroin, finished off the ice that I had.""  (28.6.13 - T.40.2)
This evidence was consistent with what he had said in his ERISP at the time of his arrest.
32Just before cross-examination of the applicant commenced, his Honour requested that the police custody records be produced with a view to finding out what disclosure had been made by the applicant concerning his pre-offence drug taking (28.6.13 - T.44).  There was also an issue of whether he was capable of making an ERISP at that time.  When those documents were not readily available, his Honour adjourned the matter.  After the applicant had withdrawn, the following exchange took place:
""HIS HONOUR:  In terms of range Mr Waterstreet do you wish to be heard on a range?
WATERSTREET:  My submissions put the case better than I would in answer to that, your Honour.  We would be agitating for what's said in my submissions and that would be a non-custodial sentence and in circumstances as set out in that.  Your Honour would see attached to it the statistics from JIRS.  
HIS HONOUR:  Mr Waterstreet I'll tell you now my preliminary view is this.  I do not see this as a Muldrock type situation where the offender can seek solace in what the High Court said about persons suffering from illness.
WATERSTREET:  No your Honour but -
HIS HONOUR:  That being so this is a case which would fall much on the higher side than Henry which means I would be in appealable error if I was not to impose a significant custodial sentence.
WATERSTREET:  No your Honour.  For the reasons set out in the --
HIS HONOUR:  That's where we are at the moment.  I mean I'll consider all the material, I haven't looked at the submissions.
WATERSTREET:  Your Honour would be assisted in our submission respectfully, by reading the submissions.  Your Honour can - I go to the point your Honour - I don't think the Crown opposed bail on the 19th.
HIS HONOUR:  Well I think bail should be refused today now that we're into the sentencing process. 
WATERSTREET:  I don't think it's opposed your Honour but I've told my client that if bail was granted, that there would be no expectation that he was significant in the sentence.
HIS HONOUR:  Not for this offence Mr Waterstreet.  I propose to --
WATERSTREET:  Your Honour hasn't read my submissions.
HIS HONOUR:  No I haven't.
WATERSTREET:  Your Honour is not acquainted with the statistics and the law as set out in those cases that I've referred to.
HIS HONOUR:  But at this stage I formally refuse bail for both prisoners.  The court is adjourned to 19 July.""  (28.6.2013 - T.47)
33On 18 July before the sentence proceedings resumed, there was an application by the applicant that his Honour disqualify himself for apprehended bias.  The basis for the application was that his Honour had raised his voice on a number of occasions when asking questions of the applicant, his Honour's request for the custody records, his Honour's cross-examination of the applicant concerning the purchase of the tomahawk, his Honour's apparent scepticism as to the amount of drugs which the applicant had taken before he committed the offence and his Honour's peremptory revocation of bail.  His Honour refused the application and advised that he would give reasons at a later date.  Those reasons have not yet been given.  
34The matter resumed on 19 July in accordance with the order made by his Honour.  The morning was spent dealing with submissions on behalf of the co-offender, Simon.  In the course of those submissions, the following exchange took place between counsel for Simon and his Honour.
""ROGERS:  But if your Honour was for example to start at something around the 5 year mark which is the upper end of Henry, we would say that there has to be some further discount for the plea of guilty and the sentence can be reduced we would say further by the issue of a reduction in a consideration of moral culpability which I've put in my written submissions.  We would say that for Mr Simon might bring the head sentence to below 4 years and special circumstances could then be found which may provide for your Honour grounds to structure a sentence where he may be looking at a non-parole period of 2 ½ years or something thereabouts.  The only perhaps other factor that your Honour might need to take into account is the issue of parity.  Look it's conceded that the co-accused must receive a lesser sentence than Mr Simon and ...
HIS HONOUR:  The question is, is whether or not he receives a non-custodial sentence and in respect of parity matters, that's relevant to your client and that's ...
...
HIS HONOUR:  I raised earlier with Mr Waterstreet and I'm going to re-visit it, the issue of an ICO but of course I'd have to find for Mr Milsom that it's a matter of less than 2 years in order to do that.""  (19.7.2013 - T.18.48 - 19.28)
35During the course of submissions from the Crown in relation to Simon, his Honour said:
""HIS HONOUR:  Well just on the parity argument if it was that I was to give a say two years ICO to Mr Milsom, wouldn't I have to reduce Mr Simon's head sentence? ...""  (19.7.2013 - T.22.21)
At the end of submissions in relation to Simon, this exchange took place.
""ROGERS ...   if your Honour is reserving for that period of time, I'm ...
HIS HONOUR:  The reason being that I may subject to this afternoon to submission is to consider an ICO for Mr Milsom and that I'm told is six weeks.""  (19.7.2013 - t.24.28)
36Shortly after 2pm the sentence proceedings in relation to the applicant resumed.  The applicant's treating psychiatrist, Dr Roberts, gave evidence.  His evidence was that the applicant had experienced a difficult time while in custody between the two hearing dates.  His depression had worsened, he had been subjected to threats and had been intimidated by a cell mate.  His Honour asked a number of questions directed to whether during his treatment by Dr Roberts, the applicant had abstained from drug abuse.  Dr Roberts replied:
""ROBERTS:  A.  Yes.  And during the period in the clinic it's routine that patients are subjected to urine drug screening and - to confirm abstinence from substances."" (19.7.2013 - T.28.17)
37The effect of Dr Roberts' evidence was that continuing treatment at the clinic would be very beneficial for the applicant, particularly in relation to rehabilitation in terms of re-establishing a stable and professional existence.  Dr Roberts said that he would be pleased to play a part in the applicant's ongoing psychiatric care.  His Honour intervened on a number of occasions (but as I read the questions sympathetically from the point of view of the applicant).  His Honour's questions were directed to the applicant's abuse of drugs leading up to the offence.  One of the responses elicited by his Honour's questions was that the applicant's cessation of taking Zoloft when he commenced bingeing on drugs following the presentation of the Sulman Award, would have worsened his depressive condition (19.7.2013, T.31.1).
38After Dr Roberts finished his evidence, further submissions were made by counsel for the applicant to the effect that the applicant's depressive condition was an important matter which his Honour needed to take into account, both as contributing to the applicant's offending and as part of his subjective case on sentence.  A discussion of some length between counsel for the applicant and his Honour took place as to the effect of the evidence given by Dr Roberts.  Counsel for the applicant submitted that the applicant's circumstances, including his psychiatric condition, were such as to enable the court to make a finding of ""exceptional circumstances"" which would lead to the applicant receiving a non-custodial sentence.  In the course of those submissions, his Honour said:
""HIS HONOUR:  The Crown doesn't agree with you at this stage as I understand it.  The Crown says full time custody.  To give an ICO or a bond, I've got to get the head sentence down to two years.""  (19.7.2013 - T.48.34)
While not rejecting the applicant's submission, his Honour was clearly troubled by the seriousness of the offending.  He set out matters impacting on the objective seriousness of the offending at T.49.
39At the conclusion of those submissions, his Honour said:
""HIS HONOUR:  That's not the concern here, the concern is to look at the facts and to see what I can do with the available authorities.  If we go back to the first point it carries 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years where parliament has indicated, as a guidepost, penalties are to be increased for this type of offence.  In circumstances where there's been - as part of the crime there has been a wounding and the victim has to be considered for the, what on one view is a brutal bashing of him."" (19.7.2013, T.52.10)
40Not surprisingly, at the end of the day the Crown made the following submission:
""SHAW:  ....  My problem with this your Honour, we've had I think extensive submissions from senior counsel and a fair amount of conversation between the two but when we adjourned the last time, the offender was actually sworn in and I was preparing for cross-examination, your Honour asked him a few questions and then we came to the end of the day and I need to cross-examine him your Honour but given the doctor's evidence today that he has been off - I didn't catch whether it was three days or seven days off his Zoloft your Honour. .... it would be unfair to put him through a cross-examination at this stage when he's been off his medication.""  (19.7.2013 - T.53.1)
41His Honour agreed that the matter should be adjourned:
""HIS HONOUR:  If there is to be a delay Mr Crown, I will hear you on bail but I would be proposing to grant him bail again perhaps on the condition that he - with a reporting condition at Newcastle and he perhaps remain with someone.  I mean he needs to have someone with him and observing him."" (19.7.2013 - T.53.44)
Bail was not opposed by the Crown and was granted.
42At the end of proceedings on 19 July his Honour asked to see counsel for the applicant and the Crown in a side room off the Court.  He then spoke to both of them concerning the sentence proceedings.  Both counsel for the applicant and the solicitor appearing for the Crown have sworn affidavits as to what was said during that discussion.  While their versions are not identical, the thrust of what was said emerges clearly.
43The recollection of counsel for the applicant was as follows:
""The Judge asked to see myself and the Crown in the alcove.  In the alcove the Judge said to me words to the effect of:
Trial Judge:  We cannot send this man [the applicant] to prison.  Did you see him out there?
I've read your books, especially Repeating the Leaving.  I've given them to counsel, other barristers and people who are suffering depression.  
The Trial Judge then addressed Mr Shaw ""I want you to speak to Lloyd Babb to tell him that the DPP should not appeal this matter"".
The Trial Judge then appeared to be addressing both Mr Shaw and myself and said words to the effect:  
""I am worried about the Newcastle community because I am such an advocate against crystal meth in particular and I'm worried about an appeal.""
The Trial Judge continued to say:
""I've done my best to rack up some extra days in prison by refusing bail.""
44The recollection of Mr Shaw, the solicitor appearing for the Crown, was:
""I recall the conversation referred to by Mr Waterstreet in his affidavit of 21.2.14.  At the close of the day I was called into the Judge's side room of the Court by his associate to see his Honour.  When I arrived his Honour and Mr Waterstreet were standing facing each other, in conversation.  His Honour turned to me.  I recall the conversation as this:
HH to CCS ""Colin I don't want to send this man to prison.""
CW to both: ""The Director won't appeal if he doesn't go to gaol.  Colin can have a word with the Director?""
HH to CCS: ""Every time up in Newcastle that it's ice the DPP go mad if I don't put them in, they are always appealing [and more of the same].""
CW to both:  ""No, no-one's going to appeal it.""
CCS to HH:  ""I might put it up to the Director.""
There may have been a little more conversation than related.  Any other conversation was only repetition of the same point.  I do recall the first line from HH vividly as it came out of the blue, there was no preamble, no introduction.""
45In his affidavit, counsel for the applicant went on to say that after that conversation, he informed the applicant and his immediate family that the Judge had indicated in court and in chambers that he was not sentencing the applicant to a further period of imprisonment.  Counsel said that he reached this conclusion, both as a result of what was said in court and out of court, and the unconditional granting of bail.
46The matter resumed before his Honour on 9 September 2013.  Further evidence was tendered on behalf of the applicant comprising an updated report from Dr Roberts and a report from a psychologist.  The applicant was re-sworn and cross-examined by the Crown.  The cross-examination was directed to the applicant's pre-offence drug taking, with particular reference to what he had said in his ERISP.  His Honour commenced cross-examining the applicant at T.17.50 up to T.23.14.  His Honour's questions were directed to how and from where the applicant had obtained illicit drugs before the offence and the extent to which he and Simon had used those drugs, in particular methamphetamine and heroin at that time.
47At the conclusion of the applicant's evidence, further submissions were made by both the Crown and applicant's counsel.  In the course of submissions by the Crown, the following exchange took place:
""HIS HONOUR:  That's all right.  But look, in terms of, as we know, from the outset Mr Waterstreet says this is a matter where the offender should not go into custody further.  He hasn't had a lot of time in custody.  It's not a matter where he's done six months or nine months in custody to say that should be taken into account in a much larger way than it might be, but does the Crown say that this has to be a custodial sentence?
SHAW:  It should be, yes, your Honour, and I would not bind the Director by saying that your Honour would fall into or not fall into appealable error if you didn't send him to gaol fulltime but the gravity of the crime and the nature, the circumstances ...
HIS HONOUR:  Sorry, are you saying I can get it down to under two years custody and therefore deal with it by an ICO or a s 12?
SHAW:  I'd say that you could not do that, your Honour.  We could beat around the bush with semantics all day long but I say that would not be within scope.
HIS HONOUR:  In terms of Mr Milsom's rehabilitation, you don't dispute that he has rehabilitated.  You don't ...
SHAW:  I don't, on all the evidence.
HIS HONOUR:  ... dispute he hasn't shown adequate remorse.
SHAW:  He has shown adequate remorse.  The only other submission I can make, your Honour, is that the subjective features, which we concede are strong and in some areas powerful, should be given their due weight in the whole of the sentencing process and it is very easy for the Court to place undue weight on only those subjective features, your Honour.  ...""  (9.9.2013 - T.42.4)
48A further exchange took place between his Honour and the Crown:
""HIS HONOUR:  Well what about the submission that there are most exceptional circumstances.  They're my words, not Mr Waterstreet's ...
SHAW:  Yes, I listened to those, your Honour.  Again, he came under senior counsel's words before the court with a particularly, not unique, that wasn't the term used, but his subjective problems marked him out as it were, but many people come for sentence before these courts with tragic lives, your Honour, which involve repeated sexual, of course, assaults which haven't been disclosed ...
HIS HONOUR:  Well this is not that sort of offence.
SHAW:  No.
HIS HONOUR:  This is a man who, up until this matter, had an exemplary life and, in one way, providing some public service in terms of his assistance to other artists and to the university.
SHAW:  And I agree, on his record violence is out of character and on what ever else the court's been told, there's no indication he's otherwise a violent man, we accept that, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  And accepting that he did have major depressive disorder when he got onto this methamphetamine ...
SHAW:  But the Crown says that he had a major depressive disorder that was being adequately treated to the best means that we know at the moment, your Honour.  By the best means and to the best account.  It was his decision to discontinue that in search of something else.
HIS HONOUR:  On behalf of the defendant it's said well what's the point of sending this man to put him into custody for any further period of time?
SHAW:  General deterrence, your Honour, not specific deterrence but general deterrence.
HIS HONOUR:  But how many other 37 year olds do you see ever doing this?  That's what I'm just trying to get the concept.  If he was, say, 27, perhaps, but where you're 37 and you've had good public service, doesn't that put it in his favour?  That's what I'm struggling with at the moment. ...
HIS HONOUR:   ...  You can't have a strong as subjective case as here, and then to be balanced by general deterrence, I mean where is that line at the moment?  And I know the facts are serious, I mean the matter that concerns me, I didn't say anything to Mr Waterstreet, but, is that the time it went on, where this offender has the tomahawk and the shop assistant is around the back and then they see the safe, and at that time there's, in the facts there, I think it puts that this offender wielded the, bottom of page 2 [his Honour quotes from the Agreed Facts]
...
So it's a long period of time, and at that time they're trying to get into the safe.  So, I mean, it puts it - yep, okay.  Is there anything else then, Mr Crown?""  (9.9.2013 - T.43.6 - T.44.35)
49It was agreed between the Crown and counsel for the applicant that allowing for time spent in the Sydney Clinic, the applicant had spent 54 days in custody.  When that figure was placed before him, his Honour said:
""HIS HONOUR:  Gentlemen, I don't think, it's either going to be one or the other, I don't think I can get it down for an ICO, Mr Waterstreet.
WATERSTREET:  Well, your Honour ..
HIS HONOUR:  It's either one or the other, it's either I find most exceptional circumstances and he doesn't spend anymore time - well, I guess 54 days is a significant amount of time to go into most exceptional circumstances and ...""  (9.9.2013 - T.46.40)
50When his Honour advised that he would deliver judgment on 13 September 2013, the Crown made the following request:
""SHAW:  I was only going to ask your Honour, whatever your Honour's going to do, could we ask, for everyone's ease, that you ask for your remarks on sentence to be taken out with some haste and ...
HIS HONOUR:  Well they will be, and I'll do it on Friday, I think, for both.  You don't have to be here, Mr Waterstreet, we'll get a copy to you ASAP ..."" (9.9.2013 - T.47.30)
Remarks on sentence
51His Honour handed down sentence on 13 September 2013.  He made a number of factual findings.  His Honour found that the applicant had taken methylamphetamine and heroin in the hours leading up to the robbery and was affected by both those drugs at the time that he went to the store.  He found that the applicant gave Simon either heroin and/or ice shortly before the robbery.  His Honour found that at the time of entering the shop, it was the applicant who had taken the lead and that he made the first assault upon the shop assistant (ROS 4.2, 4.5).
52Having sentenced Simon, his Honour directed his remarks to the applicant.  On the issue of parity, his Honour said that although the applicant did not have a criminal record, he had been a drug user for many years involving ice, heroin and other prohibited drugs and that this was a matter relevant to that issue.
53His Honour reiterated his earlier finding that the applicant had provided ice to Simon.  His Honour characterised this as criminal behaviour which could not be countenanced by a court.  His Honour said:
""It is a matter that relates to his criminal behaviour which had occurred over a long period of time by his use of heroin, ice and other prohibited drugs.  Although he has no criminal convictions, he comes before this court as a person who was involved in significant drug offending and as far as I can understand it, up until recent times, made no apology for it.""  (ROS 10.9 - 11.2)
54His Honour had regard to the applicant's unfortunate background and that he had suffered from a major depressive illness for many years.  His Honour also noted the oral evidence and references as to the applicant's good character. 
55His Honour expressed some reservations about that evidence:
""However, in respect of those references, none of those persons addressed his continuing offending behaviour which gave rise to this offence, that is, that he was addicted to heroin, ice and other drugs and perhaps alcohol and despite those addictions he was seen to be a very good person.  That is a difficult proposition to accept by a court where the excessive use of a drug such as methamphetamine (ice) can have and in this case did have the effect of putting some person in fear of their life, being injured and presumably suffering the difficulties that flow from what was a vicious attack upon him.
In one way this offender does not have any excuse for his behaviours.  He is well educated, having a Masters Degree in Fine Arts and was on his way to a PhD in Fine Arts.  He has had the support of a partner/friend who is eminent in her career as a photographer.  He has the support of his sister, a well known arts correspondent for a local newspaper.  He has the support of other persons eminent in the community and despite these supports and despite the medical advice that he had had for many years and as it would appear in respect of his major depressive illness which was under control with the use of the well known medication Zoloft was able to function artistically at his highest.  
In respect of this matter the court finds that his behaviour on this night was unrelated to any underlying major depressive illness or in respect of any other illness or psychological condition that could be said to fall within the case of R v Muldrock as was submitted by his counsel.  This is an example once again in this court where a person affected by methamphetamine (ice) does something that other persons who are well known to them would not and could not understand or countenance.  But for a person who has used ice and heroin over years it was known to him as to the consequences of his actions when he binged on this dangerous substance.""  (ROS 11.7 - 12.6)
56His Honour rejected the evidence of Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, who sought to provide an explanation for why the applicant had ceased taking his Zoloft medication.  His Honour said:
""What is clear for the reasons that I have set out above and what was evidence given by the offender in this court was that he for three weeks had binged on ice and/or heroin and/or other drugs and in respect of his behaviour, that was related to the drug or drugs overtaking his normal mental facility.  In that regard a person who does that is not entitled to any diminished moral culpability.  That person is responsible because of their drug use for the consequences and their actions that flow from that drug use and that is what I have found in respect of this matter.""  (ROS 13.8)
57His Honour referred to the reports of Dr Roberts and his evidence and accepted that the applicant had been substantially rehabilitated by the treatment which he had received from Dr Roberts.  His Honour found:
""... what is clear from Dr Roberts's reports and evidence is that when on ice that particular medication overwhelmed this offender and in respect of the actions of this night, whether it be of his initiative or his co-offender's initiative, whatever they be I have no hesitation in finding that he was drug affected by methamphetamine.
I have indicated in my reasons in respect of the co-offender Simon that the community cannot accept that persons who use drugs illegally for periods of time and promote themselves as decent members of the community can then seek to get a benefit from courts when there has been long-standing criminal behaviour.  This is such a case.  This is a person who may have used drugs to overcome what had been his unfortunate history of very sad and tragic events and/or may have been used in respect of some way to gain a sense of wellbeing in respect of his artistic endeavour, but for whatever reasons, the offender knew that it was illegal to do what he was doing and he had medical assistance at least as early as 2005 by Dr Morgan and it would seem that medical assistance in the nature of Dr Roberts was available at a later point in time.
I accept that now that he has come under the care of Dr Roberts and has been now seeking counselling from a local psychologist in Newcastle he will hopefully, avoiding drugs, continue with his artistic endeavours and he will rehabilitate himself.  The rehabilitation in respect of this offender is subject to his willingness and abilities to deny his addictions; alcohol, heroin, ice and prescription drugs.""  (ROS 14.8 - 15.5)
58His Honour concluded:
""It was submitted on his behalf by Mr Waterstreet that this is a matter where there are most exceptional circumstances and that it is a matter where there should not be a custodial period save for the 50 days that he has served by way of his initial bail refusal when he was arrested, his days at the Sydney Clinic and in most recent times when he as bail refused in this matter.  The court does not accept that submission.  In respect of this matter for the reasons of the seriousness of the offence and although there is evidence of his rehabilitation and of his remorse, nonetheless the fact remains that throughout most of his adult life at least he has considered the use of drugs, heroin and methamphetamine, to be par for the course and I for this court's part cannot see any change in attitude save as for the danger and/or risk those matters form in his offending behaviours.
In the co-offender's matters the court has set out the need for general deterrence and those general deterrents need to be repeated.  In this offender's case if a person uses illicit substances that are capable and indeed alter the mind and they are a person who does have intelligence and is able to understand that matter, then they cannot seek the benefit of the law as suggested in this matter.  They must pay and must be an example to others that if they use heroin, ice or other drugs and then offend, they must be sentenced adequately and severely.  In respect of this particular offender there is a need for specific deterrence, that is, if he uses drugs again on his release, he will not get the benefit that this court will extend on this occasion.""  (ROS 15.6 - 16.4)
59His Honour acknowledged the very strong subjective case of the applicant but thought that even this was compromised by his history of prior drug taking.  His Honour said:
""He is a person not only of good character, what might be seen exemplary character, that is, that he has assisted other aspiring artists, but of course that was done in the circumstances where he was a significant drug user using drugs that could cause death and injury to others and there lies, it might seem, the dilemma for this offender and others and the matter that I have earlier referred to.""  (ROS 16.8)
60Because of the applicant's early admissions, his Honour allowed a 25 percent discount on sentence.  Before passing sentence, his Honour set out his conclusions as follows:
""The court will find that each were responsible jointly and there can be no lesser or greater apportionment of blame.  What is clear for the reasons I have already stated was this person who provided the ice to himself and most likely the ice to Mr Simon and whether money was owed to this person or not, nonetheless in terms of what was described to the court the madness of this offending, they are both responsible.  When one goes through the facts and seeks to imagine what the shop assistant at that early hour of the morning was subjected to, that is, the threat of being hit with a tomahawk, the threat of being stabbed with a 15 centimetre knife and then being shot with a pistol, as I have said, puts this certainly into the mid range of seriousness for an offence under s 98."" (ROS 17.3)
Ground of Appeal 1
61The applicant submitted that the course of the proceedings was irregular.  He submitted that although each of the eight matters raised in Ground of Appeal 1 was insufficient of itself to provide a basis for quashing the sentence imposed, taken together they did so.  The applicant submitted that taken together these matters caused the proceedings to miscarry.
(i) His Honour cross-examined the applicant about the circumstances of his acquisition of the tomahawk on 28 June 2013.
62The applicant submitted that sentence proceedings are adversarial in nature and that it is the task of the prosecution to cross-examine and challenge issues raised by the defence.  He submitted that in this case his Honour had intervened impermissibly when he made it clear that he would not accept a submission that the tomahawk was purchased for a reason unconnected with the robbery unless he gave evidence.  He submitted that this resulted in it being necessary for him to give evidence in circumstances where that would not have occurred had his Honour not intervened in the way in which he did.  He submitted that his Honour's cross-examination on that issue went beyond clarification of answers and was excessive in the circumstances.
(ii) His Honour asked the prosecutor to obtain and tender the applicant's Custody Management Records.
63The applicant submitted that his Honour interfered with the adversarial nature of the proceedings by requiring the prosecution to produce the applicant's ""police custody records"".  The applicant submitted that this direction was in a context where, implicitly at least, his Honour was expressing some scepticism about the extent of the applicant's intoxication by drugs at the time of the offending.  The applicant submitted that it was not the function of a sentencing judge to direct that evidentiary material be produced.  The applicant submitted that this circumstance was very different to where a sentencing judge might request evidentiary material or ask the parties whether a certain type of evidentiary material was going to be produced.
64The applicant referred the Court to Madden v R [2011] NSWCCA 254 where Simpson J (with whom Whealy JA and Hislop J agreed) said at [29]:
""29 ... the courts of NSW operate on an adversarial system. The roles of counsel and the judge are clearly defined and trespassing by one upon the role of the other is not to be encouraged ...  It is not the role of a judge to seek out evidentiary material, nor to determine the scope of the evidence put before him or her. ... a judge must be very circumspect in intruding into the role of counsel.""
(iii) His Honour refused bail at the conclusion of proceedings on 28 June 2013 without any application being made by the Prosecutor and without hearing from the applicant.
65The applicant submitted that before his cross-examination had been completed, before all the evidence had been called in his case, and before submissions had been made and written submissions read, his Honour peremptorily revoked bail.  The applicant submitted that this was in circumstances where he was already on bail, the Crown did not oppose the continuance of bail, no opportunity was given to his counsel to make submissions to the contrary and his Honour gave no reasons.  The applicant submitted that the overwhelming inference was that at that time his Honour had already made up his mind to impose a significant term of imprisonment.
66On that issue, the applicant relied upon Branko Balic (No 2) (1994) 75 A Crim R 515 where Cole JA (with whom Handley and Sheller JJA agreed) said at 520:
""In my view here there is no question of actual bias. It can readily be assumed that Judge Court paid full regard to all that was put to him when bail was being considered on 4 November 1994. Nonetheless the person seeking bail had been told in advance that his Honour had made the remarks quoted by Mr Ford.  Those remarks were capable of being interpreted as a pre-judgment.  Mr Balic, and the public, could reasonably entertain an apprehension of pre-judgment on the bail application.  Once such a decision is so tainted, it must be set aside.  A consequential effect is that Mr Balic, or fair-minded members of the public, could reasonably hold the view that any subsequent trial presided over by Judge Court may not have that appearance of impartiality which is necessary. There can be no doubt the trial would be conducted fairly by Judge Court, but that is not the test.""
(iv) His Honour dismissed an application that he disqualify himself for apprehended bias without delivering any reasons.
67The applicant submitted that there was a sound basis for the application that his Honour disqualify himself for apprehended bias. The applicant referred to the matters raised before his Honour when the application was made, i.e. the revocation of bail, making an observation which in effect compelled the applicant to give evidence and calling for the production of the Custody Management Records.  The applicant submitted that these were significant matters which were indicative of an apparent pre-judgment on the part of his Honour.  The applicant submitted that at the very least his Honour should have given reasons for the dismissal of the motion and his refusal to disqualify himself.
(v) His Honour initiated a conversation in the court ante room with counsel which was not recorded, in which he indicated that he could not send the applicant to gaol and in which he urged the Prosecutor to tell the DPP not to appeal his decision.
68The applicant submitted that his Honour's conduct in bringing both advocates into the ante room without any request from them, in circumstances where there could be no record of what was said, was most irregular.  The applicant submitted that his Honour's remarks about not sending him to gaol could only be interpreted as an intention on his Honour's part not to impose a custodial sentence.  Such an impression was confirmed by his Honour urging the solicitor for the Crown to obtain an undertaking from his superiors that if a non-custodial sentence were awarded, there would be no Crown appeal.  The applicant noted that this discussion took place after his Honour had reinstated bail without an application by him.
69The applicant submitted that this Court had on a number of occasions disapproved such irregular proceedings.  He referred to R v Foster (1992) 25 NSWLR 732 where Carruthers J (with whom Loveday J agreed) said in relation to consultations between legal representatives and a judge in chambers in sentence proceedings:
""The above is sufficient to dispose of this application but it is, I think, appropriate to make some observations about the practice of legal representatives consulting the judge in private chambers.
Superior courts in this country and in England have over recent years stressed the undesirability of legal representatives in criminal proceedings consulting with the judge in private chambers. These judicial strictures are, however, not always heeded, and the present case should operate as a reminder and as a warning to judges and the legal profession of the irregularity and undesirability of the practice. ...""
In Foster their Honours referred to R v Tait and Bartley (1979) 46 FLR 386; 24 ALR 473 where the Full Court of the Federal Court (Brennan, Deane and Gallop JJ) regarded the receiving by a judge of information relevant to sentencing in chambers, even with the consent of both parties, was irregular.  On this issue, the Federal Court said:
""In the present case, the confidential information was communicated to the judge not in court, but in chambers. That procedure was understandable but irregular. It was understandable because the judge sought a way of securing the confidentiality which the circumstances suggested were desirable. Nevertheless the procedure was irregular, for the judge received material relevant to the sentence out of court and in his private chambers. The consent of the parties provides no warrant for such a procedure, though we were assured from the Bar table that the practice was a usual one, and that it has the support of English authorities. The practice by which a judge in chambers exercises the jurisdiction of his court, which Dixon J described as a 'well-understood mode of exercising the judicial authority belonging to a judge in virtue of his office as a judge of the Supreme Court' (Medical Board of Victoria v Meyer (1937) 58 CLR 62 at 97) is not a practice which authorizes a judge sentencing a prisoner to receive in chambers information which is calculated to affect the sentence. If his court cannot be closed without statutory warrant, a fortiori he cannot hear submissions in his private chambers. ..."" (P 405)
70Having analysed the authorities, the conclusion arrived at by Carruthers J in Foster at 741 was:
""These cases demonstrate that consultation between the judge and legal representatives of the parties in a criminal case is fraught with danger and to the extent that it still exists the practice should cease. I find it difficult to envisage a case where, if sufficient precautions are taken, any problem arising during the course of a criminal trial cannot be resolved in open court in the absence of the jury. Certainly, when it comes to advising the judge of assistance rendered or to be rendered by a prisoner to the authorities the sealed envelope procedure should be adopted. To the extent that it is necessary to give evidence of an oral nature then a little tact and commonsense should avoid undue publicity.
It cannot be too strongly emphasised that private discussions place the judge in an invidious position if a dispute subsequently arises between the judge and counsel as to what had transpired, if for no other reason than that the judge cannot give evidence as to his or her version of events. Although, I am constrained to add the comment that I consider the practice of members of the legal profession seeking to give evidence of what transpired in a judge's private chambers to be professionally distasteful. The preferable course is for all concerned to avoid the problem ever arising.""
71In Foster Smart J said at 742D:
"" ... It is highly undesirable that matters of this kind or any matter of consequence should be canvassed in private chambers in the absence of the accused. It is important to avoid having to refer to what is said in a judge's private chambers between the judge and the legal representatives in the absence of the parties.  Frequently there is no common recollection as to what was said. Disagreements or inability to recollect what was said in private chambers may lead to one or other of the parties having a sense of disquiet.  Neither the judge nor the legal representatives should be expected to have to remember what was said for future use.""
72The applicant submitted that the manner in which the proceedings were conducted thereafter should be considered in the light of his Honour's out of court comments.  He submitted that both parties were given the impression that his Honour was minded not to impose a significant period of imprisonment and was likely to impose a non-custodial outcome.  In that regard, this sub-ground of appeal should be considered with (vi) and (viii).
(vi) On 19 July 2013 his Honour granted bail without the applicant making any application for bail.
73The applicant submitted that the unconditional granting of bail on 19 July 2013 was a clear signal that his Honour was minded to impose a non-custodial sentence.  This was consistent with the out of court position which his Honour indicated to counsel on that day.
(vii) His Honour extensively cross-examined the applicant about his drug related offending on 9 September 2013.
74The applicant submitted that his Honour's cross-examination of him on 9 September 2013 as to the source of the drugs which he had been using went considerably beyond that which was appropriate in sentence proceedings.  It raised issues which had not been pursued by the Crown.  The applicant noted that he had consistently asserted that his co-offender, Simon, had been his regular source of drugs.  The applicant accepted that after considerable questioning he conceded that in the weeks preceding the offence, he had shared drugs with Simon (9.9.2013 - T.22.13).  The applicant submitted that this was the only evidence in the proceedings that suggested that he had provided drugs to Simon but was the basis for his Honour's adverse conclusion that he had provided ice to Simon and that he ""was involved in significant drug offending"" (ROS 11.2).
75The applicant submitted that his Honour's cross-examination on 9 September was an inappropriate intervention in the proceedings that it gave rise to his Honour reaching an important conclusion which was adverse to him and which led to the imposition of an inappropriately higher sentence.
(viii) His Honour failed to indicate to the applicant that he was actually contemplating a sentence of about 6 years' duration.
76The applicant submitted that from the time of the out of court discussions on the afternoon of 19 July, very little occurred to put his legal advisers on notice that his Honour was considering a sentence of 6 years or more.  He submitted that the submissions of both advocates focused on whether the applicant's sentence would be more or less than 2 years, such as to allow the court to fully suspend the sentence.
77The applicant submitted that during the course of the proceedings on 19 July, the exchanges between the bench and the advocates focused almost entirely upon whether an ICO or a suspended sentence would be appropriate.  He submitted that the exchanges and submissions on 9 September were to similar effect and drew attention to his Honour calling on the parties to address him as to whether there were ""most exceptional circumstances"" justifying a non-custodial outcome.  The applicant noted that even though the Crown had not accepted that proposition, his Honour had tested the Crown's position with a series of questions relating to rehabilitation, remorse and his major depressive disorder in a context which could only be regarded as favourable to him.  The applicant submitted that this impression was further strengthened by the inquiries by his Honour as to the exact number of days he could be considered to have spent in fulltime custody.  The applicant submitted that the judge's final remarks to his counsel could only be interpreted as an indication that his Honour was of the opinion that the case was close to the margin of being a non-custodial sentence.
78The applicant submitted that because of the clear impression given by his Honour on 19 July and 9 September, his legal advisors were denied the opportunity to make submissions in opposition to the course that his honour ultimately took.  The applicant submitted that his legal advisors were also denied the opportunity of making submissions as to the length and structure of any custodial sentence imposed.  By way of illustration, the applicant submitted that had he been on notice that his Honour was considering a sentence of about 6 years, his legal advisors would have stressed parity and the sentencing factors that favourably differentiated him from Simon.
79The applicant submitted that the eight matters identified in this Ground of Appeal constituted significant irregularities in the sentence proceedings which ultimately worked to his disadvantage.  The applicant submitted that the sentence proceedings were marked by inappropriate intervention by his Honour, inappropriate communication with the legal advisors in private and indications which seriously misled his counsel as to the sentence which his Honour was going to impose.  In that regard, the applicant submitted that the proceedings on 19 July and 9 September had miscarried in that it was apparent from his Honour's comments that he was using a ""bottom up"" approach to sentence, i.e. he had a sentence in mind and was looking for factors to justify that sentence rather than adopting the proper approach of taking all factors into account and as a result of a consideration of those factors, reaching a final sentence.
80The applicant submitted that the irregularities in the sentence proceedings were such that procedural unfairness had occurred and that there had been a miscarriage of justice.
Crown submissions as to Ground of Appeal 1
81The Crown submitted that in relation to (i), there was a live issue as to the purpose of the purchase of the tomahawk.  In the circumstances, his Honour was entitled to ask questions of the applicant to test that issue.
82The Crown submitted that in respect of (ii), there was no objection by counsel for the applicant when his Honour called for the Custody Management Records and that ultimately there was no finding adverse to the applicant made as a result of their production.  As with (i), the Crown submitted that even if there were some irregularity (which was not conceded) there was no adverse effect on the applicant in the sentence proceedings.
83The Crown submitted that in relation to (iii), the revocation of bail occurred after a discussion about the likely penalty, the discount for the plea and the fact that the court was now conducting sentence proceedings.  The Crown submitted that in those circumstances it was appropriate for his Honour to revoke bail.  The Crown submitted that his Honour had clearly not prejudged the matter, given the subsequent protracted nature of the proceedings and the changes in approach which occurred during them.
84In relation to (iv), the Crown submitted that although reasons had not been given by his Honour, the basis for his rejection of the application that he disqualify himself was amply set out in the transcript of the application of 18 July.  In answer to a submission made by counsel for the applicant, his Honour responded:
""HIS HONOUR:  With respect to Mr Waterstreet and Dr Roberts I was concerned - or am concerned - about matters set out in the record of interview in respect of - that may have been seen not to be in the offender's favour.  On one view of it, accepting what appears to be the accepted evidence of his drug use leading up to this event, he should not have been questioned if he was affected by drugs, as he was at that point in time.  Frankly in respect of the issue of the purchase of the tomahawk I think that is irrelevant because it's not the purchase of the tomahawk during the day, it's the taking of the tomahawk from the studio in Glebe to the 7-Eleven.  That's the issue.  But your predecessor had emphasised those matters.  My concern is that in terms of a Muldrock type situation, the essential evidence was not being adduced.  That's what the document I thought might go to and as you know that custody record could still be objected to and would be objected to by you or Mr Waterstreet if the Crown sought to tender it.  You accept that I take it?""  (18.7.2013 - T.5.13)
85In relation to (v), the Crown submitted that the out of court conversation between his Honour and the legal representatives made it clear that his Honour had not earlier prejudged the issue.  
86In relation to (vi), the Crown did not accept that bail was granted without the applicant making any application.  The Crown referred to the evidence of Dr Roberts about a place being available at the Sydney Clinic if the applicant were released.  Implicit in that evidence was an intention to apply for bail.  Having heard that evidence, his Honour simply pre-empted any application for bail by accepting its accuracy and granting bail.  The Crown submitted that this was yet another indication that his Honour was carefully considering the evidence as it emerged and had not prejudged the matter.
87In relation to (vii), the Crown submitted that there was a live issue concerning the applicant's depression, his decision to take himself off Zoloft and his use of ice and heroin in the days and hours preceding the offence.  The interrelation of those matters formed an important part of the defence case that his Honour should find exceptional circumstances and that there was a causal nexus between the applicant's depression and his participation in the offence.
88The Crown submitted that in those circumstances, given the importance of the issue, his Honour was entitled to extensively cross-examine the applicant about his drug taking before the offence.
89In relation to (viii), the Crown submitted that it had never conceded the appropriateness of an ICO.  The Crown submitted that the possibility of a substantial custodial sentence remained a real option in the proceedings and there had been a decision by the applicant's legal advisors not to address that issue, rather than them being misled by anything which his Honour said.  The Crown submitted that the applicant was not denied any opportunity to put his case.  The Crown submitted that the sentence proceedings were extensive and protracted and the submissions, both written and oral, by the applicant went for significantly longer and were at significantly greater length than those put forward by the Crown.  The Crown submitted that applicant's counsel exhausted all the arguments which could be put in the applicant's defence.  Nothing was left unsaid and nothing more could have been added.
Consideration Ground 1
90At the hearing of this application for leave to appeal against sentence, senior counsel for the applicant was asked whether he wished to challenge the factual findings by the sentencing judge, or whether if the appeal were successful, he wished this Court to re-sentence the applicant on the basis of those findings.  Senior counsel for the applicant was not prepared to accept those findings on a re-sentencing of the applicant.
91These sentence proceedings were lengthy and included extensive oral evidence including that of the applicant and Dr Roberts.  His Honour had the advantage which we lack, of seeing and hearing those witnesses.  Given the conclusions which I have reached in relation to Ground 1, I do not see how this Court could re-sentence the applicant without relying upon the findings of fact made by his Honour.  If as I have found, the process of fact finding was affected by the matters raised in Ground 1, the only alternative is for the sentence to be quashed and for the sentence proceedings to be remitted to the District Court to be heard by another judge of that Court.
Grounds 1(i) and (ii)
92I am not persuaded that these Grounds of Appeal gave rise to any practical disadvantage for the applicant insofar as they relate to whether procedural fairness was observed in these sentence proceedings.  While it is undoubtedly correct, as the applicant submitted, that sentence proceedings are adversarial and a judge should not trespass upon the role of the advocates, to the extent that it occurred here, it did not adversely affect the applicant.
93His Honour's comments that he could not make a finding favourable to the applicant in relation to the purchase of the tomahawk unless he heard from the applicant were appropriate in the circumstances.  His Honour was merely indicating to the applicant's legal advisors the way in which he was thinking so as to enable them to meet the problem if they so wished.  It is true that his Honour's cross-examination of the applicant was vigorous but it did not result in a finding unfavourable to the applicant.
94His Honour's request for the applicant's Custody Management Records is more controversial.  A judge in sentencing proceedings should not require production of a particular piece of evidence.  He or she can, of course, advise the parties that unless evidence of a certain kind is adduced he or she will or will not be able to make a particular finding.  It is then a matter for the parties as to whether they wish to take steps to deal with the issue raised by the court.
95Another way in which courts traditionally deal with such an issue is to inquire of the parties whether evidence of a particular kind is going to be tendered or relied upon thereby indicating at the very least that the judge regards such evidence as being of importance, but leaving it to the parties as to whether or not they adduce the evidence.
96To require the production of evidence, as his Honour did in this case, is unusual and in my opinion, does cross the boundary identified by Simpson J in Madden v R in that the judge in such circumstances is clearly trespassing upon the role of the advocates.  Such an approach should be disapproved by this Court.
97In this case, however, there was no practical detriment suffered by the applicant in that the evidence when produced did him no harm.
Grounds 1 (iii) and (iv)
98These grounds give rise to more serious issues.  The revocation of the applicant's bail at the conclusion of proceedings on 28 June clearly involved a denial of procedural fairness insofar as the applicant was concerned.  That denial of procedural fairness involved matters of bias and procedure.  Insofar as apprehended bias is concerned, an independent observer would undoubtedly form the opinion that at that point in time his Honour had prejudged the proceedings at least to the extent of concluding that a custodial sentence should be imposed.  The basis for the forming of such an opinion was that the applicant had been on bail for 14 months, the evidence was substantially incomplete, no application to revoke bail had been made by the Crown - on the contrary, the Crown did not oppose bail being granted - and no opportunity was given to counsel for the application to make submissions.
99There was procedural unfairness in that it was clear that his Honour had not read the extensive written submissions which had been placed before him on behalf of the applicant and because he did not give an opportunity to counsel for the applicant to make oral submissions.  The transcript makes it clear that the attempt by counsel to do so was peremptorily cut off.
100Although, as the Crown correctly points out, the revocation of bail on this occasion did not produce any practical disadvantage for the sentencing outcome, the way in which it was dealt with was unsatisfactory and it is appropriate that this Court indicates its disapproval.
101Similar comments can be made in relation to the application for disqualification on 18 July.  While his Honour addressed in the course of argument the complaints concerning his cross-examination of the applicant and his requirement that the Crown obtain and tender the applicant's Custody Management Records, he did not address the complaint related to the revocation of bail.  That unsatisfactory state of affairs was exacerbated by his Honour's failure to provide reasons at that point in time, or at least before the sentence proceedings resumed, as to why he refused to disqualify himself.  That is not to say that his Honour should have disqualified himself but the failure to give reasons would have increased the perception of the applicant and his legal advisors that the requirements of procedural fairness were not being observed.
102As with Grounds (i) and (ii), however, despite the unsatisfactory nature of what had occurred up until that point in time there was no practical disadvantage which adversely affected the outcome of the sentence proceedings.  If these were the only problems in the sentence proceedings, although they clearly involved irregularities, it would be difficult for the applicant to successfully argue that a miscarriage of justice had occurred in relation to the sentence imposed on him.
Grounds 1(v), (vi) and (viii)
103The out of court meeting between his Honour and the legal representatives of the parties was not only irregular, it should not have occurred.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, this Court strongly disapproves of any such discussions, be they in the course of a trial or in sentence proceedings.  This is particularly so if they are initiated by the judge.  The observations in R v Foster remain as valid today as when they were made.
104Although the recollections of the legal advisors, as set out in their affidavits, are not identical, three significant aspects of the meeting are clear:
(i) It was initiated by his Honour.
(ii) There was a clear statement by his Honour that he did not think the applicant should receive a custodial sentence.
(iii) His Honour was concerned about a Crown appeal if he did not impose a custodial sentence and was trying  to elicit some assurance from the Crown representative that no appeal would be brought.
105The attempt to bring pressure on the Crown representative in this way was quite inappropriate, should not have happened and is strongly disapproved by this Court.  Leaving that aspect aside, when taken with his Honour's express desire not to impose a custodial sentence on the applicant, it provides a firm basis for the applicant's primary complaint that the sentencing proceedings involved procedural unfairness insofar as he was concerned, resulting in the sentence ultimately imposed giving rise to a miscarriage of justice.
106In comparatively recent times, a substantial body of jurisprudence has developed in relation to the issue of procedural fairness in sentence proceedings.  The first of these cases was Baroudi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 48.  Price J (with whom Sully and Howie JJ agreed) gave the leading judgment.  
107The factual background was that in the course of submissions a concession was made by the Crown in relation to the length of the non-parole period.  The applicant asserted that the conduct of the judge during submissions on sentence suggested strongly that he intended to act upon that concession.  However, in his remarks on sentence some time later, the judge did not refer to the Crown's concession and imposed a non-parole period 12 months longer than that which was indicated in the concession.  It was common ground that the submissions of counsel for the applicant were confined by his understanding that the judge had accepted the Crown's concession.
108In giving his reasons, Price J referred to the observation of Kirby P in Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282 at 296 where he said:
""It used to be said that ""silence"" in a judge was ""a counsel of perfection"": see The Queen v Watson Ex parte Armstrong (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 294. However, at least in the case of a trial judge sitting without a jury that view has now been disapproved by the High Court of Australia: see Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 571.  Respectfully, I strongly endorse the view there expressed.  Fair procedure requires, at least for important decisions and those critical to the determination of a case, that considerations of importance to the judicial officer's conclusions should be drawn to the notice of the parties affected or their representatives so that a fair opportunity is presented for contrary argument to persuade the judicial decision-maker to a different view.""
109Price J set out his conclusion on this issue as follows:
""33 In the present case, it was open to the Judge to indicate that either his views were tentative or that he neither accepted nor rejected the Crown concession.  Such an indication would have afforded counsel the opportunity to dissuade the Judge from imposing a lengthier sentence. With respect to his Honour, his inadvertent failure to do so denied the applicant procedural fairness.""
110A similar situation arose in Button v R [2010] NSWCCA 264.  In the course of submissions, the judge said that a head sentence needed to be ""somewhere between 2½ and 3 years"".  That was followed by a comment to the effect that given the applicant's status as a first time offender and his strong prospects of rehabilitation ""release after one year in gaol and perhaps 18 months or 2 years on parole"" would be appropriate.  There were further exchanges along the same lines.  At the conclusion of submissions, the judge said that he would reserve but that ""the effect of it will be I intend to release him within a year of his going into custody .... and there will be supervised parole but probably for between 18 months and 2 years"".  Ultimately the sentence imposed was one of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months.
111The leading judgment was given by Latham J (with whom Simpson and Kirby JJ agreed).   Her Honour said:
""14 At the heart of the denial of procedural fairness claimed in this appeal is the absence of an opportunity to be heard further in relation to a matter of penalty, where the applicant relied upon a representation by the Judge that a particular sentence was to be imposed, and the Judge departed from that representation without notice to the applicant.
15 Gleeson CJ said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 at [35] and [37] ; (2003) 214 CLR 1 at 14 :-
""But what must be demonstrated is unfairness, not merely departure from a representation. Not every departure from a stated intention necessarily involves unfairness, even if it defeats an expectation. In some contexts, the existence of a legitimate expectation may enliven an obligation to extend procedural fairness. In a context such as the present, where there is already an obligation to extend procedural fairness, the creation of an expectation may bear upon the practical content of that obligation [13]. But it does not supplant the obligation. The ultimate question remains whether there has been unfairness; not whether an expectation has been disappointed.
...
Fairness is not an abstract concept. It is essentially practical. Whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice.""
16 There are essentially two explanations for the Judge's departure from the representation that he made in the course of submissions.  One is that, in the intervening 11 days in the course of a busy country sittings, without the benefit of a transcript, his Honour had simply forgotten the details of the exchange with counsel.  The other is that his Honour arrived at a different sentence after further consideration of the matter.  If the latter is the explanation, one would have expected some reference to the reason for the revision, either in the remarks on sentence or by way of a further conversation with counsel, before delivery of sentence.  Had that occurred, this Court could not be confident that further submissions from the applicant's counsel would not have persuaded the Judge to reinstate his previous representation.
17 If the former is the explanation, it would be surprising if a reminder from the applicant's legal representative of the Judge's earlier proposed sentence would not have prompted the Judge to revise the sentence. 
18 It is not necessary to determine what the explanation is.  In either case, the applicant has demonstrated a ""practical injustice"".  The Judge went beyond a mere indication of sentence and announced the sentence he was going to impose.  The applicant is entitled to receive the sentence that was accepted by the Judge and the parties as an appropriate sentence in all the circumstances.  There is no suggestion from the Crown in this Court that such a sentence is manifestly inadequate.""
112The next in the sequence of cases is Weir v Regina [2011] NSWCCA 123.  There the Crown conceded in submissions that on the basis of a psychiatric report the sentencing judge was entitled to mitigate the penalty which he would otherwise have imposed by reason of the applicant's mental illness.  The Crown also accepted that it was open to the judge to reduce the moral culpability of the applicant by reason of that mental illness.  In an exchange with counsel for the applicant the judge expressed a ""tentative view"" that the absolute minimum sentence would have to include imprisonment with an 18 month non-parole period and a balance of term of 18 months.  Shortly thereafter, the judge said ""Not binding myself to that actual sentence, but considering it highly likely that would be the sentence that I would impose ... Would you like to discuss that with your client""?  After discussing the matter with his client, no further submissions were made by counsel for the applicant.  The sentence ultimately imposed was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months.
113The principal judgment was that of Garling J (with whom Macfarlan JA and Johnson J agreed).  His Honour set out the relevant legal principles as follows:
""64 It is clear that an offender is entitled to procedural fairness during criminal proceedings, including proceedings on sentence: Pantorno v The Queen (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 472-3 per Mason CJ and Brennan J, 482-483 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282; Baroudi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 48; Button v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 264. 
65 The particular form which procedural fairness dictates may vary. That is because the content of the requirement of fairness may be affected by what is said and done during the proceedings: Re Minister for Immigration & Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; ex parte Lam (2003) 214 CLR 1 at [34] per Gleeson CJ. Here the relevant process was the sentencing of Mr Weir by King DCJ in circumstances where, the applicant contends that, King DCJ indicated the sentence that he proposed to impose.
66 The key to determining whether there has been a breach of the requirement of procedural fairness is to ascertain the consequence of any departure from the dictates of proper procedure because what is ultimately in issue is whether unfairness has resulted from the process: See Lam at [34]. The concern of the law is to avoid practical, and not merely theoretical, injustice: Lam at [37].

67 One common basis for demonstrating that practical injustice and unfairness has occurred is where an individual has lost the opportunity to make submissions to the decision maker in opposition to a proposed course and in support of a course which he urges: Lam at [36]; Button at [18].""
114Garling J found procedural unfairness and set out his reasoning:
""75 King DCJ imposed a lengthier sentence on the applicant than that which he had indicated he was minded to do. True it is that he had used the word ""tentative"" when he first expressed his view.  But this was quickly followed by the expression with respect to the sentence ""considering it highly likely that that would be the sentence that I would impose "". It was then followed by his giving the applicant's lawyer the opportunity of having a conference with the applicant, specifically to obtain instructions about what the judge had said. 

76 It is clear that the applicant's lawyer, having taken express instructions from the applicant during an adjournment, granted by King DCJ for that purpose, declined to make any further submissions for his client on sentence.  He accepted, in short, that what the sentencing judge had indicated would be an appropriate exercise of the discretion of the sentencing judge.
...
78 ... there has been a practical injustice and substantial unfairness in at least two respects.  First, the applicant has received a longer sentence of imprisonment. True it is that the difference in what was indicated and what was imposed affected only the period that the applicant would be on parole.  But this is nevertheless part of a sentence of imprisonment. The applicant during that period is constantly at risk of being returned to imprisonment if a breach of his parole occurs.  It may take some time for that breach to be then dealt with by the State Parole Authority and the applicant's liberty will be lost during that period. This is not a matter of triviality.
79 Secondly, if a sentence of imprisonment is of 3 years or less, then the offender is automatically released on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period determined by the sentencing judge: s 50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The trigger for the release is an order of the sentencing judge. If a sentence of imprisonment is longer than 3 years, the date for release on parole is determined by the State Parole Authority. Again, that difference in mechanism for release is not a trivial one.""
115The same issue arose in Ng v R [2011] NSWCCA 227.  The basis for complaint in that case was that the sentencing judge failed to warn those acting for the applicant that he proposed to impose a sentence longer than that indicated during the proceedings on sentence.  In the course of the sentence proceedings, the judge proposed a starting point for the sentence of 30 years and said on a number of occasions that he would make no findings adverse to the applicant by comparison with his co-offender.  The total effective term of imprisonment imposed on the applicant was imprisonment for 37 years with a non-parole period of 27 years and 9 months.  When imposing the sentence, the sentencing judge made a number of adverse findings against the applicant by comparison with his co-offender.  
116In relation to the ground of appeal raising procedural fairness, the Court (Bathurst CJ; James and Johnson JJ) said:
""41 This Court has observed that it will not normally find an error of principle from interchanges between the Bench and counsel, since judicial views expressed during submissions do not necessarily reflect a considered decision: R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 at [11]; R v Thompson [2005] NSWCCA 340; 156 A Crim R 467 at 474-475 [32]. It is the judgment of the Court which ought be considered for this purpose, and not exchanges between the Bench and counsel during the course of submissions.
42 Of course, the Applicant does not seek to rely here upon exchanges during submissions to demonstrate an erroneous view of law or fact on the part of the sentencing Judge. Rather, the Applicant submits that the course of events demonstrates a denial of procedural fairness to the Applicant.""
117The Court, having set out with approval the summary of relevant principles provided by Garling J in Weir v R, stated its conclusions: 
""44 It is, of course, necessary to read fairly the entirety of the sentencing transcript and the remarks on sentence, for the purpose of determining whether practical injustice has been demonstrated in this case. 

45 It is apparent that his Honour articulated to counsel the 30-year starting point, utilised in sentencing Lo, as a prima facie starting point for the sentencing of the Applicant for murder. Soon after the jury had returned verdicts, his Honour stated this approach. His Honour's later comments reinforced this construction and understanding.
46 His Honour expressed this view as being subject to any submissions from the Crown. The submissions of the Crown Prosecutor did not contend for a different conclusion. In fact, the Crown submitted that ""the sentence should be the same"".
47 The Applicant's trial counsel approached the issue of sentence, as a matter of practical reality, upon the basis that an upper limit of 30 years constituted the starting point for the murder count, subject to any reduction flowing from acceptance of the Applicant's submissions. In circumstances where the Crown effectively endorsed the sentencing Judge's approach, it is understandable that the Applicant's counsel did not seek to address further on that issue.
48 We are satisfied that there has been a practical injustice, and substantial unfairness to the Applicant in this case in at least two respects. 

49 Firstly, the Applicant received a longer sentence of imprisonment on the murder count than that which had been identified clearly by the sentencing Judge in the course of submissions, without any indication from his Honour that his view had altered in this respect, accompanied by an opportunity to make further submissions on the issue. 

50 Secondly, the finding that the Applicant was ""a markedly more dangerous man"" than Lo (as an apparent basis for moving upwards from the 30-year starting point) had not emanated from any submission from the Crown nor from any exposure of his Honour's provisional thought processes during the sentencing hearing. To the extent that the question of dangerousness was referred to at all in submissions, his Honour had said ""There is no reason to think he is more dangerous than the acts which he has already committed would demonstrate or no reason to think that there is any psychological problem which mitigates his responsibility"".""
118Most recently the same issue arose in Tran v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 85.  In the course of sentence submissions in that case, the sentencing judge indicated that his assessment of the range of objective seriousness of the offence was middle of the range.  Both the Crown and counsel for the applicant agreed with that assessment.  Subsequently, in his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence at ""well above the middle of the range of seriousness for such offences"".
119On the hearing of the appeal, the Crown accepted that unfairness did arise in the circumstances, being a denial of the opportunity for senior counsel for the applicant to make additional submissions to the sentencing judge in opposing a sentence greater than that which had been indicated.  Hall J (with whom R A Hulme and Davies JJ agreed) found that the concession by the Crown had been properly made.
120Applying those principles to the facts of this case, the overwhelming conclusion is that procedural unfairness has occurred.  The exchanges in court on 19 July and 9 September, together with the out of court communication between his Honour and the legal representatives on the afternoon of 19 July, made it clear that the sentence under consideration by his Honour ranged from a non-custodial sentence at one end of the spectrum to something more but not greatly more than imprisonment for 2 years at the other.  There was no mention by his Honour, or by the parties, of a head sentence of 6 years or anything like it.  On the contrary, the tone of the submissions was consistent with the out of court discussion.  The Crown was clearly expecting a non-custodial sentence which explains his request at the end of the proceedings that his Honour expedite the production of a transcript of his remarks on sentence.
121The practical injustice is clear in at least two respects.  The applicant received a longer sentence than that which had been identified clearly by the sentencing judge in the course of submissions without any indication from his Honour that his opinion had changed in this respect.  In addition, he lost the opportunity for his counsel to make further submissions on that issue in particular submissions relating to parity.
122Those considerations are enough to make out that part of the ground of appeal based on a lack of procedural fairness.  There is, however, another basis for the success of this ground which arises from the irregular communication between his Honour and the legal representatives on the afternoon of 19 July.  The meeting was instigated by his Honour.  An impartial observer being aware of that fact and being aware of his Honour's indication that he did not want to gaol the applicant but was concerned that there might be an appeal which he wished to discourage, would have a reasonable apprehension that at that point in time, the sentence proceedings would not be dealt with impartially and not decided according to law.
123The analysis of this part of the appeal is set out in the judgment of Beech-Jones J. I respectfully agree with and adopt both his Honour's analysis and conclusions on the issue of apprehended bias.
Ground 1(vii)
124I have concluded that this part of Ground of Appeal 1 has also been made out and that procedural unfairness occurred.
125It needs to be appreciated that the cross-examination of the applicant by his Honour, to which reference is made in the Ground of Appeal, occurred after the applicant had given his evidence in chief and had been cross-examined by the Crown.  The cross-examination by his Honour was extensive and occupied over six pages of transcript.  It was in relation to a subject which had not been raised on by the Crown, i.e. where the applicant had sourced his illegal drugs and what he had done with them (apart from ingesting them himself) in the period leading up to the offence.  These two issues were irrelevant to the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced.
126The unfairness arose because his Honour was not seeking clarification of evidence which had been given, but was trespassing on the function of the advocates.  This is particularly so when the subject matter of the questioning was irrelevant to the sentence proceedings.  However, the most important element of unfairness arose because his Honour used the responses which he received to his questions as a basis for a finding that the applicant had been supplying drugs to Simon in the weeks leading up to the offence.
127That finding did not emanate from any submission by the Crown nor was it revealed by any exposure of his Honour's provisional thought processes during the sentence hearing.  In those circumstances his Honour should, at the very least, have indicated to the applicant's legal advisors the way he was thinking so as to enable them to make submissions to the contrary.
Conclusion as to Ground 1
128Ground of Appeal 1 has been made out in the respects which Beech-Jones J and I have identified.  The departure from procedural fairness and the apprehension of bias in the sentence proceedings were such that the sentence will have to be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced.  This does not mean that the Court will simply substitute a sentence within the range which was indicated during the sentence proceedings.  Were this Court to re-sentence it would be necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements, sentencing principles and most particularly the evidence, in order to formulate its opinion for the purpose of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 as to whether some lesser sentence was warranted (Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 at 287 [19]).  
129As indicated at the beginning of the consideration of this ground, that task is significantly complicated because the applicant has challenged important findings of fact by the sentencing judge.  Given the protracted nature of the sentence proceedings and that important evidence was given by witnesses which this Court has not seen and assessed, I am not persuaded that this Court is in a position to re-sentence the applicant.  It is my opinion that the matter should be remitted to the District Court for the re-hearing of the sentence proceedings be heard by a different judge.
130Because of the conclusion which I have come to in relation to Ground 1, and the need for the sentence proceedings to be reheard, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to deal with the other Grounds of Appeal, lest this Court be thought to be expressing an opinion as to what sentence should be imposed on the applicant.
131On that issue I wish to make it clear that this Court has not formed any opinion as to the appropriate sentence which should be imposed on the applicant in the re-sentence proceedings.  It would be quite wrong to assume or infer from anything which I have said that I endorse the range of sentences which were discussed in the exchanges between the advocates and his Honour.  It should be clearly understood that the sentencing of the applicant on the re-hearing of the sentence proceedings is entirely a matter for the discretion of the judge to whom the sentence proceedings are allocated.
132I have included in the Orders that the re-hearing take place before a different judge.  Once the apprehended bias ground has been made out, it would be inappropriate for the matter to be heard by the same judge.
133The orders which I propose are:
(1) The sentence imposed by Maiden DCJ on 13 September 2013 is quashed.
(2) The sentence proceedings in relation to the applicant are remitted to the District Court for re-hearing by a different judge.
(3) The applicant's bail is continued until further order.
134ROTHMAN J:  I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and of Beech-Jones J.  I agree with the orders proposed and, except as to that which follows, the reasons therefor.
135Ordinarily, an exchange in argument between judicial officer and legal representative will not form the basis of error in sentencing.  One of the exceptions to that general proposition is where the exchange is evidence of a denial of procedural fairness or an incorrect approach to the task being undertaken. 
136Each of the grounds with which Hoeben CJ at CL has dealt is in one of those categories.
137The sentencing judge enquired as to whether the applicant was to give evidence in circumstances where his Honour made it clear that he would not find in the applicant's favour in the absence of such evidence on the significant issue of whether the weapon (a tomahawk) had been purchased with the robbery in mind.  To what did such a finding go? 
138It is relevant to a finding of aggravating factors in s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, namely, the existence and extent of planning involved in the offence.  It may also be relevant to a mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(b) of the aforesaid Act, but only to the extent that there was no planning involved (which I do not understand was a suggestion). 
139If the sentencing judge was seeking to use the factor as an element of aggravation, namely the degree of planning, it was an aspect for which the Crown bore the onus. 
140In the particular circumstances of the present sentencing matter before the judge below, there was a fine line between drawing an inference of planning from earlier conduct and the suggestion that it was for the applicant to prove (or satisfy the judge) of this aspect in order that it be considered ""favourably"" for the applicant.
141In my view, his Honour reversed the onus of proof when his Honour required the applicant to prove he did not purchase the tomahawk for the purpose of the robbery.  Nevertheless, no issue was taken at the sentencing hearing and, like both Hoeben CJ at CL and Beech-Jones J, I do not consider an appeal based solely on such an error should, in circumstances where it was not raised, succeed. 
142As to the apprehension of bias, I make the following further comments.  Apprehension of bias has been described by each of my colleagues.  It is unnecessary to repeat the principles so eloquently outlined by them. 
143Apprehension of bias does not require ""practical disadvantage"" in order to succeed as an appeal ground.  
144Sentencing is an intuitive process.  This Court, on appeal, intervenes only when identifiable or manifest error is disclosed.  The fact, if it were the fact, that a sentencing judge, who has engaged in conduct from which apprehended bias has been disclosed, ultimately reaches a conclusion that was open to him or her is not the point.  Otherwise, apprehended bias would not exist as a separate ground from actual bias.  An applicant would, otherwise, be required to show error in the judgment on account of bias and in so doing would be required to show actual bias or forego the argument.
145Once, according to the principles, there is an apprehension of pre-judgment, there is a denial of procedural fairness and all that follows is both irregular and must be redone.  Further, pre-judgment having been disclosed, the sentencing judge could not undertake again the task upon which his Honour previously embarked.
146Denial of procedural fairness includes the proposition that material is considered that has not been adduced in the proceedings, including private communications with the parties.  Where, as here, a concluded view has been reached following such a denial, there is an apprehension of pre-judgment that precludes the same judicial officer determining again the matter to be decided.  I agree with both other judgments in this latter regard and with the orders proposed.  
147BEECH-JONES J:   In R v Orchard [2013] NSWCCA 342 at [151] this Court described its role in hearing an appeal against a conviction in the following terms:
""This court has no independent function to police judicial manners or enforce standards by which counsel are expected to behave in their exchanges with the presiding judicial officer. A consideration of such matters can only occur as part of the exercise of the court's function to determine whether there was a miscarriage of justice.""
148This case is an example of the kind of case envisaged by the second sentence is this extract, with two modifications.  The first is that this is not a conviction appeal but a sentence appeal.  The relevant inquiry in this case is therefore not whether there was a miscarriage of justice (cf Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(1)), but whether there was a relevant error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion.  Second, this is not a case of a slip in ""judicial manners"" but of a departure from the fundamental principle that proceedings are to be conducted in open court (K-Generation Pty Ltd v Liquor Licensing Court [2009] HCA 4; 237 CLR 501 at [48] to [49]).
149Ground 1 of the Appeal contends that the sentence proceedings ""miscarried"" by reason of various matters.  An assertion that the exercise of a discretion miscarried only posits the question why?  The answer must be that one of the established grounds for intervention with the exercise of a discretionary judgment has been made out. Five such bases for intervention are identified in the well known passage from House v R [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.  However none of them are alleged in relation to ground 1.  Instead the written submissions asserted there were procedural ""irregularities"". Of itself that assertion is not sufficient.  Ultimately in oral submissions senior counsel for the applicant, Mr Boulten SC, contended that the actions of the sentencing judge gave rise to an apprehension of bias and involved a denial of procedural fairness.  Each of those contentions is matter that, if established, could lead to appellant interference. They are matters that need to be considered separately, although that consideration needs to encompass the entirety of the proceedings and not a piecemeal consideration of the events in isolation.  For the reasons that follow I consider that each contention is made out and warrants interference by this Court.
Ground 1 - Apprehended bias
150I will deal with apprehended bias first.  The relevant test is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide (Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; 205 CLR 337 at [6] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ (""Ebner"")).  If such an apprehension is established then there is no need to demonstrate that any further ""practical unfairness"" was occasioned. Thus if the question of apprehended bias is raised after the matter is decided, ""[n]o attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge"" (Ebner at [7]). The unfairness is established by the fact that it was apprehended that a partial judge might have decided the matter.
151In my view it is critical to identify what the relevant form of bias is.  The High Court's judgment in Re JRL; Ex parte CJL [1986] HCA 39; 161 CLR 342 (""Re JRL"") addressed whether the making of an ex parte communication by a family court counsellor to a judge of that court about various contested issues gave rise to an apprehension of bias.  Justice Mason (as his Honour then was) commenced his judgment by stating (at 350):
""A central element in the system of justice administered by our courts is that it should be fair and this means that it must be open, impartial and even-handed. It is for this reason that one of the cardinal principles of the law is that a judge tries the case before him on the evidence and arguments presented to him in open court by the parties or their legal representatives and by reference to those matters alone, unless Parliament otherwise provides.""
152Later Mason J identified what apprehended bias on the part of a judicial officer involves (at 352):
""It needs to be said loudly and clearly that the ground of disqualification is a reasonable apprehension that the judicial officer will not decide the case impartially or without prejudice, rather than that he will decide the case adversely to one party. There may be many situations in which previous decisions of a judicial officer on issues of fact and law may generate an expectation that he is likely to decide issues in a particular case adversely to one of the parties. But this does not mean either that he will approach the issues in that case otherwise than with an impartial and unprejudiced mind in the sense in which that expression is used in the authorities or that his previous decisions provide an acceptable basis for inferring that there is a reasonable apprehension that he will approach the issues in this way.""  (emphasis added)
153The concept of ""impartially or without prejudice"" in this passage means deciding the case according to its legal and factual merits.  Thus, in Ebner when outlining the two step approach to determining contentions that a judicial officer displayed apprehended bias, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ stated  (at [8]):
""The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an ""interest"" in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making, is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed.""  (emphasis added)
154No doubt in many sentencing hearings the presiding judge makes known their views in open court on the sentencing outcomes they might impose. Consistent with the above statements, without more such a course does not demonstrate apprehended bias.  However this case had much more.
155The somewhat erratic course of the sentencing proceedings is set out in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [28] to [60].  Consistent with the approach noted in [149], the conduct of his Honour on 28 June 2013 in cross-examining the applicant, requesting his custody records, and peremptorily refusing bail is to be considered as the background to the meeting in the Court's alcove at the conclusion of proceedings on 19 July 2013.  There is an understandable concern about the sentencing judge's failure on 18 July 2013 or thereafter to provide reasons for refusing to disqualify himself but I do not see how that adds much to any apprehension of bias that might have been held by the fair minded lay observer.
156The respective versions of the meeting in the alcove of the Court after the proceedings concluded on 19 July 2013 are set out in the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [43] to [44].  A consideration of whether there was apprehended bias did not require any difference between the two versions to be resolved by this Court (CUR24 v Director of Public Prosecutions [2012] NSWCA 65; 83 NSWLR 385 at [41] per Meagher JA).  In any event, as noted by Hoeben CJ at CL at [104], while there were differences in those versions, three common features of those versions were that the meeting was initiated by his Honour, his Honour clearly indicated that he did not want to send the applicant to gaol, and his Honour was seeking some assurance that there would be no Crown appeal if he did so.
157There are a number of cases in which a complaint of apprehended bias has been made in the context of a private communication by a litigant, a legal practitioner, a witness or a third party to a judicial officer (eg Re JRL, and see Mark Aronson, Bruce Dyer and Matthew Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (Thomson Reuters, 4th ed, 2009) at [9.175ff]).  This case involves the representatives of both parties communicating with the judicial officer in private.  Clearly not all private exchanges with a judge in the presence of the legal representatives of both parties that relate to a case are inappropriate, much less give rise to an apprehension of bias.  However, this exchange canvassed the details and the outcome of the case.  In such circumstances, the hypothetical fair minded lay observer can be taken to be aware that the initiation by the trial judge on 19 July 2013 of a conversation with counsel in the Court alcove which canvassed the imposition of a non-custodial sentence was improper.  Further, such an observer would appreciate that it was also improper for his Honour to participate in the placing of some form of pressure on the prosecutor not to appeal any non-custodial sentence that may be imposed.  The observer might reasonably conclude that this meeting was the real process by which the sentence was being determined by the sentencing judge, rather than by the proceedings that were taking place in open court.  Properly analysed, it follows that the fair minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the trial judge might be prejudiced or not acting impartially in the sense discussed by Mason J in Re JRL.  The fair minded observer might reasonably apprehend that his Honour might not decide the case ""on its legal and factual merits"". They could reasonably believe that was the reason why, in the secrecy of the alcove, the Director of Public Prosecution's agreement not to appeal any sentence was being sought.
158Two further points should be noted about apprehended bias.  First, as the judgment of Hoeben CJ at CL at [46] to [50] makes clear, the subsequent course of the sentencing proceedings could have suggested to a fair minded observer that his Honour was, or at least may have been, proposing to retreat  from  the indicated course of imposing a non-custodial sentence (but was instead considering a sentence that was perhaps just in excess of two years imprisonment). In Re JRL it was accepted that subsequent disclosure to the parties by the judge that he had received an ex parte disclosure could have the effect of dispelling any apprehension of bias, but that will not always be the case (Re JRL at 351).  However, when the nature of the apprehended bias is analysed in the above terms, it is evident that the subsequent course of the sentence proceedings in this case did not dispel the apprehension of bias that arose.  While the reasonable observer might have concluded from the statements made during the sentencing proceedings on 9 September 2013 that the sentencing judge was no longer wedded to imposing a non-custodial sentence, nothing that was stated would have dispelled any apprehension they might have held that his Honour might not decide it according to its legal and factual merits.  Worse still, they might have simply treated the sentence hearing on 9 September 2013 as a façade bearing in mind the conversation in the alcove. On either view a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the sentencing judge is made out.
159Second, there was no submission to the effect that this Court should decline to intervene on the basis of any alleged acquiescence in, or encouragement of, the inappropriate procedure that was adopted on the part of counsel for the applicant who appeared before the sentencing judge.  In the absence of such a contention it is not necessary to consider this further.
Ground 1 - Hearing rule
160I agree with the finding of Hoeben CJ at CL at [120] to [121].  The principles noted in the cases discussed at [106] to [119] demonstrate that  the applicant was also denied a fair hearing.
Remaining grounds of appeal and relief
161The remaining grounds of appeal all concern aspects of his Honour's sentencing judgment. However, the applicant's success on ground 1 warrants the sentencing judgement being set aside. The consequence is that this Court cannot proceed to re-sentence.  In  addition to the agreed facts, a number of other factual findings are sought which in part involve an assessment of the evidence given by the applicant and Dr Roberts (see O'Neil-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42 (""O'Neil-Shaw"") at [32] per Basten JA).  Accordingly I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL that the proceedings will have to be set aside and re-determined afresh.  Section 12(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act authorises that course (O'Neil-Shaw id). Further, in light of the Court's findings, I consider that the Court should direct that they not be heard by the same judge (O'Neil-Shaw at [37] per Basten JA).
162I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

		28 July 2014",2014-07-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704709,R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2014] NSWSC 1287,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy has submitted that it would be an abuse of process for the Crown to be permitted to adduce evidence that contradicts findings of fact made by Garling J not interfered with by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Counsel for Mr Seller has joined in that application.
	
	
	To state the background with great succinctness, this trial starkly raises the question of the interaction in practice between inquisitorial and adversarial processes in Australia: X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92; Do Young Lee v The Queen; Seong Won Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 88 ALJR 656. That is because the accused, each of whom has been arraigned on a count alleging, in short, conspiracy to defraud, submit that an important witness in the Crown case had extensive access to oral and documentary material produced under compulsion by them to the Australian Crime Commission.
	
	
	Before Garling J a permanent stay was obtained: R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2012] NSWSC 934. In the Court of Criminal Appeal that order was quashed: R v Seller; R v McCarthy [2013] NSWCCA 42. The matter was remitted for further hearing to this Court. Currently an amended notice of motion of Mr McCarthy, in which Mr Seller joins, is being heard by me before the trial by jury some months from now.
	
	
	Senior counsel for Mr McCarthy, correctly in my opinion, disavows in his submission that issue estoppel has a role to play in the criminal law: Rogers v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 254 and 276.
	
	
	However, he and his junior submit that it would be an abuse of process that would scandalise the administration of justice and that could lead to the unseemly result of inconsistent verdicts to permit the Crown to tender evidence that contradicts the extant findings of Garling J. It was accepted that it is for Mr McCarthy, as the moving party, to establish that proposition.
	
	
	I respectfully reject the submission. I do so on the following bases.
	
	
	First, an examination of the orders sought in the amended notice of motion before me, and the orders sought before Garling J, shows that, although factually related to a degree, they are actually rather different.
	
	
	Secondly, as one would expect in those circumstances, the issues requiring determination by me are different from those requiring determination by Garling J.
	
	
	Thirdly, senior counsel for Mr McCarthy has submitted that he should be permitted to tender supplementary evidence in support of the motion that was not before Garling J. To my mind, it would be an odd result if Mr McCarthy, but not the Crown, were afforded that flexibility with regard to adding to or revisiting the findings made by Garling J.
	
	
	Fourthly, whether the Crown accepted the correctness of the findings of Garling J in the Court of Criminal Appeal in whole or in part is, to my mind, relevant but not determinative. The fact is, as I have said, that the relief sought and therefore the nature of the proceedings, has now altered.
	
	
	Fifthly, to a degree the amended motion constitutes an application for an evidentiary ruling, in that reliance is placed in part on s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It is well known that evidentiary rulings are not set in stone and can be revisited during a trial if the state of the evidence changes. Again, that state of affairs, to my mind, argues in favour of flexibility.
	
	
	Sixthly, to the extent that the ""verdict"" of Garling J granting a permanent stay was quashed, there is no question of inconsistent verdicts in the true sense. As I have said, the matter is proceeding by way of a further hearing of the same trial before me.
	
	
	Seventhly, without delving into a detailed comparison of the facts, to my mind the circumstances here are very far removed from those that were held to be an abuse of process by the High Court of Australia in the leading case about revisitation of findings of fact leading to an abuse of process in the criminal context: Rogers v The Queen.
	
	
	Eighthly, although it plays a small role in my determination, I consider it possible that the Crown was not in a position to litigate with completeness before Garling J the question of the role of the witness under consideration, namely Mr Tang, that it now seeks to revisit: Rippon v Chilcotin Pty Ltd and Others [2001] NSWCA 142; 53 NSWLR 198 at 204.
	
	
	Ninthly, senior counsel for Mr McCarthy has, with the usual candour of counsel, invited my attention to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Edwards [1998] 2 VR 354, 94 A Crim R 204. That decision is simply to the effect that evidentiary interlocutory determinations in the same criminal proceedings are not binding on a subsequent judge hearing those same proceedings. I have no reason to doubt that that is a correct statement of the law of New South Wales as well.
	
	
	It is for those reasons that I do not propose to uphold any objection to the adduction of evidence by the Crown on the basis that it would be an abuse of process to call into question the findings of fact made by Garling J.

		24 September 2015",2014-07-28 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704710,R v Crispe (No 3) [2014] NSWDC 207,"Judgment

1Mr Schaudin, on behalf of his client, has made an application for me to make an order adjourning these proceedings until his client is reassessed by Dr Furst. I should add that that was his secondary position. His primary position was for me to release his client conditionally at this stage.

2I am empowered to make such orders under s 39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW). Section 39(2) of that Act makes a very important qualification to any order I make. It provides -
""The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person's release.""

3It seems to me, whether I make a final order for Ms Crispe's release or an order for adjournment of the proceedings, that provision binds me to not make any release order unless I am so satisfied. I am not inclined to grant Mr Schaudin's primary application, because I do not have, in my opinion, sufficient information to be satisfied on a longer term basis that the safety of Ms Crispe or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by her release.
I turn then to Mr Schaudin's second position, namely that the case be adjourned. Both Mr Schaudin and Mr Thompson have made submissions about matters which would satisfy me on the balance of probabilities, inaccordance with s39(2) for the period of an adjournment, which might be some six to eight weeks. They point to the following factors. First, there has been no report of any misbehaviour by Tricia Crispe since the acts in question in this case. She has been admitted to psychiatric care, but there has been no behaviour which puts anybody at risk, including herself. Secondly, exhibit B demonstrates that Tricia Crispe has no criminal convictions. Thirdly, exhibit 2 is a very helpful report from the Venerable Hsiu Nong, vice-abbot of the Lingyen Mountain Temple, Australia, dated 15 May 2014. The author, although not purporting to be qualified as a psychologist or psychiatrist, has had an extended opportunity to view Ms Crispe's behaviour in her daily attendance at the temple, which is near her home.The author expressed the view that she ""is now in a much healthier state of mind than when she first came to the temple in 2013"". The author acknowledged ""the severity of the trauma she experienced"" and that it had ""not completely left her"". She still avoids social contact beyond her home and the temple. They will continue to support her at the temple, which she attends daily from 7.30 in the morning till five at night. That is a reassuring history of non violent and rehabilitative behaviour, supported by the opinion of the author of the report. Fourthly, Ms Crispe was the subject of a community treatment order, which was part of an agreement which she undertook as a condition of bail on 3 December 2012. The Auburn Community Mental Health, which Mr Thompson was in contact with this morning, reported that her progress was such that she was released from the community treatment order in May this year. Fifthly, there is an apprehended violence order in place (of a provisional nature, I understand)which protects Phillip Crispe. Finally, Mr Schaudin accepts that a condition of her release can be that she comply with recommendations of the qualified psychiatrist, Dr Furst, in consultation with her legal practitioners.

4 It seems to me that it is appropriate for me to release Ms Crispe subject to certain conditions, which have been agreed between Mr Thompson and Mr Schaudin, in order for her to obtain up to date information about her condition, which will enable me to make a final determination under s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. It does not seem to me that I grant her bail, but that I make a conditional release order under s 39.

5I make an order releasing Ms Crispe. The order is subject to the following conditions -
(1)That she complies with any apprehended violence order, provisional or otherwise, in place.
(2)That she continues to live at [home address].
(3)That for the period of the adjournment, she not approach or attempt to approach or contact Phillip Crispe or either of her children.
(4)That she keep an appointment made for her with Dr Richard Furst and in consultation with her legal practitioners, comply with such recommendations that Dr Furst makes, especially concerning counselling or medication, as her legal practitioners regard as reasonable.
(5)That Tricia Crispe attend before me in the District Court at Sydney on Thursday 9 October 2014 at 10am.

6I direct a transcript of these proceedings, including the judgments I have delivered, including yesterday's proceedings, to be taken out and made available to me for revision on or before Friday 3 October 2014.

7I direct the Registrar of this Court to notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of my orders and that the Registrar provide the Mental Health Review Tribunal with a copy of my reasons for judgment and orders and copies of the exhibits tendered in the proceedings.

		08 December 2014",2014-07-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704713,R v Crispe (No 2) [2014] NSWDC 201,"Judgment

1I will hear you both on the orders in due course but I can indicate that I find a special verdict in respect of your client. 
2Tricia Crispe and Phillip Crispe were married, but separated. They had two young children. Phillip Crispe was bringing the children around to Tricia Crispe's house on a Saturday morning at about eight. It was 16 June 2012. Tricia Crispe started to stab him with a knife and with scissors. He was seriously wounded, but luckily survived.
3As a result of what happened Tricia Crispe was charged with a very serious criminal offence. It is the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. It is a crime against s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). In the alternative, she is charged with recklessly wounding Phillip Crispe. Tricia Crispe was arraigned on those charges before me here in the District Court at Parramatta yesterday. She pleaded not guilty to each offence and it is clear from the submissions of her counsel, Mr Schaudin, that that plea was a plea of not guilty on the basis that his client was mentally ill at the time, so as not to be responsible according to law, for her actions.
An issue arose immediately yesterday about Tricia Crispe's fitness for trial. In a judgment yesterday, I determined that she was fit for trial. Both Tricia Crispe and the prosecutor have jointly applied for an order that she be tried by a judge alone. I made that order yesterday in compliance with s 132(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
4The issue for me, therefore, is whether I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Tricia Crispe performed the actions which the prosecution claims she performed. The onus of so satisfying me remains with the prosecution. The second issue is whether the defence has satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that Tricia Crispe was mentally ill at the time, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for her actions.
5I should briefly review first the evidence about what happened at the scene by way of dealing with the first issue. The evidence before me comprises two exhibits. Exhibit A is a bundle of statements and photographs and reports tendered by Mr P Thompson who appears as prosecutor; and exhibit 1 is a report of Dr Richard Furst, tendered by Mr Schaudin on behalf of his client.
6The statements in exhibit A include a statement from Phillip Crispe. He provides some history of his relationship with Tricia Crispe and the arrangements they had made for shared parenting. There were times, he said, ""when we have argued or had problems"". He recollected about five occasions ""where things have been bad between us. Most of these have been reported to the police"".
In accordance with a previous arrangement with Tricia Crispe, Phillip Crispe was delivering their sons to where Tricia Crispe was living in Berala. Both her parents were there at the time, visiting from Malaysia. As Mr Crispe was turning his attention to one of the boys, who was expressing some reluctance to be handed over to his mother, he ""felt an arm come over my right shoulder and around my throat"". He felt what he ""thought was a punch to the back of my head"". He felt a sharp pain in his hand when he put his hand up to protect his head, and felt what he described as ""liquid running down the back of my head and down my back"". He ""realised I was being stabbed and was bleeding"".
7The next thing Phillip Crispe remembers is lying on the floor inside the unit. He saw that his hand had been ""cut multiple times and was bleeding"". He saw that -
""Tricia still had hold of a knife. I was able to get hold of the blade of the knife with my left hand. I was trying to get the knife from her or stop the knife from coming any closer to me. Tricia was still trying to stab me by continually pushing it down into my hand. I remember the knife had a silver blade and looked like a large kitchen knife.""

He recounted that ""Tricia used another item to stab me twice in the face and head area"". He felt a sharp pain again. He was taken by ambulance to Auburn Hospital. He had a deep laceration to his right hand, severing a tendon. There were also lacerations on his right eyebrow and scalp. He required surgery to heal his hand and attention to the wounds on his head.
8Ms Swee Eng Tan is Tricia Crispe's mother. As I said, she was staying with Tricia Crispe at the time. She was in a bedroom with her husband and could hear a commotion outside. She stepped out of the bedroom and, just inside the front door, she saw Tricia and Phillip Crispe ""physically fighting on the ground, hitting each other"". She remembers ""seeing a knife in Tricia's hand and she was trying to stab Phillip in the head"". She described the knife as ""a kitchen knife"" with ""a 20 centimetre blade and black handle"". Phillip was trying to grab her hands and grapple the knife away from her. She could see blood coming from Phillip's head. She said that her daughter was continually shouting ""You have hurt me: you have hurt me so much. He has made me suffer so much.""Ms Tan's husband, Wengfatt Hooi, also came out of the bedroom to see that ""Phillip was lying face down"". He too saw blood on Phillip's head. He was trying to separate them. He remembers seeing ""a silver blade knife in someone's hand. I do not know who was holding the knife, either Phillip or Tricia"".
9Some neighbours in the block of units were the first other people at the scene. One of the witnesses, Mahfuzur Arhmon Sumon, said he saw an African man, who was also a neighbour, ""trying to hold one of the wrists of the Asian female as she was holding a knife in this hand"". Mr Sumon reported that the African said ""Guys, move. She's got a knife in her hand"". Another man who was staying nearby, Fodah Bayoh, remembers a person who was obviously Tricia Crispe saying, ""He's been trying to hurt me"". He checked that the police had been called, and then he saw a woman - I accept it was Tricia Crispe - ""pick up a pair of scissors that were on the ground next to her using her right hand. I watched her use the scissors to stab the male on the ground in the head once."" He got the scissors away from Tricia Crispe. 
Police came and secured the scene. Photographs were taken of a knife and more than one pair of scissors and Mr Crispe's head and hand, which indeed show bloodied wounds. One of the police, Detective Senior Constable Matthew Barham, recalled Tricia Crispe continually saying ""He's been trying to hurt me. He has been trying to take my money and kids"". She was saying that repeatedly, as well as ""other things that I was not able to understand"". He tried to inform Ms Crispe that she was under arrest and to caution her, ""but she was continually talking and it was obvious she was not listening to me"". He tried to interview Ms Crispe a couple of weeks later at Cumberland Hospital but it became obvious to him that Ms Crispe ""was still suffering suicidal and paranoid thoughts"".
10Tricia Crispe was seen by Senior Constable Barry Thurling with ""bloodstains on both her hands and palms, as well as bloodstains on her socks"". He too heard her continually saying that Phillip Crispe wanted to hurt her and take her money. Constable Jessica Arnott heard her saying the same thing. She and another police officer accompanied Tricia Crispe in an ambulance to Westmead Hospital. 
11Although she did not appear to have any physical injuries, Constable Arnott recounted that she ""was assessed by a further social worker/psychiatrist"" for an extended period of time. Constable Arnott then spoke to the psychiatrist ""who informed me that she was unable to obtain a full recollection of the incident; however she advised me that she appeared significantly disoriented, spoke little English, and repeated to state, 'he was trying to hurt me'"". The police were told that Ms Crispe ""needed to be taken to Cumberland Hospital and assessed"" and that was arranged.
12The police accompanied her there, where she still ""appeared increasingly disoriented"". Constable Arnott noted that Ms Crispe ""continued to walk around the waiting room very slowly, and approached the reception window on a number of occasion, however would not speak"".
Senior Constable Dan Chilvers arrested Tricia Crispe, who said that Phillip Crispe ""was trying to hurt me"" and that they had had an argument outside the unit. When asked about whether he hurt her, she said that he ""isalways abusing me and not make my children come with me"". He confirmed that an ambulance was called for her as well to be taken for a mental health assessment.
13On behalf of his client, Mr Schaudin, in his helpful written submissions which became MFI 4, conceded ""that it was her act that caused the wounds to Phillip Crispe"". Mr Thompson, in his equally helpful written submissions which are marked MFI 3, also reviewed the evidence and submitted that I ""would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has proved the actus reas charged with respect to the first count in the indictment beyond reasonable doubt. The contrary has not been contended at the trial by learned counsel for the accused.""
14I have no hesitation in being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Tricia Crispe wounded Phillip Crispe on 16 June 2012 with a knife and with at least one pair of scissors. 
15I turn now to the second issue, which is whether Tricia Crispe has satisfied me on the balance of probabilities that at the time she inflicted the wounds on Phillip Crispe, she was ""mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for...her action at the time when the act was done."" I am quoting from s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW).
16Mr Thompson has helpfully made submissions on the law relating to the establishment of a defence on the grounds of mental illness. I accept that a disease of the mind is, as Mr Thompson submitted, ""any disease which is capable of affecting the mind, irrespective of whether it has a mental or physical origin and irrespective of whether or not the defect of reason caused is temporary or permanent."" One of the longstanding points of reference for the law for assessing the applicability of the defence of mental illness is a direction given by Sir Owen Dixon sitting at first instance in the High Court of Australia, but trying a murder charge in Canberra in 1933. The relevant parts of his Honour's summing-up to the jury is contained in The King v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182. Mr Thompson has directed me to the relevant passages in that case.His Honour referred to the two bases on which a jury may return such a verdict. His Honour at 188 described them briefly as follows - 
""One state of mind is that in which he is prevented by a mental disorder from knowing the physical nature of the act he is doing; the other is that he was prevented from knowing that what he was doing was wrong.""

17Because of the preponderance of the evidence in this case, I will focus on the second requirement. His Honour said over 189 -190 the following -
""The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense of composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong.""

His Honour observed that wrong means ""wrong, having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people"". 
Whilst dealing with legal issues, I should mention another matter. I have made a determination so far only that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Tricia Crispe wounded Phillip Crispe in the way claimed by the prosecution. I have not yet made a determination about the question of whether she did so, to quote from the indictment, ""with intent to cause grievous bodily harm"". I am instead turning to the question of the defence of mental illness. I do that in compliance with the judgment of the High Court in Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 500. The case concerned an alleged murder by a young man of his father in a pine plantation in Railton in Tasmania. In a unanimous judgment, the Court said as follows at 517 - 
""In principle, the question of insanity falls for determination before the issue of intent. The basic questions in a criminal trial must be: what did the accused do and is he criminally responsible for doing it? These questions must be resolved...before there is any issue of the specific intent with which the act is done. It is only when those basic questions are answered adversely to an accused that the issue of intent is to be addressed. That issue can arise only on the hypothesis that the accused's mental condition at the time when the incriminated act was done fell short of insanity...""

18In Regina v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 63 NSWLR 490, Hunt AJ, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal, followed the High Court's judgment at that passage, confirming that that was the applicable approach in New South Wales. (See at [32] of his Honour's judgment.)
19Accordingly, I should turn to the evidence concerning the mental health of Tricia Crispe. There is little direct evidence of Ms Crispe's mental health up to the time of the commission of the offence, but there is a good deal of indirect evidence in histories taken from her by Dr Furst in exhibit 1 and Dr Stephen Allnutt in his report dated 12 November 2013, which was part of exhibit A.
20Dr Furst noted an ""episode of severe depression in 2005 after the birth of her youngest son"". He noted that Ms Crispe ""tried to cut herself with a knife and was admitted to St John of God Hospital"". She was there for about a week. The discharge summary ""indicates she was suffering from somatic and nihilistic delusions at the time, being diagnosed with a psychotic depression"".
Dr Furst also notes ""an admission to the Macquarie Hospital in Ryde in November 2005 for ten days"". Ms Crispe had taken an overdose. Dr Furst observed that Ms Crispe ""decompensated after separating from her husband"". He noted also that she ""was not functioning well in the months preceding the events before the Court"". She took time off her work as a teacher and reported to Dr Furst that she ""felt as though she had 'lost everything'. Her mother, who was present at the time, said her condition had deteriorated in May 2012, describing her as 'traumatised by Phillip and her children'.""
21Dr Furst noted that Ms Crispe ""was admitted to Cumberland Hospital for five months following her alleged offences"". She was given a mixture of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication. She was more recently admitted to Concord Hospital, again after a suicide attempt, in February 2012. She had no reported family history of mental illness and is ""a non smoker who does not drink very often"". There is no suggestion of any illicit drugs.
22Dr Furst noted an entry by a psychiatric registrar who examined Ms Crispe on the date that she wounded Phillip Crispe. The entry extracted by Dr Furst reads as follows:
""Ms Crispe appeared withdrawn and was very restricted in her affect. She said repeatedly that she believes her husband wants to kill her, and says she doesn't have a future and wants to die...Ms Crispe appears to be acting irrationally and there are significant concerns about her safety and the safety of others""--

23Dr Furst noted that Ms Crispe ""was deemed a mentally ill person under the meaning of the Mental Health Act"". Whilst a patient at Cumberland Hospital, Dr Furst noted a history that she wanted to die, saw no future for herself and still believed that her husband would kill her. Ms Crispe ""was noted to be vague, perplexed and highly emotional, with an initial diagnosis of a delusional disorder and a melancholic depression"".
24Another doctor who examined her on the same day, namely when the events occurred, noted that Ms Crispe was ""sitting huddled in the chair hyper vigilant at sounds, examiners' behaviour; reports feeling victimised, exploited, persecuted, and being under threat for life...mentally ill. No less restrictive place currently.""Dr Furst noted diagnoses in earlier admissions to the St John of God and Macquarie Hospitals as including ""major depressive disorder with psychotic features"". Dr Furst himself diagnosed Ms Crispe as having a major depressive disorder with melancholic and psychotic features.
25Addressing the question of the state of her mental illness at the time that she wounded Mr Crispe, Dr Furst observed -
""Observations from medical staff who assessed Ms Crispe at Westmead Hospital and Cumberland Hospital on the day of the offence were consistent with her being severely depressed and psychotic at the time in question, including a belief that her husband Phillip intended to kill her.""

He observed that she made ""little improvement despite her five month admission to Cumberland Hospital"" and that she had had a recent relapse. He pointed out that a major depressive disorder with melancholic and psychotic features ""has been recognised at law as a disease of the mind"". He expressed his opinion as follows:
""In my opinion, Ms Crispe had a defect of reason at the time of the offence in question before the Court, believing that her husband was following her, monitoring her and wanted to kill her. She was also agitated, nihilistic and wanted to die. In my opinion, the severe depressive illness and psychosis Ms Crispe was suffering from when she stabbed her husband deprived her of the ability to reason about her actions with a moderate degree of sense of composure. She was unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of her actions. She has the mental illness defence available to her.""

26Dr Furst went on to consider recommendations regarding future treatment, which I will take into account when considering the appropriate orders to make in this case. 
When Dr Allnutt examined Ms Crispe on 25 October 2013, he too noted the earlier admissions to hospital. He noted accounts that she thought people were following her and that she was ""being watched and being recorded on the phone"". She thought that the ""TV was telling her something, like they were commenting on her, like sending a message which caused her to turn it off"".
27Dr Allnutt noted that Ms Crispe's mother had observed, in the months before the event, that her daughter was ""not good"" and ""was very upset"". Ms Crispe's mother also stated that her daughter commented that the birds were very quiet and not chirpy, which her mother thought was ""weird"".
28Ms Crispe, in her account to Dr Allnutt, said that she ""did not recall stabbing"" Phillip Crispe. Dr Allnutt also noted no history of family mental illness nor any excess alcohol or illicit drugs. 
29Dr Allnutt also reviewed various documents relating to Ms Crispe's medical history. Dr Allnutt expressed his opinion and qualified it by indicating that it ""is based on the assumption that there is limited evidence that her husband had her surveillanced, was conspiring with others or planning to kill her"". He thought that Ms Crispe ""presents with symptoms consistent with a recurrent depressive disorder with associated psychotic features"".
30Dr Allnutt too was of the opinion that at the time of the events, Ms Crispe ""was experiencing a 'disease of the mind'. That is, symptoms of depression with associated psychosis"". He thought that her belief that her husband was wanting to kill her was probably delusional and that ""her perception of others in her environment would have been significantly distorted by virtue of a depression due to cognitive distortions"". He thought that those observations along with her delusional beliefs would have impacted on her capacity to make rational interpretations of events and thus, she experienced a defect of reason. He did not believe that ""Ms Crispe's mental illness was of a severity that it negated her capacity to know the nature and quality of her actions. ""He observed that he did believe that ""she maintained a capacity to understand that a knife could harm him if she utilised it"". However, he confirmed his view that ""she was significantly compromised in her capacity to know the wrongfulness of her actions or in her capacity to reason about the wrongfulness of her actions"". He concluded on balance that ""it would be reasonable to conclude that her mental state was disturbed severely enough to have compromised her capacity to reason about the wrongfulness, to the extent that on balance, she would have had a defence of a mental illness available to her.""Dr Allnutt, too, made some recommendations for disposal of the case.
31Mr Schaudin, in his written submissions, drew my attention to authority for the proposition that if medical evidence relating to the issue of mental illness is unanimous, the evidence cannot be rejected by the tribunal of fact in absence of other material which casts some doubt on it. Mr Thompson acknowledged ""that both Dr Allnutt and Dr Furst are well respected and well known to this court"" and submitted that ""there is no basis for this Honourable court to do other than accept the whole body of expert evidence contained in the reports of Drs Allnutt and Furst."" He went on to argue that the Court ""can be comfortably satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused has made good the proposition that, as to the first count in the indictment, she is not guilty by reason of mental illness"" (by reference to s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act).
32I should remind myself in accordance with s 37 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act of the legal and practical consequences of finding Ms Crispe not guilty by reason of mental illness. I am aware of the kinds of orders which I can make under s 39 of that Act and of the role of the Mental Health Review Tribunal, especially with respect to forensic patients and what that tribunal needs to consider if it is to release a person into the community.
I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Ms Crispe did not know the physical nature of the act that she was doing. However, given the evidence concerning what happened on the day, the accounts given by various witnesses, the evidence, although indirect, of the history of her mental health and the opinions of Drs Furst and Allnutt, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that, by reason of mental illness, at the time that she stabbed Phillip Crispe, Ms Crispe was not able to appreciate the wrongness of what she was doing. She could not reason about what she was doing with a moderate degree of sense and composure so as to realise that it was wrong, having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people.
33Accordingly, in accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, given the evidence on the trial, I am satisfied that Ms Crispe was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for her actions at the time when the act was done.
34I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did the act charged in count 1 in the indictment but I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she was mentally ill at the time and I return a special verdict that she is not guilty by reason of mental illness.

		26 November 2014",2014-07-28 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704714,R v Evans; R v Rawlinson; R v Proud [2014] NSWSC 979,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The deceased Katherine Foreman died at her home in the early hours of 27 October 2011, when the upstairs bedroom in which she was sleeping was set alight. The fire engulfed the home and the deceased was later found lying on the landing at the top of the stairs. It is not in dispute that petrol was poured inside the bedroom and ignited.

2Bradley Rawlinson, Michelle Proud and Wendy Evans were each indicted upon a charge alleging that on 27 October 2011 at Corrimal in the State of New South Wales they did murder Katherine Foreman. Ms Evans pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased on 14 June 2013. A jury found Mr Rawlinson and Ms Proud guilty of the murder of the deceased on 11 April 2014 following a trial in Sydney that commenced on 18 February 2014.

3The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In the event that a determinate sentence is imposed, a standard non-parole period of 20 years applies. In proceeding to determine the appropriate sentence, I am not required to commence by considering whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. Similarly, I am not required to make an assessment of whether or not the offence is within the mid range of objective seriousness (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]). The relevant statutory provisions generally, and the provisions of ss 54B(2) and (3) and 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in particular, require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified, and a judgment is reached as to the appropriate sentence having regard to such factors (see Muldrock at [26], citing Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [51]). The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the ""non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"". It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock at [27] and [31]).

4All three prisoners appeared before me for submissions on sentence on 3 July 2014. I had earlier determined that the sentencing hearings should take place at the same time: see R v Evans [2014] NSWSC 735. However, as discussed in that judgment, because Ms Evans was not a participant in the trial of the others, the facts relevant to her do not include all of the facts potentially relevant to them and vice versa. It is therefore important that the facts that have now been agreed with respect to Ms Evans be clearly and separately stated.

MS EVANS

Factual findings

5The following facts were agreed for sentencing purposes with respect to the case against Ms Evans.

6The deceased was a solicitor who practised in and around Wollongong. She lived at 6 Doncaster Street, Corrimal. Ms Evans is a former employee of the Department of Attorney-General and Justice and worked at various Local Courts over the years preceding the death of the deceased. Ms Evans met the deceased in 2008 through her work. They became friends in about November 2010.

7Mr Rawlinson and the deceased had been in an intimate relationship on and off over a period of about four years prior to her death. They communicated regularly with each other during this time and were intimately involved even as late as the days preceding the death of the deceased. 

8For some time leading up to the death of the deceased Ms Proud and Bernard Spicer had been in a de facto relationship. Ms Evans and Ms Proud met and formed a friendship. It appears that Mr Spicer and Scott Field, who was then Ms Evans' partner, had both been inmates of the same correctional centre in 2008.

9On 9 July 2011, Mr Rawlinson had a birthday dinner that was attended by the deceased, Ms Evans and others. The celebrations moved to the Harp Hotel in Wollongong where the deceased was seen to kiss Ms Evans' son. Mr Rawlinson saw this and became angry. He told Ms Evans. The deceased asked Ms Evans to take Mr Rawlinson home. Ms Evans then drove Mr Rawlinson to the deceased's home.

10Mr Rawlinson revealed to Ms Evans that the deceased had been in a sexual relationship with Mr Field. Ms Evans had herself been in a relationship with him from some time in 2009 until about December 2010. Ms Evans was still seeing Mr Field on and off in an intimate way until he was arrested in February 2011 for assaulting her. Notwithstanding that, Ms Evans and Mr Field remained in contact until November 2011. Ms Evans told the police that the deceased had admitted in mid July 2011 that she had slept with Mr Field, and around September 2011 the deceased revealed this to a sheriff's officer at Wollongong Local Court.

11Ms Evans told Sian Regal that she and Mr Rawlinson commenced a friendship on the night of his birthday party. They kept in regular personal and telephonic contact thereafter. Their friendship became intimate on 29 August 2011. Mr Rawlinson would visit Ms Evans every day except when he had his son on weekends.

12On 16 July 2011, the deceased sent Mr Rawlinson a text message that said: ""I know you've been talking to Wendy behind my back so keep lying about it see if I care."" Mr Rawlinson then sent Ms Evans his own message saying: ""Didn't take long, here's the message I just got from Katie."" Mr Rawlinson then forwarded the previous message from the deceased to Ms Evans after adding his own words saying, ""I'll fuck you both up.""

13On 28 July 2011, Ms Evans posted the following on her Facebook page: ""Note to self...take a deap [sic] breath, count to ten, remember, murder is still against the law."" On 11 August 2011 she wrote: ""has been quiet a very long time now, I pity those who have yet to see me pissed off because I have remained calm until now. The volcano is bubbling.""

14Numerous work colleagues noted that Ms Evans frequently spoke about her personal life and specifically her friendship with the deceased. This spanned the periods before and after Ms Evans became aware of the fact that the deceased had slept with Mr Field. Ms Evans subsequently told a number of people that the deceased had slept with him, including her mother, her friends and work colleagues. Suzanne Van Kooten was a work colleague, and Ms Evans told her that the deceased was sleeping with police, prosecutors and other solicitors. Ms Evans said to her: ""I am going to tell somebody and cause Katie to get what is coming to her"" and, ""she gets what she deserves for what she has done to me.""

15Mr Rawlinson engaged the services of a female escort named Nicole Thompson, who he would see every few months. He spoke to her about the deceased in negative terms. Mr Rawlinson offered Ms Thompson $2,000 to have the deceased bashed, telling her, ""I want to put her in hospital."" On 27 July 2011, Mr Rawlinson sent Ms Thompson a text message saying, ""Hi Nikki, it's Brad, are you able to do that job for me."" On 3 August 2011, Mr Rawlinson again asked Ms Thompson about bashing the deceased and sent her a number of follow up messages that she ignored. Ms Thompson ultimately told Mr Rawlinson to ""fuck off.""

16Ms Evans repeatedly spoke to her work colleagues at the Wollongong Court about the deceased's personal life and their falling out. The deceased also told her father that she had been advised by a sheriff's officer that Ms Evans was spreading rumours about her. One of these officers spoke to senior registrar Kathy Frost about the matter who in turn spoke to Ms Evans on 30 August 2011. Ms Evans had been absent from work but told Ms Frost that, ""everything with Katie has come to a head"" and that she had not been coping. Ms Evans resigned but would have been dismissed by Ms Frost in any event, because the things that she was saying about the deceased were unacceptable.

17About a month before the fire that killed the deceased, Ms Evans told her friend Sian Regal that she had, ""asked the Berkeley Boys to get her [the deceased] bashed"" and said, ""I should get her bashed"".

18Between 1 October 2011 and 22 October 2011, Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson exchanged numerous text messages. Ms Evans sent a message to him on 1 October 2011 saying, ""I hate it when you leave"". Mr Rawlinson replied, ""Yeah so do I but just keep thinking one more week. Then she is gone and we are away from her"". That prompted the following response from Ms Evans:

""I hate that she gets to spend the time with you that we should be spending. I'm sorry. But hopefully it's only for another week. I love you and miss you badly when your [sic] not here. Next weekend is going to be so hard. As I won't see you from when you leave here in the morning until late Monday night or even Tuesday night. It will be the longest that we have been apart in a month.""

19On 3 October 2011, Mr Rawlinson sent messages to Ms Evans whilst he was in the presence of the deceased, as follows:

""I can't wait to see you tonight. This is hell. She is a cow. She's carrying on like an idiot. God I want her gone.
...

I want to kiss you tonight and hug you. I love you.
...

OK, let me know how you go beautiful. I miss you.""

20Ms Evans responded, saying: ""I'm OK just finished from the Dr. I have to get antibiotics. I miss you and I love you. I can't wait to see you tonight. So entertain me? What is she doing to be an idiot?""

21On 4 October 2011, Ms Evans sent a message to Mr Rawlinson saying, ""I will sweetness. I hope you have a good day at work. I miss you and love you. I wish you were here with me. I dislike it intensely when you are not with me. But it's not for much longer. Then our life together begins.""

22Mr Rawlinson sent Ms Evans a message on 13 October 2011 in which he said: ""I want to be with you til I die and I hope you understand the various reasons why it needs to happen to her now. I love you.""

23Some six days later Mr Rawlinson sent a message to Ms Evans as follows: ""Do me a favor [sic] and send her the text from the public phone you were going to yesterday."" Ms Evans responded, saying, ""I will do it today sweetness. I love you. Have a good day at work."" Mr Rawlinson later responded, saying, ""OK Wendy. I really do want to spend my life with you which is why she must go. To grow old with you always.""

24On that day the deceased received a text message from a public phone in Berkeley. That message was sent by a third person at Ms Evans' request, and was in these terms:

""K GOT PACKAGED WILL B URS 2NGT 4SESS OFF URCUNT CU 940 UWIL ENJOY FUK UR RSE NSQEL LIKE PIGS U FUK B READY IWILL LINE URCUNT WITH COC.""

25Mr Rawlinson visited the deceased at her home on 19 October 2011, leaving at about 22.30. Approximately 15 minutes later she sent him three messages in quick succession, saying, ""Are you here?"", ""Are you here?"" and, ""Answer me quick please?"" Mr Rawlinson responded with a message at 22.48 saying, ""What no why, what's wrong?"" The deceased responded saying, ""There's someone here I don't know what to do"" and, ""There's someone here I just went downstairs and there's someone on the bottom deck"". At 22.55 Mr Rawlinson sent a message saying, ""I'm here"". He spent the night at the deceased's house. However, at 23.49 Mr Rawlinson sent a message to Ms Evans saying, ""Hi beautiful, I'm sorry but I'm going to stay at mum and dads with Angus tonight because he's not staying on the weekend. I hope you understand. I love you.""

26On 21 October 2011, Mr Rawlinson sent a message to Ms Evans as follows:

""God I want her ended, I'll send you the text I just got from her.""

27Mr Rawlinson then created and sent a further message to Ms Evans on 21 October 2011 that he falsely indicated had been sent to him by the deceased. It was as follows:

""Your [sic] fucked, yes you, and your fucking mut kid and your fucking mut wife. You've given me nothing. What have you done for me. I will end you. Why didn't you fill the car with petrol this morning. Because you would rather spend your money on your fucking rat kid. I've had to go to woolies today because you don't buy anything. Nearly 40 dollars you prick. Fuck you! I'll finish him, you watch.""

28Ms Evans responded:

""Well she thinks ur worth more to her dead. She will then get all ur money. Maybe you should ask her why she wants you around then...Well hopefully that part of your life is over soon sweetness. I love you.""

29Mr Rawlinson replied:

""Every min away from you takes forever. I want her gone so I'm not having to be away from you. Goodnight beautiful.""

30In the period leading up to the events of 27 October 2011, Ms Evans contacted Michelle Proud and asked her if she knew anyone who could bash the deceased. Mr Spicer later called Ms Evans and said that he would do it. It was agreed that Mr Spicer would be paid $3,000 for his assistance. It is apparent from telephone records that Ms Evans and Ms Proud and/or Mr Spicer made contact on 38 occasions between 14.18 on 25 October 2011 and 14.59 the following day. Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson made contact on 54 occasions between 17.06 on 25 October 2011 and 00.07 on 27 October 2011.

31At 11.43 on 26 October 2011, Mr Rawlinson withdrew $1,000 from the Commonwealth Bank ATM at Figtree. He deposited that amount into the TAB account of Peggy-Ann Case at 11.57. Ms Case is Mr Spicer's sister. Ms Case then received a call from Ms Proud telling her that ""a friend"" would deposit money in her account. At 12.33, Ms Case withdrew the money and gave it to Mr Spicer.

32Ms Proud and Mr Spicer then booked to stay at the Oasis Motel in Windang, with Ms Evans' assistance. That motel was located about 20 minutes drive from the deceased's home. The booking was made in Mr Spicer's name using Ms Proud's credit card.

33Ms Evans arranged to borrow her mother's green Hyundai Excel motor vehicle that she drove to an address in Whalan on the afternoon of 26 October 2011. Ms Evans collected Ms Proud and her children from that address. At approximately 16.06, Ms Evans sent a text message to Mr Rawlinson saying, ""I'm heading back to Wollongong. Then I will be returning to collect the main person. I love you"". That was a reference to Mr Spicer. Ms Evans dropped Ms Proud at the motel and returned to Western Sydney, where she collected Mr Spicer and his daughter. From there they drove back to the motel, arriving just before 20.00.

34At about 20.30 on 26 October 2011, a male was observed by a witness parking in Wilford Street, Corrimal a short distance from the deceased's home. It was the Crown case that this male was Mr Rawlinson. Phone records show that he was in Corrimal at that time. CCTV footage also depicts a white Ford Falcon utility heading south along the Princes Highway towards Corrimal at 20.38. The Crown contended that Mr Rawlinson was driving the vehicle.

35Ms Evans left the motel and met Mr Rawlinson at the house at which she was then residing, and was provided by him with two keys to the deceased's house. Ms Evans then returned to the motel and collected Mr Spicer.

36Other CCTV footage shows a white Ford Falcon utility heading north on the Princes Highway towards Woonona and away from the deceased's house at 23.49. It is once again the Crown case that Mr Rawlinson, who was making his way home, was driving this vehicle. Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson exchanged nine text messages between 23.40 on 26 October 2011 and 3.31 the following day.

37At 00.40 on 27 October 2011, Ms Evans and Mr Spicer went to the K-Mart store in Figtree and purchased a 10-litre bucket, a water container and an aluminium torch. Mr Spicer paid cash for these items. They then went to two service stations. At the first of these they filled a container with petrol as well as the Hyundai car. At the second they purchased a pack of firelighters and a BIC lighter. From there Ms Evans and Mr Spicer made their way to the home of the deceased, passing the intersection of the Princes Highway and Bellambi Lane at Russell Vale heading north towards Woonona at 1.11. Three minutes later, that Hyundai car travelled through the same intersection heading south towards Corrimal. The car was then parked adjacent to a set of stairs that led directly up to Doncaster Street, Corrimal, about 25 metres from the deceased's home.

38Meghan Errington noticed this car at the base of the stairs at about 1.30 and saw a male and a female get out. She continued driving to her house in Doncaster Street, from where she saw the same two people standing at the top of the stairs leaning against the railing. These people were Ms Evans and Mr Spicer. At about 2.20, Ms Evans and Mr Spicer entered the deceased's house using the keys provided by Mr Rawlinson. Mr Spicer carried a firelighter and the bucket that he had earlier filled with petrol. Ms Evans and Mr Spicer walked up the stairs in the deceased's house. Mr Spicer handed the firelighter to Ms Evans, which Mr Spicer had wrapped in a petrol soaked cloth. Mr Spicer said to Ms Evans, ""When I say light it, light it and throw it"".

39The deceased was at this time asleep in her bed. Mr Spicer proceeded to pour or to throw petrol from the bucket around the deceased's bedroom and possibly onto the bed where the deceased lay asleep. Mr Spicer said, ""Light it now."" Ms Evans lit the fire lighter and threw it into the bathroom. Mr Spicer retrieved it from the bathroom and threw it into the deceased's bedroom. The petrol ignited immediately. They ran from the house. Fire consumed the bedroom within a very short time. Whilst fleeing from the house, Ms Evans dropped the two house keys. Mr Spicer picked up one of the keys and gave it to Ms Evans.

40The Fire Brigade arrived at the house at about 2.35. The upper level of the house was by then well alight, with flames visible from the bedroom window and the roof. The fire was extinguished and the body of the deceased was located on the small landing at the top of the stairs leading to her bedroom. It was the Crown case that the deceased was awoken after the fire started and attempted to escape, but was overcome by fire and smoke. She collapsed and died just beyond the entrance to her bedroom.

41Ms Evans neither assisted the deceased nor called an ambulance or the Fire Brigade.

42A crime scene was immediately established. The key to the deceased's home dropped by Ms Evans was found on the roadway outside the house. It fitted the front screen door. The house did not show any signs of forced entry.

43An autopsy conducted by a forensic pathologist established that the deceased had inhaled smoke and soot, indicating that she had been alive and breathing during the fire. Petrol was detected on remnants of clothing worn by her.

44Mr Rawlinson was interviewed at Wollongong Police Station that day. He did not disclose his relationship with Ms Evans, or his knowledge of or involvement in the fatal fire. He told police that he had not seen the deceased since 25 October 2011, but said he had sent her a text message the following day. He said that he went down to the Wollongong Harbour in the evening of 26 October 2011 and that he arrived home at about 23.30.

45Between 15.35 and 16.50 on the day of the fire, Ms Evans met with investigators from the Police Integrity Commission at the Novotel Hotel in Wollongong. She had contacted them prior to the death of the deceased, on 29 September 2011. She spoke to the officers about two allegedly inappropriate relationships between the deceased and police officers, in the course of which the deceased was said to have supplied illicit drugs and sex in exchange for reduced charges or better sentencing outcomes for her clients. Ms Evans disclosed that she was having a sexual relationship with the deceased's boyfriend Mr Rawlinson. Investigators to whom Ms Evans spoke were unaware of the fatal fire at that time. The allegations of corrupt conduct were never substantiated.

46On 28 October 2011, Ms Proud went to a Cash Converters store in Warrawong and pawned a number of items. She received $70 in cash, which she used to pay for the return trip to Sydney for herself, Mr Spicer and the children. Ms Proud later told her friend Amie Hull, ""Wendy had dogged us, we had to hock Tayla's camera, Matthew's video games, and DS and Wii just to pay for a train ticket to get home for all of us"". A short time later, Ms Proud told Ms Hull that she was going to do a grocery shop but was waiting for Wendy to put money into her account. Ms Proud told Ms Hull that it was ""a couple of thousand"" dollars. Shortly thereafter Ms Proud told Ms Hull, ""Wendy had not paid the money that she owes us and BJ and I are going to bash the shit out of her if she does not pay in the next day or so"".

47Police investigations led to recovery of a large amount of evidence after the fire. That evidence included the following material.

48Ms Evans went to the Warrawong K-Mart with Ms Regal where she purchased two Samsung phones. Ms Evans told Ms Regal that they were for her and Mr Rawlinson.

49Ms Proud left a number of voice messages for Ms Evans and also sent her several text messages. They included the following:


""Hey Wendy, what's going on, it's Michelle, I need that money. Today.""


""BJ's going to Berry tonight. He's going to drop into Brad's. He's got a job to do. Um, either have the money in the TAB account by seven or he'll be around at Brad's house.""


""I want my fucking money bitch and this is Michelle. Where is my fucking money? I'll come down and I'll hunt you down. I know where Brad lives so don't fucking stuff me around. I'm nearly kicked out of my fucking house.""

50On 5 November 2011 at 17.53, Ms Evans sent a text message to Ms Proud and Mr Spicer saying, ""Dad put in at dimond beach rec 495 000 143 478 929 903 $50."" Ms Evans was visiting her father at Diamond Beach at the time.

51Three days later at 11.57, Ms Evans sent Mr Rawlinson a text message saying, ""By one"". At 12.39, Mr Rawlinson withdrew $1,000 from his bank account and gave it to Ms Evans whom he met near Dapto. Ms Evans deposited that amount into Ms Case's TAB account at 15.07 and Mr Spicer withdrew it at 16.57.

52At 9.00 on 16 November 2011, Mr Rawlinson gave a statement to the police in which he said that he had not spoken to Ms Evans for the previous six months. At 11.20 the same day, Mr Rawlinson called Ms Evans from a public phone and they arranged to meet. Mr Rawlinson called Ms Evans again at 14.17 and she told him that she was at Dapto heading to the Telstra shop. Mr Rawlinson asked her, ""So you don't know about Telstra, you don't know about those messages yet?"" Ms Evans responded, ""I'm walking in there right now."" They then organised to meet at Michael Hill Jewellers. Immediately thereafter, Ms Evans and an unknown female entered the Dapto Telstra shop and spoke to an employee who told them, in answer to their query, that deleted text messages could not be retrieved. Both Ms Evans and her companion smiled when they were told this.

53Ms Evans was interviewed at Sutherland Police Station the next day. She did not disclose her relationship with Mr Rawlinson, or any knowledge of or involvement in the fatal fire. She told the police that she had not communicated with him since his birthday party and that she had only met him a handful of times in the presence of the deceased. She said that she had not spoken to Mr Rawlinson since the death of the deceased. She also provided a false alibi, claiming that on the night of the fire she had gone to ""The Oaks"" at Albion Park to collect her mother. She said that she had spoken to Ms Proud by phone throughout the evening of 26 October 2011 but had not seen her since January or February 2011. Ms Evans also said that her contact with the deceased had steadily decreased since she discovered that she had slept with Mr Field.

54At about 21.00 on 18 November 2011, Ms Evans spoke to Mr Spicer and Ms Proud. She asked them, ""You got the other thousand, didn't you?"" Mr Spicer responded, ""Yeah"". In the context of discussing the ongoing police investigation, Ms Proud says, ""Tell Brad to keep calm."" Ms Evans replied, ""He is. But he's now stressing about me, because they're hammering me..."".

55On 25 November 2011 at 13.09, Mr Rawlinson withdrew $400 from his account and met Ms Evans and gave it to her. At 14.26 Ms Evans put $350 into Ms Case's TAB account. Ms Evans then sent a message to Mr Spicer and Ms Proud at 15.19 saying, ""Sorry we just put 350 in now that's all we have."" Ms Proud left a voice message for Ms Evans at 15.28 saying, ""Hey hon, only me um, we got it. Thanks. Bye.""

56Only six minutes later, Ms Proud called Ms Evans on her mobile phone. They discussed the fact that the TAB was investigating transactions on Ms Case's account. Ms Proud suggested that Ms Case was being investigated for money laundering. Ms Evans then referred to the fact that she has just deposited $350 in that account. Ms Case in fact withdrew that sum at 16.00 that same afternoon. 

57Police seized the Hyundai motor vehicle on 14 December 2011. 

58Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson spoke by telephone on 19 December 2011 about text messages that they had exchanged, of which there were nine between 23.40 on 26 October 2011 and 3.31 the following morning. Mr Rawlinson advised Ms Evans that the police had called and wanted to see him, because they were checking some ""inconsistencies"" in relation to her. Other portions of the intercepted calls between them on 19 December 2011 included the following:

""RAWLINSON: We cannot be seen to have been together because they'll put the two of us together, as the two that did it. We cannot say that we've been together. I don't know what to do.

EVANS: Fuckin' hell.

RAWLINSON: I'm fucked. My life is over.

EVANS: If you go, I've got to go with you.

...

EVANS: There's nothing there to prove anything though.

RAWLINSON: Well that text message that night does, doesn't it?

EVANS: What does it say? Do you remember? Something about ripping the screen off, something like that.

RAWLINSON: Pardon?

EVANS: Mentioned something about ripping the screen and that.

RAWLINSON: About what?

EVANS: Just ripping the screen.

RAWLINSON: Say it again.

EVANS: Didn't it just say something about ripping the screen?

RAWLINSON: Doesn't it say something like just get in and do it and get out?

EVANS: I don't know.

RAWLINSON: Huh?

EVANS: No, it was about make sure they rip the screen from the outside, something like that.""

59In another call on the same day, Mr Rawlinson refers to, ""the last couple of messages that I had with you"". The conversation then continues:

""EVANS: I can't remember 'cause I erased everything.

RAWLINSON: Yeah, well remember the last couple of messages basically you asked me if she was asleep and I said, 'yes'. And then I just said to you, well do it and get out, do it and get out.

EVANS: Mm.

RAWLINSON: Remember?

EVANS: Yeah. Yeah.

...

RAWLINSON: 'Cause I don't know what to say. Yeah, I had communication with you. What sort of communication? Oh well I was just speaking to her in relation to keeping Scott away from Katie... Is that all? Yeah. Then why is there a message talking to her on the night before stating, 'Is she asleep? Need to tell me when she's asleep.' 'Yeah, she's definitely asleep. Um just get the job done and get away.' What do I say to that?

EVANS: I don't know 'cause I'm hoping that's what they haven't got.

RAWLINSON: Well I don't know what to do if they've got that one.

EVANS: But does it say her, does it actually say her name?

RAWLINSON: No.""

60Ms Evans also spoke with Ms Proud that day:

""PROUD: The only problem will be if they check servos.

EVANS: Well, what but only for that part of it. Like that's the only thing.

PROUD: Yeah.

EVANS: 'Cause we put petrol...""

61Ms Proud then asked Ms Evans if she was on a ""safe"" phone. Ms Evans assured Ms Proud that she was speaking on a different phone altogether and the conversation then continued with Ms Evans referring to filling up the tin ""down there"", a reference to Wollongong.

62I am satisfied of these facts beyond reasonable doubt.

Subjective circumstances 

63Ms Evans consulted Dr Richard Furst, a psychiatrist, for the purposes of these proceedings. He provided reports dated 20 November 2013 and 14 March 2014. Much of the material that follows is taken from those reports.

64Ms Evans is a 41-year-old Aboriginal woman. She has three sons aged 24, 21 and 20 and a daughter aged 18. Ms Evans grew up in Unanderra and Berkeley, attending Farmborough Road Public School and Berkeley High School to Year 10. She became pregnant for the first time when still at school at the age of 16. She completed her senior high school years at Illawarra Senior College. She does not suffer from any learning disorder or ADHD. She was a well behaved and quiet student. She was never suspended or expelled.

65Ms Evans was hit by a car when she was 8 years of age, sustaining a fractured skull and femur and suffering loss of consciousness. She suffered emotional difficulties as a teenager, feeling unwanted by her father. Her parents separated when she was in her infancy. She was raised by her mother and stepfather, who was an alcoholic.

66She had a conflicted relationship with her stepmother, who treated her violently. She and her sister were also sexually abused by a grandparental figure when she was about 9 or 10 years of age. She reported this but was told to keep it to herself. She was exposed to violence in the family home. Her mother was imprisoned for fraud when Ms Evans was first pregnant.

67Ms Evans married the father of her first three children in 1996. They were divorced in 2000. Their relationship continued sporadically thereafter until 2010.

68Ms Evans started work as a childcare worker in 1995 and worked as an Aboriginal teachers' aide between 1997 and 2001. She fell into depression in 1999 in the context of her failing marriage and the stress of parenting. Her sons all suffered from ADHD. She was treated with antidepressant medication between 1999 and 2000.

69Ms Evans started a relationship with Scott Field in about 2000. That lasted for six months, after which she returned to her husband. Ms Evans suffered from depression over subsequent years. She had low self-esteem, self-doubt and frequent episodes of tearfulness. She felt hopeless but not suicidal.

70Ms Evans started work with the Attorney-General's Department in 2008, working at the Wollongong Courthouse and the Coroner's Court. She enjoyed that work. She remained on antidepressant medication from time to time until 2011.

71Ms Evans became involved once again with Scott Field from about 2006 to 2010. He had been incarcerated until May 2010 and they separated in December that year. Mr Field advised her to, ""kick her son out of the house"" for stealing from the home. That ended up destroying her relationship with her son. She felt guilty for preferring her relationship with Mr Field over the needs of her children. Ms Evans reported that Mr Field had control over her, even after they separated. He physically assaulted her in December 2010.

72Ms Evans met the deceased through her work at Port Kembla Court. They developed a close friendship. The deceased informed Ms Evans about her relationship with Mr Rawlinson. Ms Evans confided in the deceased about her problems with Mr Field, from whom the deceased told her to get away as she did not like him. The deceased also assisted Ms Evans with her son when he was arrested in 2011.

73Mr Field assaulted Ms Evans in April 2011. His parole was revoked. The deceased provided support for her at that time. Ms Evans attended the deceased's birthday party in June that year. She was unaware that the deceased and Mr Field had been involved sexually some little time beforehand. Ms Evans also attended Mr Rawlinson's birthday party in July. Mr Rawlinson revealed to Ms Evans that the deceased and Mr Field had been together. She became upset about this.

74Ms Evans reported to Dr Furst that Mr Rawlinson told her at around this time he was going to kill himself. She also reported that Mr Rawlinson told her that the deceased intended to hurt her children and have her daughter removed from her care. Ms Evans began to doubt everyone, including the deceased. She reported to Dr Furst that she believed everything that Mr Rawlinson told her, and what he said about what the deceased was going to do to her son.

75Ms Evans became involved in an intimate relationship with Mr Rawlinson from the end of August 2011. She described him to Dr Furst as appearing to be ""the perfect man"".

76Ms Evans has no drug or alcohol history of significance.

77Ms Evans reported to Dr Furst that she arranged with her co-accused to have the deceased bashed, so that she could feel the pain that she felt. Ms Evans said that she believed that the deceased was going to have her children bashed or sent to gaol. The following is an extract from Dr Furst's first report:

""She claimed she rang her friend Michelle [co-accused Ms Proud] to see if Ms Proud's partner [co-accused Mr 'BJ' Spicer] 'knew anybody who could bash her.'

Ms Evans said, 'I had no intention of doing anything until after one month of Brad asking if I could find anyone to have her bashed. BJ agreed. I had to pay $1000 into his TAB account by 26/10/11'.

The offence took place in the early hours of 27/10/11. Ms Evans maintained that she never thought Ms Foreman would be killed.

She added, 'I was petrified on the night. BJ has a violent temper. At first, I never thought he was using petrol. BJ told me to light the firelighter and throw it into the bedroom. I threw it into the bathroom. She was in her bed. I was one step down from the top step.'

On further questioning, Ms Evans acknowledged awareness BJ had poured petrol in the house and lighting a firelighter was a dangerous thing to do. However, she still claimed she was 'in fear of BJ,' 'numb' and 'annoyed' about the things she believed the victim said and did.""

78Ms Evans told Dr Furst that she hated herself, and that she had become somebody she did not recognise, from a caring and responsible person to ""like that"". She claimed to have twice attempted suicide between the death of the deceased and the date of her arrest. She has also since come to realise that the things she believed about the deceased were not true. She has come to detest both Mr Field and Mr Rawlinson. She is unable to explain why she listened to Mr Rawlinson but believes she may have been searching for a ""father figure"". She believes she was easily manipulated. She told Dr Furst that she pleaded guilty because it was, ""the right thing to do"".

79Ms Evans told Dr Furst that she frequently thinks about the night of the offence and the impact that her actions have had upon her own family. She said that her family wants to know ""where Wendy went"" and how she ""participated in one of the most horrific crimes"". She said, ""I should have gone to the police to stop it from happening."" Dr Furst wrote this:

""She expressed remorse about her role in the murder of Katie and the impact of this on Ms Foreman's family. She said, 'I feel every day for her family. That this happened and I did nothing to stop it. I didn't think of the alternatives. I've seen her nieces and nephews and brother. I met her parents. They thought we were out partying. We were driving to Nowra for doughnuts, watching DVDs with the kids. I can never take back time. I want to be sentenced to give her family some peace.""

80Dr Furst expressed the opinion that Ms Evans, ""was probably vulnerable to the influence of...[Mr] Rawlinson by virtue of her depression, addiction to the pain medication codeine, and general poor judgment by virtue of her dependent personality traits and idealisation of [Mr] Rawlinson as 'the perfect man'."" He considered that given her propensity to depression, lack of criminal antecedents, and separation from her children, a custodial sentence might well weigh more heavily on her than the average inmate. He also considered that she had insight into her offending behaviour and was remorseful. Dr Furst expressed the opinion that Ms Evans had a low risk of re-offending and good prospects of being successfully rehabilitated, notwithstanding the obvious seriousness of the offence in question.

81In response to specific questions, Dr Furst opined that Ms Evans was, ""probably more vulnerable to being manipulated"" by Mr Rawlinson, ""by virtue of her adverse childhood experiences and unique personality structure"". Dr Furst said this:

""In my opinion, the pattern of communication between Ms Evans and [Mr] Rawlinson, relationship dynamics, and a degree of apparent manipulation probably impaired Ms Evans' capacity to rationally deal with the threat she perceived the deceased constituted, especially having regard to her personality structure and personal vulnerabilities.""

82He was of the view that, ""her decision making at the time of the offence appears to have been adversely affected by her romantic attachment to [Mr] Rawlinson and a desire for the two of them to continue a relationship without the deceased"".

Mitigating factors 

83I have referred later in these reasons to the effect of the early plea of guilty. Ms Evans is entitled to the benefit of that plea to the extent that it carries an obvious utilitarian value and informs the existence and extent of remorse. However, in this last respect I note that Ms Evans did not enter the witness box and give evidence of her remorse before me. I found that decision somewhat difficult to understand in the circumstances. If Ms Evans was truly remorseful, it confounds common understanding for her not to have taken a perfect opportunity to express it in her own words in the presence of the deceased's parents, who had both read their respective victim impact statements from that very location earlier in the day. It seems to me to be all the more difficult to understand when the expression of what is said to be a genuine and sincerely felt emotion is simultaneously likely to advance at least my understanding of how Ms Evans has felt following the death of the deceased, particularly having regard to her admitted involvement in causing it. I remain troubled when I am asked to assume favourably to an accused person that he or she is truly remorseful, or in simple words, truly sorry, for what he or she has done, when the closest I am taken to hearing it comes from a second hand report of what a medical professional has managed to elicit during a clinical examination. The giving of direct evidence of remorse can also help to illuminate the distinction between true remorse and self-pity. Usually only one of those emotions is relevant for sentencing purposes. 

84Ms Evans has no prior criminal record. It was submitted on her behalf that this offence was a gross aberration. That submission is true by definition.

85I have been asked to accept that Ms Evans' familial circumstances and mental state are such that she is likely to find incarceration more difficult than might otherwise be the case and that I should take that into account in sentencing her. I accept immediately that it must be excruciatingly painful for Ms Evans to realise that her actions will deprive her of a close family relationship for many years. However, I am unable to detect any basis for distinguishing her from almost every other person with a family convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for murder in this State.

86I have had particular regard to the evidence from Dr Furst concerning Ms Evans' mental state and psychological and psychiatric health. I accept that she has from time to time required medication and treatment for depression and associated conditions. It appears that she continues to be vulnerable to the reoccurrence of such health problems. However, I am also informed by the ease with which she was able, notwithstanding these conditions, to operate and perform as an active member of society, to all outward appearances unaffected, or at least not disadvantaged, by her afflictions. There does not appear to me to be the slightest indication of mental illness or associated disability evident from the detailed agreed facts in her case. The only medical attention that she appears to have required as the relevant events unfolded was a prescription for antibiotics that she spoke about to Mr Rawlinson.

87For much the same reason, I consider that Ms Evans has particularly good prospects of rehabilitation. I accept that she has acted completely out of character, a fact that is empirically attested to by her uneventful criminal history and subjectively confirmed by testimonials with which I have been provided. I feel unambiguously confident that she is unlikely ever to re-offend. It follows that I do not consider that Ms Evans will constitute any danger to the community upon her release. These conclusions are also reinforced by the fact that Ms Evans will be considerably older when she is released.

Aggravating circumstances 

88The crime was committed in company with Mr Spicer. It was perpetrated in the home of the deceased. It was also the result of what I consider to have been considerable planning.

Objective seriousness 

89Ms Evans' crime is objectively very serious. I was urged by the Crown to find that it was in the worst category of case. I was taken in detail to s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and to authorities such as R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 and R v Miles [2002] NSWCCA 276.

90Section 61(1) is in these terms:

""(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.""

91In R v Merritt, Wood CJ at CL said this at [42]:

""[42] Several possible interpretations of the section exist (subject to s 61(3)): 

(a) First, that a life sentence is required, if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest, in any one of the four indicia, is such that it could only be met by such a sentence;

(b) Second, that such a sentence is only required if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest, in each of the four indicia, is such that it could only be met by such a sentence; and

(c) Third, that such a sentence is required if the culpability is so extreme that the community interest, in the combined effect of such of the four indicia as are applicable, could only be met by such a sentence (a construction which would embrace a circumstance where any one or more of those factors may be of itself insufficient, or inapplicable). 

(d) Fourth, a variation of the third construction, that such a sentence is only required where the culpability is so extreme that the combined effect of the four indicia, with each contributing to some degree, is such that it could only be met by such a sentence.""

92The absence of one or more of the indicia in s 61(1) will make it more difficult for a trial judge to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the level of culpability is so extreme as to require the imposition of a life sentence: R v Merritt at [5]. However, the absence of the need for personal, as distinct from general, deterrence, is unlikely to influence the decision to any significant degree: R v Merritt at [6]. 

93A two-step process is involved in determining whether a life sentence is mandated. The Court must first determine whether, on the objective facts, the level of culpability is so extreme that it warrants the maximum penalty. The Court must then determine whether the subjective factors are capable of displacing the prima facie need for the maximum penalty: R v Miles at [204]; R v Merritt at [37].

94The fact that an offender pleads guilty does not automatically preclude the availability of a life sentence: R v Penisini [2004] NSWCCA 339. Moreover, in some cases the objective circumstances may be so appalling as to overwhelm the offender's subjective circumstances, including prospects of rehabilitation: R v Miles at [203].

95Ms Evans acknowledged that this is a very serious case of murder, but submitted that it was not a worst case, and not one calling for a life sentence. Prominent among her contentions in that respect is the submission that she was the victim of undue influence and manipulation by Mr Rawlinson. These submissions were made by reference to the objective gravity of the offending conduct, to which they are obviously relevant. That is because they inform conclusions about Ms Evans' moral culpability. Having regard to the evidence from Dr Furst, however, it seems to me that they are also relevant to a consideration of her subjective circumstances. I hasten to observe, however, that Ms Evans is entitled to have any favourable conclusions reached by me in this respect brought to account in the same way in whatever setting her submissions are considered.

96Mr Smith, of counsel for Ms Evans, submitted that Ms Evans was made to believe that the deceased had threatened her and her family. There is evidence, which was led in the Crown case, that she told other people about these alleged threats. It is now accepted that Mr Rawlinson manufactured these threats and that they were never made by the deceased. The threshold issue is whether Ms Evans believed that what Mr Rawlinson said was true.

97There was evidence led by the Crown at the trial, which Ms Evans embraces for present purposes, to suggest that Mr Rawlinson was a manipulative and unscrupulous liar. Perhaps the most dramatic indication of this characteristic is to be seen in the series of text messages passing between Mr Rawlinson and the deceased on 26 October 2011 between approximately 16:07:50 in the afternoon and 23:03:46 the same evening:






R to F

16:07:50

I love you. Is work going ok.


R to F

18:21:02

How is work going babe. When do you think you'll be finishing


F to R

18:39:03

I don't know it doesn't matter to you anyway


R to F

18:40:09

Why babe it does matter. I love you. You are everything to me.


F to R

18:50:42

Go and talk to mum and dad they're both too gutless to say anything to me. You're all fucked


R to F                 

18:55:12

I don't want to talk to them. I want you and to be with you and talk to you. You are everything. You are the most beautiful woman in the world whom I adore. I'm sorry for saying that to your mum. I wanted you to know because I love you.


F to R

19:00:48

Good cause I don't want to talk to them either, or you


R to F

19:08:21

Please babe, I love you.


F to R

19:50:02

So pathetic the way you all ignore me


R to F

19:57:05

Babe I'm not ignoring you, you are everything.


F to R

19:58:56

Yes you are. Tell me what's going on I know you would have spoken to one of them today


R to F

20:05:12

Babe I'm not ignoring you I swear and I havnt spoken to either of them today. What I said to you last night is what I know. I'm sorry babe but I havnt spoken to them.


F to R

20:08:58

Last night you said to me ""your dad talked to your mum and has been for a few weeks"" and then I ask you when he told her and you say last night. You can't even keep a story straight


R to F

20:12:06

No babe you asked me when your dad spoke to your mum and I said yesterday being Monday. He told your mum he has been spitting up blood and yellow stuff for a few weeks.


F to R

20:13:05

No that's not what you said when you were waving the knife at me you said he's been talking to her for weeks


R to F

20:16:12

No babe, I said that he told your mum that he had been spitting up stuff for a few weeks. He rang her on Monday and told her that.


R to F

21:04:53

I love you babe, I'm not ignoring you. You are everything.


F to R

21:14:15

If you really didn't hear from her you still don't think she's pissed off with you?


R to F

21:17:40

I haven't heard from her babe. No I don't think so babe but you know her better.


F to R

21:18:49

Why don't you think so since you did what you agreed you wouldn't?


R to F

21:23:34

I don't know babe maybe because she didn't seem angry at me on the phone last night.


F to R

21:31:57

That's because she would be worried about what's going to happen now I know but she'll get over that and start thinking about it and then it will start. Don't you think she would have rung you about the pool or something today if she wasn't pissed off?


R to F

21:40:22

I just didn't think she rang today babe because I thought it must have been to wet for them to work.


F to R

21:47:14

Ok


R to F

21:51:51

Babe you know her better, I Hope she's not. I love you, I'm sorry.


F to R

21:54:02

The kids are the ones who will miss out


R to F

22:05:34

I don't want the kids to miss out and I don't want to miss out on them or you. I love and adore you and I love those kids.


R to F

22:05:43

I'm sorry babe.


F to R

22:07:13

Oh well I hope you're all happy now


R to F

22:22:49

No I'm not babe. I miss you so much and I wish I was there to hold you and talk to you. You are everything to me and I live [sic] those kids.


F to R

22:25:08

I don't want you to talk to me there's nothing to talk about. Well don't blame me if she stops you seeing them I warned you


F to R

22:34:36

Can you meet me at the servo in the morning because I can't get the petrol cap off


R to F

22:40:17

I don't blame you. I wish I could talk to you about everything because I love you.


R to F

22:41:05

Yeah babe no worries. What time do you want to meet.


F to R

23:01:59

I don't know I'll text you when I'm leaving if that's ok


R to F

23:03:46

Yeah ok babe, no worries. I love you.

98Within three and a half hours of the last message, the deceased had been killed.

99Ms Evans argues that Mr Rawlinson had the power and the ability to manipulate and influence her, as evidenced in part by this very deception of the deceased herself. Ms Evans submitted that Mr Rawlinson manipulated and deceived her in just the same way, and that she was inevitably taken in by promises of a life together with Mr Rawlinson and convinced by him to become involved in whatever he planned should happen to the deceased. She contends that she would never have become involved in the death of the deceased, or indeed in anything like it, if it were not for Mr Rawlinson's cynical conscription of her to his service. The Crown made submissions to such an effect at the trial, to which Ms Evans made favourable reference for present purposes.

100Counsel for Ms Evans conceded that there was no doubt that she was angry at the deceased because of the deceased's relationship with Mr Field. However, it is submitted that there is no evidence that from the time that she became aware of that fact Ms Evans set upon her own plan physically to hurt the deceased. On the contrary, Ms Evans emphasises that it was only after Mr Rawlinson suggested that the deceased had threatened to harm Ms Evans and her children that she became a participant in any plan to injure the deceased.

101Counsel for Ms Evans referred to these matters in the context of Dr Furst's opinion concerning her particular personality traits, her depression and her vulnerability against a background of familial discord, physical and sexual abuse, limited contact with her father and becoming a mother when still a child herself.

102It will be immediately apparent that resolution of this question necessarily confronts the force of submissions made on Mr Rawlinson's behalf at the trial, to which I take him to adhere, that contrary to what Ms Evans says, it was he who was the victim of control and manipulation by her. I will specifically address that proposition later in these remarks. 

103An important starting point must be that Ms Evans was not aware of the deceptions that Mr Rawlinson was simultaneously practising upon her and the deceased. Whereas it may now be easy with hindsight and better information to discard what Mr Rawlinson was saying about the deceased as fantastic and obviously unbelievable, as indeed it was, Ms Evans did not have the same frame of reference that is now available to me. Ms Evans was unaware that Mr Rawlinson was professing his love for the deceased in private communications to which Ms Evans had no access. Mr Rawlinson was furnishing Ms Evans with misinformation about the deceased that had the potential to strike a chord with her because of her genuinely unfavourable predisposition to the deceased that arose from her short physical relationship with Mr Field. It seems to me to be highly probable that Ms Evans would not have become involved in any plan to harm the deceased if Mr Rawlinson had not beguiled or encouraged her to do so.

104Verification of that conclusion can in my view be found in an examination of the text messages between Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson prior to 27 October 2011. As far as the evidence reveals, these commence in July 2011, not long after they spoke to each other at Anne Foreman's birthday party in April that year. On the day after his own memorable birthday party, Mr Rawlinson sent Ms Evans a text message about his relationship with the deceased, saying, ""Yeah things have come crashing down for us."" He continues with what is now excruciating irony, saying, ""but the most important thing is honesty."" He goes on to say, ""I swear I'm being honest with you."" Mr Rawlinson did not, however, adhere to that mantra.

105Significantly as well is the fact that this group of text messages is completely devoid of any corresponding deception of Mr Rawlinson by Ms Evans. Indeed, one very prominent feature of Ms Evans' messages is her expression of support for Mr Rawlinson throughout the time that his relationship with the deceased was unravelling. Mr Rawlinson constantly resorts to her as a sounding board or confidante and she constantly responds with encouragement and assistance. That extended as well to his relationship difficulties with his son.

106The patent normality of Ms Evans' approach to Mr Rawlinson's difficulties in his relationship with the deceased can be seen quite starkly in a series of messages exchanged by them in early September 2011. Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson were by then in the first days of an intimate relationship. The following exchange demonstrates in my opinion that Ms Evans was clearly attempting to exert a moderating influence upon Mr Rawlinson and advising that he should in effect just move on, as well as the fact that she saw that there was no genuine threat to herself from the deceased:





R to E                

18:14:49

E to R

21:44:05

We will survive it. Have fun being with Angus, play music enjoy yourself. I am missing you too.

107On 12 September 2011, Ms Evans sent a message to Mr Rawlinson telling him that she missed not having him there with her but said, ""Angus should be the priority in your life over anything else."" 

108Shortly after midnight on 18 September 2011, Mr Rawlinson sent a text message to the deceased that concluded with the words, ""Goodnight beautiful, I love you."" Just after lunch on the following day he sent a message to Ms Evans saying, in part, ""I miss you"" and ""I want her gone beautiful because I want to spend my life with you.""

109On 2 October 2011, Mr Rawlinson sent a message to Ms Evans saying, ""I know your [sic] angry and pissed off at me. I'm sorry. I love you."" Ms Evans replied saying, ""Don't worry about it. Hope your [sic] having an enjoyable day. Next week isn't coming fast enough. I love you too. I miss you."" Just before midnight on the same day, Mr Rawlinson sent a message to Ms Evans' phone that was apparently directed to Ms De Souza, in which among other things he said to her, ""She [referring to Ms Evans] said to me earlier today that next week couldn't come soon enough and I agree totally.""

110It is clear that whatever might have been intended by the references to ""next week"", they are not matched by anything that is known to have happened within that time frame. It also seems unlikely that they were sinister, because Mr Rawlinson openly mentions ""next week"" in his message to Ms De Souza.

111It is difficult to pinpoint the moment when Ms Evans changes from a patient and interested listener into an active participant in plans to murder the deceased. Certainly by 9 October 2011, when Ms Evans, in an obvious reference to the deceased, tells Mr Rawlinson that, ""she is not destroying your chance with me"" and says that, ""I know she is your devil"" but that, ""she will be out of our lives soon"", Ms Evans is demonstrating a different approach. That appears to be confirmed in the following exchange of messages on 14 October 2011:

""R to E: Please tell me it's sorted for tomorrow night. I can't handle more than one more night.

E to R: It is sorted so please stop stressing. No more nights to put up with after tomorrow night sweetness. Please stay safe. Remember that I love you.""

112Once again, nothing appears to have happened the following night. However, within a short time Ms Evans made contact with Ms Proud and Mr Spicer with a view to acquiring their assistance. By 26 October 2011, Ms Evans is actively driving between Whalan and Wollongong with ""the main person"", in anticipation of buying the petrol and other equipment with which to attack the deceased in her home the following morning.

113It is trite to observe that Ms Evans was fundamentally involved in the events leading up to and resulting in the death of the deceased. I am however satisfied on the balance of probabilities that her participation came about to a not inconsiderable degree as the result of the significant influences exerted upon her by Mr Rawlinson and a web of lies and deceit that he spun. I am satisfied that Mr Rawlinson manipulated Ms Evans emotionally and psychologically by creating the totally false impression that for as long as the deceased was alive she would remain an immovable obstacle to Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson ""growing old together."" That conclusion reduces in a small way her moral culpability. 

114Accordingly, while I accept that there is much force in the Crown's submissions, I am unable to accept that Ms Evans' crime is one that attracts a sentence of life imprisonment. It is not in the worst category of case. However, because I consider her crime to be objectively very serious, it is important that I set out the reasons for coming to that conclusion.

115First, the circumstances of the deceased's death and the manner in which she died. The Crown referred to the fact that the deceased was incinerated. Such a description is on one view very emotionally loaded. Unfortunately, it is completely accurate. The deceased was confronted with what was an inferno that exploded in the quiet of the night in the home where she lived. It was unexpected and inescapable. The fact that the deceased was found such a short distance from her bed suggests quite strongly that she was quickly overcome by heat and smoke. She died alone, with no possible chance of escape from the blaze and no apparent prospect of survival even if she had. In the scheme of human understanding, it is difficult to contemplate a more frightening and excruciating way to die.

116Secondly, the fire that led to her death was carefully planned. Counsel for Ms Evans urged upon me that the level of planning was not greatly sophisticated. To the extent that what happened to the deceased was brutal and barbaric, that submission may have some semantic force. What occurred in fact was a carefully planned and executed scheme to ensure that the deceased was killed. This murder involved the premeditated purchase, from more than one location, of items guaranteed to start a fire that could not easily be avoided and that was highly likely to be fatal. This was not a case of a fire started in the downstairs laundry or even in the upstairs sitting room that might, in either instance, conceivably have offered the deceased a chance to escape. Whatever dispute there may be about whether petrol was poured on the floor around the deceased's bed or thrown into the bedroom from the doorway, the unavoidable fact is that it was done deliberately. The deceased's night clothing retained traces of petrol. Ms Evans and Mr Spicer were provided with keys to the house so that they could enter it with ease. Moreover, the text messages to which Ms Evans was a party suggest that the deceased's death had for some time been contemplated as an approaching prospect. It did not occur spontaneously or reactively or to the surprise of anyone other than the deceased.

117Thirdly, it was necessary to solicit the services of Mr Spicer and Ms Proud and to pay them money for their assistance. That was itself indicative of a plan. It is both unnecessary and improper to speculate about whether or not that was also an attempt to avoid detection.

118Fourthly, Ms Proud and Mr Spicer were all ultimately conveyed to and accommodated in a motel a short drive from where the deceased lived. That was in accordance with arrangements made deliberately and in advance. The fact that the plan would not appear to have extended to ensuring that they were returned to Whalan with similar ease is not to the point.

Intention

119The Crown contended that I would be satisfied that Ms Evans committed the offence with an intention to kill the deceased. That submission was supported by the (not altogether settled) proposition that an offence involving an intention to kill is generally more serious than one involving only an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. I briefly examined the different possible views about this issue in R v Kristi Anne Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 952 at [25] - [27]. Counsel for Ms Evans in fact submitted that this might very well be a case where there is little difference objectively between an intention to kill and an alternative liability for murder. 

120Accepting for present purposes that there may be little difference, either in this case or more generally, between the two possibilities, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Evans intended to kill the deceased. Much of what I have already referred to supports that conclusion. For example, the location and intensity of the fire is overwhelmingly supportive of the proposition that the fire was set with a view to killing the deceased. If the intention had been merely to cause serious bodily injury to the deceased, one might have expected either some other method of causing injury to have been used, such as direct physical assaults upon her as she lay in bed, or the setting of a fire in some location that may have caused injury to the deceased but permitted her to escape. The setting of a fire that must inevitably have led to an immediate conflagration within a small room with only one means of ingress or egress, is highly inconsistent with any other conclusion. That satisfies me beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Evans intended to kill the deceased.

121It is an agreed fact that Ms Evans threw a firelighter into the bathroom rather than the bedroom. It is submitted for her that that is consistent with an intention to do grievous bodily harm to the deceased but not to kill her. That has to be contrasted with the fact that Mr Spicer retrieved the item from the bathroom and threw it into the bedroom while Ms Evans passively stood by. Her failure to intervene to prevent Mr Spicer doing that is inconsistent with the lesser intention and is consistent with an intention to kill.

122Quite apart from that, the content and timing of the text messages between Mr Rawlinson and Ms Evans satisfy me that Ms Evans intended to kill the deceased. I am not satisfied that there is any alternative readily available and credible explanation for words such as, ""God I want her gone"" or, ""then she is gone and we are away from her."" I accept that Ms Evans did not write those words. However, they were written to her and she offered no response to indicate either that she did not understand them or understood them to mean something else. The results of a pending Police Integrity Commission investigation would not have seen the deceased ""gone"" and the surrounding context within which the words appear is telling. 

123Even more significantly, however, would appear to be the total lack of any reference by Ms Evans, or Mr Rawlinson when communicating with her, after the death of the deceased, to any surprise or dismay at the fact that what happened on 27 October 2011 actually caused the death of the deceased, as opposed to something less. If the intention were not to kill the deceased, one would have expected that issue to figure prominently and extravagantly in what they said to each other before they were arrested or realised that their conversations were being intercepted. Quite to the contrary, the conversations between Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson are chillingly sanguine and casual. For example, Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson speak by telephone on 27 November 2011 and discuss ""nice clean fresh crisp...blue and white...sheets"" and whether Mr Rawlinson should join her at Amanda De Souza's house for ""spag bol"".

124I accept for present purposes that Mr Smith's submission, that the difference between the two types of intention may in effect be academic, has some force. The circumstances of the killing, even accepting the formation by Ms Evans of no more than an intention to cause serious bodily injury, are so dangerous and extreme, that there is arguably little scope for the imposition of a discernibly different sentence. Indeed, although proffered in the context of his opposition to the imposition of a life sentence, counsel for Ms Evans contended that the relevant sentencing objectives could be satisfied in this case by a lengthy determinate sentence.

Special circumstances

125Counsel for Ms Evans contended that I should vary the statutory ratio of parole and non-parole periods to take account of the anticipated need to supervise Ms Evans in the community following her release. Having regard to the length of the parole period that I propose to impose, it does not seem to me that there is any need to do so. Ms Evans is not suffering from any debilitating condition that appears to have interfered with her ability to lead a normal life in the community so far. She is not a young offender whose ability to acquire life skills will have been truncated or obliterated by premature incarceration. None of the factors identified by Dr Furst appears to me to indicate that there are special circumstances extant in this case.

Deterrence

126Having regard to my views about her prospects for rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending, I consider that the need for specific deterrence is small. The same cannot be said for what any sentence Ms Evans receives ought to say about the terrible nature of her crime and the consequences for anyone committing a similar crime. I remain even now completely puzzled about why the deceased was killed. She did nothing to anyone that set her apart from any but the most saintly and pious among us. Even Ms Evans, to her credit, now accepts that nothing she believed about the deceased that inspired her hatred was true. No one should be left in any doubt that scurrilous gossip and meaningless banter can never justify the taking of another person's life. I consider that there is a need generally to deter the commission of such evil conduct as the circumstances of this case have revealed.

Early plea of guilty to murder

127Ms Evans pleaded guilty to the charge of murder at the earliest available opportunity. She is entitled to a discount of 25 percent in those circumstances. Although I have elsewhere referred to remorse, I accept that Ms Evans' plea of guilty is an empirical and objective manifestation of her remorse, in the sense that it corresponds to an unquestioning acceptance of her responsibility. In that respect I specifically accept her statement to Dr Furst, even though not articulated in open court, that her plea was ""the right thing to do"".

MR RAWLINSON

Factual findings 

128I acknowledge that my fact-finding role is that described in Isaacs v R (1997) 41 NSWLR 374; (1997) 90 A Crim R 587. I am required to find the facts material to the sentence. To the extent that my findings are based on facts led at the trial, they must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. Any findings of fact that are adverse to the offender must be found beyond reasonable doubt. Matters in mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. A judge's finding of facts upon which the sentence is based is, ""both on what was necessarily implicit in the jury verdict and on his/her own impressions"": R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [196]. 

129At the sentencing proceedings before me, Mr Rawlinson, through his counsel, maintained his innocence. Having regard to the plea of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter that he offered at the trial, I take that stance to be a maintenance of his admission of guilt to the lesser charge notwithstanding the verdict of the jury that he is guilty of murder. Because Mr Rawlinson has adopted that position, I consider that I should make some specific remarks about the jury verdict, and the extent to which the facts that I am prepared to find are consistent with it.

130Mr Rawlinson did not give evidence at the trial. He was not then, and cannot now, be criticised for that decision. The jury were not, however, confronted with a version of the facts that contradicted the Crown case, but only the detailed and skilful address of his counsel. That jury's verdict carries with it at least one of the following conclusions. Either that the jury must have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died as a result of an act of one or more of the participants in a joint criminal enterprise, when the offenders had an intention to kill or inflict really serious injury upon her and that Mr Rawlinson was a participant in the commission of this crime. Alternatively, that the deceased died as a result of an act or acts of one or more of the participants in a joint criminal enterprise, when those participants had an intention to kill or inflict really serious bodily injury upon her, and where Mr Rawlinson was part of a joint criminal enterprise to cause physical harm to the deceased where he contemplated the possibility that in its execution she would be killed or at least have inflicted upon her really serious bodily injury. The case marshalled against Mr Rawlinson was in my view an overwhelming circumstantial case capable of supporting the jury's verdict on either of these bases. 

131The evidence at the trial included Mr Rawlinson's electronically recorded interview with the police. Mr Rawlinson told the police that the deceased threatened to kill his son as many as 50 times over the course of their relationship, a suggestion that is so improbable that it borders upon the bizarre. Be that as it may, the police asked Mr Rawlinson what he did about that threat. He replied, ""I organised through Wendy for people to come down but they weren't meant to kill her."" The effect of Mr Rawlinson's present stance, and his anterior plea of guilty to manslaughter, must therefore be that he was part of a joint criminal enterprise seriously to injure the deceased but that he did not contemplate even the possibility that she may have been killed in the process. 

132The jury clearly rejected that analysis. In doing so they had available to them the following facts, consistent with their verdict, concerning Mr Rawlinson's involvement in the murder of the deceased that for sentencing purposes I find beyond reasonable doubt. 

133Mr Rawlinson felt a very substantial enmity towards the deceased for at least some months prior to her death. His motive for killing her was to make her pay for what he perceived she had done to him. He had attempted to have grievous bodily harm inflicted upon her in July 2011.

134Mr Rawlinson was part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. He planned with Ms Evans to kill her by setting fire to her bedroom in the early hours of the morning while she lay asleep in her bed. Mr Rawlinson deployed the ill will that Ms Evans already had for the deceased and systematically provided her with false information concerning the deceased in order to increase it. That included the lie that the deceased had threatened to kill Ms Evans' children. It also included false information that Mr Rawlinson could not commit himself to a relationship with Ms Evans until the deceased was out of his life.

135At all times before and after the murder Mr Rawlinson sought to distance himself from the killing. However, he paid for the killing to be carried out. Notwithstanding that, he falsely portrayed himself as the deceased's grief-stricken partner and actively sought to suggest false possibilities about how and why she may have been killed.

136I am satisfied of these facts beyond reasonable doubt. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, for the purposes of sentencing Mr Rawlinson, of the same facts of which I was satisfied in the sentencing proceedings involving Ms Evans.

Subjective circumstances 

137Mr Rawlinson is 42 years of age. He was divorced from the mother of his only child in about 2008. His son, who is 13 years of age, continues to live with her. Mr Rawlinson learned at the age of 14 that he was adopted shortly after his birth. He told Dr Jonathon Adams, a psychiatrist who examined him for the purposes of these proceedings, that he always felt unwanted. Dr Adams' report dated 22 June 2014 was tendered as an exhibit.

138Because Mr Rawlinson did not give evidence at the sentencing proceedings, the only significant material containing details of his subjective circumstances is what appears in the careful history taken by Dr Adams. Unfortunately, I consider that Mr Rawlinson has failed conspicuously to be truthful with Dr Adams and has instead provided him with a series of self-serving lies and half-truths in order to present himself in a good light. Some examples of this are as follows.

139Mr Rawlinson told Dr Adams that on two or three occasions he engaged in sexual intercourse with Ms Evans during the months leading up to the offence. That is patently untrue, as any reasonable reading of the text message summary conspicuously and graphically reveals. Mr Rawlinson told Dr Adams that he did not consider Ms Evans to be his partner during that time, believing that he remained in a relationship with the deceased. The tone and content of the same text message summary makes at least the second of those assertions completely incredible.

140Dr Adams asked Mr Rawlinson about Ms Thompson, referred to as the ""female escort"" in the Crown case statement. Mr Rawlinson told the doctor that, ""he saw this 'escort' on only one occasion, and that he had ongoing text messages with her about employment opportunities, driving jobs."" Those suggestions are totally at odds with the evidence at the trial, given by Ms Thompson, which I have no difficulty accepting as truthful. Mr Rawlinson never challenged Ms Thompson's evidence to suggest that he saw her more than once. One of Mr Rawlinson's text messages to Ms Thompson said, ""Babe, I do trust you, and it is my problem because I like you and care about you.""

141Dr Adams also asked Mr Rawlinson about paragraph 14 on page three of the Crown Case Statement. Although it involves some repetition of material to which I have already referred, it is necessary to set out in full what that paragraph contains, as follows:

""Between 1 October 2011 and 22 October 2011, RAWLINSON sent numerous texts messages to EVANS. On 1 October 2011, RAWLINSON sent EVANS a text message stating 'Yeah so do I but I just keep thinking one more week. Then she is gone and we are away from her'. On 3 October 2011, RAWLINSON sent EVANS a text message stating 'I can't wait to see you tonight. This is hell. She is a cow. She's carrying on like an idiot. God I want her gone'. On 13 October 2011 RAWLINSON sent EVANS a text message stating, 'I want to be with you 'til I die and I hope you understand the various reasons why it needs to happen to her now. I love you.'"" 

142Dr Adams reports that Mr Rawlinson told him this about that paragraph:

""He said that these messages were written by both Ms Foreman and himself, and were always written in her presence. He said that they were written in an effort to get Ms Evans to 'open up' about the potentially incriminating information.""

143I accept that Mr Rawlinson said that to Dr Adams. However, I totally reject it if it is proffered now on behalf of Mr Rawlinson as a true statement.

144Dr Adams also asked Mr Rawlinson about the sum of money placed into what was Ms Case's TAB account. Dr Adams recorded the following as the answer he was given:

""He told me that prior to this he had had a discussion with Ms Foreman and her parents about how to resolve the issue, and that they decided to give Ms Evans a sum of money. Mr Rawlinson told me that he had believed this account to belong to Ms Evans' father.""

145It is a little difficult to know just where to start in order to demonstrate the falsity of this statement. It is perhaps sufficient to note that it is generally at odds with his plea of guilty to manslaughter, but particularly contrary to the evidence of him personally attending the TAB where Ms Case was present and also what he said in his ERISP about it.

146Dr Adams also said that Mr Rawlinson, ""denied any involvement in Ms Foreman's murder"". Dr Adams reported as follows:

""With regards the murder of Ms Foreman, Mr Rawlinson commented, 'never in my wildest dreams did I think what was going to happen would happen, I can't believe it'. He reiterated that he had no knowledge of the plan to murder Ms Foreman. He stated, 'I hate violence, absolutely and completely...I want to help people, I don't like to see people get hurt'.""

147As earlier noted, Mr Rawlinson told the police that he had organised for people to come down but they were not meant to kill the deceased. It leaves a reasonable observer wondering what they were supposed to do if not commit an act of violence of some sort.

148To my observation from the evidence tendered at the trial, Mr Rawlinson was in the constant habit of lying. I have difficulty accepting anything that he told Dr Adams that is not otherwise confirmed. It is not without a tragic irony that the deceased sent a text message to Mr Rawlinson on the evening of 9 October 2011 in these terms:

""You are obviously never going to stop lying so I really think you need some professional help for it. I told you that a long time ago and it's only getting worse.""

149Evidence that I am able to accept can be found in what Mr Rawlinson's parents reported to Dr Adams. It was as follows:

""Mr Rawlinson's adoptive parents corroborated the account that he provided during my assessment. They confirmed that they adopted Mr Rawlinson when he was 3 weeks old, via their involvement with the Salvation Army. They confirmed that he learned of his adoption at the age of 14 years, and discussed it more recently in the context of his worsening mood. Mrs Rawlinson confirmed that Mr Rawlinson had a very close relationship with his maternal grandfather, and was distressed following his death.

Mr and Mrs Rawlinson described their adopted son as generally a 'quiet, well-natured person'. They described his caring manner, and referred to several 'great friends'. They said he had never been aggressive or irritable towards others, and they did not refer to any underlying antisocial tendencies. They described how he had a stable and supportive relationship with his wife and son prior to their relationship difficulties. Mr and Mrs Rawlinson did not provide any history consistent with any symptoms of mental illness prior to 2006.

Mr Rawlinson's adoptive parents confirmed that his emotional state deteriorated significantly in 2006, in the context of working long hours. They described his depressed mood. They said he became 'more quiet' and less sociable. They said that when he resided with them he tended not to sleep, would spend more time in his room, and declined the food that was prepared for him. Mrs Rawlinson recalled Mr Rawlinson's negative thought processes, providing one example of Mr Rawlinson commenting, 'if I die will you bury me next to grandfather'.

Mrs Rawlinson reported that Mr Rawlinson's wife escorted him to the general practitioner in approximately 2008, and confirmed that he saw a few counsellors thereafter.

Mrs Rawlinson referred to the relationship problems between Mr Rawlinson and Ms Foreman. She commented, 'He would often neglect his son to please her'.

Mrs Rawlinson raised her concerns about the impact of the correctional setting upon Mr Rawlinson's mood.""

Mitigating factors 

150Mr Terracini SC made very limited submissions on behalf of Mr Rawlinson at the sentencing hearing. Mr Terracini would appear to have been constrained by limited instructions having regard to Mr Rawlinson's expressly confirmed belief in his innocence. I was not specifically referred to the presence of any mitigating factors that I could take into account in Mr Rawlinson's favour.

151Doing the best I can, I consider that the following factors may potentially be available to Mr Rawlinson:

(1)he does not have any record of previous convictions, 

(2)he was a person of good character, 

(3)he is unlikely to re-offend, 

(4)he has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of his age or otherwise.

152I have no difficulty accepting the first two of these factors. I have no information capable of reliably informing me about the last two factors. Dr Adams certainly does not deal with them. He did say that he ""did not elicit any evidence of pervasive or persistent maladaptive personality traits or behaviours."" Dr Adams noted that, ""Mr Rawlinson's depressive symptomatology was not severe enough to render him incapable of engaging in interpersonal contact or working, but his symptoms might have had a deleterious impact upon his rational thought processes and decision making capacity.""

153In my estimation Mr Rawlinson neither has, nor has he exhibited, any insight into or understanding of the level of his offending. His continued protestation of innocence suggests, if it does not prove, that he is in a complete state of denial. That state would appear from my lay perspective to be wholly irrational. It leaves me with no basis upon which to express a meaningful or worthwhile view about the likelihood that he will re-offend or what his prospects of rehabilitation really are.

154I consider that I am unable to say more than that, on the balance of probabilities, particularly having regard to his lack or previous criminal history and his likely age upon release, that his prospects of re-offending are low. Any attempt by me to quantify his prospects of rehabilitation would amount to speculation. That is because he denies ""any involvement in [the deceased's] murder"" in the face of a most persuasive and powerful case to the contrary. Such a circumstance cannot be the foundation for any optimism at all.

155Mr Rawlinson has also shown no remorse. Even in the beneficial environment of Dr Adams' careful interrogations, Mr Rawlinson appears never to have expressed the slightest breath of regret for what has occurred or the tiniest hint of sympathy or concern for the parents or relatives of the deceased. He did not do so at the sentencing hearing and continues in the face of the facts to reprobate any involvement in the murder. I hasten to add that the lack of remorse is not an aggravating factor, but this is a case where I am not even troubled by a decision about whether or not Mr Rawlinson's expressions of remorse are genuine. There was none and Mr Rawlinson is not entitled to any mitigation of his sentence on this account.

156There is no evidence to support the proposition that Mr Rawlinson was acting under duress in the sense contemplated by s 21A(3)(d) of the Act. The issue of whether or not Mr Rawlinson was manipulated by Ms Evans is best considered in the context of objective seriousness.

Aggravating circumstances 

157The crime was perpetrated in the home of the deceased. It was also the result of what I consider to have been considerable planning. Indeed, in my view it is clear that Mr Rawlinson was the principal and driving force behind the conception and consummation of the offence. It would in the calamitous circumstances of this case be incorrect to describe him as a mastermind.

Objective seriousness 

158Mr Rawlinson's crime is a very serious case of murder. It lies well above the mid-range of seriousness for cases of its type. It is not in the worst category, and does not warrant the imposition of a life sentence. It is however a crime of terrible and extreme violence, perpetrated in the detailed circumstances to which I have already referred. It was described during final addresses to the jury by Mr Rawlinson's counsel as a ""cowardly, cruel, horrible murder, about which there could be no question."" I adopt that description.

159The calculating and calculated nature of this murder marks it out as one of particular callousness and brutality. On no account was there any comprehensible explanation for it and, as I have said, I personally remain at a complete loss to understand why it ever occurred. Whatever so-called issues Mr Rawlinson had, or thought that he had, with the deceased, they were insignificant in the scheme of the ordinary understanding of rational human affairs. These issues were hardly the stuff of revenge or retribution or unexpected impulse or miscalculation as so often comes to light in this Court. The murder of the deceased was on the contrary inspired by a cold indifference to the deceased's right to live her life in her own way and on her own terms. I am entirely unable to understand what twisted perceptions motivated Mr Rawlinson to assemble a group of immoral assistants to carry out his awful plan, or under what standard of acceptable human behaviour he thought it was acceptable.

160I am led to understand that Mr Rawlinson continues to maintain that he finds himself where he is today as the result of the malevolent influence over him exerted by Ms Evans and her manipulation of his will to resist. He contends, in effect, that she threatened him and that any involvement on his part was a direct function of her threats and manipulation. Such a submission requires a very selective dissection of the facts, not to say a complete suspension of belief, if it is to be even remotely plausible. Support for that proposition is everywhere. Some examples will suffice.

161Mr Rawlinson originally told the police in his ERISP that he did not want anything to happen to the deceased. That exculpatory position later erodes to a concession that he just wanted her to be scared. He agreed with the police that he knew, ""something was going to happen that night"". He maintained that the fire was Ms Evans' idea, because of ""grievances"" that she had with the deceased. There is therefore at the most fundamental level a concession by Mr Rawlinson, quite apart from Ms Evans' views on the matter, that he wanted something to happen to the deceased that would scare her. There is no suggestion that his instruction in that regard was the result of pressure from Ms Evans.

162Mr Rawlinson also told the police that the death of the deceased was connected to Ms Evans' threats to him. Indeed, he was given an open opportunity to explain his position, when asked by the police whether the threats from Ms Evans to him had anything to do with the death of the deceased. His answer was as follows:

""Well, only from the viewpoint that she was using me to give her money and that she said that if I went back to Katie and told her what had happened and, you know, that there was nothing in it any more and all back to, that, yeah. She was going to do something.""

163Even making allowances for the situation in which Mr Rawlinson found himself at the time, that explanation does not support a contention that Ms Evans was manipulating him.

164The text message schedule is one of two overwhelming collections of evidence disproving the submission that Ms Evans was the dominant party. Mr Rawlinson's texts are full of lies and fantasy. They are the exclusive source of references to the deceased being ""gone"". They are the predominant source of scurrilous and disparaging references to the deceased. They are the only texts that contain any suggestion of threats to children or family from the deceased. They are most tellingly entirely free of anything remotely approaching a threat from Ms Evans to Mr Rawlinson. Ms Evans' texts are, as I have already indicated, very often conciliatory and cautious. There is an enigmatic tone of concern and decency in much of what she writes. Mr Rawlinson's texts are also crammed with protestations of love and adoration for Ms Evans, hardly suggestive of a man being manipulated by the object of his praise: ""I am in love with you""; ""I do really want to spend my life with you, which is why she must go. To grow old with you always"". These are not things that upon any view of reality one would expect Mr Rawlinson to say to Ms Evans if she had recently threatened to kill him and his family. Ms Evans' responses are correspondingly coy and flattering. The texts paint a superficial picture of reciprocated affection, but for the fact, unknown to Ms Evans, that Mr Rawlinson was deceptively attempting simultaneously to maintain his relationship with the deceased.

165The second body of evidence that puts the lie to Mr Rawlinson's submission is their post mortem conduct. There are several intercepted phone conversations between them after the death of the deceased. They plan to go away together. They appear to go shopping. They jointly plan their responses to the police investigation.

166Mr Rawlinson's moral culpability is not in any way diminished or reduced as the result of any undue, improper, overpowering or burdensome influence being exerted over him by Ms Evans. She was enthusiastic in her support for him, but that enthusiasm was the result of his encouragement of her and not the reverse. Ms Evans did not have the upper hand. She did not manipulate him.

Intention

167Mr Rawlinson was not present at the fire. He left or delegated the commission of the physical acts that caused the death of the deceased to others. There is no evidence to support a finding that he knew the precise details of what Ms Evans and Mr Spicer were proposing to do when they entered the deceased's house. Those circumstances cannot therefore inform a conclusion about Mr Rawlinson's intention. However, other material can.

168I have already referred to some of the text messages sent by him to Ms Evans. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that expressions or phrases such as, ""just keep thinking one more week [t]hen she is gone and we are away from her"", ""God I want her gone"", ""I want her gone so I'm not having to be away from you"", and, ""I want her gone beautiful because I want to spend my life with you"" are all references by Mr Rawlinson to his desire for the deceased to be killed. They are to be contrasted with Ms Evans' advice to Mr Rawlinson on 7 September 2011, in the early days of their intimate relationship but before he had pummelled her with inflammatory lies about the deceased, that he should ""just walk out"" and that ""it's not worth it."" I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the content and timing of these words, written by Mr Rawlinson, prove that he formed an intention to kill the deceased, which was effected by his recruitment of Ms Evans and Mr Spicer, to whom he paid $3,000, to enter the house of the deceased while she slept and set it on fire. They are unambiguous in the context and particular circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased. 

169Once again, as in the case against Ms Evans, I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Rawlinson formed that intention by his total failure, when speaking to Ms Evans or communicating with her after the death of the deceased, to speak of his surprise or dismay or revulsion or shock at the fact that what happened on 27 October 2011 actually caused the death of the deceased, as opposed to something less. If the intention were not to kill the deceased, but only to scare her, I am satisfied that fact would have figured prominently and emphatically in what Mr Rawlinson and Ms Evans said to each other even before they were arrested or realised that their conversations were being intercepted. Quite to the contrary, the conversations between Mr Rawlinson and Ms Evans give not the slightest hint that Ms Foreman's death was anything other than entirely expected. Their lives proceeded together as normal. Mr Rawlinson's later protestations to the police, that the plan was only to harm the deceased, but not to kill her, were patently self-serving, disingenuous and totally unbelievable.

Special circumstances

170Dr Adams has diagnosed Mr Rawlinson with a depressive illness. It does not appear to have interfered with his ability to function in the community. Mr Rawlinson will necessarily spend a considerable time on parole. He has not demonstrated the existence of special circumstances warranting an adjustment of the statutory ratio of parole to non-parole periods. No submissions to the contrary were made on his behalf.

Deterrence

171The gratuitous nature of this crime calls for unambiguous condemnation. Mr Rawlinson's sentence should take account of the need for general deterrence.

MS PROUD

Factual findings 

172The Crown submitted that I would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following facts concerning Ms Proud's involvement in the murder of the deceased.

173Ms Proud was approached by Ms Evans to engage her then partner Mr Spicer in the criminal enterprise. She was the link or connection between Ms Evans and Mr Spicer in the payment of money and in encouraging Mr Spicer to participate in the commission of the offence. She was a willing and enthusiastic contributor in the plan to cause very substantial harm to the deceased. Ms Proud later showed no remorse concerning what had occurred and spoke in terms to Ms Gallagher suggesting that the deceased was a nasty and violent person who deserved to be killed. 

174Ms Proud has at all times sought to distance herself from any involvement in the crime. However, she was part of an agreement to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased. Her culpability can in this respect be distinguished from Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson who were each part of a joint criminal enterprise to kill the deceased. 

175With some qualifications about the finding of no remorse, which are referred to later, I am satisfied of these facts beyond reasonable doubt. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, for the purposes of sentencing Ms Proud, of the same facts of which I was satisfied in the sentencing proceedings involving Ms Evans.

Subjective circumstances 

176Ms Proud was seen by Dr Olav Nielssen, whose report dated 17 June 2014 was tendered in evidence at the sentencing hearing. She gave a history to him, to which some reference is made in what follows.

177Ms Proud is 29 years of age. At the time when the offence was committed she had been in a relationship with Mr Spicer for a number of years. They have three children together, who are now aged eight, seven and nearly four years of age respectively. Mr Spicer's daughter from a previous relationship also lived with them. Those children have since been taken into the care of the Minister for Family and Community Services. Direct contact with her children is limited to four times a year, although contact through correspondence may also occur.

178Ms Proud's relationship with Mr Spicer was troubled and fraught with domestic violence. She gave evidence of this during the trial. She confirmed it in consultation with Dr Nielssen. Ms Proud said that Mr Spicer was abusive towards the children and her, and that they lived in fear of him. Ms Proud met Mr Spicer in 2005 when she was recovering from the death of her mother. Ms Proud had attempted suicide and was feeling alone. Ms Proud took out an apprehended violence order against Mr Spicer at one time when he threatened to take the children and have her hurt. They reconciled before the birth of their third child.

179Ms Proud met Ms Evans in 2008 while visiting Mr Spicer in prison, when Mr Field was also incarcerated. They became occasional friends. Some time before the death of the deceased, Ms Evans rang Ms Proud and told her that she wanted someone ""hurt and scared"". Ms Proud said that she did not want to be involved. She could not remember if she passed on the message to Mr Spicer or if Ms Evans contacted him separately.

180Ms Proud confirmed to Dr Nielssen that she had contacted Ms Evans after the offence to ask for the money that Ms Evans had promised to pay Mr Spicer. She was then in straitened circumstances, Mr Spicer was addicted to drugs and alcohol, and he took money from her to support his habits. 

181At the time of the offence, Ms Proud was taking antidepressants and seeing a counsellor because of the violence in her relationship. Ms Proud had an unhappy childhood and had been subjected to familial sexual interference. She had performed acts of self-harm as a teenager. She attempted suicide in 2000 while still at school. She was admitted to St John of God Hospital in 2004 following another attempt on her own life. She was admitted to Blacktown Hospital following yet another attempt after an episode of physical abuse by Mr Spicer.

182Ms Proud currently has difficulty sleeping and cries frequently. She reported constant worry and ruminations about her situation and the welfare of her children. She told Dr Nielssen that she found it very hard to live with what she and Mr Spicer had done.

183Ms Proud never smoked and rarely drank, and never used illicit drugs. She finished Year 12 at High School but had generally struggled as a student. She was bullied and picked on but never repeated a year. She was literate.

184Medical records to which Dr Nielssen was given access suggested that Ms Proud had a borderline personality disorder. A Uniting Care case summary noted 31 visits because of domestic violence and mental illness. Dr Nielssen diagnosed Ms Proud with a major depressive illness and dysthymic disorder. He opined that these conditions and her low self esteem probably contributed to her entering and remaining in an abusive relationship.

185Dr Nielssen helpfully indicated that Ms Proud had reasonably good prospects of eventual rehabilitation: she has no substance abuse problem or any pattern of criminal conduct, and could be expected to return to paid employment. She expressed remorse for her role in the offence and the consequences of her behaviour in a way that Dr Nielssen considered was independent of the pathological guilt associated with severe depression.

Mitigating factors 

186Ms Proud does not have any significant record of previous convictions. She is, apart from the current offence, a person of good character. She is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. 

187Ms Proud has also shown remorse. She was alone among her co-accused in either giving evidence at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings. In the latter case, Ms Proud expressed regret at what had happened. 

188The Crown contended that the listening device material and intercepted phone calls demonstrated that Ms Proud was not truly remorseful at all. There is considerable support for the making of such a submission. Ms Proud refers to the deceased in particularly pejorative terms, ascribing to her all manner of negative characteristics, including the commission of violent acts and threats to do so. 

189The most significant example of this is to be found in the transcript of a secretly recorded conversation between Ms Proud and her friend Danielle Gallagher on 15 December 2011. Some of what was said is as follows:

""PROUD: 'Cause she's a very nasty girl and she used to bash, the bloke Wendy is with now was her ex-husband.

GALLAGHER: Mmm.

PROUD: And 'cause she was fucking every copper, she knew every copper and that and she was fucking them, she was getting away sending people. She put her ex-husband in hospital with concussion by hitting him with pots across the head and that, and they had enough and she got people out on Wendy and her kids.

...

PROUD: And Katie was doing all this shit. Katie was a nasty woman when I met her too. The stuff with Wendy's ex Scott who is in gaol now, what she was planning on doing to Scott, for what Scott did to Wendy, she was going to have fuckin' Scott done in gaol.

GALLAGHER: Oh.

PROUD: She was going to have Scott killed in gaol, this Katie girl. But no one believed Wendy's story, because Katie was well in with the judges and she was fucking every copper in Wollongong and all this and that so Wendy went and asked if we knew anyone that could do the job and like she'd pay them.""

190None of the things asserted by Ms Proud about the deceased was true. More importantly, none of those things was the product of Ms Proud's own observation or experience concerning the deceased, who she hardly knew, but were manifestly things that she had been told. They are matters that she repeated in my opinion as some kind of justification for what occurred. To that extent they are literally inconsistent with remorse. However, she was not likely at that time to express remorse for at least two obvious reasons. The first is that she had not been charged with any crime or implicated in what happened to the deceased. The entire conversation with Ms Gallagher proceeds upon the basis that Mr Spicer was involved but that she had nothing to do with it. That is plain from the concern she expresses about the prospect that Mr Spicer may be in trouble, whereas there is no such concern expressed about her personal position. It is easy to understand, even if morally difficult to accept, that Ms Proud would not express remorse for the death of the deceased when her death had, as far as Ms Proud was concerned, nothing to do with her. The fact that she did not express remorse, or even the fact that she spoke ill of her, which in the circumstances may appear to be the same thing, is explicable when she clearly held no fears for her own position and patently did not appreciate that she was in any way potentially implicated in the death of the deceased. 

191The second reason is that Ms Proud appears genuinely to hold the view that the deceased was only supposed to be scared but not killed. The conversation with Ms Gallagher refers to this as follows:

""PROUD: Well, the night we went down there they went and got the fuel and they weren't supposed to kill her, but they ended up killing her when they lit the house on fire.

GALLAGHER: Who lit the house on fire?

PROUD: BJ and Wendy, it was only supposed to be a warning thing for her to back off.

GALLAGHER: Mmm.

PROUD: And they actually ended up killing her...

GALLAGHER: Mmm.

...

GALLAGHER: Is this when you went away? Is he upset?

PROUD: He was sick when he found out on the news that she was killed. It was in the news the next day. It wasn't supposed to kill her, it was just supposed to warn her to back off.

...

GALLAGHER: It's crazy...

PROUD: And it wasn't supposed to kill her, it was only supposed to warn her to back off. See, all BJ was supposed to do, like I said to BJ all you do is, is you go in there, you mess her up a bit, I said damage her face, because she thought she's this crash hot so, like she could fuck anyone she wanted...

GALLAGHER: Yeah.

PROUD: ... and that... said, 'just damage her face and whatnot.

GALLAGHER: Yeah.

PROUD: Just bash her a bit and that, put her in hospital to the point her face can't be fixed and no one will want her after that, because coppers never believed Wendy, that Katie was doing all this shit. I've met Katie before.

...

PROUD: ...It wasn't meant to be murder...it wasn't meant to be a murder, it was only supposed to scare her. It just went straight up in flames as soon as he walked down.""

192In my opinion, these matters do not tell against Ms Proud's expressions of remorse, which may be taken to mean deep and painful regret for wrongdoing. Ms Proud was neither a wrongdoer in her own eyes at the time she spoke to Ms Gallagher, nor did she anticipate she would be found to be one. Moreover, her flawed but understandable reasoning at that time was that the death of the deceased was actually a mistake. As morally and legally offensive as that logic may be, it contextualises Ms Proud's reaction to the death of the deceased at the time. It does not derogate from the sincerity of later expressions of remorse when she had cause to have sincere regret for what she had done.

Aggravating circumstances 

193The crime was perpetrated in the home of the deceased. It was also the result of considerable planning.

Objective seriousness

194The legal and factual foundations for Ms Proud's liability for the murder of the deceased are different to those of both Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson. Ms Proud was not present at the scene of the crime. She was not involved in assisting the commission of the murder by direct or active participation in events that caused the death of the deceased. She was uninvolved in planning the murder or in carrying it out. Ms Proud barely knew the deceased and clearly had no basis upon which to feel any animus towards her beyond the lies she was told and the misinformation with which she was cynically provided. Ms Proud became liable for the murder of the deceased because of the violent domestic and impoverished financial situation in which she found herself as the result of her unfortunate association with Mr Spicer. 

195I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Proud was a party to a joint criminal enterprise to cause serious harm to the deceased. However, with one relevant exception, her role in that enterprise was entirely passive. The exception is, simply as a matter of happenstance and disastrously for her, that she introduced Ms Evans to Mr Spicer. No other act committed or performed by Ms Proud in any way advanced or facilitated the commission of the crime. Her enthusiastic demands for payment of the money owed to Mr Spicer by Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson after the event were not acts performed in the course of committing the crime, even if they inculpated her as a participant in the enterprise.

196To that extent the particular crime of murder for which Ms Proud stands to be sentenced is in my opinion clearly below the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of this description. One might well have expected the jury to return a different verdict in her case, or not to be surprised if it had done so. In contrast to the crimes of murder for which Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson have been found guilty, which I have indicated are objectively very serious examples of murder, Ms Proud's crime is not. I hasten to add that such a conclusion ought not to be mistaken for the expression of an opinion about the seriousness of the crime of murder generally, for which the community and the legislature have unambiguously and consistently reinforced their unanimous disapprobation. It is rather no more than my recognition of the need expressly or impliedly, but in either case clearly, to indicate where in the comparative range of offences of this nature Ms Proud's crime should be placed.

Special circumstances

197I am satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying an alteration of the statutory ratio in Ms Proud's case. Her psychiatric condition is one of longstanding and her adjustment and reintegration into the community upon release is likely to require close monitoring and professional assistance. Her likely economic situation and limited resourcefulness suggest to me that Ms Proud will remain vulnerable for some time.

Deterrence

198Ms Proud's involvement in the events that have led to her conviction for murder are somewhat tragically more the product of ignorance and naivety than malevolence or some other criminal state of mind. Ms Proud did not so much set out to commit a crime as become drawn into circumstances, which she had neither the wit nor the resources to avoid. She was as well the victim of predatory behaviour by Ms Evans and Mr Spicer, and also Mr Rawlinson, whose criminal schemes unnecessarily ensnared her. There seems to me to be an ever-present tension between the need for general deterrence and Ms Proud's crime, borne so much as it is of stupidity and ignorance. I do not therefore propose to make a significant allowance for general deterrence in the sentence I intend to impose upon Ms Proud in this case.

199Nor am I satisfied that Ms Proud requires any reminder from me about the predicament in which she has now found herself. The sentence I propose in her case will in my estimation operate as a salutary and adequate reminder to her of the perils of re-offending.

VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS

200Victim impact statements from the deceased's mother and father were read aloud by each of them to the Court. They spoke in measured terms of their own personal reactions to the death, including the continuing consequences for them and the rest of the family. All of these people would appear to be labouring with the burden of grief in various and personal ways. The death of the deceased is undoubtedly a terrible and unending fact of life for all of them. Nothing that I have said in the course of delivering these remarks should be taken as in any way derogating from or diminishing the importance of the life of the deceased in the eyes of her family and the friends who will always remember her. I am, however, mindful of the principles referred to in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 and Bollen v R (1998) 99 A Crim R 510, and I must conform to them.

POLICE INVESTIGATION

201Before passing sentence upon these prisoners, I want to make some comments about the work of the police investigators whose unfortunate task it became to try to discover who may have killed the deceased. The evidence that was gathered for presentation to the jury in this case was nothing short of remarkable. The electronic surveillance and the recovery of vast amounts of phone and SMS records were critical to the just prosecution of these offences. Interviews were also conducted with many scores of witnesses from the community, as well as with many other technical experts, and a very comprehensive brief of evidence could be assembled as a result. The deceased died on 27 October 2011. Arrests were made 55 days later. The criminal justice system is often inaccurately criticised as slow or unwieldy or even broken. These criticisms inevitably emanate from a limited understanding of how that system operates. The efforts of the policemen and policewomen in this case cannot be faulted and deserve public recognition.

SENTENCES

202Ms Evans, Mr Rawlinson and Ms Proud were all arrested on 21 December 2011. They have remained in custody referrable to these offences since then.

203I have given close consideration to questions of parity between Ms Evans and Mr Rawlinson. For the reasons that I have already given, it is my view that Ms Evans is, by reason of Mr Rawlinson's manipulation of her, slightly less morally culpable than him. The sentence that I intend to impose upon Ms Evans will therefore have a starting point that is just over ten percent less than that for Mr Rawlinson before the application of a discount for her early plea of guilty.

204Wendy Anne Evans, for the murder of Katherine Foreman you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 24 years commencing on 21 December 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2035, with a non-parole period of 18 years expiring on 20 December 2029, which is the first day upon which you will become eligible for parole. 

205Bradley Max Rawlinson, for the murder of Katherine Foreman you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 36 years commencing on 21 December 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2047, with a non-parole period of 27 years expiring on 20 December 2038, which is the first day upon which you will become eligible for parole. 

206Michelle Sharon Proud, for the murder of Katherine Foreman you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 20 years commencing on 21 December 2011 and expiring on 20 December 2031, with a non-parole period of 14 years expiring on 20 December 2025, which is the first day upon which you will become eligible for parole.

2704727,R v Clissold [2014] NSWDC 271,"Judgment

HIS HONOUR: Mr Clissold, you have not been sentenced before, apart from being fined. Ms McGowan or Mr Healy might have explained to you, I give reasons for my sentence. So I am going to talk for about half an hour about the case and then I will announce my sentence at the end. Some judges announce it straightaway. I do not do that because I want you to listen to what I am saying, as well as the other people in court and I will announce the sentence at the end. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: So that is what is going on. Judges always have to give reasons for sentences they impose, particularly if it is relatively serious.


	
	Raymond Clissold is a man who is almost thirty and has a negligible criminal record. But over a period of a month or so in late 2012, he got himself involved in a theft as well as receiving and disposing of stolen property to a serious extent. He was charged with various offences and has pleaded guilty and it is my job this morning to sentence him for the offences that he has pleaded guilty to.
	
	
	The first thing I should do is refer to the charges themselves. I am sentencing Mr Clissold for a larceny. That is a crime under s 117 of the Crimes Act 1900. Parliament has fixed a maximum of five years imprisonment to that offence. When I am sentencing him for that larceny offence, Mr Clissold has asked me to take into account three offences that he has pleaded guilty to, but which will not be recorded as convictions. I will take those into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and I sign the form to that effect. The three charges are disposing of some caravan towing mirrors and an LED lamp and possessing ammunition.
	
	
	In addition, I am sentencing Mr Clissold for six offences of disposing of stolen property. They are all offences under s 188(1) of the Crimes Act. They are more serious than the larceny offence. Parliament has fixed a maximum of ten years imprisonment, to each of those offences. Each item that was disposed of was a firearm, either a rifle or a shotgun.
	
	
	I am also sentencing Mr Clissold for receiving stolen property in the form of a gun safe and eight firearms and a GPS system. That is an offence again under s 188(1) of the Crimes Act carrying a maximum of ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	Finally I am sentencing Mr Clissold for yet another offence of receiving stolen property. That property was a backpack and a mobile phone handset, motorbike helmets, jackets and gloves. Again, it carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment under s 188 of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	As I said, Mr Clissold pleaded guilty to all of the offences. He did that on 18 October 2013. I therefore formally convict Raymond David Clissold of all of the offences which I have referred to.
	
	
	It is important for a judge to set out a little detail about what happened to bring about the charges, so that the offender and others wanting to know about the offences can have a sense of how serious they are. It is also appropriate for a judge to make reference to personal factors which relate to an offender.
	
	
	First I will say something briefly about the crimes themselves. I take the information from a document which is part of exhibit A, which is called agreed facts. Tony and Elaine North owned a caravan which they kept at Riverside Gardens Over Fifty-Fives Village, in North Richmond. It was stolen sometime between 27 November and 29 November 2012. They had bought it four years before for nearly forty-thousand dollars and it was insured for just over thirty-five thousand dollars. That theft is the larceny which Mr Clissold has pleaded guilty to.
	
	
	In the early hours of 17 December 2012, two properties were broken into in Lugarno, both of them in Moons Avenue. From the property of Mr Matthew Mood, there was stolen a GPS, a gun safe and eight firearms which were in the gun safe. In the same street, a garage was broken into and the garage itself and a car in the garage were ransacked. From the garage was stolen a backpack, a mobile handset, some helmets, motorcycle jackets and gloves.
	
	
	At the time, Raymond Clissold lived in North Parade Mount Druitt. Police turned up there with a search warrant on 19 December 2012, a couple of days after the thefts from Moons Avenue. They found the caravan there but did not realise at the time that it was the stolen caravan. Mr Clissold was there with another man named Robert Manning. He also lived at the address. Both men used to go into the caravan, according to the agreed facts. Police found various items at the place, including the Gladiator gun safe which had been broken open. They found the backpack and mobile phones and some GPSs, as well as the motorbike associated items. No firearms were found. Police did find a mobile phone which suggested that “the offender and Manning were seeking buyers for the firearms”.
	
	
	Police searched again a couple of weeks later. They discovered that Mr Clissold had pawned the LED lamp and caravan mirrors at pawn shops about a month beforehand. In early January 2013, police found six of the eight firearms which had been stolen from one of the Lugarno houses, along with some ammunition. They found it at the house occupied by a man named Joshua King. Joshua King is the person with whom Mr Clissold and Mr Manning were communicating about selling firearms.
	
	
	Mr Clissold was not arrested until some months later. It was 5 June 2013. He made limited admissions but they included that he had pawned the towing mirrors and the LED lamp at the end of November 2012. He denied knowing Joshua King. He denied being involved in the other offences. He told police that he owned certain of the items which were found.
	
	
	I should add here that Joshua King pleaded guilty to certain offences and was sentenced by his Honour Judge M Williams SC on 19 December 2013. I will return to that sentence.
	
	
	Robert Manning has pleaded not guilty to certain offences and will be tried here at the Parramatta District Court in September.
	
	
	Mr Clissold’s record, as I said, is negligible. There is one item in respect of which the charge was dismissed under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I do not take that into account and for negligent driving and custody of a knife in a public place, over ten years ago, he received fines.
	
	
	I should say something about Joshua King’s sentence, because some submissions were made on the question of parity. Joshua King had pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and was given a twenty-five per cent discount on his sentence by his Honour. Of significance is that Joshua King had pleaded guilty to only six charges. Each of them was of possessing a firearm without a licence. That is an offence against s 7A(1) of the Firearms Act and each offence carries a maximum of five years. Mr King is about five years younger than Mr Clissold. However he had accumulated a worse criminal record, which included an offence of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm for which he received an Intensive Correction Order. He was called up for a breach of that. At the time that Joshua King committed the offences he was on conditional liberty. In addition, his Honour Judge Williams took into account a greater number of offences under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, than on Mr Clissold’s corresponding form. I have to be careful about the question of parity, because in fact the offences that Mr King was sentenced for are not the same. They are less serious offences than almost all of the offences that Mr Clissold is charged with. All of Mr Clissold’s crimes carry a maximum of ten years, except the larceny offence.
	
	
	I turn now to matters which are personal to Mr Clissold himself. As I said, he is twenty-nine and has a negligible criminal record, which does not count at all against him. There is a helpful pre-sentence report, prepared by Community Corrections. It gives some information about his background and circumstances. He was reared by his grandparents, due to his mother’s drug abuse and associated periods in custody. He came to know his own father only when he was twenty, but now has a supportive relationship with him and his father is present in court and supporting him, as are his grandmother and his partner. His grandmother described him in positive terms and suggested that the “offences were uncharacteristic of him”. Sometimes judges are weary of such an assessment but in this case, that remark is borne out by his criminal record which contains next to nothing.
	
	
	Mr Clissold has four children himself. They are aged two to ten and he has been in a relationship with the mother of his children “intermittently for the last eleven years”. Evidently Mr Clissold has a drug problem, because he told the officer who interviewed him that “his drug use” was the cause of instability in his relationship. He completed Year 10 and almost completed an apprenticeship as a panel beater. He has been generally in good employment, over the years, although inconsistent. Apparently he will have employment available to him when he is released. He admitted to the officer “problematic cannabis use” which he commenced at about 18 and a year or so before he went into custody, “he was abusing methylamphetamine, also known as ‘Ice’, which he also used on a daily basis.” He said significantly that “he has never engaged in intervention to address his substance abuse issues.”
	
	
	The reporting officer thought that Mr Clissold’s acknowledgement of his offences “demonstrated some level of responsibility for his offending behaviour.” He said that he “intends to cut all ties with his antisocial peer group when he returns to the community.” The officer thought that he was “willing and motivated to address a longstanding history of drug abuse” with the support of his family. He is suitable for and would benefit from a period of supervision.
	
	
	There is some contrition for his offences. That is exhibited by his plea of guilty. However, he was not called to give evidence and cross-examined so there was limited weight that I can put on it, but it is borne out by the fact that he has pleaded guilty. I also have to bear in mind that there were six months between January and June 2013 whilst the investigation was still going on. I also have to bear in mind that there is in his custody record - issued by the Corrective Services Department - of his movements since he has been in custody, an entry for a misdemeanour which involved failing a prescribed urine test in December last year. Mr Clissold frankly acknowledged to his counsel that it involved amphetamines. There is one only such item and Mr Clissold has been in custody for over a year.
	
	
	Mr Clissold has very good family support and his pre-sentence report is encouraging and hopeful. I would regard his prospects of rehabilitation as fairly good. But for the incidents involving the urine, I would have regarded them as good but I hope that that was a one-off incident.
	
	
	Mr Healy of counsel appeared for Mr Clissold in the sentence proceedings yesterday and Mr Kiru appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Healy acknowledged his family support and prospects of rehabilitation. I have already referred to those aspects. I agree with Mr Healy that his client needs direction and assistance when he is released from custody.
	
	
	Mr Kiru fairly acknowledged that there may be special circumstances for adjusting the normal relationship between the full sentence and the non-parole period. Normally a prisoner must serve 75% of their sentence in fulltime custody but in special circumstances the judge can reduce that percentage. I think there are special circumstances for making that reduction in this case. They are that he has never had any intervention so far as his drug abuse is concerned; there is a positive pre-sentence report; he has good family support and, hopefully, employment.
	
	
	Mr Kiru warned me about placing too much weight on the sentence which was given to Joshua King. I agree with Mr Kiru in that regard. I think that the principle of parity has limited application in this case. Mr Kiru proposed that there should be some partial accumulation in the sentences. Although Mr Healy argued that the culpability of the criminal behaviour, so far as Mr King and Mr Clissold were concerned as that behaviour related to the six weapons, is similar, I do not accept that submission because Parliament regards the crimes differently. Mr King pleaded guilty to possessing firearms without a licence. What Mr Clissold has pleaded guilty to is distributing, by way of supplying, firearms to another member of the community. Parliament regards that behaviour as very serious as is reflected in the ten-year maximum sentence which it has attached to that crime.
	
	
	The sentence which I will impose will date from 5 June 2013 which is when Mr Clissold was arrested and went into custody.
	
	
	In addition, Mr Kiru has acknowledged that the plea of guilty which Mr Clissold entered was at the earliest available opportunity so the sentence which I will impose will be discounted by 25% because of that fact.
	
	
	What I also propose to do is to aggregate the sentences which I would impose. I am able to do that under s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I am sentencing Mr Clissold for nine offences and what I am allowed to do is to impose one aggregate sentence in respect to all of them, and I propose to do that but I must also indicate what the individual sentences would have been for each of the crimes. I will now proceed to do that.
	
	
	I regard an appropriate sentence for the larceny offence as being one of two years’ imprisonment. It was an item of some significant value. Because Mr Clissold pleaded guilty, I would discount that sentence to 18 months imprisonment.
	
	
	In respect of the six offences of disposing stolen property, being the firearms, I regard an appropriate sentence as being one of four years imprisonment. I take those offences seriously. It involved distributing lethal firearms within the community. Again, because Mr Clissold pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity I discount that sentence to three years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	In respect of each of the offences of receiving stolen property, the first being the gun safe and the firearms and the GPS system, the second being the backpack and other items, I would regard appropriate sentences for each of those as one year and ten months. That is, 22 months for each of them. I would regard it as appropriate for the six offences of disposing of stolen property being the firearms, for those sentences to be concurrent. They were disposed of, so far as I know, all at the same time on one criminal occasion. So for each of them the sentence would have been three years and they would all run together.
	
	
	I would also order that the sentences for the last two offences of 22 months each - one year and ten months - be concurrent. But I would regard it as appropriate to accumulate by two months the three years concurrent on top of the 18 months which I would have imposed for the larceny, and the 22 months pair of sentences on top of the three years. In other words, I would regard an appropriate overall sentence as being one of three years and four months and that takes into account the discount of 25% which I have already factored in.
	
	
	As I said, for a sentence of three years and four months - which is 40 months - the non-parole period would be expected to be 30 months, two years and six months. However, because of the special circumstances which have been referred to, and I accept, I propose to discount that with some significance. I am going to fix it at 50% so that the amount of time that Mr Clissold will have to serve in custody will be one year and eight months before he is eligible for parole. That is a relatively generous adjustment. The reason I am doing so is because of his relatively young age; it is his first time in custody and also he has never undertaken some assistance for his drug problem. He has also very good family support.
	
	
	I am going to sentence you now Mr Clissold, if you would stand up. I fix a non-parole period of one year and eight months to commence on 5 June 2013 and to expire on 4 February 2015. The balance of the term is one year and eight months commencing on 5 February 2015 and expiring on 4 October 2016.
	


HIS HONOUR: Have a seat for a moment and I’ll make sure I’ve got the mathematics right and then I’ll make sure you understand when it starts, when you’ll get your parole and when it ends. But let’s just make sure my sums are right. So one year and eight months non-parole period 05/06/13 to 04/02/15; balance of the term one year eight months 05/02/15 to 04/10/16. Take your time.

WILSON: Your Honour, my friend has just raised in relation to the receive stolen property offences, your Honour did not--

HIS HONOUR: Which ones?

MCGOWAN: 8 and 9.

WILSON: That would be 8 and 9 on the current sentence summary. Your Honour did not expressly indicate a discount, so your Honour did not apply a discount.

HIS HONOUR: You’re right, no thank you. She is quite right, thank you. I can see what I've done. The sentences that I would have imposed for the receiving stolen property being the gun safe firearms and GPS, and for the backpack would have been two and a half years each, that is 30 months. I discount those by 25% so that they are rounded off 22 months each.

MCGOWAN: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: It’s right in front of me but I forgot to read that. So just go back to your sums.

WILSON: Your Honour, just indicating my friend and I agree with your calculation.

HIS HONOUR: All right, that’s reassuring. Thank you. And I've just noticed that I should, under s 44(2)(a) of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act, deal with aggregate sentence.


	
	I fix the term of the sentence as three years and four months commencing 5 June 2013, expiring 4 October 2016 and I set one non-parole period for all of the offences to which the sentence relates, being one year and eight months commencing 5 June 2013, expiring 4 February 2015.
	


HIS HONOUR: That makes sense? Yes, getting nods. Okay.


	
	Mr Clissold, your sentence is more than Mr Healy asked for. He thought maybe you should be released around about now - one year and two months -but I have given you more than that because of the reason that I gave: that your offending behaviour was worse than Jason King’s and you have got more offences and the sentences - the maximums - are higher. And you have been engaged in some dangerous activity with disposing of firearms, stolen firearms, that is why I have given you the sentences that I have for the reasons that I have explained.
	
	
	The non-parole period that you get for 40 months is normally 30 months, so you would be in gaol for two and a half years. But instead I brought that down to one year and eight months, 20 months. You will be eligible for parole on 4 February 2015, that is the important date, 4 February 2015. I do not order your parole, the Parole Authority does that. You will need to apply for parole and they normally grant it if everything is going well like so far with that one incident being the exception.
	
	
	After you are released on parole you have got another one year and eight months of your sentence to serve but you are in the community serving it. The Parole Authority will fix conditions for your parole and they will no doubt include supervision by the Probation and Parole people, assistance with your drug habit from beforehand and support with getting on with your life and things like.
	


Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: So the important date is 4 February 2015, next year when you are eligible for parole. Look, what you do now is up to you. I can see you've got your family there, you’re well supported and I've taken that into account. You’re a young man, you’re not 30 yet, I've said that. You’ve got a negligible criminal record and quite often I get in front of me people with pages of them. Mr King had a couple of pages in his record. You’re pretty much a cleanskin but you’ve now embarked on a series of serious offending behaviour, that’s why you’re in gaol because it’s serious stuff.

What you do when you get out is up to you and my advice is that you take advantage of what they offer you, get yourself off the drugs, get back to your family and allow yourself to be supported by your own family and by the Corrective Services people in the community. Do you understand that?

OFFENDER: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: All right. It’s over to you now, good luck. Ms McGowan, do you want a word with your client before he’s taken down? I’m happy to leave him in the dock for the time being.

MCGOWAN: I’ll see him downstairs. Thank you, your Honour.

DISCUSSION AS TO OFFENDER’S FAMILY BEING ALLOWED TO SEE HIM AT THE DOCK

MCGOWAN: Your Honour, my friend’s just got something to say.

WILSON: Your Honour, I’m also instructed to apply for the transcription of the remarks on sentence. This sentence, so they’re available for Mr Manning, maybe.

HIS HONOUR: Right. Because you’ll need them maybe for Mr Marshall. Yes.


	
	I direct that a transcript of these remarks on sentence be taken out.
	


HIS HONOUR: Probably one at a time but I will leave it up to Correctives.

WILSON: And I confirm that the firearms are not to be destroyed as they are to be returned to their owners by the police.

HIS HONOUR: Okay, that’s fair enough. Yes that’s fine. I have not made any order about disposal of the firearms.

WILSON: Thank you, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thanks Ms Wilson, thanks Ms McGowan.

		19 February 2015",2014-07-29 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704733,R v Thaidy (2) [2014] NSWDC 194,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Whilst on parole for an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, and whilst on bail as well, the offender went out to a party one evening. He there met two other people. They left, with the offender driving his car, despite the fact that it was uninsured, and unregistered, and Mr Thaidy did not have a licence.

2As they drove past a small shopping centre for reasons that are never really satisfactorily explained, Mr Thaidy and the two people that he was with decided that they would break into a hairdressing salon in the shopping centre. They made observations of the premises, drove away and then came back about ten minutes later. A nearby resident saw what was happening and telephoned police.

3Whilst police were on their way, the offenders broke into the hairdressing store and took some property, $46 in cash, three pairs of scissors and two razors. The meagre results of their offending were something that was entirely to be expected.

4As the three offenders were about to leave, the police arrived. One of those police officers was an officer by the name of Senior Constable Ballard. He ran towards the offender's car. The offender was in the driver's seat and his two co-offenders were in the rear seat. Senior Constable Ballard attempted to stop the offender driving off, grabbing hold of him through the driver's open window. Another officer, Sergeant David Lewis, also in full police uniform, ran from his police car. He approached the offender from the other direction, getting into the front passenger seat. Whilst he was kneeling on the front passenger seat he grabbed the offender with both hands and tried to pull him out of the car, but the offender was determined to get away. He broke free of Senior Constable Ballard's grip and accelerated wildly. This caused Sergeant Lewis to be propelled into the rear seat of the vehicle. He still had hold of the hoodie being worn by the offender. 

5The offender drove out of the shopping centre car park, turned left and then left again and began driving in an extremely dangerous manner. His intention was to cause Sergeant Lewis to lose hold of him either so that Sergeant Lewis could be thrown out of the vehicle, or so that when the vehicle eventually stopped the offender could run away unhindered. 

6He drove from side to side, swerving violently across the roadway. At times he would drive up onto the gutter. At one stage he hit a metal sign before driving back onto the road. Eventually the offender tried to make a righthand turn but lost control of his car, it left the roadway, went through the fence of a house, and stopped.

7All the time Sergeant Lewis was being thrown up and down and from side to side colliding with various things inside the car. He gave evidence that he was in fear of his life and I have no doubt that his apprehension was genuine. He even gave evidence that at one stage he pulled his service pistol out of its holster and contemplated shooting Mr Thaidy, the offender. The only thing that stopped him was apparently that the officer realised that at the speed the car was travelling it was more dangerous to shoot the driver than it would be to hold on and hope for the best.

8Sergeant Lewis suffered a number of injuries as a result of what occurred, both physical and psychological. A victim impact statement was relied on by the Crown. The Crown also tendered a statement of facts which set out physical injuries the officer suffered, I therefore have no hesitation in finding as a result of the injuries the officer suffered, he is receiving ongoing treatment, getting regular physiotherapy for injuries to his back and right shoulder and, probably more importantly, regular psychological counselling for recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks following this incident.

9The victim impact statement sets out the consequences for Sergeant Lewis of the offender's serious criminality. In particular he is not able to work as he did in the past. He has become withdrawn both personally and professionally. These consequences for Sergeant Lewis were entirely foreseeable, they are exactly the sort of consequence that could easily be expected as a result of Mr Thaidy subjecting Sergeant Lewis to the terrifying experience I have described.

10Mr Thaidy now appears for sentence having pleaded guilty to an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal and having been found guilty by me for an offence of using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension in company. The first of those matters carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years. The second carries a maximum penalty of 15 years' imprisonment but despite the lower maximum penalty, it is common ground that it is the more serious of the offences in the present circumstances.

11I am also to sentence Mr Thaidy for related offences on a s 166 certificate, driving in a manner dangerous, driving an uninsured vehicle, driving an unregistered vehicle and driving a vehicle without ever being licensed to do so.

12I take into account the pleas of guilty that were entered and so the sentences I will impose upon the offender for those matters is 25% less than it would otherwise have been.

13There was no plea of guilty to the most serious offence, using an offensive weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension but nevertheless there were concessions made in the course of the trial which limited the matters in dispute. The accused's attitude towards those matters I have also taken into account.

14Mr Thaidy was brought up by parents who loved him and cared for him. He has a number of siblings. Neither of his parents and none of his siblings have been in trouble with the police. 

15As Mr Thaidy was growing up there were financial problems due to his mother's gambling and his parents unemployment, but that is the only blot to be noted in the offender's family upbringing. His parents did not abuse drugs or alcohol, nor did they commit any offences. Mr Thaidy had a good upbringing. His choice to begin to commit crimes, his choice to begin to use drugs and his choice to continue both using drugs and commit crimes as he got older has to be looked at in that light.

16The financial problems caused by unemployment and gambling led to the offender becoming embarrassed and angry at his parents. That in turn led to him committing thefts in order to obtain money. That of course led to tension in the family, he left home at times and would return on occasions but even when he was living at home attempted to avoid home life.

17He began using drugs at a young age and indeed was under the influence of drugs at the time of these offences. He has for many years associated with friends who also commit offences. Mr Thaidy sees a connection between associating with such people and the commission of offences. He will not introduce his younger brother to his friends because he does not want him to make the same mistakes that he did. Unfortunately, as Mr Thaidy made clear in evidence today, he has no intention of disassociating himself from those people to whom he would not introduce his brother. He either fails to see the connection between associating with them and offending or just does not care. 

18Mr Thaidy is a man where immaturity and inability to think about the consequences of his actions appear to have affected his behaviour for many years. Whilst that may impact upon the offender's moral culpability, it may also suggest the need for substantial component of personal deterrence to be built into the sentence which I will shortly announce.

19Of course the most serious offence I have already mentioned is the offence of using an offensive weapon in an attempt to prevent lawful apprehension in company. The police officer involved, Sergeant Lewis, has been harmed by the offender's misconduct. Police, as the authorities have noted, do a dangerous job. What they do is risk their personal safety in order to protect other members of the community. It is incumbent upon the Courts to do what can be done to protect them. One way in which the Courts respond to offences of this kind is to impose severe, and indeed harsh, sentences in an attempt to deter others who may be tempted to do what Mr Thaidy has done. His offence was unusual in the sense that Sergeant Lewis was actually in the car, but the situation where an offender drives a motor vehicle at a police officer with intent to avoid apprehension is unfortunately relatively commonplace. Offenders having committed one offence such as a break, enter and steal must realise that if they attempt to evade apprehension by threatening harm to a police officer, or by actually harming a police officer using an offensive weapon such as Mr Thaidy did, Courts will respond with appropriate sentences to reflect the grave criminality of what they have done.

20I take into account that there was a limited degree of planning for the break, enter and steal offence and perhaps no planning at all for the more serious offence. It was, it would seem, a spur of the moment decision to swerve from side to side in an effort to break Sergeant Lewis's grip once the offender found himself driving away from the scene of the crime with Sergeant Lewis in the car with him.

21I should mention the question of parity. The two other offenders were dealt with in the Children's Court. I have to be careful that the offender does not have a justified sense of grievance when he compares the sentences I will impose upon him with the sentences that were imposed in the Children's Court, but of course when he does that comparison he must realise two important things: first he was the driver of the car, it was he who caused the injuries by psychological and physical to Sergeant Lewis; and secondly, the focus of sentencing in the Children's Court is very different to the focus of sentencing in these Courts.

22Of course there needs to be some level of accumulation between the break, enter and steal offence and the use offensive weapon to avoid apprehension offence but there also needs to be some level of accumulation to reflect the different focus of the offence of driving in a manner dangerous to the public. Although of course it was the same physical action which has given rise to the drive in a manner dangerous offence and use offensive weapon to avoid apprehension offence, one offence can have multiple consequences. Those offences focussed on different consequences and they must each be reflected in my view in some additional punishment. As it will be clear the additional punishment is not great but it marks in my view the separate nature of the consequences of the two offences.

23It is unfortunate to have before me quite a young man displaying a level of immaturity whom I must sentence to a significant period of custody in order to reflect the objective gravity of his misconduct. At present Mr Thaidy's future looks bleak. As I mentioned before he either fails to see the connection between associating with friends who like him seem to be regular offenders or does not care. Mr Thaidy's attitude towards the criminal law is obvious both from his criminal history and the fact that he was prepared to break into a hairdressing salon where the monetary rewards of such an offence were likely to be slim indeed.

24I have taken into account both the maximum penalties and in one case the standard non-parole period in formulating the sentences I will impose. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence

25I impose sentences as follows:

26For the offence of driving in a manner dangerous, I impose a sentence of imprisonment of nine months commencing from 21 July 2013. For that offence the offender is disqualified from driving for five years.

27For the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal, I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months commencing from 21 October 2013 and a head sentence of three years.

28For the offence of using an offensive weapon to avoid apprehension in company, I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing from 21 October 2014 and a head sentence of six years.

29For the offences of driving uninsured, driving unregistered and driving whilst never licensed, I deal with the offender under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act concurrently. For the drive unregistered vehicle and drive having never been licensed to do so, the offender is disqualified from driving for a period on one year accumulative to the disqualification period I have imposed for the drive in the manner dangerous offence. 

30I note that sequence four the offence of resisting police is to be withdrawn it is therefore dismissed.

31The overall effective sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of four years, nine months commencing from 21 July 2013 and a head sentence of seven years, three months. The offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 20 April 2018.

		14 November 2014",2014-07-24 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2704737,T and X Company Pty Ltd v Chivas [2014] NSWCA 235,"HEADNOTE[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]
On 6 October 2008, Mr Imad Khallad was driving a taxi owned by T and X Company Pty Ltd (the appellant) in a westerly direction down Market Street, Sydney.  He had a green light permitting him to cross George Street.  As he approached the intersection, two young men ran across Market Street, ignoring the red pedestrian light.  They passed in front of his taxi.  He did not slow down.  As he crossed George Street, a third young man, Scott Chivas (the deceased), ran onto Market Street and was fatally injured when hit by the taxi.
In proceedings brought by the mother of the deceased, the trial judge found that the driver of the taxi was negligent for driving at excessive speed in the circumstances. While finding that the negligence of the driver caused the harm, the trial judge reduced damages by 40%, reflecting his assessment of the contributory negligence of the deceased in crossing against a red pedestrian light despite oncoming traffic. 
The issues for determination on appeal were:
(i) whether the driver of the taxi was negligent in failing to reduce his speed;(ii) whether the trial judge had impermissibly relied upon hindsight in finding that excessive speed caused the collision with the deceased;(iii) whether the trial judge's assessment of contributory negligence by the deceased was inadequate.
The Court held, by majority, allowing the appeal:
In relation to (i)(per Basten JA, Beazley P and Barrett JA agreeing)
1.The trial judge, applying the principles in s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), correctly concluded that the driver of the taxi was in breach of his duty to take reasonable care with respect to pedestrians on the roadway and on the kerb at the intersection by failing to reduce his speed: [29]-[32]
Mobbs v Kain [2009] NSWCA 301; 54 MVR 179 referred to.
In relation to (ii)(per Basten JA, Beazley P and Barrett JA agreeing)
2. The trial judge did not erroneously rely on hindsight when determining whether the driver's speed caused the collision with the deceased. The trial judge did not conclude, either expressly or covertly, that the taxi should have been travelling at such a speed as to avoid the accident: [37]-[39]
Mobbs v Kain [2009] NSWCA 301; 54 MVR 179; Knight v Maclean [2002] NSWCA 314 considered.
In relation to (iii):(per Basten JA, Barrett JA agreeing)
3. Section 5R of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) reflects the view that people are to take responsibility for their own lives and safety. This raises doubt about the approach taken by earlier authorities that the culpability of a driver of a motor vehicle is greater than a pedestrian because their conduct is inherently more dangerous: [54]
Alford v Magee [1952] HCA 3; 85 CLR 437; Pennington v Norris [1956] HCA 26; 96 CLR 10; Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492; Cook v Cook [1986] HCA 73; 162 CLR 376; Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70; Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; 214 CLR 510; Imbree v McNeilly [2008] HCA 40; 236 CLR 510; Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells [2010] NSWCA 147; 174 LGERA 208; Frost v Kourouche [2014] NSWCA 39 considered.
4. According proper weight to the unpredictable step taken by the deceased in seeking to cross the road against a red pedestrian light and in the face of oncoming traffic required a far higher level of contributory negligence than that found by the trial judge.  Contributory negligence should be assessed at 75%: [57]
(Beazley P dissenting)
5. The damage that a motor vehicle may do to pedestrians remains a relevant observation in determining contributory negligence under the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). Both the deceased and the driver were careless but the likely seriousness of harm of the driver's conduct was such that he should bear a higher proportion of the blame for the accident. There should be no appellate intervention in the apportionment made at trial: [11], [16]-[17]
Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492 applied.
Stocks v Baldwin (1996) 24 MVR 416; Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; 214 CLR 510; Duggan v Chan [2013] NSWCA 182; 64 MVR 249 considered.
Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70; Seers v Turrell (19 November 1997, New South Wales Court of Appeal); Yu v Yu (1998) 26 MVR 509; Schieb v Abbott (1998) 27 MVR 285 referred to.




			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Basten JA.  I agree with his Honour's reasons in respect of negligence and causation.  My reasons in respect of contributory negligence are as follows.  In dealing with that question, I rely upon the factual matters in his Honour's judgment and in particular the matters set out at [22]-[24].  Although Basten JA has set out the provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002, s 5R, which governs the 'standard' of contributory negligence in negligence claims that fall within the Act, it is convenient for the analysis which follows to set out its terms at the outset of my reasons.
""5R Standard of contributory negligence
(1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm.
(2) For that purpose:
(a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and(b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time.""
2Section 5R was introduced as part of the civil liability reforms which implemented the recommendations of the Review of the Law of Negligence Final Report (the Ipp Report).  Section 5R embodies the Panel's recommendations. 
3As with certain other aspects of the Ipp Report and, relevantly to this case, in relation to the statutory requirements of breach there is a question of the extent to which the Panel's concern was with the application of the law by judges, rather than considering that a new law of contributory negligence was required.  This is apparent in the Panel's reference to judges being ""overly indulgent"" in the apportioning damages.  Section 5S may constitute a reform in providing that a court may determine a reduction of 100 per cent if it considers it ""just and equitable to do so"", although it is possible that the provision may articulate what was in any event available having regard to the terms of the legislation governing apportionment, discussed below.  
4However, the essential aspects of contributory negligence at common law were retained by the Civil Liability Act.  In particular, the statutory test is objective, as was the position at common law:  Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; 214 CLR 552 and, as I have always understood the position, the question at common law was to determine whether there had been a person's departure from the application of reasonable care for the person's own safety.  Thus in Joslyn v Berryman, McHugh J, after observing that the test for contributory negligence was objective, stated, at [32]: 
""The test of contributory negligence is an objective one. Contributory negligence, like negligence, 'eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question.'""  (citation omitted)
5His Honour continued: 
""34 In McHale v Watson, Kitto J held ... the established rule [was] that ... 'a plaintiff is required to conform to the same standard of care as a defendant, with due allowance for the fact that here the enquiry is directed to what is reasonable for his own safety rather than the safety of others.' ...
35 ... the plaintiff is held to the standard of care expected of an ordinary reasonable person engaging in the conduct that caused the plaintiff's injury or damage.""
6I have made extended reference to Joslyn v Berryman because there are potentially inconsistent decisions in the Court as to the ongoing relevance of that decision given the enactment of s 5R.  Nonetheless, the position is now as prescribed by statute and it is the language of the statute to which regard must be had and there would appear to be limited utility in continued reference to that decision, at least in cases which do not bear any similarity in their factual circumstances.  
7It is important to note, however, that the Panel's recommendation in relation to contributory negligence was not intended to ignore the identity of the plaintiff or the nature of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.  The Panel referred to the example of a child (plaintiff)/adult (defendant) relationship where the application of the same standard to a plaintiff and defendant did not require the Court to treat the child as an adult.  Likewise, in the case of an employee/employer relationship, the Panel observed that a court would still take into account the fact that an employee typically has less control over the work environment than the employer.  
8There appears to be a difference in views in the Court in decisions where it has been considered relevant to have regard to the capacity of a motor vehicle to inflict significant damage.  The potential for a vehicle to do serious damage to a pedestrian was referred to by Mahoney P in Stocks v Baldwin (1996) 24 MVR 416 where his Honour observed, at 417-418:
""The use of motor vehicles in the city creates real dangers ... 
[However] the reasonable person would accept that it is not the duty of a driver so to drive that there is no foreseeable risk of injury to others.  To think otherwise would be to ignore the realities of city life.  But it is not to be taken from what I have said that risks may be ignored.  In the 'balancing' process to which Mason J referred, at least four things are to be borne in mind:  the extent of the damage that may be done by a driver to a pedestrian;  the degree of likelihood that a pedestrian will suddenly come into the path of an ongoing vehicle;  the consequent extent of the precautions which a driver must take against that eventuality;  and the extent of what a driver is able to do when confronted with such a danger.""
Mahoney P continued:
""The damage which a driver may do to a pedestrian is great:  the injuries suffered by the present plaintiff show this.  This is an important matter when deciding what a driver must do.  The inconvenience of driving slower is to be measure against, inter alia, what may be done to a pedestrian if the driver's estimate of the risk is wrong.  
Pedestrians sometimes act carelessly ... they do so with sufficient frequency that a prudent driver would take account of it.""
9The damage that a motor vehicle may do to a pedestrian has often been referred to in the case law.  Thus, in Schieb v Abbott (1998) 27 MVR 285, having referred to the observations of Deane J in March v Stramare (E & MH) Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 12; 171 CLR 506 at 521, I commented (Mason P and Priestley JA agreeing) that the duty of care of a driver of a motor vehicle was owed to all users of the road, including the inattentive and those whose faculties were impaired by alcohol, meant that the standard of care to be observed by a driver of a motor vehicle was, of necessity, high.  In that context, I referred to the identification by Mahoney P in Stocks v Baldwin of the relevance of the damage that may be done to a pedestrian by a motor vehicle in determining whether a driver had breached the duty of care owed to the pedestrian.  See also Seers v Turrell (19 November 1997, New South Wales Court of Appeal, unreported);  Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70;  Yu v Yu (1998) 26 MVR 509.  
10Those cases were decided prior to the introduction of the Civil Liability Act.  Nonetheless, the case law has continued to recognise the relevance of the harm that can be done by a motor vehicle for the purposes of determining breach of duty of care.  Thus, in Duggan v Chan [2013] NSWCA 182;  64 MVR 249 Emmett JA (Ward and Gleeson JJA agreeing) observed, at [17]:
""Drivers of motor vehicles, being in charge of frequently lethal machines, are under a duty to drive reasonably in the circumstances in which they find themselves.  Such circumstances include the fact that a driver is driving lawfully by obeying green lights and travelling within the limit proscribed by the law.  On the other hand, other circumstances may need to be taken into account as well:  Tsuji v Metromix Pty Ltd (1998) 28 MVR 401 at 403-4.  Thus, a motorist may have some reason, because of the surrounding circumstances, to be aware that pedestrians are likely to behave carelessly ... A motorist must always be conscious of the fact that a pedestrian may do something silly and must adjust his or her driving to account for that possibility.""
11However, as his Honour observed, at [18], the mere possibility of a pedestrian being on the road may not be sufficient to find breach of duty.  As the authorities have also stressed, the liability of a motorist is not an absolute one.  As I explain below, the observations of the Court in Duggan v Chan as to the damage that can be caused by a motor vehicle, which reflect earlier authorities on this point, is also a relevant observation in respect of the determination of contributory negligence under the Civil Liability Act. 
12In determining whether a plaintiff was contributorily negligent, s 5R turns the attention of the decision maker to s 5B.  Section 5B(2) provides that in determining whether a reasonable person would have taken precaution against a risk of harm, the Court is to consider: 
""(a) the probability that the harm would occur if care were not taken,(b) the likely seriousness of the harm,(c) the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm,(d) the social utility of the activity that creates the risk of harm.""
13If by reference to those matters, and any other factors that the Court considers relevant, the Court determines that a plaintiff has been contributorily negligent, the reduction in the amount of damages to which a plaintiff would otherwise be entitled, in the case of a motor vehicle accident, is governed by the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999, s 138(3), which provides:
""The damages recoverable in respect of the motor accident are to be reduced by such percentage as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case.""
14The ""just and equitable"" determination must be based upon the relative responsibility for the accident as between the plaintiff and defendant.  That assessment must, having regard to the statutory scheme, be based upon the Court's assessment of the matters in s 5B(2) as between the defendant who has been found to have breached a duty of care, and the plaintiff, who has been found not to have exercised the care of a reasonable person for his or her own safety.  
15In the present case, the s 5B(2) factors, when considered in relation to the negligence of the driver of the taxi, must be answered by reference to the fact he was driving too fast in the CBD, and there were pedestrians in the vicinity, who, to the driver's observation, were not crossing the road safely or in accordance with the regulations.  For example, some pedestrians were jaywalking.  Others were running across the road, including two of the deceased's friends.  Generally, the pedestrians in that part of the city on the day in question were likely to include elderly and infirm persons and persons with strollers and young children, as was seen in the video of the streets in the vicinity of the accident.  Importantly, the likely seriousness of the harm, if the driver did not drive at a slower and reasonable speed as a precaution against the risk of harm, was very high.  His taxi cab was likely to do serious, if not fatal, injury to a pedestrian should he collide with one at the speed he was travelling.  The burden of taking the precaution of slowing down was negligible.  There was no social utility relevant to the circumstances.  
16For his part, the deceased acted either with a high degree of carelessness, or made a serious error of judgment in respect of the oncoming taxi.  However, the driver of the vehicle not only acted with a high degree of negligence in driving in the manner he did, the likely seriousness of the harm in the driver not taking the precaution of driving more slowly was such that the taxi driver should bear a high proportion of the blame for the accident. 
17The trial judge did not give reasons for his apportionment.  Nonetheless, I consider that appellate restraint in respect of apportionment under the combined operation of the Civil Liability Act, s 5R and the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, s 138(3) is required.  In other words, I consider that in the context of these provisions, the appellate restraint referred to in Podrebersek applies:  Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492.  Accordingly, although I may have found a higher degree of contributory negligence (although not to the extent found by Basten JA with whom Barrett JA agrees) I do not consider appellate intervention is warranted. 
18BASTEN JA:  6 October 2008 was a public holiday.  Traffic in the city was light.  At 12.50pm, Mr Imad Khallad was driving a taxi owned by the appellant in a westerly direction down Market Street, Sydney.  He had a green light permitting him to cross George Street.  As he approached the intersection, two young men ran across Market Street from the north-western kerb (to his right and on the far side of George Street), ignoring the red pedestrian light.  They passed in front of his taxi.  He did not slow down.  As he crossed George Street, a third young man, Scott Chivas, ran onto Market Street and was fatally injured when hit by the taxi.
19Ms Amanda Chivas was the mother of the deceased.  She did not witness the accident, but sued in the District Court for nervous shock.  The trial judge, Bozic DCJ, found that the driver of the taxi was negligent and assessed the plaintiff's damages at a little under $800,000.  He reduced the damages by 40% for the contributory negligence of the deceased, entering judgment in a sum of $478,539.
20By its notice of appeal, the appellant challenges the findings that its driver was negligent, that any negligence caused the accident and the assessment of contributory negligence which it said should have been at least 75%.
21For the reasons given below, the challenges with respect to negligence and causation should be rejected; the challenge with respect to contributory negligence should be allowed and contributory negligence assessed at 75%.
Challenge to finding of negligence22Where Market Street intersected with George Street from the east (or Hyde Park direction) Market Street was one-way with traffic heading in a westerly direction.  There were three lanes.  As the traffic crossed George Street, it was required to veer to the left as there was a fourth lane on the west (Darling Harbour) side of George Street for buses which were able to proceed in an easterly direction up Market Street as far as George Street and turn left into George Street.  Thus the taxi, proceeding in the right hand lane down Market Street towards George Street (in lane 3, the lanes being numbered from the left) was no longer in the kerbside lane when it crossed George Street.
23The fatal accident was captured by a CCTV camera mounted on a building on the north-west corner of the intersection.  It captured images at half-second intervals.  Of the four young people in the group, Scott Chivas' two male friends started across Market Street ahead of him.  The third friend, a young woman, did not attempt to cross Market Street.  The two males commenced to cross four or five seconds before the collision, one just ahead of the other.  The CCTV footage suggested that the leading man had just reached lane 1 and that the second man was in lane 2 at the time of the collision.  About three seconds after the first of his friends stepped onto Market Street, Mr Chivas followed.  At that point, the second friend was directly in the path of the taxi.  Scott Chivas crossed the bus lane and was in lane 3 (the taxi's lane) when the collision occurred.
24The findings of fact made by the trial judge were summarised in the following passage at pp 21-22:
""(1)  On 6 October 2008, Mr Khallad was driving his taxi in a westerly direction on Market Street.
(2)  As he proceeded down Market Street, there were many pedestrians who were crossing Market Street against the prevailing traffic signals.
(3)  The subject of pedestrians jaywalking was discussed between the passenger and driver.
(4)  The taxi was travelling down Market Street at or just below 50 kilometres an hour.
(5)  At no point prior to the accident did the taxi alter its speed.
(6)  As the taxi approached the intersection at Market and George Street, there were pedestrians visible on the pavement on both sides of Market Street.
(7)  The traffic lights facing the taxi were green.
(8)  One young man left the pavement and proceeded to cross Market Street in a southerly direction; that is, crossing from right to left, as seen by the occupants of the taxi, and half a second later another young man stepped off the pavement and proceeded to cross the road.
(9)  The taxi did not alter its speed in response to the emergence of pedestrians on the road in front of him.
(10)  The taxi driver proceeded to drive across the intersection and sounded his horn.
(11)  The taxi driver passed within a very close distance to the two men, perhaps no more than several centimetres.
(12)  Three seconds after the first man stepped off the pavement, Scott Chivas stepped off the pavement and proceeded to cross the road.
(13)  The taxi brakes were applied immediately prior to impact since the CCTV footage shows the taxi in the nose down position upon impact.""
25No challenge is made to any of those findings.
26The finding of negligence proceeded on the following basis.  First, the trial judge noted that the particular risk of jaywalking had been identified by the taxi driver in conversation with his passenger as they proceeded down Market Street.  From that he concluded that reasonable care required that the taxi travel at 40kph, rather than closer to the speed limit, which was 50kph.  It followed that the taxi was being driven at an excessive speed (judgment, p 26), a finding which the appellant did not challenge.
27The second aspect of negligence, identified by the trial judge at p 27, was challenged and should therefore be set out in full:
""Secondly, in approaching the George Street intersection, the risk of pedestrian jaywalking again became manifest.  Five seconds before impact, one of the young men left the pavement.  Half a second later, another man left the pavement.  Notwithstanding that four and a half seconds prior to impact with Mr Chivas there were two pedestrians crossing Market Street against the lights, and that there were other pedestrians standing on the footpath, the driver did not slow down.
At this point, reasonable care required the driver to slow down, not simply to avoid the two men on the road but because of the risk that others might also attempt to cross the road.  This in fact occurred some two and a half seconds after the second man left the kerb when Scott Chivas stepped off the pavement.""
28This challenge cannot be accepted.  Some jaywalkers who proceed across a road otherwise than at a marked crossing, or who use crossings but disregard the traffic signals, do so with full appreciation of the risks and with close attention to the direction from which a vehicle may be expected.  Many will have the agility to move more quickly if the unexpected occurs.  However, that is not true of all pedestrians on city streets.  Some may be young and inexperienced, others old and less agile; some may be familiar with the habits of traffic at particular intersections, others may not, including people from rural areas where traffic may behave quite differently.  Some may be expected to anticipate how drivers will behave because they are themselves drivers, but others whether because they do not drive or because they have a disability which does not allow them to anticipate readily how others will behave may face greater risks.  A driver who fails to take the variability of such circumstances into account, when faced with persons crossing the street against lights or otherwise unwisely, fails to take reasonable care in the handling of a motor vehicle.  
29In applying the principles set out in s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), it is necessary in assessing the precautions a reasonable driver would take to consider the likely seriousness of the harm which might eventuate from a collision with a pedestrian and the burden of taking precautions to avoid the risk of harm, that was in the present case by slowing down.
30Given that the appellant accepted that the taxi was travelling at excessive speed, it is difficult to understand the basis for the challenge to the finding of negligence.  However, the question as to whether the driver should have slowed below 40kph was significant for another reason, namely the challenge to causation.  Its concern with the finding that he should have reduced speed on seeing pedestrians crossing the road in front of him was in part directed to the failure of the trial judge at that point to identify the extent to which his speed should have been reduced.  The answer was that his speed should have been reduced so that he did not simply miss the second of the two young men crossing the road, but passed at a safe distance.  One reason for taking that step was to avoid the need to focus all his attention on the man he could see on the road, to the exclusion of other possible risks.
31The trial judge, applying the principles in s 5B of the Civil Liability Act, correctly concluded that the driver of the taxi was in breach of his duty to take reasonable care with respect to pedestrians on the roadway and on the kerb at the intersection.  
32It may be added that the trial judge sought assistance from the findings in a number of decisions in this Court, discussed in Mobbs v Kain [2009] NSWCA 301; 54 MVR 179; [2009] Aust Torts Rep 82-037.  No doubt those findings, based on their particular facts, provide some guidance as to the standard required of drivers; however, they do not constitute binding authority and it is, accordingly, not necessary to consider them for present purposes.
Challenge to finding as to causation33The challenge to causation was based on the proposition that even if the taxi had been travelling at 35kph or even 30kph on seeing the two young men crossing the road, the outcome would have been no different in that the collision would still have occurred.  There was no evidence that the injuries would have been less severe at a lower speed: the case was run upon the basis of collision or no collision.
34At the heart of the appellant's argument with respect to this ground, was the proposition that the trial judge had committed the ""hindsight fallacy"" identified in Mobbs v Kain, by reasoning from a finding as to the speed at which the collision could have been avoided to the conclusion that breach lay in a failure to travel at or below that speed.  This was noted in the judgments of Giles JA (at [3]-[4]) and by McColl JA (with whom Macfarlan JA agreed) at [84], referring to the reasoning of Heydon JA in Knight v Maclean [2002] NSWCA 314 at [66]-[69].
35As the appellant correctly noted, the central element of causation was that ""the negligence was a necessary condition of the occurrence of the harm"", as required by s 5D(1)(a) of the Civil Liability Act, involves a sufficient identification of the nature of the breach of duty constituting the negligence to allow that assessment to be carried out.  Whilst causation is to be assessed with the benefit of hindsight, the standard of care required is not: to elide the separate stages of the inquiry is undoubtedly erroneous.  The question is whether the trial judge did that in the present case.  There is no doubt that the trial judge asked himself the correct question, setting out both the statutory provisions and noting the need to identify the negligence causing the harm.  The judge then noted evidence of an expert witness, Mr Jamieson, who said that had the driver braked when the two boys crossed the road in front of him, the collision would probably not have occurred.  He was asked why not and stated:
""Because the physics dictates that if he brake[d], even moderately, not emergency, the taxi would have arrived there late and Scott would have cleared into the lane adjacent to the taxi.""
36The trial judge concluded, at p 30:
""Approaching the question of causation in this way, it is unnecessary to deal with issues of reaction time and with issues of whether the taxi driver was able or could have stopped, given the time at which Mr Chivas stepped out from the pavement.  As I have indicated, in my view reasonable care demanded that the taxi driver should have taken action before Mr Chivas stepped off the pavement.""
37It is tolerably clear that this reasoning did not commit the error complained of.  The trial judge did not conclude, either expressly or covertly, that the taxi should have been travelling at such a speed as to avoid the accident.  Rather, he accepted Mr Jamieson's evidence as to ""the physics"", a term which is readily understood in the context.
38The CCTV footage showed the deceased stepping off the kerb about 2 seconds before the collision.  At the point of collision, he had crossed the bus lane and was in the lane in which the taxi was travelling.  Mr Urquhart (the appellant's expert) noted that the deceased travelled ""about 3 to 3.5 metres in one second"": judgment, p 12.  In the three seconds between the first pedestrian stepping onto the roadway and the deceased stepping onto the roadway, travelling at 48kph, the taxi would have covered 40 metres.  At 36kph, it would have covered 30 metres.  Not only would the driver have had extra time in which to see the deceased and reduce speed further, but the deceased would have had sufficient time to reach lane 2, being the lane beyond that in which the taxi was travelling.  That is the rough and ready calculation which underlay Mr Jameison's reference to ""the physics"".  The appellant did not attempt to demonstrate that that calculation was wrong, no doubt because it was not.  The trial judge was entitled to rely upon the expert without carrying out the unchallenged calculation.  He was correct to conclude that causation was established.
39The breach which the trial judge had identified was in travelling down Market Street at close to 50kph, instead of 40kph.  The further breach, which required him to slow further (had that been necessary) when the first two pedestrians started across the road, could readily be satisfied by reducing speed to 36kph.  Accordingly, it was the breach already identified which permitted the finding as to causation; there was no application of ""hindsight reasoning"".  The appeal with respect to liability and causation must be dismissed.
Challenge to contributory negligence40The trial judge assessed contributory negligence of the deceased at 40%.  After stating the relevant principles, he identified the relevant factors in the following passage (judgment, p 32-33):
""Although this was not a case of a car travelling at high speed, it was a case of a car travelling at a speed which was excessive in all the circumstances, failing to make any attempt to slow down or take other evasive action, in circumstances in which the taxi had a far greater capacity to cause damage.  On the other hand, Scott Chivas created the situation of danger by stepping out onto the road, whether one describes his movements as a brisk walk or a jog, where it was not safe to do so, ignoring the flashing red pedestrian light and being able to observe the approaching taxi.  Shortly before impact he does look to his left.  He stepped out onto the road permitting the driver minimal opportunity to avoid the impact.""
41In identifying the relevant legal principles to be applied, the trial judge correctly referred to s 5R of the Civil Liability Act and s 138 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW).  Further, he summarised the principles set out in cases which pre-dated the Civil Liability Act, including Joslyn v Berryman [2003] HCA 34; 214 CLR 552 and Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 34; 59 ALJR 492.  
42Section 5R of the Civil Liability Act provides:
5R Standard of contributory negligence
(1) The principles that are applicable in determining whether a person has been negligent also apply in determining whether the person who suffered harm has been contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions against the risk of that harm.
(2) For that purpose:
(a) the standard of care required of the person who suffered harm is that of a reasonable person in the position of that person, and(b) the matter is to be determined on the basis of what that person knew or ought to have known at the time.
43The commonly cited passage in Podrebersek is at 494:
""The making of an apportionment as between a plaintiff and a defendant of their respective shares in the responsibility for the damage involves a comparison both of culpability, ie of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man (Pennington v Norris (1956) 96 CLR 10 at 16) and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage: Stapley v Gypsum Mines Ltd [1953] AC 663 at 682..."".
44In Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70, Handley JA, reflecting the reasoning in Pennington v Norris [1956] HCA 26; 96 CLR 10, stated at 88:
""The evaluation and assessment of the culpability of the plaintiff and the defendant must take proper account of the fact that ... the plaintiff's conduct posed no danger to anyone but herself, while the defendant who was driving [the vehicle] ... was in charge of a machine that was capable of doing great damage to any human being who got in its way.""
45Caution is necessary with respect to the authorities which pre-date the Civil Liability Act.  References to the ""common law rules of contributory negligence"" must also be viewed warily.  (Even under the common law reference to 'rules' as opposed to 'principles' was frowned on: see Alford v Magee [1952] HCA 3; 85 CLR 437 at 456 and 460.)  
46Apportionment of responsibility in negligence is not a common law concept, but a product of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965 (NSW) (""the 1965 Act""), s 9 of which relevantly provides:
9 Apportionment of liability in cases of contributory negligence
(1) If a person (the claimant) suffers damage as the result partly of the claimant's failure to take reasonable care (contributory negligence) and partly of the wrong of any other person:
...(b) the damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage.
47Somewhat unhelpfully, the Motor Accidents Compensation Act provides that ""[t]he common law and enacted law as to contributory negligence apply to an award of damages in respect of a motor accident, except as provided by this section"": s 138(1).  The section then states that findings of contributory negligence must be made in particular cases, but expressly preserves ""any other ground"": s 138(2) and (6).  Section 138(3) states that ""[t]he damages recoverable in respect of the motor accident are to be reduced by such percentage as the court thinks just and equitable in the circumstances of the case.""  Although this last provision is not identical in terms to s 9(1)(b) of the 1965 Act, because s 138 does not purport to impinge on the obligation to have regard to the injured person's share in the responsibility for the damage, it should not be read as an exception to which s 9(1) is made subject by s 138(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act.
48Section 5R of the Civil Liability Act is found in Div 8 of Pt 1A and is stated to apply to motor accidents: Civil Liability Act, s 3B(2)(a).  The Civil Liability Act being enacted later than the Motor Accidents Compensation Act, and making specific provision in s 3B for its operation with respect to motor accidents, should not be taken as subject to s 138.  Rather, it should be given operation according to its terms.  Its interrelationship with s 9 of the 1965 Act warrants separate attention.
49In this somewhat complex statutory scheme it is not clear what role is to be played by the ""common law"", including the reference in s 138(1) of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act.  If (as must be the case) it means no more than the way courts have construed the statutory provisions, it is not only otiose, but ""is apt to distract attention from the supreme importance of statute law"", to adopt the language of Gummow J in Sons of Gwalia Ltd v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1; 231 CLR 160 at [35]; and see Walker Corporation v Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority [2008] HCA 5; 233 CLR 259 at [30]-[31] (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ); Apotex Pty Ltd v Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 50; 304 ALR 1 at [18] (French CJ).  For example, s 5R(2) of the Civil Liability Act deals with the ""standard of care"", which may or may not affect the ""just and equitable"" test in s 9 of the 1965 Act.
50The reference by the trial judge to Joslyn was no doubt to the ""rules"" identified by McHugh J at [16]ff.  However, there are reasons not to place too much weight on these propositions.  First, Joslyn was concerned with the application of s 74(2) of the Motor Accidents Act 1988 (NSW), not the common law (assuming the intended distinction is between the common law and statute; cf Leeming JA in Frost v Kourouche [2014] NSWCA 39 at [31]).  McHugh J was indeed conscious of that distinction, making clear the importance of the statutory test at [14].  The following paragraphs of his judgment involved an historical account of the ""common law"" of contributory negligence, at a time when contributory negligence was a complete defence and the courts had devised a number of mechanisms to diminish the unsatisfactory consequences.  Secondly, no other member of the Court expressly adopted the reasoning of McHugh J.  Thirdly, whilst doubting the current applicability of the reasoning of the High Court in Cook v Cook [1986] HCA 73; 162 CLR 376 (in respect of the duty of a care owed by a learner driver to an instructor) Joslyn pre-dated the decision in Imbree v McNeilly [2008] HCA 40; 236 CLR 510 which overruled Cook.  Finally, although there have been statements in this Court to the effect that s 5R(2) reflects the principle stated by McHugh J in Joslyn, the correctness of that statement is not self-evident and the reasoning underlying it has never been fully exposed. 
51Relevantly for present purposes, McHugh J described the test of contributory negligence as ""an objective one"": Joslyn at [32].  He described it as one which ""eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question"", quoting Glasgow Corporation v Muir [1943] AC 448 at 457 (Lord Macmillan).  McHugh J noted exceptions in respect of children and possibly certain other ""special and exceptional circumstances"" (referring to Cook) at [30] and [32].  To the extent that s 5R(1) picks up the principles in s 5B, that provision should be applied; to the extent that the standard is identified in s 5R(2)(a), it should be applied.  The standard is at least a qualified objective test: it does not conform to the language of McHugh J in Joslyn.  
52For present purposes, it is not necessary to consider whether those statements remain correct, a matter which depends not at all on the common law, but on the meaning of the phrase ""a reasonable person in the position of [the injured person]"".  However, what does need to be determined is the extent to which the approach adopted in Pennington v Norris, and relied on in Talbot-Butt, continues to operate.
53There are, as I sought to explain in Council of the City of Greater Taree v Wells [2010] NSWCA 147; 174 LGERA 208 at [107]-[108], difficulties in applying the same legal principles in determining negligence of the defendant and determining whether the injured party was contributorily negligent in failing to take precautions ""against the risk of that harm"".  Secondly, it is not entirely clear whether, by an implication from the statement in s 5R(1) (that the principles applicable in determining negligence also apply in determining contributory negligence), the standard of care identified in s 5R(2) in relation to the injured person is that which applies to the person causing the injury: cf D Villa, Annotated Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) (2nd ed, Law Book Co, 2013) at 247.
54The significant, if subtle, change of emphasis which arises from the enactment of the Civil Liability Act raises a doubt as to the emphasis in past cases placed on the capacity of a motor vehicle to cause far greater damage, when compared with the capacity of a pedestrian to cause damage.  That factor should be understood from the perspective of both the driver and the pedestrian, rather than as an independent consideration.  To treat it as an independent consideration may lead to the conduct of the driver being judged against a higher standard than that of the pedestrian.  Each should be equally conscious of that factor and adjust his or her behaviour accordingly: the driver by taking greater care for the pedestrian; the pedestrian by taking greater care for his or her own safety.  It appears to have been this factor, however, which led the trial judge to place a greater share of responsibility on the driver than the pedestrian.  
55A second factor to be taken into account is the requirement in s 5R(2) that the standard of care required of the plaintiff is that of ""a reasonable person in the position of"" the plaintiff.  In assessing the harm caused to the mother, the trial judge noted that the deceased was affected by Asperger's syndrome.  This might have raised a question as to whether the deceased's ability to judge the behaviour of other road users was affected and, if so, whether that was a factor to be ignored in assessing contributory negligence.  This in turn might have raised a question as to whether, although in assessing damages the tortfeasor must take the plaintiff with his or her personal frailties and idiosyncrasies, that is not so in the case of an assessment of contributory negligence.  In Joslyn, McHugh J thought that statements of Stable J in Daly v Liverpool Corporation [1939] 2 All ER 142 at 143 and of Jordan CJ in Cotton v Commissioner for Road Transport and Tramways (1942) 43 SR(NSW) 66 at 69 that a person should not be held to a standard of which he or she was not capable were wrong because they contradicted the ""objective test of contributory negligence"": Joslyn at [34] and [39].  McHugh J noted an exception with respect to age in the case of a child: at [35].  
56These issues were not raised in the present case and it is therefore inappropriate to explore them further.  To do so would require an inquiry into the extent to which s 5R is consistent with the principle stated by McHugh J in Joslyn, and the extent to which, absent s 5R, relevant disabilities of a plaintiff could be taken into account under s 9(1)(b) of the 1965 Act.  On one view, the ""claimant's share in the responsibility for the damage"" is a mandatory factor in considering a ""just and equitable"" apportionment, but not the only factor.  Section 5R affects the assessment of that factor, but does not deprive the court of the power to consider other factors relevant to the ""just and equitable"" test.  These questions will need to await consideration in another case.
57The weighty factor in assessing relative responsibility for the accident was the unpredictable step taken by the deceased in seeking to cross the road against a red pedestrian light and in the face of oncoming traffic.  Giving due respect to the careful reasoning of the trial judge, in my view, according proper weight to that factor in the mix of the identified considerations required a far higher level of contributory negligence.  I would assess contributory negligence at 75%.
Conclusions58For the reasons set out above, the appeal against the findings of liability must be rejected.  However, contributory negligence should be reassessed and the judgment in favour of the respondent set aside.
59There was no challenge to the assessment of damages at $797,564.  However, the assessment of contributory negligence means that the plaintiff will receive a judgment for only 25% of that figure which, in round terms, is $200,000.
60The plaintiff made an offer of settlement prior to trial, on the basis that the offer was without prejudice, except as to costs.  The offer did not purport to be made under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW).  The trial judge considered whether rejection of the offer was unreasonable and held that it was not.  Accordingly, costs were awarded in favour of the plaintiff, to be assessed on the ordinary basis.  Although the judgment in favour of the plaintiff still exceeds her offer, there was no challenge to the costs ruling.  Accordingly it should stand.
61In the second judgment, dealing with the application for indemnity costs and an application for stay of the judgment, pending an appeal, the trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiff and made the order as to costs, but also stayed ""the proceedings"", by which should be understood the enforcement of the orders.  The respondent should obtain the benefit of her judgment with interest from the date of the order in the District Court, namely 28 March 2013.
62So far as costs in this Court are concerned, the appellant has failed on the two matters which consumed the bulk of the hearing.  However, those matters involved an assessment of the respective responsibilities of the driver and the deceased for the accident, so that no clear division can be made between issues relevant to liability (on which the appellant failed) and contributory negligence (on which the appellant succeeded).  In these circumstances the appellant should pay half the respondent's costs of the appeal.  The respondent should have a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW) limited to the appropriate proportion of her costs not ordered to be paid by any other party, pursuant to s 6(2)(b).
63The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Set aside order 1 made by the District Court on 28 March 2013.
(2) In place thereof, give judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant in the sum of $200,000, such judgment to take effect from 28 March 2013.
(3) Order that the appellant pay the respondent 50% of her costs in this Court.
(4) Grant the respondent a certificate under the Suitors' Fund Act 1951 (NSW) with respect to the balance of her costs of the appeal.
64BARRETT JA:  I agree with Basten JA.

		22 July 2014",2014-07-21 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2704747,JG v R [2014] NSWCCA 138,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 11 February 2013 the appellant was arraigned on an indictment that contained 13 counts (of which counts 6, 8, 11 and 13 were pleaded as alternatives to counts 5, 7, 10 and 12 respectively). All charges were of sexual offences against teenage boys. Count 1 alleged an offence of buggery (Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 79) committed between 1 September 1965 and 31 December 1967, against a complainant to whom I will refer as GB. The remaining counts (except count 9) alleged sexual offences of various kinds committed between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989 against a complainant to whom I will refer as TE. 

2Counts 2 and 3 alleged indecent assault (Crimes Act, s 61E(1A)); count 4 alleged an act of indecency towards a person under 16 years of age by a person in authority (s 61E(2A)); counts 5, 7, 10 and 12 alleged sexual intercourse with a person under 16 years of age by a person in authority, without consent and knowing that the person was not consenting (s 61D(1A)); counts 6, 8, 11 and 13, the alternatives to counts 5, 7, 10 and 12, alleged sexual intercourse with a person over the age of 10 years, and under the age of 16 years, by a person in authority (s 66C(2)); and count 9 alleged common assault (s 61). The references to legislative provisions are references to the legislation as it applied at the time the offences are alleged to have been committed. There has, since the dates alleged in the indictment, been considerable legislative amendment with respect to sexual offences.

3The appellant entered pleas of not guilty to all counts. A jury was empanelled and a trial proceeded. On 22 March 2013 the jury returned verdicts of guilty in respect of counts 1, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 12, and of not guilty in respect of count 9. The jury was unable to agree on verdicts in respect of counts 2 and 3.

4On 17 June 2013 the appellant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment that, when aggregated, totalled 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole of 4 years and 6 months.

5The appellant appeals against the convictions. He has not sought leave to appeal against the sentences imposed.

6Before coming to the detail of the Crown allegations, it is convenient to set out the procedural history.

Procedural history 

7The appellant was arrested in September 2008. Initially he was charged with offences against four teenage boys. They were GB, TE, and two others to whom I will refer as SR and PW. The Crown proposed a joint trial of all charges. In April 2012 the Crown gave notice pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that it intended in the trial to rely on tendency evidence. The Crown proposed to rely on the evidence of each complainant with respect to the allegations of each other complainant to establish that the appellant had a tendency to have a sexual interest in teenage boys, to engage in sexual activities with teenage boys, and to use his position of authority to that end. The Crown identified a number of other witnesses from whom it proposed to adduce evidence for the same purpose. The Crown also gave notice under s 98 of the Evidence Act that it intended to rely on coincidence evidence. It proposed to rely on the evidence of each of the four complainants, and of other witnesses, to prove that the appellant committed the offences alleged.

8By Notice of Motion filed in April 2012, the appellant sought a variety of orders, including an order that there be a separate trial in respect of the allegations made by each individual complainant, and an order for stay of the indictment in respect of the count relating to GB. This latter application was not pursued. Whether there should, or should not, be separate trials depended upon what determination was made as to the use of the evidence of each complainant as tendency or coincidence evidence in respect of the allegations of each other complainant. The appellant also challenged the admissibility of the proposed tendency and coincidence evidence of the other named witnesses.

9The Notice of Motion came on for hearing before Cogswell DCJ in May 2012. Pursuant to s 130 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), a pre-trial voir dire was conducted. GB, TE and PW, as well as a number of other witnesses, gave evidence in that proceeding. Ultimately, on 23 May 2012, Cogswell DCJ ruled that, with some relatively minor exceptions, the evidence in question would be admitted as tendency and/or coincidence evidence in the trial of the allegations of GB and TE: R v JG (NSWDC, 23 May 2012, unreported). However, the effect of this ruling was to sever the trials of the allegations of SR and PW. 

10A jury was then empanelled, and the trial proceeded. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury was unable to agree on verdicts. 

11A second trial was then fixed to commence before Garling ADCJ. The appellant sought to re-litigate the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence. Having considered s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act, Garling ADCJ adhered to the rulings made by Cogswell DCJ: R v JG (NSWDC, 13 February 2013, unreported). This ruling is the subject of grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal.

12The appellant then sought an order that the proceedings on the indictment, so far as they involved count 1 (concerning the allegations of a single offence against GB) be stayed. That order was refused: R v JG (NSWDC, 20 February 2013, unreported). This ruling is the subject of ground 6 of the appeal. The second trial proceeded. This is the trial the subject of the present appeal.

13In the second trial the evidence of GB and TE was given to the jury, pursuant to s 306I of the Criminal Procedure Act, by playing the video recordings of their evidence in the first trial. The evidence of a number of other witnesses was similarly given.

14On 22 March 2013 the jury returned the verdicts set out above. By ground 3 of the appeal it is contended that the convictions are ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"". By grounds 4 and 5 complaint is made, respectively, of certain questions asked by the Crown prosecutor of two prosecution witnesses, and of the nature of cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown prosecutor.

An overview of the Crown case

15An overview of the Crown case is as follows. 

16At all material times the appellant was a brother in a religious order working (not as a teacher) and living in a Catholic boys' boarding college in the city of Bathurst, in the central west of NSW. From 1986 he held the position of Vice President of the college. From 1990 he was engaged in community work. Both GB and TE were students at the college, although at widely separated times, GB from 1965 to 1967 (at about age 12 to 14) as a day student, and TE from 1988 to 1989 (at age about 14-15) as a boarder.

17The offence against GB occurred on an afternoon when, in circumstances to be more fully described below, the appellant directed GB to an art room, where he (the appellant) sexually assaulted GB.

18The allegations concerning TE involved a more complex course of behaviour, involving the appellant in ""grooming"" TE by befriending him, having him undertake tasks such as washing the appellant's car, giving him treats by way of reward and showing him pornographic images. Chronologically, the first offence against TE occurred in that context, when the appellant took TE to a local fast food restaurant.

19The Crown case also involved allegations that the appellant had behaved in a sexually inappropriate way towards other students at the college, and to another teenager. This was the evidence tendered as tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act. The tendency evidence also included evidence of a variety of books, magazines and DVDs of a pornographic nature, with homosexual themes, and a focus on boys or young men, and condoms, seized in the execution of a search warrant on the arrest of the appellant. 

The trial

20What follows is an account of the evidence given in chief by GB, TE, and other prosecution and defence witnesses. It is not intended to, and cannot, represent any findings of fact with respect to disputed issues, other than those that are embodied in the verdicts of guilty.

The Crown case

21For the sake of caution, I have anonymised the names of those witnesses who were students at the college, or who gave evidence of sexual encounters with the appellant.

The allegations concerning GB

22GB was born in June 1952. He attended the college between 1965 and 1967, at the ages of 13 to 15. The offence against him, the subject of count 1 on the indictment, was committed on an occasion when GB and two other students (who he believed were PM and IS) were returning from smoking in a machinery shed. At the time, a swimming pool was under construction in the college grounds. The three boys came across a tractor that had slipped into a trench. The appellant was standing beside the tractor drinking a glass of cordial. GB made a facetious remark to the effect that the appellant had ""done a good job there"". The appellant poured the cordial he had been drinking over GB's head. He then asked GB and the other boys where they were supposed to be and told them to go there. As the three boys set off, the appellant told GB to go to the art classroom and wait for him there. GB did so. GB thought that he was in trouble, for his facetious remark, and was going to be ""flogged"". The appellant arrived, carrying a white towel, unlocked the door and told GB to enter. He used the towel to attempt to clean the cordial from the back of GB's neck and head. He then told GB to remove his trousers. GB did so and the appellant told him also to remove his underwear. He did so. The appellant held him tightly around the bottom of the jaw and stood behind him and penetrated GB anally. In evidence, GB said:

""He was using his left hand to hold me in position. He was using his right hand to guide himself. He was lifting me off the floor with - while he was thrusting to try and enter me further I suppose is the best way to describe it.""

(It is worth remembering that, although GB was a teenager at the time of the events in question, by the time he gave his evidence he was a mature man of 60 years.)

23At that time GB was not aware of what it was that the appellant used to penetrate him. However, he then saw the appellant use the towel to clean blood and ""slime"" from around his buttocks, and to clean his own penis. It was then that GB realised that he had been penetrated by the appellant's penis. He said that the experience was as ""a pain like I'd never ever felt before"". He continued to experience pain for several days, and also bleeding from the anus. 

24GB was, by this time, crying. The appellant told him to ""stop blubbering"". He warned GB not to tell anybody about what had happened, and that if he did, he would deny it. He also warned him that children can be cruel towards other children who made complaints of that kind. He said:

""Who are they going to believe, you or me?""

25This gave rise to the first count on the indictment (buggery), the only count that concerned GB. The appellant was convicted of this offence.

26GB maintained his silence. He did not tell anybody of the incident until about 2007 or 2008 when he told a psychologist, Dr Robert Woodside. In about 2008 he also told a psychiatrist, Dr Frukacz. 

27In evidence in chief, GB said that he came forward with his allegations after seeing news of the appellant's arrest, and lawyers acting for the appellant publicly declaring that the arrest was ""a witch hunt"", and the reporting of it ""a media beat-up"". That prompted him to ring lawyers in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and encourage them to continue with the prosecution. 

The allegations concerning TE

28The allegations concerning TE were more numerous. TE was born in September 1973. He commenced boarding at the college in 1988 when he was in Year 8. By that time the appellant was ""second in charge"" of the college. Brother Peter Dwyer was the head of the school. TE was also a mature man (aged almost 40) at the time he gave his evidence.

29TE said that, initially, the appellant treated him very well, and TE liked him. The appellant had TE wash his car and gave him food that he liked. He said by 1989 ""things started to feel not right"". 

30Incidents of a sexual nature began in 1989. The first instance of physical contact with the appellant that TE recalled took place on an occasion when the appellant took him to a McDonald's restaurant in Bathurst, and bought him food. He said the appellant put his hand on TE's leg, and then lowered it into his groin, his two fingers rubbing each other and clicking. This allegation gave rise to count 2 on the indictment, an allegation of indecent assault against TE. (In respect of this count, the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict.) 

31The following day TE was washing the appellant's car. The appellant asked TE to remove his shirt. He put his arm around the top of TE's shirt and ""pinched or played with my nipples ..."". There was a practice in the college, among the students, of ""nipple twisting"" that was done by the boys to one another in order to cause pain. TE said that the action of the appellant in playing with his nipples was of a different character and was of ""a fondling nature"". TE said that the car washing took place in front of the college, at the main entrance. Only TE and the appellant were present. This allegation gave rise to count 3 on the indictment, an allegation of indecent assault against TE. (In respect of this count the jury was unable to agree on a verdict.)

32The appellant developed a practice of inviting TE to his room. The appellant showed TE images of a ""graphic nature"" and asked whether it ""turned [TE] on"", and whether he had an erection. He showed TE the outline of his erect penis, and asked if that ""turned on"" TE. At one time he told TE that he was ""like a little brother"" to the appellant; the appellant told TE not to mention to anybody else that he was going to the appellant's room because he would be victimised by other students. The appellant had sexual images around the room that were of a homosexual variety. The appellant had a red toolbox in his wardrobe that contained about five or six homosexual videos of Asian boys with white men. The appellant showed these videos to TE. While the videos were playing, he performed fellatio on TE, and had TE either perform fellatio on him (which TE resisted) or masturbate him.

33TE described one incident in which the appellant displayed to him the outline of his (the appellant's) erect penis within his shorts and said to him:

""Do you mind if I wank?""

TE replied that he did not want to see anything, to which the appellant replied:

""How am I supposed to do it if you can't see me?""

34He said that the appellant covered himself with a sheet, dropped his shorts to below his knees, moulded the sheet over the top of his penis and used his hand, over the sheet, to masturbate. He told TE to watch. The appellant ejaculated onto the sheet. This allegation gave rise to count 4 on the indictment, an allegation of an act of indecency toward a person under the age of 16 by a person in authority. (The appellant was convicted of this offence.)

35Another incident occurred following a Sunday detention in early May of 1989. TE was required, as punishment, to rake the oval. When he returned rakes to a shed, he found that the shed where they belonged was locked. He walked towards another shed. This was a shed used by a brother, Brother Elrott. As he walked towards Brother Elrott's shed, the appellant intercepted him, and took him into the shed to which the appellant had a master key, which he then closed and locked from inside. When he first encountered the appellant on this day, Brother Dwyer was nearby. Brother Dwyer asked TE about the sweat on his forehead. The appellant asked TE to pose nude beside the lathe. TE refused. The appellant used industrial lubricant on his hand, and began to masturbate. He then put his hand down TE's pants and inserted his finger into his anus. The appellant's fingernail scratched TE's anus and he appeared to take pleasure from the fact that it hurt TE. The appellant then pushed TE over the lathe and penetrated TE's anus, with his penis. He asked TE if he was all right. TE replied that he was not. The appellant hurriedly left. These two incidents of penetration gave rise to counts 5 and 7 on the indictment, and the alternatives, counts 6 and 8. (The appellant was convicted on each of counts 5 and 7.)

36Another incident which TE believed occurred on a winter Saturday or Sunday took place when TE was in the television room. The appellant took TE to the study hall which at that time was considered to be an out of bounds area. It was deserted. The appellant forced his penis into TE's throat. TE was vomiting and gagging. The appellant pushed him to the ground, pulled his pants down to his knees, and had forced penile-anal intercourse with him. These two acts gave rise to counts 10 and 12 on the indictment, and the alternatives, counts 11 and 13. (The appellant was convicted on each of counts 10 and 12.)

37On another occasion TE was in the hall watching a movie with other boarding students. He left the room to obtain some water because he was coughing. The appellant took him to his room where he gave TE some cough medicine. He asked TE if he would like to stay in the room and lie on the bed as he was feeling unwell. TE declined. As he left, the appellant came into the hallway, took hold of him by the shirt, and began to drag him back into the room. Another priest (Brother Tanner) appeared in the hallway and the appellant released TE. This gave rise to count 9 on the indictment, a count of assault. (The appellant was acquitted on this count.)

38TE first mentioned these matters to his mother during a telephone call that he made from the college. It was not the practice in his household to be direct about such matters, and his description to his mother of what occurred was somewhat vague. TE thought that his mother did not understand the nature of what he was describing. He also said that he complained to the matrons in the college infirmary. There were two ""matrons"" who worked in the infirmary, both registered nurses. They were Ms Marie Daymond and Ms Beverley Clark. Both were present, but TE believed that he spoke to Sister Daymond. TE gestured to her that he had a sore anus. She responded by telling him that he should stop putting things ""in his bum"". (In cross-examination, TE corrected this and said that it was Matron Clark who had told him not to put things in his anus. It was then elicited from him, in cross-examination, that he had told police that Matron Clark had suggested that he go into town to buy some women's panty liners to soak up the blood. He expressly confirmed, not only that this was what he had told police, but that this had happened.) He also spoke to a nun, Sister Mary Comer in 1989. He told Sister Comer about ""putting a penis into my bottom"". He said that he saw Sister Comer between 8 and 15 times.

39In his evidence, TE referred to Brother Elrott, who was disabled and substantially confined to a wheelchair. TE struck up a relationship with Brother Elrott (who he described as ""a very lovely man""). Brother Elrott maintained a workshop in a shed (where the conduct the subject of counts 5 and 7 took place). TE, with other students, assisted Brother Elrott physically by helping him to move between his wheelchair and his car, and take him up to his room. TE also spent time with Brother Elrott in his shed, assisting him by handing him tools and the like.

Other evidence in the trial

40Both of TE's parents gave evidence. His mother, ME, recalled the telephone call made by TE in which he made allegations about misconduct at the school towards him. She could not recall the exact words. Her evidence confirmed TE's impression that she did not understand the nature of what he was saying, nor the seriousness of it. His father, GE, also gave evidence of a much later complaint made to him by TE.

41Investigating police located PM (one of the boys GB identified as having been with him when he came across the tractor incident). He gave evidence at the first trial. His evidence from that trial was read in the second trial. His evidence was of little assistance. He had a vague recollection of the incident involving a tractor rolling over. He did not recall smoking with GB. The other student named by GB could not be located by investigating police.

42A record of interview conducted with a Mr Tom Collins, who had been the art teacher at the college in 1964, was read. The effect of this evidence was that only Mr Collins and another art teacher (Father Quinn) had keys to the art room. Mr Collins did not lend his key to anybody. He did not know if Father Quinn lent his key to anybody. 

The tendency evidence

43The evidence of the tendency witnesses was, like that of the two complainants, given by playing the video recordings of their evidence in the first trial.

44PW gave evidence. He said that he attended the college from the beginning of 1987. At that time the appellant was the Vice Principal. PW gave evidence of an incident that occurred in the dormitory during 1987, when he was leaning on a cubicle talking to fellow students. He said that the appellant came up next to him, put his arm around him and ran his hand down his back, inside and down the back of his shorts or pyjamas, and patted him on the bottom. The appellant was fondling his buttocks for half a minute to a minute. 

45PW's evidence was corroborated by MH, who said that he observed the incident described by PW. 

46RB gave evidence of an event he said he witnessed in 1987 when the appellant sat on a skateboard with a junior student on his lap. The manner in which the appellant held the student was disturbing to RB. That was because the student was sitting in the appellant's groin area and the appellant was holding him down in that position. RB then saw the appellant stand and get off the skateboard. He said the appellant's penis was erect. The appellant turned and walked in the opposite direction. RB also gave evidence of witnessing a similar incident on a second occasion. 

47SW was a student at the college from 1986 to 1991. He gave evidence of having observed an incident in his second year, in the dormitory. The appellant was talking to a group of students. He had his left hand inside the boxer shorts of another student. His hand remained so placed for more than a minute. 

48HM, a student at the college for about a year between the middle of 1985 and the middle of 1986, gave evidence of an incident he said occurred in 1986 at night in the appellant's room. At the request of the appellant, HM went to the appellant's room where they had a conversation which the appellant said was ""getting to know [HM]"". The appellant placed his hand on HM's leg, and moved it towards the groin. The appellant asked HM what he and his mates did for fun. With some presence of mind, HM replied that they used to ""bash gays"". The appellant told him that he had been ""gay bashed"" at Dee Why, but removed his hand and HM left the room.

49MK gave evidence that he attended the college from 1986 to 1989, when he was in Years 9 to 12. On one occasion, when he was in Year 9 or Year 10 he saw the appellant with his arm around the back of a student, towards the student's pants line. 

50Another tendency witness was MA. MA was born in January 1979. MA was not a student at the college. He gave evidence of having first met the appellant at a dinner party in about 1993, when MA was 14. MA had an uncle, Noris Ioannou, with whom he was close. Mr Ioannou was in a long-term homosexual relationship with Robert Lyons, a psychiatrist. Dr Lyons had a holiday home at Cape Gervis (in South Australia). About a week after the dinner party, the appellant picked up MA from MA's parents' home to drive him to the Cape Gervis holiday home. MA said that, after dinner that night, he and the appellant were sitting on a couch massaging each other's feet. There might have been some movement by the appellant towards MA's genital area. Their legs were in each other's crotch area. Later that evening, when everyone had retired to bed, MA entered the appellant's room, jumped into his bed, and took hold of the appellant's penis. The appellant took hold of MA's penis. MA felt uncomfortable and left the room. The circumstances surrounding the dinner party, and these events, were the subject of evidence from Dr Lyons and Mr Ioannou. Their evidence essentially corroborated that of MA, although they could not attest to what had occurred in the bedroom. 

The defence case

51The defence case was outlined at the commencement of the trial, when the solicitor representing the appellant gave an opening to the jury. He said that all allegations were ""untrue"". He went on to say:

""... the defence case is that what [GB] says about this incident is untrue. [GB] never complained to anybody, anybody until September 2008. At that time ladies and gentlemen, there was enormous publicity when this accused was arrested on 3 September 2008. Front page news, TV, internet, the lot. Radio ... So [GB] comes forward nearly 41, 42, 43 years later, in the circumstances of considerable publicity. One of the things you will need to consider about [GB] is this; he hated that school. He was a dayboy. He didn't like it. Who could blame him I suppose. He felt different to the boarders. The boarders were regarded better as far as he concerned [sic]. He hated the order, he hated the school, he hated the institution and so on. You will have to consider carefully how someone could not complain, would not complain, would not talk about in any way to doctors that he was seeing, anything about what [the appellant] did to him. It's just simply extraordinary and the timing of it comes out with all this publicity, blanket publicity about the order at the time of the arrest of this accused. What a coincidence.""

(There was, in fact, no evidence to support the assertions about GB's state of mind.)

52With respect to TE, the solicitor referred to behavioural problems, and to TE's history of attendance at the college infirmary, of which there was evidence. He referred to TE's anticipated evidence that one of the matrons at the infirmary, when he made a complaint of bleeding from the anus, told him to wear women's panty liners. He suggested that the jury would accept the denials of the two matrons in preference to TE's allegation. He made reference to the anticipated evidence of TE concerning the incident at McDonald's, and told the jury that McDonald's at Bathurst did not exist at the time of the incident TE alleged.

53He referred to the evidence concerning Brother Dwyer, and said that Brother Dwyer would give evidence, as he had in the first trial, that no such incident had ever occurred, and that it was ""ridiculous"" to suggest that it had. He concluded that part of his opening by saying:

""That's the quality of the evidence of [TE].""

54The solicitor went on to deal with some of the evidence that was to be given. The clear tenor of the opening was that all of the accusations against the appellant were false, and deliberately false, motivated, at least in the case of GB, by animosity to the college and to the appellant; and, in the case of TE, by his alleged fragile psychological condition. The solicitor made specific reference to TE's supposed ""attendance"" at an adolescent psychiatric school. The attribution of motive - the suggestion that GB was motivated by publicity generated by the appellant's arrest - could only be taken to mean that GB had deliberately come forward to join in the accusations against the appellant, and had done so dishonestly. 

55In case there was any doubt about it, during the hearing of the appeal, the appellant's solicitor expressly acknowledged that his intention in cross-examining the complainants as he did was to accuse them of deliberate fabrication.

56It is clear from these passages that the defence case was that both complainants were making false accusations against the appellant.

57That continued to be the theme in the cross-examination of the various Crown witnesses. A concerted attempt was made to discredit the two complainants in particular. One means by which this was attempted was to identify discrepancies in the evidence given by the complainants in committal proceedings, and statements they had made on prior occasions. For example, in a statement made by GB to police, he gave the dates of his attendance at the college as 1964 to 1966. During the committal proceedings he gave those dates as 1965 to 1967. It was put to both GB and TE that the events of which they complained had never taken place.

58It was elicited from GB in cross-examination that he had made two statements to police. In the first (September 2008) he said that he had attended the college between 1964 and 1966. In the second (February 2009) he corrected the dates to 1965 to 1967. He was cross-examined with respect to a third document; this was not a statement made to police, but an account he had prepared for himself in 2012, but had provided to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 

59Cross-examination of GB focussed heavily upon the tractor incident. The main avenue of attack concerned the year in which he said it had occurred.

60GB said in evidence that the incident of which he complained did not happen in 1965. What he could say with certainty was that the incident took place the year that the tractor went into the trench. In the statement he wrote for his own purposes in 2012 and provided to the Director of Public Prosecutions, he said that he thought he would have been 12 or 13 years of age at the time of the incident. That would have placed the incident in 1964 or 1965. 

61In the statement made to police, GB said that he could not remember the names of the two students in his company when he came across the tractor. By the time of committal, he recalled the names of the students as PM and IS.

62In the document provided to the Director of Public Prosecutions, GB described the appellant's clothing at the time of the tractor incident as a white t-shirt and shorts. He did not, in his police statement, refer to or describe the clothing the appellant was wearing. 

63It was put to him that, in the two statements made to police, he had included an acknowledgement that the statement accurately sets out the evidence he would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness, and was true to the best of his knowledge and belief and he knew that if he said anything he knew to be false or did not believe to be true he would be liable to prosecution. No such acknowledgment was contained in the third document, the account he had prepared for his own purposes. Just what was intended to be achieved by that cross-examination is not clear; there does not appear to be any material discrepancy between the content of that document and his earlier statements, other than some confusion about the year in which the offence occurred.

64In his first statement to police, GB said that when he came across the tractor, it had its two right hand wheels stuck in the trench. At committal, he corrected this by saying that it was the two left hand wheels that were stuck. His explanation for this was that his perception depended upon the angle from which he was viewing the tractor. 

65The recurring theme of the cross-examination of TE was that his evidence was false. It was clearly implied that he had deliberately fabricated his allegations against the appellant. This, it appears, was sought to be supported in a number of different ways, which it is, regrettably, necessary, having regard to the grounds of the appeal and the submissions, to explore in some detail.

66It was first suggested to TE that, from the beginning of his residence at the college, he had had learning difficulties, visual impairment, and difficulties in settling into the college life. At the end of the cross-examination, it was suggested to him that he had falsely stated to police that he had been accused by the appellant of lighting fires and stealing. I infer that these questions were put in order to suggest a motive for his making false allegations, although that was never directly put to him. 

67TE was then extensively cross-examined about each of his allegations. With respect to count 2, the allegation of indecent assault at a McDonald's restaurant in Bathurst, TE did not, in his evidence in chief, specify a date of its occurrence. In cross-examination he agreed that he had, in a statement made to police, fixed the timing of the incident as late February or early March 1989. It was put to him that as at that date, the McDonald's restaurant in Bathurst had not opened. He replied:

""That's a load of crap.""

He was shown a newspaper cutting purportedly reporting the opening of the restaurant in August 1989. He said:

""It's with my whole heart that I believe that I was in McDonald's in 1989 ...""

He queried whether the opening reported in the newspaper was a ""grand opening"" and whether the business had in fact been operating at an earlier time.

68He maintained that he had ""physically"" gone to McDonald's in Bathurst with the appellant. Ultimately, the Crown conceded that the McDonald's restaurant had opened in August 1989. Plainly, TE could not be right about both the date of the offence, and its location. TE was pressed to adhere to the date he had given. His focus was on having attended the restaurant, rather than committing himself to the date.

69Another issue the subject of extensive cross-examination was the location and layout of the appellant's room, where TE said some of the offences and other events took place. He was asked to, and did, draw a diagram of what he said was the layout of the appellant's room. He was challenged by being confronted with another diagram, said to have been drawn by the appellant, which was markedly different. TE maintained that the room depicted in that diagram was not the room of the appellant. It was suggested to him that the room he had drawn was in fact the room of Brother Elrott, but he refuted this. 

70In cross-examination it was elicited from TE that, in his statement to police, he had given an account of an incident in the office of Brother Dwyer (the President of the college). This was not the subject of evidence in chief. The incident, as recounted by TE, was this. TE had gone to see Brother Dwyer to report that another student had stolen some clothing of his. Brother Dwyer had, on the table in his office, a number of photographs, which TE could clearly see were pornographic photographs of naked boys. Brother Dwyer attempted to conceal them. While TE was in the office, his uncle (whom TE said was a paedophile) arrived. He handed Brother Dwyer $100, and Brother Dwyer gave him photographs.

71TE was cross-examined at length with a view to exposing what was said to be the unlikelihood of various aspects of his evidence. These included:

(1)his account of the pornographic photographs given by Brother Dwyer to TE's uncle;

(2)the incident in which TE said that he had been required to rake grass in May. It was suggested to him that there would be no grass mown in Bathurst in May, that any grass mown would be mulched, and that, in any event, TE had not been on detention on any Sunday in May, June or July of 1989;

(3)the evidence concerning TE's complaint to the matrons following which he claimed to have been told to ""stop putting things up his bum"", and to buy women's panty liners;

(4)the car wash incident. This, TE said, took place on a Saturday in the front of the school, near the entrance. Plans of the school show that there is an oval in front of this area. The suggestion was that this oval, on Saturdays, would be in use, with many students and perhaps parents present - and that, therefore, it was unlikely that the appellant would have behaved as TE alleged, in what was, effectively, a public place. TE denied that the oval was in use, and said that it was, in fact, out of bounds.

72Throughout the cross-examination, TE was repeatedly accused of lying about various incidents of which he gave evidence. Similarly, the tendency witnesses were accused of fabrication. 

The appellant's evidence

73The appellant said that he was first posted to the college in October 1965. He then occupied a guest room in an area of the college known as ""the priest's corridor"". He was not a member of the college staff. 

74He became involved in the construction of the swimming pool, where ""the tractor incident"" referred to by GB had taken place. He gave very detailed evidence about the circumstances of the tractor incident. He said that extricating the tractor from the trench took most of the day.

75He said he did not recall GB, and had ""nothing whatsoever"" to do with him during the three years that he (GB) was at the college. He denied having directed GB to go to the art room after the tractor incident. He said he did not have a key to the art room, and, indeed, at that time did not know where the art room was. He denied anally penetrating GB, and denied warning or threatening him.

76The appellant said that, in 1986, he was appointed a Vice-President of the college and Tutor Master and House Master of the boarding school. He gave detailed evidence describing his accommodation, which conflicted in a number of respects with the evidence of TE. He said that he had minimal contact with TE. He denied ever having taken TE to a McDonald's restaurant. He denied ever inviting TE to his room. He denied possession of any pornographic material. He said that he did not have a key to Brother Elrott's shed.

77The specific allegations made by GB, TE, and the tendency witnesses were put to the appellant. He denied each. The appellant said that he moved to Adelaide in 1991 and became involved in the Adelaide Diocese and AIDS council. In that capacity he met Dr Lyons and Mr Ioannou. With respect to MA, he asserted that Dr Lyons had expressed to him concern about MA's sexual orientation and behaviour and had asked the appellant to act as a professional counsellor. By that time the appellant was living in Adelaide and had come to know Dr Lyons. An arrangement was made for the appellant to pick up MA and drive him to Cape Gervis. (This was disputed by Dr Lyons.) The appellant said that after dinner that night, and after he had retired to bed, MA came into his room and sat on his bed, wanting to continue the conversation that they had had on the drive down. He said that he immediately told MA to return to his room. He denied that MA had got into his bed. 

78The appellant said that he did not expel TE from the college. He acknowledged that, in two telephone conversations after his arrest (which was intercepted pursuant to a warrant) he had said of TE:

""We expelled him, he was a pyromaniac"",

and:

""I expelled him.""

He said that this was said out of frustration and upset at having been arrested and falsely accused.

79He said that in 1997 he returned from Adelaide to Sydney where he took up a position at a Catholic organisation called Stanford House and continued his involvement in HIV/AIDS organisations. It was in the course of this work that he came into possession of the various books, magazines, DVDs and other items (including condoms) that were seized by police in the execution of the search warrant.

80The appellant's evidence took issue, in a number of detailed aspects, with the evidence of both of GB and TE, and, to a lesser extent, with the tendency evidence witnesses.

81In addition to the appellant's own evidence, 18 witnesses were called in his defence. A number of these were character witnesses, who attested his good character. Some had been students at the college at various times, and gave evidence that they knew of nothing untoward about his behaviour or reputation. Two gave evidence, consistent with that of the appellant, that the art room was always locked. Two gave evidence of the discipline system in force at the college. This appears to have been intended as rebuttable of evidence given by GB, that, when the appellant sent him to the art room, he feared that he was going to be ""flogged"". 

82Brother Dwyer gave evidence. He had no recollection of coming across TE at Brother Elrott's shed. He was referred to the evidence of TE that Brother Dwyer had asked him about sweat on his forehead, and was asked if that had ever occurred. He replied ""No"".

83He denied that TE had ever come to his office about stolen clothing, and said that would not be within the normal college procedures. He described as ""totally a fabrication"" that there was an occasion when TE had come to his office when he had photographs of naked boys on his desk. He said that he did not recall ever meeting a person by the name of the uncle TE had spoken of.

Grounds of appeal

84The grounds of appeal are pleaded as follows:

""1. The learned Trial Judge erred in refusing an Application pursuant to s 130A Criminal Procedure Act in respect of separate trials of the counts in the Indictment relating to [GB] and [TE].

2. The Trial Judge erred in refusing an Application pursuant to s 130A(a) Criminal Procedure Act as to tendency and coincidence evidence relied upon by the Crown.

3. The conviction of the appellant was unsafe and unsatisfactory.

4. His Honour erred by permitting the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine Matron Clarke as to 'masking' symptomatology relating to [TE].

5. That a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the Crown Prosecutor being permitted to cross-examined [sic] the Accused contrary to Palmer v R [[1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1].

6. The learned Trial Judge erred in refusing an application for a permanent stay of the Indictment in respect of [GB].""

85Before commencing to deal with the individual grounds of appeal, I make this observation.

86In support of the grounds, written submissions were filed on behalf of the appellant. The written submissions run to 111 pages. It was difficult to follow the argument advanced, partly because, as is apparent, the submissions have been prepared for purposes other than the appeal (such as an application to cross-examine witnesses at committal), and added to incrementally. 

87The manner in which the submissions were presented has increased the difficulty of understanding what the appellant's case is, and has very significantly increased the amount of time necessary to be taken to do justice to that case. This approach is unfair to other litigants whose determinations will be delayed while I (and other members of the Court) struggle to identify the case sought to be made. Discipline is called for in the preparation of submissions.

Ground 1: separate trials
Ground 2: tendency and coincidence evidence

The background to these grounds

88As mentioned above, prior to the empanelment of the jury in the first trial, by Notice of Motion, an application was made on behalf of the appellant that there be a separate trial in respect of the allegations of each of the four complainants named on the indictment as it then stood. The outcome of that application depended upon whether or not the evidence upon which the Crown proposed to rely as tendency and/or coincidence evidence would be admitted for those purposes (or either of them). The Tendency Evidence Notice (s 97) nominated a number of witnesses from whom the Crown proposed to call evidence. These included students of the college, who were to be called to give evidence of the appellant behaving in a sexual way to themselves, or of having observed the appellant behaving in a sexual way to others. 

89The proposed witnesses named in the Tendency Evidence Notice also included police officers who would give evidence of the execution of a search warrant at the appellant's home after his arrest in September 2008, and to the seizure of a number of items from those premises. Those items included DVDs, books and magazines, condoms and a club membership card. The Crown proposed to rely on these items of evidence as indicating a sexual interest, on the part of the appellant, in young boys.

90The Coincidence Evidence Notice (s 98) indicated that the Crown proposed to rely on the allegations of GB and TE to establish that, because of the improbability of the events the subject of those allegations occurring coincidentally, the appellant did in fact engage in the conduct alleged. Further, the Coincidence Evidence Notice foreshadowed that the Crown intended to rely on the evidence of the various items seized from the appellant's home to support TE's assertion that the appellant showed him pornographic videos and magazines.

91The Notice of Motion was supported by an affidavit sworn by the appellant's solicitor. The affidavit recounted, in detail, the arrest and charging of the appellant, as well as other members of the Catholic Order of priests who administered and staffed the college. Annexed to the affidavit were many pages of extracts from newspaper and internet reports, and comments posted on the internet. It appears that this was intended to provide the foundation for the proposition that GB, and perhaps TE, had been influenced to bring their complaints by becoming aware of other allegations against the appellant, or other members of the college staff. This, in turn, appears to have been directed to a proposition that the evidence of the two complainants lacked probative value because it was affected by contamination resulting from what was said to be widespread media publicity. 

92Cogswell DCJ determined that (with minor exceptions) the evidence would be admitted for tendency and coincidence purposes. The effect of that ruling was that the application for separate trials would fail and the Notice of Motion would be dismissed. Although there is in the material before this Court no record of any formal order being made, it may be taken that, at least by implication, his Honour made an order dismissing the Notice of Motion. Once he had determined that the evidence of both complainants was admissible for tendency and coincidence purposes, it was inevitable that such an order would be made.

93That is of some significance, for reasons that appear below.

94At the commencement of the second trial a similar application was made to Garling ADCJ. Garling ADCJ considered himself bound by the order made by Cogswell DCJ. In reaching that view, he relied on s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act.

95Sections 130 and 130A are relevantly in the following terms:

""130 Trial proceedings after presentation of indictment and before empanelment of jury
(1) In this section, court means the Supreme Court or District Court.
(2) The court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned, and any orders that may be made by the court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury may be made before a jury is empanelled for the trial.
(3) If proceedings are held for the purpose of making any such orders after the indictment is presented to commence the trial and before the jury is empanelled: 
(a) the proceedings are part of the trial of the accused person, and
(b) the accused person is to be arraigned again on the indictment when the jury is empanelled for the continuation of the trial.
(4) ...
(5) ...

130A Pre-trial orders and orders made during trial bind trial Judge
(1) A pre-trial order made by a Judge in proceedings on indictment is binding on the trial Judge in those proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.
(2) ... 
(3) If proceedings on indictment before a trial Judge are discontinued for any reason, a pre-trial order made by a Judge, or an order made by the trial Judge, in relation to those proceedings is binding on a trial Judge hearing any subsequent trial proceedings relating to the same offence as the discontinued proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge hearing the subsequent trial proceedings, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.
(4) In this section, pre-trial order means any order made after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial.""

96There was no dispute that, for the purposes of s 130A(3), the trial before Cogswell DCJ had been ""discontinued"", and that the (implied) order made by Cogswell DCJ dismissing the Notice of Motion seeking separate trials was an order within that sub-section.

97There is an issue, as yet unresolved, whether s 130 and s 130A encompass pre-trial rulings on evidence: see R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306; 201 A Crim R 451 at [151] per Howie J. This doubt derives from the interpretation given to the word ""order"" as it appears in s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW): see R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136; R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213; R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633; DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568.

98Garling ADCJ was alive to this issue. He cited a decision of Haesler DCJ in R v BO [2012] NSWDC 194, in which his Honour concluded that, since s 130A is designed to avoid the unnecessary re-ventilation of issues which often lead to delays in criminal trials, the word ""order"" in s 130A encompasses pre-trial rulings and orders relating to the admissibility of evidence. 

99Garling ADCJ agreed with that view and adopted it. That is not the subject of any ground of appeal. 

100It is necessary to do no more than note that that issue exists. Certainly, it would be helpful if the NSW Parliament were to effect an amendment to put the matter beyond doubt. Section 130 and s 130A would be considerably more useful if it were clear that they are intended to ensure that pre-trial rulings on evidence are (absent the interests of justice dictating to the contrary) binding on subsequent judges dealing with the same proceedings.

101There are two reasons why the issue does not call for determination in this case. The first is that it has not been raised in the very lengthy submissions provided on behalf of the appellant. The second is that, in any event, what was done by Cogswell DCJ amounted to an order. The order was to dismiss the Notice of Motion by which the appellant sought separate trials: see DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568. 

102Garling ADCJ extracted sub-s 130A(1) and (3). He went on to say:

""It is argued on behalf of the accused that I should make an order which would allow the reconsideration of this application on the basis that it would not be in the interests of justice for the previous order to be binding. The onus of proof, of course, is upon the accused.

...

It is argued on behalf of the accused that I should allow this matter to be reconsidered because his Honour [Cogswell DCJ] made this ruling on the evidence available to his Honour but before his Honour heard the evidence in the trial. It is argued that the evidence which came out in the trial, which included evidence from the complainant, evidence from the accused and other evidence on the accused's behalf would allow this court to come to a different view. It is argued that the evidence given by the complainant [GB] was significantly unreliable.

...

As I see the position, his Honour had before him a significant amount of evidence. His Honour, in a lengthy judgment covering a number of matters, obviously gave careful consideration to the point it is sought to re-argue. When I am looking at s 130A I do not consider it on the basis that one of the parties may not agree with his Honour's ruling or that I, indeed, may have reached a different conclusion. The section of the Act is in place for a purpose and that is that pre-trial orders or orders in another trial made by another judge, the trial Judge, cannot be re-argued except in exceptional circumstances.

...

I have concluded, having looked at all those matters quite rightly raised, that this is not a matter in which I could rule that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding ... I cannot make any other finding than that I am bound by section 130A in relation to the first of these matters. 

... I am not hearing arguments as to whether I would have admitted [the evidence] in this trial, I am purely ruling in relation to section 130A and, having considered all those matters, I have concluded that I am bound by section 130A in his Honour's ruling. I could not say it would not be in the interests of justice that that order be binding.""

103The argument that was put to Garling ADCJ was to the effect that experience in the first trial demonstrated unreliability in the evidence of both complainants. This, it was said, was because there was a risk that their evidence had been contaminated by pre-trial publicity, and because the complainants were hostile towards the appellant. Those arguments were essentially the same as had been put before Cogswell DCJ. They provided no basis for departure from the order made by Cogswell DCJ. 

104An additional argument was put to Garling ADCJ. That was that, since both GB and TE had given evidence in the first trial, and had been cross-examined, Garling ADCJ was in a better position than had been Cogswell DCJ to assess their credibility. Moreover, as the appellant had also given evidence in the first trial, it was possible to discern ""an alternative explanation"" for conduct of the appellant of which the two complainants gave evidence. The alternative explanation went to the appellant's possession of the items seized in the execution of the search warrant, tendered as indicative of the appellant's interest in homosexual activity, particularly with young boys or men. The alternative explanation was the appellant's involvement in HIV/AIDS organisations. 

105These submissions were, in my opinion, misconceived. The task of a judge determining admissibility of evidence under s 97 or s 98 is to decide, first, whether it would have ""significant probative value"". Since ""probative value"" is the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue (Evidence Act, Dictionary), the assessment is of the capacity of the evidence to have that effect to a significant degree. In DSJ v DPP (Cth); NS v DPP (Cth) [2012] NSWCCA 9; 84 NSWLR 158, this Court held that, for the purposes of s 98, the assessment of probative value may take into account any alternative explanation (in a criminal case, inconsistent with guilt) of which there is a real possibility: at [10] (per Bathurst CJ) and at [78]-[82] (per Whealy JA). That appears to be because s 98 specifically directs attention to other evidence adduced, or to be adduced, by the tendering party. (The same must, obviously, apply to evidence tendered under s 97.) Both the Chief Justice and Whealy JA, however, also held that in the assessment of probative value it is no part of the judge's function to embark upon an assessment of the credibility of the evidence. That is, and remains, within the province of the jury: R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308; R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121; 84 NSWLR 363 at [167]. That applies equally whether the evidence is tendered under s 97 or s 98, or is sought to be excluded under s 137. In a criminal case, a further assessment is required: to be admissible under s 97 or s 98, the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant (s 101(2)).

106The submissions put to Garling ADCJ invited his Honour to make an assessment of the probative value of the evidence by evaluating the credibility of the two complainants on the basis of the evidence they gave in the first trial, particularly their cross-examination. That was wrong in principle, and Garling ADCJ was correct not to succumb to the invitation.

107A similar submission was made to this Court, and should similarly be rejected.

108Moreover, what was said to be the possible subject of an alternative explanation was not the criminal conduct alleged, but the appellant's possession, at the time of his arrest, of items that might be thought to be indicative of a sexual interest in young men or boys.

109In an alternative argument put on appeal, the appellant's solicitor seized upon the reference in the decision of Garling ADCJ to ""exceptional circumstances"". The contention was that his Honour applied the wrong test. 

110Had his Honour applied an ""exceptional circumstances"" test, then there is an available argument that this denoted error. However, in my judgment, he did not apply such a test. He set out the relevant sub-section (sub-s (3)) of s 130A, and twice thereafter expressed the conclusion, in correct terms, that he could not rule ""that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order made by Cogswell DCJ to be binding"". That is a test in the language of s 130A. The single reference to ""exceptional circumstances"" does not express the approach taken by Garling ADCJ to the issue that was before him.

111Finally, it was argued that Garling ADCJ erred by failing to exercise the ""discretion"" conferred by s 130A. This was not a case, it was (correctly) pointed out, in which the second judge exercising jurisdiction was limited to the material available to the judge who made the initial decision. In this case, available to the judge, and said to be relevant to the assessment of probative value for the purpose of s 97 and s 98, was the evidence given by GB and TE in the trial, as well as that of the appellant. The evidence of the appellant can immediately be put to one side; probative value for the purposes of s 97 and s 98 is to be assessed by reference to the evidence in question, having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party. There is no room in that assessment for reference to be made to evidence tendered or to be tendered by the opposing party.

112The relevance of the evidence of GB and TE in the trial was said to lie in the effect of their cross-examination. There was nothing in those parts of the cross-examination to which reference was made that impacted on this evidence other than their credibility. For the reasons given above, that does not affect the assessment of the probative value of the evidence so far as s 97 and s 98 are concerned.

113It will be seen that both grounds 1 and 2 rely upon s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act. There is no separate challenge to the decision (by Cogswell DCJ) that the evidence was admissible as tendency and coincidence evidence, nor any ground that asserts miscarriage of justice as a result of the admission of the evidence. No argument was directed to the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence. To the extent that it is possible to do so in the absence of argument, I would conclude that the tendency and coincidence evidence was properly admitted.

114I would reject grounds 1 and 2.





Ground 6: refusal of an application of permanent stay in respect of GB's allegations

Background

115Prior to the commencement of the second trial a Notice of Motion was filed on behalf of the appellant, in which a number of orders were sought, the first of which was for permanent stay of the proceedings so far as they concerned the allegations of GB against the appellant. The Notice of Motion was supported by two affidavits sworn, respectively, on 24 January 2013 and 6 February 2013, by the solicitor who has represented the appellant throughout. The first affidavit runs to 62 pages of text in which is recounted, in microscopic detail, every incident with respect to the appellant, the charges, and the proceedings. By way of illustration, paragraphs 57-58 record a mention, on 19 December 2008, of the matter before the Chief Magistrate in which the question of venue was discussed. Just how this has any relevance to the application for stay, or any other of the orders sought in the Notice of Motion was and remains unexplained. Similarly, annexed to the affidavit are a very large number of documents, which are not paginated. It is impossible to discern the relevance of a great deal of this material. The plethora of documentation put before the court, without any attempt to explain its relevance, has added to the difficulty of determining whether there is any merit in this, and other, grounds of the appeal. 

116The second affidavit catalogues staff at the college who have died, or, who, by reason of medical conditions or infirmity, are not in a position to provide information or give evidence. Plainly, this is intended to demonstrate the disadvantage caused to the appellant in defending allegations that date back more than four decades. That disadvantage ought not be underestimated. 

117The hearing with respect to the Notice of Motion before Garling ADCJ was complicated by the fact that one of the orders sought in the Notice of Motion concerned the admissibility ""of evidence as to Sexual Assault Communication Privilege"" concerning GB. Evidence was given by two medical practitioners, but that issue, ultimately, was not pursued. 

118Garling ADCJ gave judgment on 20 February 2013. He identified as the matters to consider (as put to him on behalf of the appellant) the following:

""(1) Delay.

(2) The reason for the delay.

(3) Was the accused responsible for any of the delay.

(4) Prejudice to the accused.

(5) Consideration of public policy, namely, the importance of bringing persons accused of serious crimes to be processed by the court system."" 

119He began by noting the extent of the delay - that is, the delay between when the offence was alleged to have been committed, and when it was reported to police. That was between 41 and 43 years. (It was an even longer period before the allegation was brought to trial, and another year before the second trial commenced.) Garling ADCJ noted the submissions made on behalf of the appellant, to the effect that no real explanation for GB's delay in coming forward had been given, but his Honour also noted that GB had given evidence that the appellant had told him not to tell anybody of what he had done as he would not be believed. He noted a submission that GB, in complaining, was motivated by ""animus"" towards the college, and his unhappy experiences at the college. He further noted a submission that GB came forward after seeing the appellant's solicitor interviewed and disagreeing with what he had said. This submission was intended, it seems, to reflect on the credibility of GB's allegations.

120Quite properly, Garling ADCJ did not make findings of fact on any of these matters. He accepted that the appellant was not responsible for any of the delay.

121In relation to asserted prejudice, he noted that what was put on behalf of the appellant was:


significant publicity surrounding the charging of the appellant, and the arrest of another member of the same Order as the appellant;


significant publicity surrounding the institution of an inquiry by Royal Commission into matters concerning sexual abuse of children in, inter alia, religious institutions;


significant dispute about ""the tractor incident"";


the unavailability, whether by death or infirmity, of potential witnesses.

122Finally, his Honour considered the public policy issues and correctly directed himself in accordance with decisions such as Jago v The District Court of NSW [1989] HCA 46; 168 CLR 23; Barton v The Queen [1980] HCA 48; 147 CLR 75 and R v RWO [2002] NSWCCA 133. He accepted that the appellant was at some disadvantage as a result of the delay, and other matters, but considered that the publicity, for example, could adequately be dealt with by directions. 

123In the written submissions filed with respect to the appeal, a great deal of emphasis was placed upon ""the tractor incident"". Complaint was made that, during the course of his evidence, the appellant maintained that there had been only one ""tractor incident"". The complaint appears to have been that, initially, the Crown alleged that the offence against GB occurred in 1965; but that, at committal, the Crown amended the charge to allege that it occurred between 1 September 1965 and 31 December 1967.

124The ""tractor incident"" itself is peripheral to the allegation made by GB. It does no more than set in a temporal context what he alleged the appellant did to him. On GB's account, what occurred occurred in an art room, in the absence of any other person. Fixing with more specificity the date on which it occurred could not, in the circumstances of this case, make any difference. 

125It is true, of course, as in all cases of alleged historical sexual abuse, that there is disadvantage to the person accused, in, for example, being hampered in giving or obtaining evidence of what he was doing on a particular date. However, while that may be a disadvantage, it is not, and has never been, a sufficient basis for a stay of the proceedings: R v RWO [2002] NSWCCA 133; R v McCarthy (NSWCCA, 12 August 1994, unreported).

126It was also submitted to this Court that GB's personal history was relevant to this question. Reference was made to what was said to be his medical history, during which he made no complaint or disclosure of the offence; to what was said to be his antipathy to both the appellant and the college; to what was said to be his antipathy to the appellant's legal representative; to what was said to be his motivation (supporting other victims); and that he was influenced by the media reporting. 

127The following submissions were put:

""Seventhly, in a case in which there is basically only word against word, the actual prejudice to the Applicant is submitted to be very considerable. 

Eighthly, in this case the Applicant also faces reliance by the Crown upon tendency evidence being of its very nature highly prejudicial ...

Ninthly, by reason of the delay the Applicant is no longer able to receive directions relating to:

 corroboration

 complaint

 a full Longman [Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79] direction

 a direction as to evidence of a relatively young witness.""

128The last of these is difficult to understand. There is no reason that delay precludes appropriate directions being given to a jury. That appropriate directions were given is evidenced by the fact that there is no ground of appeal that raises the absence or the adequacy of any of these directions.

129Nor is it apparent why a stay should be granted on the basis that the Crown case depends upon the word of the complainant as against the word of the appellant. That is the case in almost all trials of sexual assault or abuse. And it is difficult to understand why a stay should be granted on the basis that tendency evidence has been determined to be admissible.

130It is only in rare and exceptional circumstances that a trial of a serious criminal allegation will be stayed. So much is established by the authorities to which Garling ADCJ made reference.

131The appellant has failed to establish any basis on which a stay should have been granted, and has failed to establish any basis of error in the determination of Garling ADCJ to refuse to stay the proceedings. 

132Ground 6 must, therefore, also be rejected.

Ground 4: cross-examination of Matron Clark as to ""masking symptomatology"" relating to TE 

133This ground is based on two false premises. The relevant evidence is the following. Ms Maree Daymond and Ms Beverley Clark were both registered nurses who worked in the infirmary at the college, Ms Daymond from 1979, Ms Clark from 1975. Both gave evidence that TE attended the infirmary on numerous occasions, complaining of stomach pains. 

134Ms Daymond, who gave evidence first, was asked by the Crown prosecutor in chief:

""Now as part of your training did you learn that young men or adolescents can sometimes mask what is happening to them by complaining about stomach pains?""

The appellant's solicitor objected and, after hearing argument, Garling ADCJ rejected the question. 

135Ms Clark was then called to give evidence. The Crown prosecutor asked her:

""In the course of your training did you learn that young male adolescents can complain about stomach problems but in fact be referring to something else?""

Ms Clark asked for the question to be repeated: when it was repeated she said:

""I think, no.""

She is recorded as saying:

""I have always during my nursing career, treated the symptoms as they were presented. I do not presume to diagnosis [sic].""

She went on to say that if a student made repeated complaints of tummy aches she would refer him to a general practitioner and rely on his or her diagnosis.

136That was as far as the evidence in chief of Ms Clark went on this topic. However, in cross-examination, she was asked:

""You were asked a number of questions about whether you would deduce from symptomatology of bleeding from the anus what in your mind would trigger a thought or belief or a suspicion of sexual assault. Remember those questions asked of you?""

She said she did and accepted that that was the evidence that she had given.

137The two false premises underlying this ground of appeal are (i) that the Crown prosecutor cross-examined Ms Clark; and (ii) that Garling ADCJ permitted cross-examination on the subject of ""masking symptomatology"". 

138The written submissions on behalf of the appellant referred to the requirements of the Evidence Act in respect of ""expert evidence"" (s 79) and credibility evidence (s 102). Since no evidence of the kind the subject of the ground was given, it is unnecessary to deal with these arguments.

139There was some ambiguity in the approach eventually taken on behalf of the appellant. Although, at one point, he seemed to abandon this ground, he also maintained that he relied on his written submissions. Like Hall J, I have considered it wise to deal with the ground, although briefly.

140Ground 4 of the appeal must fail.

Ground 5: cross-examination of the appellant: Palmer v The Queen

141In Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1, it was held that it is impermissible to cross-examine an accused as to whether he or she can nominate any motive for a complainant to make false allegations. 

142The complaint under this ground does not involve any cross-examination of the appellant of that type. It is, however, related: the cross-examination of which complaint is made was cross-examination of the appellant to the effect that it was his assertion that various of the witnesses were lying in their evidence. That is not the same as asking whether a witness has a motive to lie, but, in the same manner, it does invite the accused person to express a view concerning what is in the mind of the witness - that is, whether false evidence is a deliberate lie, or mistaken or merely unreliable for some other reason. It is always open to an accused person to give evidence contradicting any part of the evidence given by a Crown witness. Doing so does not necessarily entail the assertion that the witness is dishonest in giving that evidence. The Crown did not dispute that questions of the kind put to the appellant were, if not impermissible, certainly ill advised. 

143The cross-examination of which the appellant now complains is as follows. MK (a tendency evidence witness) spoke of having seen the appellant with his arm around the back of another student, towards the pants line. In his evidence in chief the appellant said that he had no recollection of that ever having occurred. In cross-examination, when he was asked about MK's assertions, step by step, he said:

""It didn't happen.""

144He was then asked about assertions of another witness (RB). These were the assertions that RB had observed the appellant on a skateboard with a young student against his groin. The appellant's answers were:

""I remember him saying that and it's totally ridiculous that that could ever happen ... 

It's ridiculous ...

It's not physically possible ...

I remember him saying that and that also is a lie ...""

145The transcript then records the following:

""CROWN PROSECUTOR. He's a liar too?
A. Absolutely a liar.

Q. Is [MK] a liar?
A. Yes.

Q. He said that he saw it on two separate occasions?
A. I know what he said, yes. It still makes it a lie.""

146The appellant was then asked about the evidence of PW. PW was the witness who said that the appellant put his hand down the back of PW's pyjamas or shorts and fondled his bottom. The appellant said:

""I remember him saying that and that also is a lie ...""

The following transcript is then recorded:

""Q. So [RB's] lying?
A. Yes. 

Q. And [PW] is lying?
A. Yes.""

147The appellant was then asked about the evidence of a witness, MH. MH had given evidence of observing the appellant with his hand on the buttocks of another boy. The transcript records the following:

""Q. And that's what he says he saw you do?
A. That is also false. 

Q. He's a liar too?
A. Yes.""

148The Crown prosecutor (Mr Hughes) then asked about the witness SW, who gave similar evidence. The appellant agreed that to behave in that way was ""totally inappropriate"" and said that he would never do it. The transcript then records the following exchange:

""Q. And what you were doing I put to you, is you were grooming - that is - getting the boys used to being touched inappropriately by yourself, that's right isn't?
A. It is not right Mr Hughes, it is totally false.

Q. [SW] is a liar?
A. Yes Mr Hughes.

Q. As is [MH]?
A. Yes Mr Hughes.

Q. As is [PW]?
A. Yes Mr Hughes ...

And they all contradicted each other as to the incident.""

149The appellant was then asked about the allegations made by TE. The following is recorded in the transcript:

""Do you remember [TE] saying that you befriended him, that you said in effect he was like a little brother to you?
A. I remember him saying that, but that did not happen.

Q. He's lying about that?
A. Yes, like he lied about everything else.

Q. Like all the others lied about everything?
A. Yes.

Q. And he said that you took him to the McDonald's restaurant at Bathurst for a meal?
A. He said that but that it also untrue.""

He denied fondling TE's chest or nipples. He was asked if he was doing this in pursuance of his grooming of TE. He said:

""It is totally false Mr Hughes.""

150He denied showing TE any pornography and said that TE had never been in his room. He was asked about performing fellatio on TE and said:

""That is totally false.""

151He was asked about having TE perform fellatio on him, which he also described as ""absolutely false"". He said that did not happen.

152When asked about gaining sexual gratification from masturbating in the presence of TE, he said:

""It did not happen. He's a pathological liar.""

When pressed on what he meant by ""pathological"", he said:

""Well describe it as you will but that's what I - that's my description of the accusations against me would have to be made by a pathological liar.""

When asked if that also included GB, he replied ""Absolutely"". He said:

""... I said [TE] was a pathological liar and now I'm saying [GB] is a pathological liar also.""

153The transcript then records the following:

""Really, the people that are accusing you, that don't agree with you, you categorise them as pathological liars?
A. Absolutely, because I have been falsely accused.

Q. The other alternative of course, [name of appellant] is that they're telling the truth and you acted exactly the way they say you did. That's right, isn't it?
A. That is totally, totally false.""

154Later, the appellant was asked about the evidence of the witness Dr Lyons. The appellant had asserted (in his evidence in chief) that Dr Lyons had asked him to counsel MA (who gave evidence of being in bed with the appellant). Dr Lyons denied that he had made that request. The following exchange is recorded in the transcript:

""Q. Was he lying when he said that?
A. He was lying because why else would Dr Lyons invite me to pick [MA] up from his home, drive him to Cape Gervis, alone in my car when he and [MA's] uncle were also driving from Adelaide to Cape Gervis that same afternoon after work.

...

Q. And he's lying according to you?
A. I'm saying - I've given you the reasons that he asked me to pick him up and I can think of no other reason why he would do that unless he asked me to speak with [MA].""

155At a later stage in the cross-examination, the following exchange is recorded:

""Q. Is this the case, correct me if I'm wrong, your case, every single person in this trial who alleges sexual misconduct on your part perpetrated by you on them is a liar?
A. Yes.

Q. That extends from [GB] in the period 65/67 through [HM] in a room on the priest's corridor in 86. It continues with [SR] in 1987. It continues to [PW] who said that you put your hand down his pyjama shorts. It continues through all the allegations of sexual misconduct described by [TE], including anal penetration and it includes, it culminates in [MA], who said that he got into your bed and their (sic) was a mutual holding of penises. All of those witnesses are lying, is that your case?
A. Yes.

Q. And additionally, every single witness in the prosecution case in this trial who says they witnessed you acting in a predatory and inappropriate way with young students at the school, they're also lying, according to you?
A. The incidents didn't occur so, therefore, they could not have witnessed it.

Q. So [MK] lied when he told the jury he saw you with your hand on a year 7 student or 8 student on the steps leading up from the swimming pool area to the main building?
A. Yes.

Q. [RB] is lying when he told the jury you were sitting with a young pupil next to your groin and that when you stood up he could see you had an erection and you quickly walked away, not once but on two separate occasions? He's lying?
A. Yes.

Q. [SW] was lying, as was [MH], when they both testified about your placing your hand down [PW's] pyjama pants or shorts in the year 8 dorm? Correct? They're lying?
A. I think you said [SR] never made that accusation.

Q. No, [SW].
A. I'm sorry, [SW]. Yes.

Q. Both Noris Ioannou and Dr Robert Lyons are lying when they describe your inappropriate physical contact with their 15 year old nephew, [MA], in 1994?
A. Yes. All their evidence contradicted each other.

Q. Indeed Dr Lyons is lying when he says he never asked you to counsel his nephew? That was a lie?
A. Definitely a lie.

Q. You've heard persons who have come and given evidence about complaints made by [TE]? First of all, his mother said that he made a complaint while he was still at school. She's wrong about that?""

156At this point objection was taken to the ""line of cross-examination"". Garling ADCJ expressed his view that the question could not be asked and the Crown prosecutor replied:

""I don't extend it to there.""

157The cross-examination then continued (without further objection):

""Q. But this is the situation, these people who span a great number of years, they all - all of them have come and lied about you?
A. Yes, and there's a gap of 20 something years between the first accusation in 1965 and the next one in 1986 when I returned to the college and I was at the college from 1965 until 1980 and [GB] is the only accusation during that 20 year period.""

158The Crown very properly accepted that, as a general principle, a witness should not be asked whether another witness is or is not telling the truth or is lying: Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232; R v Foley (1998) 105 A Crim R 1. However, the Crown pointed to matters preceding the cross-examination. Reference was made to a similar line of questioning in the first trial. The transcript of that trial is not before this Court, but no issue was taken as to the accuracy of what is extracted in the Crown submissions in this respect. That extract shows that Cogswell DCJ raised the very question of the propriety of cross-examination of this nature. He referred to s 41 of the Evidence Act (dealing with ""improper questions""). He then said:

""But I'm assuming that was a considered decision because of - I don't know - but a forensic advantage that you expected ...""

159The following is then recorded:

""WALSH (solicitor for the appellant): Your Honour, I think I have to concede that the situation was that [JG] was capable probably of answering the question ...

What weight one puts to the answer or to the evidence is another thing ... But it did come across my mind ... and I thought it wasn't put in specific terms, it was, rather, in the general about other third parties lying, so --

HIS HONOUR: No. It was put that so and so - X and Y and Z were lying and then they're all lying. 

WALSH: Tendency witnesses.

HIS HONOUR: And I'm not being critical of you and, indeed, I haven't heard Mr Hughes [the Crown prosecutor] on whether he says that they were admissible questions or not. But I just wanted to check. Thank you. Good.

WALSH: Yes. I think, technically, your Honour, they were inadmissible, but I must concede I took a forensic view because of they were being put and I just thought ...""

160Further, in the first trial, it was put to TE in cross-examination on behalf of the appellant that he had not seen photographs of naked boys on Brother Dwyer's desk. He asked if the cross-examiner was accusing him of lying, on saying that he did not see such photographs. It was put to him that:

""... there never were any photographs on Brother Dwyer's desk depicting naked boys.""

He disagreed.

161It was then put to him directly:

""Well, I'm putting to you that you've lied about that; you've lied to the police and you're lying to the court about this?""

TE replied that he was not lying about that. Later it was put to TE that what he was saying about the incident involving Brother Elrott's shed and the appellant was a lie. He denied that.

162In respect of TE's evidence that he had been accused by the appellant of lighting fires, it was put to TE:

""See, I put to you very specifically that's just a lie?""

Later it was put to him that that evidence was ""untrue"" as was his evidence that the appellant had accused TE of stealing. 

163As mentioned above, the evidence given by GB and TE in the first trial was played to the jury in the second trial via the video recordings of their evidence. That meant that it was well known to all that the cross-examination of the complainants to the effect that they were lying would be before the jury.

164I have earlier referred to and extracted the manner in which the appellant's solicitor opened to the jury the nature of the defence case. It was clearly insinuated that GB was lying, and was motivated to do so by his hatred of the college, and that other witnesses would contradict assertions made by both complainants. It was also clearly insinuated that TE was lying in his allegations.

165In these circumstances, although I would accept the Crown's concession that the questions asked by the Crown prosecutor were, at times, impermissible, I am satisfied that those questions did not result in a miscarriage of justice. In this respect I am comforted by the acknowledgment by the solicitor that he had not objected to the questions in the first trial as a result of a forensic decision. He similarly did not object in the second trial. I can only infer that that was for the same reason. On appeal, he acknowledged that his intent in opening, and in cross-examining, had been to assert deliberate fabrication. 

166In the circumstances, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules has particular resonance. I would not grant leave to argue this ground and if leave were granted, I would reject ground 5 of the appeal.

Ground 3: ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"" verdict

167The written submissions advanced purportedly in support of ground 3 run to 30 pages. They commence with a brief reference to well known authority: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487. At paragraph 321, it is said: 

""There is set out, hereunder, the features which give rise to establishing, with respect, the ground that the conviction, was unsafe and unsatisfactory.""

168Thereafter, up to and including paragraph 348, are references, in summary form, to evidence given by GB, both in chief and in cross-examination. I can only assume that the intention behind this summary of evidence was to draw attention to inadequacies in GB's evidence. However, they include such mysteries as:

""331 [GB] agreed that the contents of the third Statement were true. However, there was no acknowledgement that anything that he said in the statement was true and correct and he would be liable for prosecution if he wilfully stated anything he knows to be false.""

169The third ""statement"" was the document prepared by GB of his own volition, recording, for his own purposes, the allegations he made against the appellant. GB said that he made that document available to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Just what point is sought to be made by pointing out the absence of an acknowledgement of the kind mentioned is completely obscure. 

170At paragraphs 341 and 343, the following appears:

""341 [GB] agreed that his state of mind was such that because the Applicant (sic) was in close proximity of the tractor that he had driven the tractor in to the trench. [GB] gave this evidence ...

'Q. Now I want to put to you that the Applicant did not drive the tractor into the trench?
A I didn't actually say that he did.'

343 ... [GB] agreed that he had given evidence to the effect that his recollection as to the timing of the incident in the early afternoon was indeed a 'feeling'. [GB] asserts that it was about 1 o'clock when he came across the Applicant. 

171The entirety of the written submissions in relation to GB's allegations extracted passages of his evidence. It did no more.

172It may be that the intention behind making these references was to contrast the evidence given by GB with evidence given by the appellant and other witnesses. However, no attempt was made to do so, and no references were given to any conflicting evidence. Indeed, despite the fact that, beside the appellant, 18 witnesses were called in the defence case, virtually no mention was made of any evidence given by those witnesses. 

173Paragraphs 349-393 consisted of references to the evidence given by TE. For example, the following appears:

""378 [TE] made an allegation that he was on detention in May 1989. He was unaware that the behavioural school committee suggested to him that in May 1989 the weather in Bathurst was extremely cold. In fact, there would be no raking of any grass at that time of year. His Honour agreed to this. He agreed that the grass would have been cut by the device behind the tractor put to him the grass was mulched. He agreed with this. 

In the presence of Brother Dwyer at Brother Elrott's Shed

379 According to [TE] Brother Dwyer was somehow present outside the shed when he was taking the rake down to Mr Sweetman. The tale is that the Applicant came across him and in turn Brother Dwyer was involved. Brother Dwyer gave evidence that at no time did he come across [TE] or the Applicant as alleged by [TE]. 

Deadlocking of the door

380 According to [TE], the Applicant unlocked the door to Brother Elrott's shed and then deadlocked the door from the inside. It was clearly suggested to [TE] that Brother Elrott's shed had a Judas door which could only be opened by a key. I would agree with this. He was shown a photograph but would not agree nor when shown a photograph of the inside of the door of the shed that it could have been deadlocked:

'I am not even agreeing that that was the actual door of Brother Elrott's shed at all, and ... photographs clearly established there was a Judas door with a rocking mechanism off the door.'

Industrial lubricant

381 [TE] gave evidence that the Applicant had imposed next to an item of machinery and then used industrial lubricant to perpetrate an act of anal intercourse with him. The likelihood that the Applicant would use industrial lubricant to perpetrate such an act is utter nonsense. 

...

385 [with reference to the evidence of TE concerning his conversation with Matron Clark] ... It is suggested that the Matron was so dedicated they would make such remarks. Judge Cogswell permitted each of the Matrons to be cross-examined and that inconsistent evidence was replaced.""

174I extract these paragraphs, not because they stand out as difficult to understand but isolated passages in the submissions. Far from that, they are illustrative of the written submissions. They demonstrate the difficulty I have had in understanding the case sought to be made on behalf of the appellant. For this reason, during the hearing of the appeal, the appellant's solicitor was asked to identify the points he sought to make in order to establish that the verdicts were ""unsafe and unsatisfactory"". He first referred to paragraphs 107 and 108. I am quite unable to discern anything in those paragraphs that bear upon the reasonableness or otherwise of the guilty verdicts. 

175The legal representative then went on:

""Firstly, in respect of the complainant GB, was the feature of his evidence that commenced in the committal proceedings, that the incident did not occur in 1965, but occurred in 1966 and 1967. The timing issue ...

The second issue is that in respect of GB, on any view, notwithstanding the problem that he had so far as irritable bowel syndrome was concerned, that over a very lengthy period of time there was no complaints ...

Thirdly, that it was apparent that the motivation of GB in coming forward was to do with publicity, and in particular, his outrage, as my learned friend says in her submissions, at the temerity of lawyers defending members of the Order [of priests to which the appellant belonged]. 

Fourthly, that GB in the obvious circumstances where he was confronted with clear photographic evidence that the tractor incident had occurred in circumstances where the accused was not clothed with a white t-shirt and white shorts, for instance, he was in overalls, and Mr Scheppingen was present and so on, then came up with the contention under oath that there was another tractor incident. 

The third point is that GB had considerable animus or animosity towards not only the accused, he says because of what was done to him, but also to the school and the institution of the school. 

176The appellant's solicitor then referred to the two students nominated by GB as having been with him at the time he came across the tractor incident and the absence of support from those students. [PM gave evidence, that he could not recall ever having smoked with GB, and had only a vague recollection of the tractor incident. The other student, IS, had not been located.] 

177The solicitor then went on:

""There was just no evidence, for instance, that GB didn't even know the accused and the accused didn't know him. I don't know how to describe that, but there was no grooming or anything like that in relation to that particular complaint, no previous relationship.""

178It seems to me, from what has been extracted, that, so far as the conviction on count 1 is concerned, the matters sought to be raised are:

(i) ""the timing issue"" - that is, the year in which the tractor incident occurred; 

(ii) the absence of complaint by GB until 2007 or 2008;

(iii) the motivation of GB in making a complaint, it being suggested that he did so [dishonestly] out of hostility towards the appellant and to the college.

Resolution

179The task of an appellate court in determining a ground of appeal that a verdict is unreasonable was established in M v The Queen (and re-stated in a number of cases thereafter) as follows (at p 493):

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations."" (internal citations omitted)

This has been affirmed in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400.

The timing issue

180Both in the cross-examination of GB and on the appeal, an inordinate amount of attention was paid to the year in which the tractor incident occurred. A great deal was sought to be made of GB's uncertainty on this question, and what was put as his fluctuating evidence about it. For example, initially he said that it did not occur in his first year at the college (1965); when cross examined about this, he said: 

""That's my belief, it wasn't 1965.""

181He agreed that it could have been 1966 or 1967. Later, still in cross-examination, it was put to him that the tractor incident occurred in November 1965 and not 1966 and not 1967. GB replied:

""If you say that, Mr Walsh, and that is correct, I'll go along with that.""

182The following is recorded in the transcript:

Q. But you have given evidence today that it definitely did not occur in 1965?
A. Did I say definitely didn't?

Q. Yes, you did. It didn't occur in 1965.
A. Well, in that case, I've made a mistake haven't I?

Q. Well, are you now changing your evidence from 1967, 1966 to 1965. 
A. Well, I'm not changing my evidence, no, not all. I'm just saying that that was my recollection.""

It was then suggested to him that the incident occurred in November 1965 and not 1966 and not 1967. To which he replied:

""If that's what you're saying is correct, then I'll go along with that."" 

183So far as I can determine - and no alternative proposition was advanced - the only importance of the tractor incident was that GB associated it with the offence that he alleged the appellant committed against him. So far as can be gauged from the transcript, GB was willing to accommodate questions that proposed dates alternative to that he had initially suggested.

184The appellant himself did not give evidence of when the incident occurred. Its timing appeared to have been fixed on his behalf by reference to a school magazine (""the Echoes"") that made light of the incident. While, in the overall assessment of the credibility of GB, his various answers about the timing of the incident must be taken into account, the timing issue itself seems to me to be of no moment. 

185Facts that are uncontroversial are:


GB was a student at the college between 1965 and 1967; 
the appellant arrived at the college in late 1965; 
the appellant was involved in the construction of the swimming pool; 
a tractor slipped into a trench and could not be driven out; 
the appellant was involved in extricating the tractor from the trench.

Absence of complaint

186There is no mention in the written submissions of the absence of any complaint by GB. The first mention that I can find of that was made in response to the specific question asked by this court. Nor was there any cross examination of GB about the absence of complaint. 

187It has long been a matter of common knowledge that victims of childhood sexual abuse frequently do not make timely complaint of their treatment. GB gave evidence that the appellant told him to tell nobody, that if he did he would not be believed, and that he would be ill-treated by other students. In my opinion, the lack of complaint by GB until adulthood is of no weight in the assessment of this ground. 

Motivation

188Again, no mention was made in the written submissions of ill feeling towards the appellant or the school imputed to GB. Nor was there any mention of that subject in the cross examination of GB. The only relevant cross-examination followed GB volunteering that, while he was at the college, he had been hit on the head with a pointer by a science master, and flogged around the legs and the buttocks with a Bunsen burner hose. He was then asked if the way he was treated at the school was something he ""greatly resented"". He answered: 

""I wasn't real happy about it, that's a good way of putting it, yeah.""

Just what was referred to as GB's ""considerable animus or animosity"" towards the appellant and towards the college is obscure. 

189The above represents my analysis of the points identified as those on which the appellant relied. I am conscious that there were other issues in relation to GB's evidence. For example, his evidence was that the offence against him took place in the art room, which the appellant unlocked with a key that he had. There was evidence in the defence case from two former students (William Kelly and Allan Chapman) that the art room was always locked. The art teacher of the time, Mr Collins, confirmed in a record of interview that became an exhibit, that he had one of only two keys to the art room. The appellant said in his evidence that he did not know where the art room was and that he did not have a key. 

190With respect to the counts involving TE, the written submissions contained a very long list of ""bullet point"" topics, said to be indicative of the unreliability of TE. Some of these are:

"" the colour of the applicant's car;

 the location of the washing of the car;

...

 the likelihood of detection of any presence of pornography by a laundry or cleaning lady;

...

 inherent unlikelihood of the raking of grass on the oval in May 1989 at the College;

...

 there was no conversation between [TE] and Brother Dwyer about the allegations involving the applicant;

 that [TE] gave his evidence repeatedly in such a combative way when confronted with facts which clearly demonstrated his unreliability, he would not make any concession that he was wrong, and in the context of the McDonald's incident, the fact that the restaurant was not built at the time he alleges he was taken there by the applicant, he amounted it to being 'a load of crap'.""

These points were not further expanded.

191Again, I have been forced to attempt to discern what points are sought to be made on behalf of the appellant. 

192One of these clearly involved the alleged event that was the subject of count 2. That was the indecent assault said to have taken place when the appellant took TE to a local McDonald's restaurant. It was conceded on behalf of the Crown that the McDonald's restaurant in Bathurst did not open until later in the year than the date attributed by TE to the offence. 

193During the course of the summing up, the jury sent two notes with questions. The second, as read onto the transcript by Garling ADCJ, read:

""Charge 2 shall the jury consider location as H says the incident happened in Bathurst ie, if the jury finds that there's doubt about location does it mean it has to acquit on this charge?""

(What ""H"" refers to is unexplained.) The question suggests that the jury was alive to, and concerned with, the doubt about TE's evidence in this respect. The appellant was given the benefit of that doubt.

194Count 2 was one of the counts on which the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. This may well reflect the jury's concern about the timing or the location of the incident.

195One issue on which TE was extensively cross examined, and was the subject of evidence from the appellant, was his assertion that he had frequently visited the appellant in his room. TE was asked to draw a diagram showing the appellant's room. The appellant denied much of what was asserted by TE. For example, the appellant said that the room he occupied had five windows; TE drew in his diagram one or two windows. There was also an issue concerning what TE said was his reporting of some incident to either or both of the matrons at the College, and his evidence that he was advised to ""stop putting things up my bum"" and to purchase some women's panty liners to stop the flow of blood. Both matrons denied having heard of any such complaint or having given such advice. The submission made in this respect was that TE's evidence was so unlikely as to be implausible. 

196Another disputed matter concerned the circumstances in which TE left the College. He said that he had been expelled; Brother Dwyer, who had been the Principal of the college, said that he had not been expelled. TE's father, GE, said:

""We was told that [TE] wasn't to come back. So he was expelled.""

He said that it was Brother Dwyer who had told him that. 

197The tape-recorded telephone conversations of the appellant after his arrest give considerable credence to the evidence of TE and his father. Indeed, the appellant said that he had believed that TE was expelled. This is an issue of little moment, except that it significantly supports the general credibility of TE.

198The evidence of TE and the evidence of the appellant were in conflict in a significant number of matters of detail. It is of considerable importance that TE was cross-examined, unequivocally to the effect that his evidence was deliberately false. So much was expressly acknowledged on the hearing of the appeal. What the jury, therefore, had to weigh were the appellant's denials, together with his challenge to TE's evidence on matters of detail, against the evidence of TE, who refuted virtually all of those challenges. In this case, the jury was uniquely placed to assess the credibility of the witnesses. It may well be that they considered that any failure of TE in his recollection of the number of windows in the appellant's room to be of no moment. Alternatively, they may have accepted TE's evidence and disbelieved the appellant. It was fully open to them to do so. Generally, the matters of detail were not matters that in any way bore upon the core allegations. There was, throughout the cross-examination of TE, an explicit suggestion that the room he described was the room of Brother Elrott. However, there was, and could have been, no suggestion that TE was mistaken, and that Brother Elrott was the perpetrator of the offences he alleged. Brother Elrott, it will be recalled, was seriously disabled. In any event, mistaken attribution of the offences was no part of, and was inconsistent with, the defence strategy. 

199I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt on all of the counts of which he was convicted. Moreover, having studied the evidence in some considerable detail, I experience no doubt of the appellant's guilt.

200In my opinion, ground 3 should be rejected.

201It follows that, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed. The order I propose is:

(1) Appeal against conviction dismissed.

Introduction

202HALL J: The appellant, JG, appeals his conviction on six counts following a jury trial in 2013 before Acting Judge Garling in the District Court. The jury at his first trial before Cogswell DCJ was discharged in July 2012, when they were unable to agree as to any of the counts with which he had been charged. 

203The indictment alleged offences by the appellant against two complainants, GB and TE. There were in all 13 counts in the indictment (some pleaded in the alternative). The jury returned guilty verdicts in respect of six counts (Count 1 in relation to GB and Counts, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 12 in relation to TE). Counts 6, 8, 11 and 13 were pleaded in the alternative to some of the above counts and therefore verdicts were not required on those counts. A not guilty verdict was returned in respect of Count 9 and the jury were unable to reach a verdict in respect of Counts 2 and 3.

204The appellant was sentenced on 17 June 2013 to an overall sentence of 7 years 6 months with an overall non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to expire on 21 September 2017. There is no application for leave to appeal against sentence.

Grounds of Appeal 

205In the Notice of Appeal filed on 9 September 2013 the appellant relied upon six grounds in support of the appeal against conviction as follows:

""1. The learned Trial Judge erred in refusing an Application pursuant to s 130A Criminal Procedure Act in respect of separate trials of the counts in the indictment relating to [GB] and [TE].

2. The Trial Judge erred in refusing an Application pursuant to s 130A(a) Criminal Procedure Act as to tendency and coincidence evidence relied upon by the Crown.

3. The conviction of the appellant was unsafe and unsatisfactory.

4. His Honour erred by permitting the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine Matron Clarke as to ""masking"" symptomatology relating to [TE].

5. That a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the Crown Prosecutor being permitted to cross-examine the Accused contrary to Palmer v R.

6. The learned Trial Judge erred in refusing an application for a permanent stay of the Indictment in respect of [GB].""

Ground 1: The trial judge erred in refusing an Application pursuant to s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act in respect of separate trials of the counts in the indictment relating to GB and TE

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in refusing an Application pursuant to s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act as to tendency and coincidence evidence relied upon by the Crown

206It is convenient to address Grounds 1 and 2 together.

The Counts in the Indictment

207On 11 February 2013, the appellant was indicted before Garling A-DCJ at the Sydney District Court. He entered not guilty pleas to all counts.

208The indictment presented at the second trial was in the same terms as that left to the jury in the first trial, with the exception of Count 1 being amended (as to the commencement date of the period referred to in Count 1) during the course of the first trial. That is a matter discussed below.

209The counts in the indictment concerning the two complainants, GB and TE, were in the following terms:

(2) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did assault TE, and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency upon TE, a person then under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years and under the authority of JG, contrary to s 61E(1A) of the Crimes Act.

(3) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did assault TE, and at the time of the assault did commit an act of indecency upon TE, a person then under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years and under the authority of JG, contrary to s 61E(1A) of the Crimes Act.

(4) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did commit an act of indecency towards TE, a person then under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years and under the authority of JG, contrary to s 61E(2A) of the Crimes Act.

(5) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, without the consent of TE and knowing he was not consenting, contrary to s 61D(1A) of the Crimes Act.

(6) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act. 

(7) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, without the consent of TE and knowing he was not consenting, contrary to s 61D(1A) of the Crimes Act.

(8) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act.

(9) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did assault TE, contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act. 

(10) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, without the consent of TE and knowing he was not consenting, contrary to s 61D(1A) of the Crimes Act.

(11) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act.

(12) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, without the consent of TE and knowing he was not consenting, contrary to s 61D(1A) of the Crimes Act.

(13) Between 1 February 1989 and 31 December 1989, at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales, did have sexual intercourse with TE, a person above the age of ten years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years, and under the authority of JG, contrary to s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act.

Coincidence and Tendency Notices

210On 19 April 2012 the Crown served notices under ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act 1995. 

(a) The Coincidence Notice

211The Crown served a Coincidence Evidence Notice pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act dated 19 April 2012.

212The Coincidence Notice referred to evidence intended to be adduced by the Crown as to ""two or more events"" the subject of a number of statements, including statements of GB dated 23 September 2008 and TE dated 7 November 2009.

213The evidence was to be adduced to prove that the appellant did numerous specified acts in relation to, inter alia, both complainants GB and TE. Those included that the appellant:


Had penile anal intercourse with GB. 
Had penile anal intercourse with TE. 
Showed TE homosexual pornographic videos.

214The evidence was also to be adduced to prove that the appellant:


Engaged in sexual activity with 12-15 year old boys; 
Used his position of authority to obtain access to 12-15 year old boys so that he could engage in sexual activity with them. 
Had a particular state of mind, namely, to have a sexual interest in 12-15 year old boys.

215In paragraph [2] of the Notice the relevant ""events"" were identified. In section C of paragraph [2] reference was made to ""events"" referred to in particular paragraphs of the statement of a witness (who may be identified by the initials JF) and in the statement of the complainant TE. It was stated in respect thereto:

""The evidence is to be tendered to prove that [the appellant] showed homosexual pornographic videos and magazines to [TE].""

216In paragraph [2]D the ""events"" in question were identified by paragraph numbers in statements of coincidence witnesses and in the statement of TE. Again, it was noted:

""The evidence is to be tendered to prove that [the appellant] showed homosexual pornographic videos and magazines to [TE].""

(b) The Tendency Notice

217The Tendency Notice pursuant to s 97 of the Evidence Act sought to prove that the appellant had the following tendencies:

(1) To have a sexual interest in 12-15 year old boys.

(2) To engage in sexual activities with 12-15 year old boys.

(3) To use his position of authority to obtain access to 12-15 year old boys so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

(4) To have a sexual interest in young males.

218The tendency evidence was said to be relevant to the following facts in issue (only the identified facts in the notice relating to the complainants GB and TE are reproduced below, not those identified in respect of four other named complainants)

""(a) Whether the [Appellant] had penile anal intercourse with [GB].
(b) Whether the [Appellant] restrained [GB] when having penile anal intercourse with him.
...
(f) Whether the [Appellant] touched [TE's] groin.
(g) Whether the [Appellant] touched [TE's] bare chest.
(h) Whether the [Appellant] showed [TE] heterosexual pornographic videos.
(i) Whether the [Appellant] showed [TE] homosexual pornographic videos.
(j) Whether the [Appellant] gave [TE] money
(k) Whether the [Appellant] showed [TE] videos depicting a young male fellating an adult male.
(l) Whether the [Appellant] showed [TE] a movie depicting an adult male having penile anal intercourse with a young male.
(m) Whether the [Appellant] showed [TE] his erect penis.
(n) Whether the [Appellant] asked [TE] if he had an erection.
(o) Whether the [Appellant] masturbated in the presence of [TE].
(p) Whether the [Appellant] told [TE] to look at him when he was masturbating.
(q) Whether the [Appellant] fellated [TE].
(r) Whether the [Appellant] asked [TE] to fellate him.
(s) Whether [TE] masturbated the [Appellant].
(t) Whether the [Appellant] put his finger in [TE's] anus.
(u) Whether the [Appellant] had penile anal intercourse with [TE].
(v) Whether the [Appellant] forced [TE] to fellate him.
(w) Whether the [Appellant] held [TE] down when having penile anal intercourse with him.
...""

Proceedings before Cogswell DCJ

219In the previous trial of the counts on the indictment, Cogswell DCJ heard and determined a number of pre-trial issues. The application heard by Cogswell DCJ sought the separation of counts involving various complainants and rulings as to the admissibility of the evidence of various tendency and coincidence witnesses. His Honour conducted a voir dire examination between 14 May 2012 and 22 May 2012. The prosecution in the course of the inquiry called evidence in order to establish the nature and extent of any risk of concoction or collusion between the complainants and the tendency witnesses. 

220On 23 May 2012, Cogswell DCJ delivered judgment on the voir dire issues that his Honour was required to determine. These centred around the admissibility of tendency and coincidence evidence. At that time the prosecution had presented an indictment containing fifteen counts concerning four complainants. 

221Cogswell DCJ ruled that the evidence of the tendency witness, who may here be referred to as JR, was inadmissible. His Honour severed the counts relating to two complainants who may here be referred to as R and C. His Honour ordered that there be a joint trial involving the complainants GB and TE.

222His Honour noted that, in assessing the probative value of the evidence which the Crown proposed to adduce, Mr Walsh asked him to take into account the good deal of media publicity that surrounded the arrest and charging of the appellant and another person associated with the same school at which the acts relating to the counts on the indictment were said to have taken place.

The Issue of Contamination or Concoction

223Having regard to the issues raised by Mr Walsh in the appeal proceedings, I set out below, in summary form, certain of the observations and findings of Cogswell DCJ on the issue of contamination and concoction.

224His Honour noted:

""... [Mr Walsh] asks me to take into account that publicity, any contact between the former pupils, any ill feeling which the former pupils may have towards his client as well as the circumstances in which they gave their statements to the police. Those factors, Mr Walsh argues, may be relevant to the question whether the evidence of those witnesses might have become contaminated, either by concoction or in some other way."" (at [35])

225In relation to the complainant GB, his Honour noted that GB had not discussed what had happened to him with any former pupils up until the time he gave his statement to police. His Honour also noted that he had spent a good deal of time outside the State. As to media publicity, GB's evidence was that he saw something on television, but apart from that, he did not read any other material before making his statement to the police.

226So far as information that GB may have gained from the internet, it was noted that it was only in the last two years (that is, before the voir dire) that he had become familiar with using the internet and his Honour accepted that he could not have used it before giving his statement to the police.

227GB had acknowledged that the story was ""all over the media back home"" in his regional city. His wife had kept articles for him to read when he got back after he had been away.

228Cogswell DCJ noted that what prompted GB to come forward was seeing Mr Walsh being interviewed on the television. That angered him because he said that Mr Walsh was describing the events as a ""witch hunt"" and GB's view was that the events did in fact happen and what Mr Walsh was saying should not be said: at [37].

229GB denied having seen an article that was shown to him by Mr Walsh called ""Darker Secrets"".

230GB acknowledged, frankly, his Honour noted, that he had no affection whatsoever for the appellant, but when pressed about why that was, he made it clear that that was because ""I was raped by him in the classroom"": at [37].

231Cogswell DCJ stated that in his opinion there was no real chance that GB's evidence had been relevantly concocted. He noted that that was because of the limited discussion he had had with fellow pupils or former pupils and also because of his limited means of access to the internet. He noted that he had not seen one of the articles that Mr Walsh had shown him and his motivation was as stated above: at [39].

232In relation to the complainant TE, Cogswell DCJ noted that he had been examined ""... in all four areas of possible contamination"": at [44]. His Honour noted:


That TE had not discussed anything about what had happened to him whilst he was at school, nor was he told about any inappropriate things by other boys at school.


He had not maintained contact with former schoolmates after leaving school.


His statement was made to police on 7 November 2008, a couple of months after the appellant was arrested. He had heard a radio broadcast which was ""how I initially found out about it"". He did pay, he acknowledged ""particular attention that night to see what the go was on television"" but he did not take the effort to go ""looking it up or anything like that"": at [44].

233The first time that TE saw anything on the television was the same night that he had heard the radio broadcast in the morning. He remembered seeing a picture of one of the other members of staff and heard the appellant's name mentioned in the broadcast, but did not recall any image of the appellant.

234As to access to the internet, TE acknowledged that he had used the internet in a very limited way ""only in the last six months"": at [44].

235TE's evidence was that he had not looked anything up on the internet concerning the appellant, that he did not know how to and nor did he have a friend or anyone look it up for him.

236TE acknowledged that he was accused of stealing by the appellant and as a result he was expelled from the school. He said that he did not entertain any hostility against the appellant in relation to what he regarded as the false allegations from the appellant about him setting fires ""but I certainly have some hostility for what he did to me as a student there"": at [44].

237What TE regarded as the false accusations were, TE considered, ""just his scapegoat of me opening my mouth about what was happening"".

238Cogswell DCJ concluded that the prosecution had satisfied him that there was no real chance of any relevant contamination so far as TE was concerned. His Honour observed that TE's hostility towards the appellant was directly related to the incidents which he said occurred to him by the appellant. He noted that his internet access was extremely limited as was his access to former students: at [45].

239The provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 in relation to the power to order separate trials are contained in s 21(2)(a) and (b).

240Applications under s 21(2)(a) and (b) may arise in a variety of circumstances. They include cases where tendency evidence is relied upon at a trial where the allegations involve offences against two or more complainants. Section 101 of the Evidence Act provides that tendency evidence about an accused relied upon by the prosecution cannot be used against the accused unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the accused. In Hoch v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 292, the High Court's observations, though related to ""similar facts"" at common law, provide guidance in a case such as the present in relation to coincidence evidence under s 98 where concoction or collusion arose for consideration: 

""...that to determine the admissibility of similar fact evidence the trial judge must apply the same test as a jury must apply in dealing with circumstantial evidence, and ask whether there is a rational view of the evidence that is inconsistent with the guilt of the accused.

...

""In cases where there is a possibility of joint concoction there is another rational view of the evidence. That rational view - viz. joint concoction - is inconsistent both with the guilt of the accused person and with the improbability of the complainants having concocted similar lies. It thus destroys the probative value of the evidence which is a condition precedent to its admissibility.

Thus, in our view, the admissibility of similar fact evidence in cases such as the present depends on that evidence having the quality that it is not reasonably explicable on the basis of concoction. That is a matter to be determined, as in all cases of circumstantial evidence, in the light of common sense and experience. It is not a matter that necessarily involves an examination on a voir dire. If the depositions of witnesses in committal proceedings or the statements of witnesses indicate that the witnesses had no relationship with each other prior to the making of the various complaints, and that is unchallenged, then, assuming the requisite degree of similarity, common sense and experience will indicate that the evidence bears that probative force which renders it admissible. On the other hand, if the depositions or the statements indicate that the complainants have a sufficient relationship to each other and had opportunity and motive for concoction then, as a matter of common sense and experience, the evidence will lack the degree of probative value necessary to render it admissible. Of course there may be cases where an examination on the voir dire is necessary, but that will be for the purpose of ascertaining the facts relevant to the circumstances of the witnesses to permit an assessment of the probative value of the evidence by reference to the consideration whether, in the light of common sense and experience, it is capable of reasonable explanation on the basis of concoction. It will not be for the purpose of the trial judge making a preliminary finding whether there was or was not concoction."" (at [9]-[11])

241The findings of Cogswell DCJ in relation to the issues of contamination and concoction accordingly support or confirm that the evidence of GB and TE had the probative force which rendered the same admissible, assuming that the provisions of ss 98 and 101 were otherwise satisfied.

Coincidence and Tendency Evidence

242His Honour then analysed the coincidence evidence and the tendency evidence at [49]-[84].

243It is clear that the trial judge's findings on the admission of tendency and coincidence evidence would have a significant influence on the outcome of the separate trial application. If the challenge to the evidence were unsuccessful, there would be less basis for ordering separate trials, a position that arose in R v Daley [2001] NSWSC 1211 at [3]. If the opposite were the case, the exclusion of the tendency or coincidence evidence in relation to one or the other complainants (that is, GB or TE), the case for separating the trials would be stronger.

244In relation to the coincidence evidence, his Honour noted that that evidence concerned allegations of penile/anal intercourse made by GB and TE. 

245The coincidence evidence also concerned claims by TE that the appellant showed him what were regarded as homosexual pornographic videos and magazines.

246His Honour observed that when the appellant was arrested in 2008, police found certain DVDs and magazines depicting homosexual sex in his possession. The prosecution wished to tender that material to support TE's claim that he was shown such things by the appellant.

247He noted that the evidence sought to be adduced was directed to proving that each event was not just an isolated one-off or a coincidental occurrence that may never have occurred at all or may have been misunderstood. The fact that they were similar events pointed to the appellant doing them deliberately. The fact that they were similar complaints pointed, the prosecution argued, to the unlikelihood that those complaints were untrue.

248As to the tendency evidence, the Crown wished to prove that the appellant had a tendency to act in a particular way in two areas, and had a particular state of mind in two areas. These were identified in the Tendency Notice dated 19 April 2012.

249The two areas where the prosecution claimed the appellant had a tendency to act in a particular way were to engage in sexual activities with 12-15 year old boys and to use his position of authority to obtain access to boys in that age range so that he could engage in sexual activities with them.

250His Honour then proceeded to analyse the relevance and the probative strength of the coincidence and tendency evidence. He separately analysed the issue of prejudicial effect and, with one stated exception, his Honour concluded that the probative value of the proposed tendency and coincidence evidence substantially outweighed any risk of unfair prejudice to the appellant. His Honour emphasised that he expressed that opinion having regard to the directions that would be given to the jury: at [77].

251His Honour separately noted that a submission had been made by Mr Walsh that the gap in time between GB's allegation and the other allegations was significant. His Honour stated:

""... I do not regard it as so significant that it deprives the evidence of its significant probative value. It is still an extraordinary thing for two boys to claim that a member of staff at the school anally penetrated them ..."" (at [87])

252Finally, his Honour concluded that the magazines and DVDs had significant probative value as coincidence evidence. His Honour noted that what would obviously occupy the minds of jurors was the likelihood (in considering whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt) of a religious brother at the school showing homosexual videos, pornographic or not, to one of the pupils at the school. The location or finding of such DVDs or other material in the possession of the appellant ""at the time of his arrest was relevant to the jury's assessment of that likelihood"": at [89].

Decision

253The assessment of the coincidence and tendency evidence by Cogswell DCJ required a consideration of the tests of admissibility for such evidence imposed by ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act. In general, such evidence is not to be admitted unless either alone or in conjunction with other evidence adduced or to be adduced, it would, in the opinion of the court, have significant probative value.

254""Significant"", as his Honour noted, is to be interpreted as meaning ""important"" or ""of consequence"": Re Lockyer (1996) 89 A Crim R 457, approved in R v PWD (2010) 205 A Crim R 75. In order to determine the significance of the coincidence and tendency evidence, the trial judge in this case was required to give consideration to the fact or facts relevant to the facts in issue in the proceedings and to which the evidence was directed.

255His Honour referred to Mr Walsh's contention that the relevant fact in issue was ""whether [the appellant] engaged at all in the conduct alleged against him"": at 33. Cogswell DCJ stated that he was prepared to accept that as ""a composite representation of the facts in issue in this case"".

256Whilst his Honour did not analyse all of the discrete factual circumstances in relation to the sexual assaults alleged by GB and TE, ""relevant"" facts going to the facts in issue, may be considered to include at least the following:

(1) The location of the alleged sexual assaults concerning GB and TE, namely, on the school premises.

(2) The age of GB and TE as at the time of the alleged assaults.

(3) Their positions at the school, namely, as young teenage students (in the age range 13-15 years.)

(4) The actions/conduct of the appellant as described by GB in relation to the offence the subject of Count 1, and as described by TE in relation to the offences of sexual intercourse contrary to s 66(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, the subject of Counts 7, 10 and 12, involving physical force and restraint by the appellant.

(5) The appellant's position of authority over TE at the time of the alleged offences, and, so far as GB was concerned, the appellant's position as staff member

257The above factual matters may be considered in the determination of the existence of similar facts for the purpose of s 98 of the Evidence in proof of the particular sexual assaults, anal/penile penetration, as alleged by GB and TE.

258On the pre-trial application Cogswell DCJ had evidentiary statements of tendency witnesses in respect of the period between GB's and TE's attendance at the school relating to the appellant's conduct and his state of mind in displaying a sexual interest in young adolescent males.

259As his Honour observed, the relevant coincidence evidence related to two matters, the allegations of penile-anal intercourse made by GB and TE and additionally the claims made by TE that the appellant had showed him homosexual pornographic videos and magazines.

260His Honour concluded that the coincidence and tendency evidence proposed to be called had significant probative value, noting that an issue would be the likelihood that the appellant as a member of a religious order would engage in sexual activity with a teenage pupil. Accounts, his Honour observed, ""given by others of such activities having taken place, if accepted beyond reasonable doubt could well be regarded as evidence of importance or of consequence"": at 63.

261The tendency and coincidence evidence, in my assessment, was of a nature and quality to support the trial judge's determination that it possessed significant probative value within the meaning of ss 97 and 98 of the Evidence Act. Additionally, the probative force or strength of the coincidence evidence relating to the sexual assaults alleged by GB and TE was reinforced by the trial judge's finding that there was no real chance of contamination. I note, in this respect, that GB and TE gave evidence on the voir dire.

262In assessing the coincidence and tendency evidence Cogswell DCJ gave detailed consideration to the matters the subject of the evidence proposed to be adduced by the Crown in determining the issues of probative value and prejudicial effect and in the application of the provisions of s 101 of the Evidence Act.

263On the issue of the admissibility of the pornographic materials seized by police, Cogswell DCJ, properly, in my opinion, accepted that such evidence was admissible under s 98 in relation to the count concerning TE based upon TE's allegation that the appellant showed him pornographic materials. No error has, in my opinion, been established with respect to his Honour's determination on the admissibility of the coincidence and tendency evidence.

264In assessing the issue of prejudice for the purpose of ss 97, 98 and 101, his Honour gave consideration to the matters raised on behalf of the appellant, including, in particular the issue of delay and consequential matters. Whilst his Honour did not in express terms refer to the particular impact of delay on recollections, the loss or absence of evidence through the death or other unavailability of witnesses or arising by reason of other circumstances, it is clear that his Honour was conscious of the delay and its relevance. His Honour noted in this respect that the delay was not significant enough to deprive the proposed evidence of its significant probative value: at 87. The potential disadvantageous effect of such matters upon the appellant and the necessity for proper and strong trial directions were plainly given appropriate attention by his Honour in the assessment of the admissibility of the proposed evidence and the significance of that in determining the application.

265In my opinion, I do not consider that Cogswell DCJ erred in the determination of the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence. 

266As earlier indicated, this was a case, in my opinion, where the outcome of the separate trial application would be determined by the decision to be made on the coincidence and tendency evidence. On the basis of the orders in favour of the admissibility of such evidence, as discussed above, there was, in my assessment, no error in Cogswell DCJ having refused the separate trial application.

Pre-Trial Hearing: The Second Trial

267On 13 February 2013, and prior to the empanelment of the jury for the second trial, the appellant sought to have, in effect, a redetermination of the previous orders made by his Honour Judge Cogswell.

268The application was made by way of Notice of Motion in which a number of orders were sought, including:

(i) A permanent stay order of the proceedings on the single count concerning complainant GB, being Count 1 on the indictment.

(ii) Orders excluding material seized by police upon the arrest of the appellant.

(iii) An order concerning good character.

(iv) An order relating to sexual assault.

269The Notice of Motion was supported by the affidavit of Gregory Walsh, solicitor, sworn on 24 January 2013, a copy of which is in the Appellant's Tender Bundle at Tab 13.

270Grounds 1 and 2 of the present appeal concern the refusal of Garling A-DCJ, in effect, to reconsider the pre-trial orders made by Cogswell DCJ as to:

(i) The order refusing the application for separate trials relating to GB and TE; and

(ii) The order as to the admissibility of the tendency and coincidence evidence.

271The application for the above orders proceeded under s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, the terms of which are set out below.

272His Honour Garling A-DCJ ultimately determined that he was bound by the rulings made by Cogswell DCJ and, applying the provisions of s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act, he determined that it was not in the interests of justice for the orders made by Cogswell DCJ to be other than binding. His Honour also declined to make an order staying the proceedings on Count 1.

Tendency and Coincidence Evidence

273The bases upon which the admissibility of the tendency/coincidence evidence was challenged before Cogswell DCJ were identified in paragraph [32] of the Appellant's Written Submissions as:

""(i) The lack of degree of similarity between the alleged conduct on the various occasions.

(ii) The lack of degree of similarity of the circumstances in which the alleged conduct took place.

(iii) The degree of concoction and contamination of the proposed tendency/coincidence evidence.""

274In the Appellant's Written Submissions criticism was directed to an alleged failure by Cogswell DCJ to consider the evidence of GB and TE ""in the context of significant probative value"": Paragraphs [304]-[307].

275The submission was made that neither Cogswell DCJ nor Garling A-DCJ dealt with the issue of ""significant"" probative value by considering the evidence of GB and TE: at [307].

276The Crown disputed these contentions. In its written submissions at [27] the Crown observed:

""Judge Cogswell considered in detail the evidence supporting the tendency and coincidence notices and considered whether that evidence was capable of establishing the asserted tendencies or coincidences. Having carefully identified and analysed all of the relevant evidence Judge Cogswell determined that the evidence had significant probative value and that probative value substantially outweighed any risk of unfair prejudice."" (at [27])

277The additional evidence relied upon by the appellant before Garling A-DCJ to that which had been placed before Cogswell DCJ included the evidence given at the first trial relating to Count 1 concerning GB. In summary, the affidavit evidence of Mr Walsh included the following matters:


The matters principally recorded in GB's statements including the years of his school attendances, ""the tractor incident"", and disclosures by GB years later: affidavit at paragraphs [156]-[176].


The evidence of GB on the voir dire before Cogswell DCJ: affidavit at paragraphs [177]-[185].


The evidence of GB at the first trial: affidavit at paragraph [186].

278Particular matters identified as arising in the first trial in the cross-examination of GB related to the following:


GB's evidence that the two right wheels of the tractor were stuck in the trench. In the committal proceedings he said it was the two left wheels: at [217].


GB only recalled the names of the students he thought were with him at the tractor for the first time at the committal - he had earlier told police he could not recall their names: at [209] and [287]-[291].


The photograph Exhibit 1 revealed that the appellant was not wearing a white shirt as GB had told police: at [230].


That he recalled the assault took place when it was very hot, about one o'clock in the afternoon, but this was only based on a ""feeling"" he had: at [233], [304]-[305].


GB changed his evidence to agree that the assault occurred in 1965 a year he rejected as the relevant year at the committal: [282].


Medical evidence as to GB's medical problems: at [252] and [256]-[272], including that of Dr John Albert Roberts at [254] (on the issue of ""recovered memory"").

279In the appellant's written submissions in this Court at [49] it was observed that GB's ""... recollection of the alleged sexual assault by the applicant specifically hinges on the Tractor Incident"". (emphasis in original)

280Additional matters relied upon in the Appellant's Written Submissions at [310]-[312] that were said to undermine Cogswell DCJ's finding as to there having been no real chance of GB's evidence being concocted, included:


The period of approximately 42 years before GB contacted police;


The contact with police occurred after extraordinary publicity in respect of the appellant and other members of the religious order at the College.


The considerable anger and hostility of GB to public remarks made by the appellant's legal representative and the former President of the College.


That GB had displayed considerable ""animus"" towards the appellant and his legal representative.


That one of the two witnesses to the tractor incident nominated by the appellant did not give evidence. (The other person GB nominated as a witness to the tractor incident could not be identified by police).


During the trial GB gave evidence of having had a very difficult time at the College and of having been ""flogged"". He had enormous hostility to the College and its religious staff and boarders.

281The application before Garling A-DCJ sought:

(i) A ruling under s 130A.

(ii) The exclusion of the coincidence evidence relating to the items seized upon arrest. 

(iii) A stay on the count relating to GB (effectively removing GB as a tendency and coincidence witness as to the counts involving TE). 

282Section 130A is in the following terms:


130A Pre-trial orders and orders made during trial bind trial Judge

(1) A pre-trial order made by a Judge in proceedings on indictment is binding on the trial Judge in those proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.

(2) If, on an appeal against a conviction for an offence in proceedings on indictment, a new trial is ordered, a pre-trial order made by a Judge, or an order made by the trial Judge, in relation to the proceedings from which the conviction arose is binding on the trial Judge hearing the fresh trial proceedings unless:

(a) in the opinion of the trial Judge hearing the fresh trial proceedings, it would not be in the interests of justice for that order to be binding, or
(b) that order is inconsistent with an order made on appeal.

(3) If proceedings on indictment before a trial Judge are discontinued for any reason, a pre-trial order made by a Judge, or an order made by the trial Judge, in relation to those proceedings is binding on a trial Judge hearing any subsequent trial proceedings relating to the same offence as the discontinued proceedings unless, in the opinion of the trial Judge hearing the subsequent trial proceedings, it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding.

(4) In this section, pre-trial order means any order made after the indictment is first presented but before the empanelment of a jury for a trial. (emphasis added)

283Accordingly, Garling A-DCJ was required to determine whether ""it would not be in the interests of justice for that order[s] [made by Cogswell DCJ] to be binding"".

284On 13 February 2013, the trial judge, Garling A-DCJ, concluded:

""As I see the position, his Honour had before him a significant amount of evidence. His Honour, in a lengthy judgment covering a number of matters, obviously gave careful consideration to the point it is sought to re-argue. When I am looking at section 130A I do not consider it on the basis that one of the parties may not agree with his Honour's ruling or that I, indeed, may have reached a different conclusion. The section of the Act is in place for a purpose and that is that pre-trial orders or orders in another trial made by another judge, the trial Judge, cannot be re-argued except in exceptional circumstances.

""It seems to me that his Honour fully considered the decision he reached and that the difference between what he may have been considering then and what perhaps, if he was sitting here today with additional material considering it, it would mean that his Honour would be looking at what often happens in trials, that is, there is significant argument as to a witness's accuracy, reliability and other matters of that nature. They are dealt with at a trial by a jury. I have concluded, having looked at all those matters quite rightly raised, that this is not a matter in which I could rule that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding. The case, of course, went before a jury. It was heard on the basis of the current indictment and the jury could not reach a conclusion on any of the charges. It seems to me that the trial proceeded in what I would have thought is a normal way and the jury did not reach a conclusion which we see from time to time. I cannot make any other finding than that I am bound by section 130A in relation to the first of these matters."" (T 3-4, 13 February 2013)

Submissions

285The appellant submitted on this appeal that Garling A-DCJ fell into error in his Honour's approach to s 130A and, in that respect, relied upon the following four matters:

(1) His Honour applied a test of ""exceptional circumstances"" which was not the appropriate test under s 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act.

(2) His Honour failed to properly consider the detailed matters raised in support of the application, especially in the context of GB as to his evidence at the first trial. 

(3) His Honour failed to properly consider coincidence evidence, especially that relating to GB and TE.

(4) His Honour failed to properly consider the coincidence evidence in the materials found in the possession of the appellant upon his arrest on 3 September 2008.

286It was contended for the appellant that his Honour failed to properly give detailed consideration to the ""additional body of evidence directly relevant to whether the Crown ought to be permitted to rely upon tendency and coincidence evidence"": Appellant's Written Submissions at [317].

287The written submissions for the appellant set out a detailed analysis of the relevant facts and issues arising with extracts from the trial transcript and references to relevant authorities. I do not mean any disrespect to Mr Walsh in not referring in detail to all of those submissions in this judgment. I have, of course, closely considered all written and oral submissions made on behalf of the appellant and the Crown.

288In relation to the ""exceptional circumstances"" ground referred to in (1) above, it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the trial judge applied a much more stringent test than that which the statute specifically required. It was observed that s 130A does not refer to a test of ""exceptional circumstances"", but rather, the test is expressed in terms of whether ""it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding"". The words ""interests of justice"", it was submitted, are words having the widest possible reference and they enliven a discretionary judgment. The words also incorporate, it was contended, as a paramount consideration, that an accused person should have a fair trial: Appellant's Written Submissions at [315].

289In relation to the issues referred to in (2) and (3) above (at [285]), it was submitted for the appellant that the trial judge was in error in failing to have regard to the evidence of GB and TE in the context of considering the need for the evidence to have ""significant probative value"" under the Evidence Act. It was additionally submitted that (a) there was a large body of evidence that went to the risk of concoction and contamination, and (b) that the tendency witnesses had animus towards both the appellant and the school: Appellant's Written Submissions at [317]. 

290In relation to (4) above (at [285]), in respect of the materials seized on 3 September 2008, it was submitted for the appellant that Garling A-DCJ failed to give proper consideration to the evidence given in the first trial of the appellant and other defence witnesses and place ""in proper context his [the appellant's] possession of those materials"": Appellant's Written Submissions at [318]. The latter evidence included the appellant's volunteer work with HIV/AIDS sufferers and his explanation for possessing the pornographic materials. It was submitted this evidence gave rise to considerable prejudice to the appellant: Appellant's Written Submissions at [318].

291In paragraph [22] of Mr Walsh's written submissions in the present appeal , reference was made to the submission made in support of the argument under s 130A. In respect of the items seized by police on 3 September 2008 it was submitted:

""... for instance although the Accused had told Detective Sergeant Grassick ... that he had in his possession certain items because of his work with HIV and AIDS patients, of course when he came to oral evidence character was put at issue. It was raised in advance of his case, good character and he explained that over a lifetime and indeed at the time of his arrest in 2008 he had been working many difficult years in helping people who tragically suffer from HIV and AIDS in our community ...""

292Reference was made to the further submission by Mr Walsh that Cogswell DCJ did not have that body of evidence to place in proper context the good works that had been done by the appellant and the ""need to have safe sex practices and DNA magazines are distributed ..."": at [22].

293In his oral submissions to this Court on 7 February 2014, Mr Walsh emphasised that Garling A-DCJ had

""... the additional bit of evidence in which there was very comprehensive explanation under oath, together with other witnesses that explained the alternative inference that this material was in the possession of the accused as part of his good works in the community. That is different to what Judge Cogswell had."" (T 6:29-35)

294In the Crown's submissions it was contended that Garling A-DCJ in fact considered the admissibility of the evidence given at the first trial in his judgment: T 4:9-T 6:7, 13 February 2013. The Crown submitted that his Honour considered the application and the constraints of s 130A of the Act.

295Mr Walsh in his submissions to this Court again emphasised that the accused had given an explanation under oath that he had for over twenty years been working with HIV patients: T 4:5-12.

296Mr Walsh submitted that his Honour ought to have taken into account this new evidence of an alternative explanation for the use of the items seized and that there was a broad test under s 130A which entitled his Honour to have regard to such additional material and an alternative explanation.

297It was contended that there was no reference by Cogswell DCJ or by Garling A-DCJ to the ""extraordinary delay"" of GB making a complaint, nor the nature of the complaint to Dr Frukacz (""in very general terms"") and that GB only came forward after considerable media publicity and the arrest and charging of the appellant.

298The Crown's response was that it was evident Garling A-DCJ considered the evidence, including the additional evidence from the first trial, that was placed before him and the submissions that had been advanced. It was submitted that his Honour found, as was open to him to find, that in the circumstances he was not satisfied that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding: Crown's Written Submissions at [35]. 

299The Crown further submitted that the trial judge considered the application and the constraints of s 130A and determined that, in the circumstances of the case, he was not satisfied that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding. Judgment was delivered ex tempore and there was no suggestion at the time that there had been a failure to have regard to any evidence: Crown's Written Submissions at [40]-[41]. 

300The Crown additionally observed that the trial judge only once used the words ""except in exceptional circumstances"", and that on all other occasions his Honour correctly referred to the ""interests of justice"" requirement: Crown's Written Submissions at [22]. 

301The appellant's submission before Garling A-DCJ had been that GB was ""significantly unreliable"". The Crown observed in its submissions to this Court that the ""problematic matters were summarised"" for his Honour: Crown's Written Submissions at [33].

302The Crown submitted that, as Garling A-DCJ stated, he had examined the relevant matters all of which had been the subject of recent reference in the submissions for the appellant.

Consideration 

303Section 130A of the Criminal Procedure Act applies to pre-trial orders made by a judge in proceedings on indictment. A pre-trial order means any order made after the indictment is first presented before the empanelment of a jury for a trial: s 130A(4).

304The following matters are noted:

(i) The provisions of s 130A are expressed in expansive terms referring to any order falling within the definition in s 130A(4).

(ii) The provisions would, accordingly, apply to separate trial orders, but doubt has been expressed as to whether they apply to evidentiary rulings: per Howie J in R v Ford [2009] NSWCCA 306 at [150] (his Honour however, observed that in the Second Reading Speech introducing the bill that originally amended the Criminal Procedure Act by inserting the provision in the terms then appearing in s 130A, it was intended that it would apply to evidentiary rulings). It was unnecessary to resolve the question in that case.

(iii) A redetermination of a pre-trial order is only possible in the limited circumstances stated in s 130A, namely, ""... it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding"".

(iv) An error in a pre-trial order may justify a court concluding that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding. Not every error of fact or law, however, may justify a judge redetermining the pre-trial order previously made. Much will depend upon the nature and/or effect of such an order.

305I will proceed to deal with each of the four matters raised by the appellant in paragraph [285] above.

(i) The 'Test' of Exceptional Circumstances

306Garling A-DCJ was clearly aware of the precise terms of s 130A which his Honour, in part, extracted into his judgment. He made express reference to the ""interests of justice"" test contained in the s 130A (Judgment at p 2).

307His Honour noted that the application under s 130A was made upon the basis, inter alia, of the evidence adduced in the first trial (including the evidence from GB) and further noted the submission for the appellant to the effect that the evidence given by GB ""was significantly unreliable"": Judgment at p 3.

308His Honour made reference to Mr Walsh's affidavit sworn 24 January 2013 and noted the reasons set out in it in support of the submission as to why the court should ""revisit"" the matters previously decided.

309Garling A-DCJ also took into account the matters that had been considered by Cogswell DCJ.

310Notwithstanding the trial judge's use of the phrase ""exceptional circumstances"", it is important to note that his Honour did not apply that as the test for determining the application. He employed that phrase in explaining the rationale for the provisions in s 130A. A little later on the same page of the judgment his Honour applied the correct test in saying:

""... I have concluded, having looked at all those matters quite rightly raised, that this is not a matter which I could rule that it would not be in the interests of justice for the order to be binding ..."" (at p 4)

311I have concluded that there is no merit to the contention that the trial judge applied the wrong test.

(ii) Failure to Consider Detailed Matters and Failure to Consider Coincidence Evidence

(iii) Failure to Properly Consider Coincidence Evidence, Especially that Relating to GB and TE

312The appellant before Garling A-DCJ relied upon evidence given in the first trial, including the evidence in cross-examination of GB and TE as well as the evidence given by the appellant. The evidence in the defence case at trial and relied upon before his Honour dealt with the appellant's volunteer work with HIV/AIDS sufferers and his explanation for the pornography found in his possession. The additional material relied upon before Garling A-DCJ also included the evidence of Dr Roberts which purported to lessen the significant probative value of GB's evidence as well as TE's evidence.

313I accept the Crown's submission that Garling A-DCJ considered the matters relied upon and argued by Mr Walsh as well as the evidence to which those submissions related. His Honour indicated that he had done so and made it clear that, in his opinion, the issue of the reliability of GB was a matter for the jury's determination at trial, which it clearly was.

314Many of the matters raised in the submissions for the appellant were directed at demonstrating, in light of the additional evidence of GB in the first trial, that GB's evidence was unreliable.

315However, in determining the issue of significant probative value for the purpose of s 97(1)(b), it is well-established that a restrictive approach is to be taken to the circumstances in which issues of reliability and credibility may be taken into account in determining the probative value of evidence for the purposes of determining questions of admissibility: R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 at [60] per Spigelman CJ.

316The Chief Justice in that case observed that there will be circumstances, as envisaged by Simpson J in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52, where issues of credibility or reliability are such that it is possible for a court to determine that it would not be open to the jury to conclude that the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue: at [63].

317An example given by Simpson J in Cook was where the evidence is so preposterous that no jury would accept the evidence. 

318That is not this case. The issue of GB's reliability or credibility, as I have indicated, was a matter for determination by the jury and not one for a trial judge to determine.

319As to the submission of a failure by Garling A-DCJ to consider evidence of concoction/contamination caused by animus towards the appellant and the College, I accept, as the Crown submitted, that there was no significant change in the evidence on the voir dire to that given at the first trial. Cogswell DCJ concluded that arguments as to alleged concoction or contamination had not been made out and there was, in my assessment, no basis established for Garling A-DCJ to depart from the ruling that had been made on that question. I do not consider this matter of complaint has any merit.

(iv) Failure to Consider the Materials Found in Possession of the Appellant on Arrest as not being Tendency or Coincidence Evidence

320On the issue of the appellant's possession of pornography, extensive submissions were made by Mr Walsh in his written submissions at [183]-[199]. The proposition contended for on behalf of the appellant was that in determining the admissibility of the evidence as to his possession of such materials under s 98 of the Evidence Act, Garling A-DCJ failed to take into account the evidence as to an innocent or alternative explanation given at the first trial.

321In relation to the submission that Garling A-DCJ did not consider the coincidence evidence relating to the possession of the pornographic items seized on arrest, Garling A-DCJ referred to Cogswell DCJ's consideration of such evidence and to his determination that the evidence was admissible as coincidence evidence.

322His Honour Garling A-DCJ dealt with this matter at pages 4-5 of his judgment of 23 May 2012, making it clear that he had ""considered all those matters"", his Honour having extracted parts of the judgment of Cogswell DCJ on the probative value of the items seized to the facts in issue in the trial in which TE was the complainant.

323I do not consider that there is any substance to the submission that Garling A-DCJ failed to properly consider the coincidence evidence relating to the possession of the pornographic materials in the items seized upon arrest.

324Essentially the question at issue was whether or not the evidence was admissible as coincidence evidence. The fact that the evidence may have supported an alternative explanation does not make the evidence inadmissible. Recognition of the jury's role in determining such issues should not be put to one side. 

325In DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9, Bathurst CJ (at [10]) observed that the real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in that case) the guilt of the accused will be relevant to forming the view required by s 98 that the evidence has probative value. However, importantly, the Chief Justice stated:

""... However, this does not involve either undertaking the fact-finding analysis suggested by Senior Counsel for DSJ or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the party seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s 98(1)(b) of the Act and would involve the judge usurping the fact-finding role of the jury.""

326It is commonly the case in determining admissibility of coincidence and tendency evidence that, on the voir dire, the Crown produces statements relating to matters upon which evidence will be sought to be led at trial. In the particular circumstances of this case, Garling A-DCJ was required, inter alia, to consider the evidence given at the first trial, including in particular the appellant's evidence, by way of explanation, of the circumstances in which he said he came into possession of the materials seized by police. Such an ""innocent"" or alternative explanation, if accepted by a jury, would deprive the evidence of its probative value.

327As earlier indicated, Garling A-DCJ stated that he had, in determining the application made under s 130A, taken into account evidence led in the first trial. Whilst express reference to the actual evidence to which his Honour referred would have been desirable, I consider that, having regard to the particular submissions made to him on this aspect, his Honour's statement as to what he had taken into account was sufficient to indicate the basis of his decision. I consider that no error has been established in this respect.

328Finally, whilst the appellant gave evidence in the first trial as to an alternative explanation for being in possession of the materials seized by police, at the end of the day that was an issue that fell within the province of the jury. The question as to whether the particular matters relied upon by the appellant in support of the alternative explanation were to be accepted required an evaluation by a jury. As noted above, the approach to be taken in determining the admissibility of coincidence and possible alternative explanations for such evidence has been established: DSJ v R; NS v R [2012] NSWCCA 9, Bathurst CJ at [6]-[10] and Whealy JA at [78]-[81].

329At the end of the day, his Honour was required to determine whether, on the evidence before him, including the evidence in the first trial relied upon by the appellant, there was a proper basis, in the interests of justice, to reconsider the decision of Cogswell DCJ. His Honour's decision not to intervene in this respect was, in my assessment, entirely appropriate.

330Garling A-DCJ was required to consider the pre-trial orders of Cogswell DCJ in light of the evidence before him, including the evidence given at the first trial and which was tendered on the voir dire, in order to form an opinion, as specified in s 130A(1). It is clear that his Honour considered the evidence and the submissions before concluding that in effect, there was no requirement to depart from or do anything other than regard the earlier pre-trial orders as binding. On a review of the matters raised in submissions in this appeal on behalf of the appellant and the Crown, I am of the opinion that there is no basis for forming any other conclusion than that expressed by his Honour. Accordingly, no error has been established in respect of Grounds 1 and 2 and they should be dismissed.

331I will deal separately with the stay application determined by Garling A-DCJ when considering Ground 6.

Ground 6: The learned Trial Judge erred in refusing an application for a permanent stay of the Indictment in respect of GB

332The appellant applied by Notice of Motion dated 21 January 2013 for a permanent stay of proceedings of the sole count concerning GB (Count 1). The application was pursued before Garling A-DCJ on 11 February 2013. There had been no previous determination of an application for a stay of proceedings. 

333The applicant relied upon the affidavits of Mr Walsh sworn on 24 January 2013 and 6 February 2013 in support of the Notice of Motion. As the Crown noted, considerable parts of the first affidavit were not admitted and were not pressed. Extensive written submissions were relied upon as well as oral submissions.

334Garling A-DCJ refused the application for a stay of proceedings.

335In oral submissions Mr Walsh observed that Ground 3, the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground, overlapped Ground 6 in some respects: T 14:10-12, 7 February 2014. 

336The Crown relied upon its written submissions.

Appellant's Submissions

337In the Appellant's Written Submissions it was contended in the hearing of the stay application before Garling A-DCJ that the date on which the tractor incident is said to have occurred (in 1965 or 1966), was of importance to the appellant's contention as to prejudice.

338Count 1 on the indictment averred a time ""between 1 September 1965 and 31 December 1967"". In this period, both the appellant and the complainant were at the College.

339During the first trial, an amendment was made to Count 1 in relation to the nominated period. The first trial commenced with a time period of 1 January 1966 through to 31 December 1967.

340GB's evidence at the first trial proceeded on the basis that he believed the appellant only joined the school in 1966.

341The day upon which the assault the subject of Count 1 occurred was, according to GB the day the tractor went into the trench. At the time he observed the tractor GB said that the only persons present were the appellant and, he believed, two of his school friends. 

342As the Crown noted, GB was cross-examined as to the date of the offence and that that evidence demonstrated his uncertainty as to timing. However, his evidence was guided by his belief that the appellant did not arrive until 1966 and the incident could be dated from the tractor incident.

343As the Crown noted in its written submissions at [110]:

""Although the complainant initially dated the incident by his recollection of his age and when the appellant arrived, which placed the offence in 1966 or 1967, he readily accepted that it may have been 1965 if the appellant was at the school and the tractor incident could be dated to that time.""

344In the written submissions for the appellant at [596] it was noted that the tractor incident was critical to the Prosecution and Defence case. The appellant had attempted to rely upon a particular photograph to demonstrate the unreliability of GB's evidence and also to prove the appellant's innocence of the charge against him.

345The submission for the appellant continued:

[596] ""... However what the Crown Prosecutor did was to suggest in cross-examination to the Applicant that the incident in which the tractor went into the ditch or trench was not in any way associated with the photograph shown to him by Mr Walsh on behalf of the Applicant. In other words what the Crown Prosecutor did was to put to the Applicant that there was another incident in which the tractor had been driven into the trench.""

346The submission on behalf of the appellant, the then applicant for a stay of proceedings, was that there was, in the circumstances in which the period in Count 1 was altered, overwhelming prejudice to him and that this was manifest because the jury would reason that there were two and not one tractor incidents: 

""... thus, the witnesses who were either dead or unavailable were even of more critical importance in the defence of the count against the Applicant."" (Appellant's Written Submissions at [597])

347The appellant's case in respect of Count 1 was at least partly based upon the proposition that the photograph in the Echoes magazine showing a tractor, the appellant and others, was one taken in November 1965.

348As the Crown observed in its submissions at [109], the effect of the evidence given by GB in the first trial was an acceptance that the photo may have been taken of the same tractor incident, but not at the same time that he made observations or had dealings with the appellant. The appellant's evidence was that the tractor incident occupied almost the full day.

349In support of the stay application there were five matters or criteria on the basis of which a permanent stay was sought of Count 1. All related to the issue of delay. They were:

(i) The delay;

(ii) The reasons for the delay;

(iii) Whether the accused was responsible for any of the delay;

(iv) Prejudice to the accused; and

(v) Consideration of public policy, namely, the importance of bringing persons accused of serious crimes to be processed by the Court system.

350As noted in the written submissions for the appellant, his Honour dealt with each of the above points as follows:

(i) That the accused was not responsible for any of the delay.

(ii) There were a number of areas of prejudice, including publicity about him and other members of the religious order. Additionally, the dispute about the tractor incident and the number of people who were present at the time who were depicted in the photograph were deceased. There were other witnesses who, because of delay, were not able to be ascertained.

(iii) The importance of the public policy in bringing persons charged with offences before the court was accepted. 

351The written submissions for the appellant reproduced his Honour's reasoning in relation to prejudice in these terms:

""Whilst a number of witnesses are deceased, the real issue is whether or not sexual assault took place. There were no witnesses so there is no reference to an eye-witness to the assault. It is not surprising that various witnesses may have died during that period. In addition, the Accused concedes many of the matters surrounding his time or work at the College. Delay is common in historical sexual assault cases and can be cured by directions."" (Appellant's Written Submissions at [604])

352It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the trial judge erred in rejecting the application for a permanent stay of the proceedings in respect of Count 1. In that respect a number of matters were raised in relation to the issue of ""reasons to explain or justify the delay"", criteria (ii) in the above list of five criteria.

353The appellant's written submissions at [608]-[618] set out details as to the medical attendances by GB upon medical practitioners from approximately 1999. These included his general practitioner, Dr Jamieson, a Dr McGarrity and a psychologist, Mr Woodside (2007) and Dr Frukacz, Consultant Psychiatrist (2008). Notwithstanding such medical attendances, GB did not disclose any history of alleged sexual assault whilst he was at the College. This included a period when he was being treated for depression. 

354The Crown observed that Dr Pullman gave evidence on the voir dire that the failure to report sexual assaults was not at all unusual or unexpected and that the failure to complain is not unexpected in sexual assault offences, referring to the observations of Bell J in R v RWO [2002] NSWCCA 133 at [103]. In RWO delay was a period of thirty-five years up to the date of trial.

355A further matter raised was a question of the motivation of GB in coming forward in 2008. It was submitted that the publicity surrounding the arrest of a former priest in May 2008, and the appellant's arrest in 2008, and the publicised remarks of the lawyers representing the appellant, were relevant in explaining GB's motivation.

356As to unreliability, the evidence on the voir dire, which Cogswell DCJ accepted, was that GB had not discussed either the assaults or the appellant with others whilst at the school or in later years. 

357The appellant's written submissions on Ground 6 reproduce in most aspects the submissions dated 11 February 2013 that were relied upon on the stay application. A copy of the latter submissions are at Volume 3 of the Appellant's Tender Bundle, Tab 15.

358In summary, the submissions relied upon delay, more particularly, prejudice arising from the delay before GB reported the alleged sexual assault. The following matters were noted:

(i) The absence of an explanation for the failure of GB to make ""a timely complaint"": Appellant's Written Submissions at [617].

(ii) That GB's ""complaint"" in 2008 was motivated by a combination of ""animus towards the Accused and the College because of the miserable time he had there"" and the considerable publicity: at [617].

(iii) The timeframe of the offence. GB at the committal said that he did not think the Count 1 offence occurred in 1965 and said he was unsure whether it occurred in 1966 or 1967. The submissions relating to this matter are discussed in the paragraphs that follow.

Consideration

359Before considering the issue of delay and prejudice, I will first address the claim of prejudice arising from the amendment to the indictment as to the period of the offending alleged in Count 1.

360As to [358](iii) above, the Crown's submissions at [121] observed:

""The appellant claimed that the change to the time period specified caused unfair prejudice. The unfair prejudice apparently being that if there was only one tractor incident, it occurred in November 1965 and was therefore outside the charged period. Also, that the evidence marshalled addressed an incident in November 1965 and if there was a possible second tractor incident then the defence was at a disadvantage defending it.""

361As earlier noted, on the indictment presented GB averred a time period in respect of Count 1 of ""between 1 September 1965 and 31 December 1967.""

362During the first trial an amendment was made to the indictment whereby the time period was changed to 1 January 1966 to 31 December 1967.

363The defence case sought to relate the tractor incident to November 1965 and no other time. The defence sought to rely upon a photograph of a tractor accident depicted in a photograph in a College publication ""Echoes ..."", a copy of which is in Appeal Book volume 1 at p 910, showing a number of people including the appellant.

364It is necessary to refer to the evidence of GB on the above photograph. GB was first taken to it at T 258:45, 21 February 2013. He there said he recalled it being shown to him at the committal. The cross-examination on the photograph continued at T 266-274. GB stated at T 272:25-30 that the photograph was not one taken when he, the two other students and the appellant were standing together before the alleged sexual assault incident. He then added at T 272:44-46:

""... this photograph has been taken after or before the incident that I'm talking about, Mr Walsh. This photograph has nothing to do with when I was there and [P] and [I] were there.""

365This evidence, if accepted by the jury, would provide an answer to the defence case that the photograph depicted those present at the tractor incident at the time GB said the appellant sent him away to the art room. The photograph had depicted the appellant differently dressed from the clothing GB said the appellant had been wearing at the time of the tractor incident.

366The appellant's submissions on the stay application had sought to establish actual prejudice to the appellant because the Crown Prosecutor had led GB into saying there had been two tractor incidents as a means of explaining the otherwise inconsistent facts reflected by the photograph.

367However, as the evidence of GB referred to above indicates, GB did not say or attempt to explain away the photograph by introducing the fact of two tractor incidents. He instead said that the photograph must have been taken at a different time of day - morning or afternoon and not at the time of the tractor accident.

368The basis claimed in the submissions for the appellant of added or actual prejudice arising from delay due to the introduction by GB of not one but two tractor incidents has not been established. He did not, as I have said, give evidence suggesting more than one tractor accident.

369In relation to the decision of Garling A-DCJ on the stay application, his Honour considered the particular issues raised before him relevant to delay and the issues of prejudice. One such issue concerned the unavailability of a large number of witnesses through death. Some of these included persons in the photograph of the tractor relied upon in the defence case and those who, it was contended, could have demonstrated that GB's account was wrong and unreliable .

370In R v RWO [2002] NSWCCA 133, a case involving a delay of 35 years up to the trial, Bell J observed at [65]:

""The delay in this case has been very great indeed. However, commensurate delays, even greater delays, have not of themselves been held to be a sufficient basis for a court refusing to exercise jurisdiction.""

371Garling A-DCJ referred to RWO in his Honour's judgment.

372In R v McCarthy (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 August 1994, unreported) Gleeson CJ observed:

""Time and time again it happens in criminal proceedings that for any one of a variety of reasons witnesses who may be regarded as important by one side or the other die, or become ill, or lose their memory, or lose documents. If the result of that were that nobody could obtain a fair trial, and the proceedings had to be permanently stayed, it would go a long way towards solving the problems of delay in the criminal lists in this State. However, the position is that it is well recognised that an occurrence of that kind does not of itself mean that a person cannot obtain a fair trial or that proceedings need to be stayed. In this connection I refer to what was said in R v Adler (unreported CCA, 11 June 1992) and R v Goldberg (unreported CCA, 23 February 1993).""

373It was submitted for the appellant that Garling A-DCJ erred in proceeding on the basis that prejudice could be met by appropriate directions. However, it was open to the trial judge to evaluate the extent to which prejudice could be addressed by directions. As the Crown observed, he was in a position to know what evidence would be led having the evidence available from the first trial was available to him

374The principles were stated by Bell J in RWO as follows:

[62] The principles upon which a court will permanently stay proceedings on indictment are well settled. They are enunciated in Barton v the Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 111; Jago v the District Court of New South Wales (1989) 168 CLR 23; Glennon v the Queen (1992) 173 CLR 592; and Walton v Gardiner (1993) 177 CLR 379. 

[63] It is a power to be exercised only in exceptional cases; Jago per Mason CJ at 31. In Jago Gaudron J explained why that is so at 76:

""The nature of the power to grant a permanent stay of proceedings itself reveals an important principle which confines its exercise. The power is, in essence, a power to refuse to exercise jurisdiction. It is thus to be exercised in the light of the principle that the conferral of jurisdiction imports a prima facie right in the person invoking that jurisdiction to have it exercised. In this context it is relevant to note the remarks of Deane J in Re Queensland Electricity Commission; Ex parte Electrical Trades Union of Australia (1987) 61 ALJR 393 at p 399, that the 'prima facie right to insist upon the exercise of jurisdiction is a concomitant of a basic element of the rule of law, namely, that every person and organisation, regardless of rank, condition or official standing, is 'amenable to the jurisdiction' of the courts and other public tribunals'. Thus, the power is one that is readily seen as exercisable (whether in civil or criminal proceedings) only in exceptional cases or, as was said by this Court in refusing special leave to appeal in Attorney-General (NSW) v Watson, 'sparingly, and with the utmost caution'.""

[64] It will be appropriate to permanently stay proceedings on indictment in a case where, as the result of delay, the continuation of the proceedings would necessarily result in a trial which was unfair. As Mason CJ observed in Jago at 33:

""In the safeguarding of the interests of the accused in the manner I have described, the touchstone in every case is fairness. 
...

The test of fairness which must be applied involves a balancing process, for the interests of the accused cannot be considered in isolation without regard to the community's right to expect that persons charged with criminal offences are brought to trial: see Barton (1980) 147 CLR, at pp 102, 106; Sang [1980] AC at p 437; Carver v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 29 A Crim R 24, at pp 31, 32. At the same time, it should not be overlooked that the community expects trials to be fair and to take place within a reasonable time after a person has been charged. 

...

To justify a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, there must be a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial 'of such a nature that nothing that a trial judge can do in the conduct of the trial can relieve against its unfair consequences': Barton (1980) 147 CLR, at p 111, per Wilson J. Where delay is the sole ground of complaint, an accused seeking a permanent stay must be 'able to show that the lapse of time is such that any trial is necessarily unfair so that any conviction would bring the administration of justice into disrepute': Clarkson [1987] v R, at p 973.""

375I do not consider that the appellant has established a fundamental defect which went to the root of the trial of such a nature that directions from the trial judge could not properly or adequately address any unfairness arising from the delay.

376I have concluded that no error has been established in the decision of Garling A-DCJ in refusing to make an order staying the proceedings on Count 1. His Honour was clearly mindful of the relevant principles to be applied. It is also apparent that his Honour was aware of the factual matters that could potentially give rise to prejudice and the need for strong jury directions to address those matters. In carrying out the balancing test required I do not consider that his Honour was bound to conclude that a trial on that count would necessarily be unfair. In my assessment, error has not been established. Ground 6 accordingly should be dismissed.

Ground 4: His Honour erred by permitting the Crown Prosecutor to cross-examine the Matron Clarke as to ""masking"" symptomatology relating to TE

377Ground 4 is devoid of merit on two bases. Firstly, the question asked by the Crown Prosecutor did not elicit any answer as to ""masking"" symptomatology. Secondly, Mr Walsh on the hearing of the appeal stated that he did not press this ground: T 20:9, 7 February 2014. However, just prior to that statement Mr Walsh also stated that he relied on his written submissions in relation to this ground. In the circumstances, it is best to deal briefly with the matter raised by Ground 4.

378Ground 4 was addressed in paragraphs [548] to [567] of the Appellant's Written Submissions.

379The appellant's submissions asserted that the objection to the Crown's questioning of Matron Daymond on the subject of ""masking symptomatology"" amounted to expert evidence but the witness had not been qualified as to any relevant expertise that she had. Further, no notice had been given of the evidence sought to be elicited from her on that topic.

380During the second trial Matron Daymond, a registered nurse, was asked by the Crown Prosecutor as to the issue of ""masking"" symptoms. The question was:

""Now as part of your training did you learn that young men or adolescents can sometimes mask what is happening to them by complaining about stomach pains."" (T 671:46-48, 27 February 2013)

381As the Crown's submissions noted, there was an objection to the question based on the absence of notice and the failure to qualify the witness as having relevant expertise.

382Paragraphs [73]-[75] of the Crown's submissions sets out questions and answers that were asked:

""She was then asked, without objection [T 27/2/13 697.45- 698.36]:

Q. In the course of your training, did you learn that young male adolescents can complain about stomach problems but in fact be referring to something else?
A. Would you repeat the question please?

Q. In the course of your training, did you learn that young persons, young adolescents, young male adolescents can complain about stomach problems and be referring to something else?
A. I think, no.

Q. You never learnt that?
A. Beg your pardon.

Q. You never learnt that?
A. I have always during my nursing career, treated the symptoms as they were presented. I do not presume to diagnosis.

Q. If you have repeated complaints of tummy aches in a young lad, would it cause you to consider the possibility that something else other than a stomach upset was going on?
A. I would refer the young person or any other person who complained of frequent tummy pains to a GP and I would rely on his or her diagnosis.

None of her answers were responsive to the question.

In cross-examination Matron Clark was asked [T 27/2/13 704.5]:

Q. You were asked a number of questions about whether you would deduce from symptomatology of bleeding from the anus what in your mind would trigger a thought or belief or a suspicion of sexual assault. Remember those questions asked of you?
A. Yeah I do.

Q. You said no?
A. I--

Q. That was your evidence?
A. Yes yes.

Q. Was it your practise that if anything serious occurred so far as the presenting symptoms of a student you'd refer him on to Dr Wilson?
A. That is correct.""

383The Crown noted that there was no cross-examination regarding stomach aches masking something else. There was no questioning of Matron Clarke to suggest that she lacked expertise to comment on the Crown Prosecutor's question.

384At the conclusion of the evidence the Crown observed, there was no confirmation that stomach aches could mask another complaint.

385In these circumstances, the Crown correctly submitted at [78]-[79]:

""This material did not form part of either the Crown or the Defence address. Nothing was said in summing up nor was any request made that anything be said.

The appellant contends that the admission of the evidence was of significant prejudice: AWS [567]. There was in fact no evidence. There was limited questioning from the Crown Prosecutor that found no acceptance with the witness.""

386Accordingly, there was in fact no opinion expressed on the matter of masking symptoms.

387I do not consider, as stated above, that there is any merit to Ground 4. The ground accordingly should be dismissed.

Ground 5: That a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the Crown Prosecutor being permitted to cross-examine the appellant contrary to Palmer v R (1998) 193 CLR 1

Appellant's Submissions

388This ground was argued upon the basis that it is impermissible for an accused to be asked questions by the Crown about whether a complainant has any motive to lie or as to whether any witness is lying, whose evidence is opposed to the accused: Appellant's Written Submissions at [576]. A number of authorities were cited in support of this proposition commencing with the decision of the High Court in Palmer v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 1 (per Brennan CJ, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 8: Appellant's Written Submissions at [577]-[583].

389It was submitted for the appellant that the cross-examination was most unfair to the appellant: at [586]. It was submitted that the effect of the cross-examination was to reverse the onus of proof and that the line of questioning pursued implied that unless the appellant satisfied the jury that the Crown witnesses were liars, they should accept the complainant's evidence and convict: Appellant's Written Submissions at [586].

390Further, it was submitted that the extensive nature of the cross-examination was such that any direction by the trial judge could not have overcome the unfair prejudice to the appellant, such that a miscarriage of justice had occurred in these circumstances: Appellant's Written Submissions at [586]-[587].

391In the ""Supplementary Note on behalf of the Appellant - JG"" dated 12 February 2014, the issue of impermissible cross-examination was addressed, initially in terms as to the possible application of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.

392Attention was drawn to an issue raised by Mr Walsh with the trial judge about the line of cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor in putting to the appellant in respect of the evidence of GB and TE, and tendency witnesses, questions such as ""Do you say he is lying?"" or ""Is that a lie?"": T 1470-1472, 15 March 2013.

393Mr Walsh referred the trial judge to Palmer v The Queen and other authorities. He stated his concern as to how the Crown proposed to address the jury on such evidence and that if the Crown Prosecutor did refer to that evidence it would occasion prejudice to the appellant: T 1471:10-20.

394The trial judge asked Mr Walsh what he wanted him to do: T 1471:30-32.

395Mr Walsh replied that he requested the trial judge to ask the Crown Prosecutor as to what he proposed to do about the matter and further in light of the authorities to which he had drawn attention to redress the problem that's arisen - that it was not up to the appellant to explain ""why any particular complainant may have a motive to tell an untruth"": T 1471:35-40.

396Discussion then occurred on the subject of directions (T 1474:45 to T 1475:1-5).

397The trial judge made the observation that the appellant had expressed his ""view"" that ""they were lying"": T 1474:5-7 and further that he ""had a very firm view about this"": T 1474:10-12.

398In the Crown's Supplementary Submissions it was noted that the appellant had not sought a discharge of the jury and that there was no suggestion that the evidence could not be covered by suitable direction: at [17].

399The Crown further submitted that there was no suggestion that the trial judge did not comply with the request for a direction and that he gave a perfectly adequate direction to the jury: at [18].

Crown's Submissions

400The Crown accepted that as a general principle, a witness should not be asked whether or not a witness is not telling the truth or is lying: Gonzales v R [2007] [NSWCCA 321; (2007) 178 A Crim R 232: Crown's Written Submissions at [83].

401The Crown submissions referred to the observations in R v Foley (1998) 105 A Crim R 1 at 8.3 to the effect that impermissible cross-examination of the kind referred to in Gonzales v R was unfair because it forced the honest witness into a recrimination and sought to rely upon the natural reluctance of a person to defame another. In Foley it was stated to be a form of ""... bullying, using unfair means to persuade a person to retract his or her evidence ..."".

402The Crown noted in its submissions that in the first trial on 18 June 2012, Cogswell DCJ raised the line of questioning with the defence at T 1604:14-T 1606:16 as follows:

""HIS HONOUR: Now, the other thing I was just going to raise is the number of times Mr Hughes put to the accused as a witness that other witnesses were lying and you didn't take objection. I'm not saying you should or shouldn't have. That is an area which, by the looks of it, is dealt with by section 41 of the Evidence Act. But I'm assuming that was a considered decision because of - I don't know - but a forensic advantage that you expected--

WALSH: Your Honour, I think I have to concede that the situation was that Brother Gaven was capable probably of answering the question. 

HIS HONOUR: That's--

WALSH: What weight one puts to the answer or to the evidence is another thing.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

WALSH: But it did come across my mind--

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

WALSH: --and I thought it wasn't put in specific terms, it was, rather, in the general about other third parties lying, so--

HIS HONOUR: No. It was put that so and so - X and Y and Z were lying and then that they're all lying. 

WALSH: Tendency witnesses. 

HIS HONOUR: And I'm not being critical of you and, indeed, I haven't heard Mr Hughes on whether he says that they were admissible questions or not. But I just wanted to check. Thank you. Good. 

WALSH: Yes. I think, technically, your Honour, they were inadmissible, but I must concede I took a forensic view because of the way they were being put and I just thought-
HIS HONOUR: I can understand that. 

WALSH: Well--

HIS HONOUR: I can understand. Yes.

WALSH: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Just checking.

WALSH: No, no, I appreciate that, your Honour."" (Crown's Written Submissions at [86])

403The Crown submitted that the final address for the appellant squarely suggested that witnesses were lying or were other than witnesses of truth: Crown's Written Submissions at [87]. Additionally, the Crown observed that the conduct of the first trial was largely reproduced during the second trial and assisted to define the parameters of the dispute.

404The Crown submitted that it was significant that at the commencement of the second trial the defence commenced its opening to the jury with an assertion that the allegations by GB, TE and any of the persons outlined by the Crown Prosecutor as giving tendency or coincidence evidence were ""untrue"": T 193:31, 20 February 2013.

405The Crown noted that the defence opening concluded with the statement that the appellant had been ""falsely accused"" in this case: T 202:20, 20 February 2013 - Crown's Written Submissions at [89].

406In paragraph [90] of the Crown's Written Submissions it was stated:

""The appellant either volunteered that a witness was lying or was asked to confirm that he was alleging a witness was lying on a number of occasions. They include:

T 1309.4 A said TE had ""made absolute false and horrendous accusations"";

T 1316.3 A said these types of students had made ""false allegations"";

T 1316.11 A was asked if liars would come forward as a result of publicity;

T 1318.24 A said those who complained made ""false accusations"";

T 1319.16 A was asked

Q. Is this the case, correct me if I'm wrong, your case, every single person in this trial who alleges sexual misconduct on your part perpetrated by you on them is a liar?
A. Yes.

Q. That extends from [G B] in the period 65/67 through [H M] in a room on the priests' corridor in 86. It continues with [S R] in 1987. It continues to [PW] who said that you put your hand down his pyjama shorts. It continues through all the allegations of sexual misconduct described by [TE], including anal penetration and it includes, it culminates in [M A], who said that he got into your bed and there was a mutual holding of penises. All of those witnesses are lying, is that your case?
A. Yes.

Q. And additionally, every single witness in the prosecution case in this trial who says they witnessed you acting in a predatory and inappropriate way with young students at the school, they're also lying, according to you?
A. The incidents didn't occur so, therefore, they could not have witnessed it.

T 1319.40 A was asked if RB was lying and he said yes;

T 1319.46 A was asked if SW, MH and PW were lying [he did not respond];

T 1320.3 A was asked if Dr Lyon and Dr Ioannou were lying and he said yes;

T 1320.11 A was asked if part of Dr Lyons evidence was a lie and A said ""definitely a lie"";

T 1320.13 A was asked if TE's mother was wrong in her evidence about a complaint.""

407The Crown noted that it was only at this point that an objection to the above ""line of questioning"" was made and the Crown Prosecutor upon the objection stated that he did not ""extend it to there"". The Crown submitted that clearly the objection had only been made upon the basis that the appellant could not have had direct knowledge of the subject of the question and could not comment: Crown's Written Submissions at [91].

408The Crown observed that immediately after the objection a further question on the above line was put at T 1320:23 without objection.

409The Crown's submission was:

""There was no objection to any of the questioning about a witness or witnesses lying. As the appellant ably demonstrated in his evidence, it was his case that almost all the witnesses called were lying, and that a number were pathological liars. Given the number of witnesses who gave accounts of a number of individual incidents occurring at different times involving the appellant it was not feasible to mount a case that they were mistaken or that their accounts were somehow confused."" (Crown's Written Submissions at [93])

410The Crown further submitted that it was clearly a case where the central ""planks"" of the defence case was that the witnesses were lying. That this was so it was said was supported by the defence final address ""resolutely suggesting that each complainant lied and did not give truthful evidence"": Crown's Written Submissions at [94].

411The Crown further submitted that the appellant was not questioned as to: 

""...what motive each or any witness had to lie. The appellant was not questioned as to any reasons why a witness was lying, he was merely asked to confirm that he was in fact suggesting that a witness or witnesses were lying about all or part of the evidence. The questioning did not enter into any questioning about motive or absence of motive such as was criticised as being impermissible in Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; (1998) 193 CLR 1; particularly at [7] and [8]."" (Crown's Written Submissions at [95])

412The Crown further submitted that the Crown Prosecutor did not suggest an absence of a motive to lie or raise for consideration the motive that any of the witnesses would have had to lie, nor did the questioning reverse the onus upon the appellant. The submission was that he merely articulated what the appellant's case was. It was a matter of significance, the Crown observed, that it was the appellant himself who suggested on many occasions that evidence was a lie or false: Crown's Written Submissions at [96].

413In relation to Ground 5, a question was raised from the Bench as to whether it had been put by Mr Walsh to tendency witnesses that they were lying. Mr Walsh put to some, but not all of the tendency witnesses, that the particular ""event"" they said occurred did not happen (eg, the witness Mr Walsh, RB and SR), with other witnesses no such proposition was put.

414A number of tendency witnesses were asked whether the boys referred to the appellant by nicknames such as ""gay van"" and ""poof truck"". It was put to one witness, Mr Walsh, that because of his attitude towards the offender, combined with rumours about his sexual ideation, he had come to the view that the appellant was doing ""something wrong"" and he was not. Mr Walsh rejected the proposition: T 775:1-5, 28 February 2013.

415The Crown noted in its supplementary submissions that while some witnesses regarded the nicknames as being directed to the perceived sexuality of the appellant, others placed a more naïve interpretation on the names: at [11].

Consideration

416Before addressing the impermissibility of the line of questioning the subject of Ground 5 and any effect it may have had, it is necessary to make the following observations:

(i) Although Ground 5 contends, in effect, that the Crown Prosector was ""permitted"" to cross-examine the accused contrary to Palmer v R, as the Crown observed the questioning proceeded without any objections being taken to the line of questioning.

(ii) The line of questioning pursued by the Crown Prosecutor did not, as the Crown properly submitted, contravene the principle with which the High Court was specifically concerned in Palmer v R. This aspect is further discussed below.

(iii) Ground 5 must be considered in the context of the trial. This includes the defence case as actively pursued by the appellant. Th",2014-07-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704772,R v Hunter (No 11) [2014] NSWSC 1154,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1Rather than delivering a formal ruling, I think I will just indicate, for the convenience of the parties so that they can reflect upon their positions, that if Mr Gary Hunter, as expected, were to object to giving evidence in the trial pursuant to s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), and if a certificate were granted to him in the absence of the jury, I would propose to briefly inform the jury of that fact, and very generally of its effect.  That is so for four reasons.  2First, I think that it would be highly artificial for the jury not to know of that important aspect of the evidence of Mr Gary Hunter.  3Secondly, I have already adopted the identical procedure with another witness who was granted a certificate, Ms Ellingsworth.  If the jury were not told of that I think that that could be seen to be inconsistent.  If the jury came to believe (or otherwise know) that a certificate had been granted, the jury could perhaps speculate on the strangeness of me having adopted that procedure with regard to Ms Ellingsworth, but not having adopted it with regard to Mr Gary Hunter.  4Thirdly, I consider that if the objection were taken in a highly formal way, and the intricacies of the section worked through thereafter in the absence of the jury, it would be odd and could lead to speculation if, the objection having been successful, the jury were simply to return to Court and I were to tell them nothing about the outcome of that objection that had been taken in their presence.  5Fourthly, in light of evidence on the voir dire with regard to the number and nature of inconsistent statements made in the past by Mr Gary Hunter, including on oath, I consider it highly likely in any event that the fact that he has been granted a certificate, if that is to occur, will come out in evidence in any event, pursuant to ss 38, 55, 103, and 137 of the Evidence Act. 6In short, I accept that there is no explicit guidance from the Court of Criminal Appeal or the High Court of Australia with regard to this particular question of whether or not a jury should be informed of the granting of a    s 128 certificate.  I also accept that it could be said that, to some small degree, the discussion in R v Macarthur [2005] NSWCCA 65 at [37] to [41] militates in support of not telling the jury about the granting of a certificate. 
7Nevertheless in the circumstances of this trial, for the convenience of counsel, I indicate that my proposal at this stage is that, if Mr Gary Hunter objects to giving evidence, and if he is granted a certificate pursuant to the Evidence Act, I propose to explain to the jury the fact that that has occurred, and very briefly the effect of it.  In short, my explanation would be highly similar to the brief explanation that I provided to the jury when Ms Ellingsworth was provided with a certificate last week.

2704773,R v Hunter (No 10) [2014] NSWSC 1153,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1One of the jurors this morning, by way of jury notes 3 and 4, has sought to be discharged.  2To state the basis simply, the juror has received a sporting invitation at the elite level that would involve one week's training, commencing this afternoon, away from Sydney.  Apparently it was not expected by the juror that the juror would receive such an invitation.  3Jury note 4, in particular, provides personal details about the juror.  I did not read that note out to the parties.  I simply provided a short précis of it.  As I indicated during discussion, it was proposed that that note be endorsed at a convenient time by me ""Not to be opened except on the order of a judge of this Court"", and sealed to that effect.  4Jury note 3 does provide the details of the sport in question but, in the circumstances, I do not consider that the same steps need to be taken with regard to jury note 3.  5The joint position of the parties is that that juror should indeed be discharged pursuant to s 53B of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW), a position with which I respectfully agree.   6I consider that it would be in the interests of no-one to have sitting on the jury for the next week, and possibly past this week, a juror who is distracted, disgruntled, and disappointed.   7It is regrettable that the possibility, however remote, was not reflected upon by the juror, and brought to my attention when the jury was empanelled last Tuesday.  8As I indicated to the parties during discussion, there is no question of the trial being adjourned for a week to suit the convenience of that juror.   9Accordingly, when the jury returns to Court, I propose to discharge that juror without asking for any indication of the identity of that person.  10The second and entirely separate question that arises is whether the trial should continue with 11 jurors: Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99.  Both parties have submitted that should take place.  Again, I respectfully agree with the position of the parties.   11To my mind, there is no question of the test contained in s 53C(1)(a) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) having been made out; namely, that continuing with ""the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice"".  12The jury was empanelled last Tuesday, and the trial has been proceeding smoothly.  To my understanding, half of the Crown witnesses have been dealt with, it could very well be the case that there will be no defence case, and one can expect that the jury will be deliberating perhaps late this week or early next week at the latest.  To my mind, in those circumstances, it is most unlikely that the number of jurors, by the time the jury is sent out to consider their verdict, will have gone below the statutory requirement.    13Separately, there is no suggestion whatsoever that anything untoward has occurred in the jury room.  Indeed, the jury appears focused and relaxed in the jury box.


14In the circumstances, I order that the trial will continue with 11 jurors.

2704774,Leichhardt Council v GRC Projects Pty Ltd ACN 135 672 294 (in liquidation) [2014] NSWLEC 122,"Judgment
1The defendant, GRC Projects Pty Ltd, has been prosecuted for an offence against s 125(1) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 ('the Act') in that, between about 17 October and 11 November 2011, it carried out development comprising the demolition of part of a building on land known as 1-13 Parramatta Road, Annandale, otherwise than in accordance with a development consent which had been obtained and was in force, contrary to s 76A(1) of the Act.
2The proceedings were commenced by summons on 15 October 2013 seeking, and the Court made, an order under s 246 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that the defendant appear before the Court on 29 November 2013 to answer to the offence charged in the order.
3The summons and order, and accompanying affidavits, were served on the defendant on 21 October 2013 by leaving it at the registered office of the defendant, namely, at Gertos Savell Katos, 164 Parramatta Road, Camperdown.
4On 4 November 2013, the solicitors for the prosecutor, Leichhardt Council, received notification of the appointment of a liquidator of the defendant.  It would appear from documents of the liquidators that they had been appointed on 26 October 2012 as liquidators of creditors' voluntary liquidation. 
5On the same day, the prosecutor's solicitors wrote to the liquidator enclosing a copy of the filed summons commencing the proceedings against the defendant.  The Court had endorsed on the summons that it was returnable on 29 November 2013.  The prosecutor's solicitors asked the liquidators their attitude to the proceedings and whether the liquidators intended to defend the proceedings.  
6The liquidators responded to the prosecutor on 7 November 2013, confirming their appointment as liquidators but suggesting that the proceedings against the defendant were stayed pursuant to s 500 of the Corporations Act 2001.  
7On 19 November 2013, the prosecutor's solicitors replied to the liquidators, pointing out that s 500 of the Corporations Act did not apply to the commencement and maintenance of criminal proceedings against the defendant, but rather only to civil proceedings, and that s 471B of the Corporations Act did not apply to bar the commencement of the proceedings as the defendant company was not being wound up in insolvency or by the Court, and there was no provisional liquidator of the company.  The solicitors asked if the liquidators had counsel's advice to the contrary.  The solicitors requested that the liquidators enter an appearance on behalf of the defendant company in liquidation, advise of the approach that the liquidators intend to take to the proceedings, and advise whether the liquidators intended to be represented at the return of the summons on 29 November 2013.  The solicitors gave notice that on 29 November 2013 they intended to apply to the Court for leave to amend the name of the defendant to add after the company name the words ""(in liquidation)"" and, if there was no appearance for the defendant, to proceed on a hearing of the charge in the absence of the defendant.
8On 21 November 2013, the liquidators replied, advising that they did not contest the Council's solicitors' interpretation of the Corporations Act; the liquidators were without funds to seek legal advice or to be represented; and consequently they did not intend to appear in the proceedings or contest the submissions the Council intended to make.  
9On 29 November 2013, the day on which the Court had ordered the defendant to appear before the Court to answer the offence charged in the order, there was no appearance for the defendant.  The Court granted leave to the prosecutor to amend the name of the defendant to ""GRC Projects Pty Ltd ACN 135 672 294 (in liquidation).""  The proceedings were adjourned to 20 December 2013. The amended summons was later served on the defendant.
10In the meantime, James Jordan of Jordan Djundja Lawyers, on 10 December 2013, filed a notice of appearance for the defendant, but on 12 December 2013 filed a notice of intention to file a notice of ceasing to act, and then on 23 December 2013 filed a notice of ceasing to act for the defendant.
11The defendant did not appear on the date to which the matter had been adjourned of 20 December 2013 or on subsequent days to which the matter was adjourned of 14 February 2014, 28 February 2014 or 20 June 2014.
12On 10 June 2014, the prosecutor filed a notice of motion seeking an order under s 250 of the Criminal Procedure Act that the matter proceed to a hearing and a determination in the absence of the defendant. 
13On 20 June 2014, the Court fixed the hearing of the prosecutor's motion for today, 14 July 2014.  Impliedly, the Court also adjourned the substantive matter to today.
14The notice of motion and accompanying affidavits in support of the motion, and notification of the date for hearing of the motion, were served on the liquidators as well as on the defendant at its registered office. Notwithstanding the appointment of the liquidators, the registered office of the defendant remained, and still remains, at 164 Parramatta Road, Camperdown.
15The defendant has not appeared again today on the hearing of the motion or the matter.  The matter was called three times outside the Court but there was no appearance for the defendant.
16Section 250 of the Criminal Procedure Act provides:
If the accused person does not appear on the day and at the time and place set by an order under Division 2 (or on a day to which a hearing has been adjourned), the court may, if satisfied that the order was served on the accused person:
(a) proceed to hear and determine the matter in the absence of the accused person, or
(b) if the court thinks the matter should not proceed on that day or without the accused person, adjourn the hearing to a specified time and place and make an order for the apprehension of the accused person under Division 2.
17The first precondition to making an order under s 250 is that the defendant has not appeared on the day and at the time and place set by an order under Division 2 or on a day to which a hearing has been adjourned.  The order under Division 2 in this case is the order under s 246 that the defendant appear before the Court to answer the offence charged in the order.  The day, time and place specified in the order made by the Court in this case was 29 November 2013 at 9.30 in the Court in Sydney.  The defendant did not appear at that time.  The hearing was adjourned to various days - 20 December 2013, 24 and 28 February 2014, 20 June 2014 and today, 14 July 2014 - but the defendant has not appeared on any of these days.
18The second precondition to making an order under s 250 is that the Court is satisfied that the order was served on the defendant.  In this case, the evidence establishes that the defendant was served at its registered office with the order under s 246, as well as the summons and accompanying affidavits, on 21 November 2013.  The evidence also establishes that the liquidators have been served with the summons and notified of the time and place set by the order at which the defendant was required to attend the Court to answer to the offence charged in the order.  The evidence further establishes that the liquidators have been notified of the subsequent times and places to which the matter has been variously adjourned.  
19Both the liquidators and the defendant at its registered office have been served with the notice of motion and accompanying affidavits, and the notification of the date set for hearing of the motion for the order under s 250 that the matter be heard and determined in the absence of the defendant.  I am, therefore, satisfied that the order and other process have been served on the defendant.
20Upon the two preconditions being satisfied, the Court has a discretion under s 250 as to whether to proceed to hear and determine the matter in the absence of the accused person.  In the circumstances of this case, it is appropriate to exercise the discretion to allow the matter to be heard and determined in the absence of the defendant.
21Under s 477(2)(a) of the Corporations Act, the liquidator of a company may defend legal proceedings in the name and on behalf of the company.  In this case, the liquidators have expressly stated, by their letter dated 21 November 2013, that they do not intend to appear in the proceedings or contest the case against the defendant company.  This statement of the liquidators is a statement of the defendant.  No other circumstances have been raised that would suggest that it would be unfair or unjust for the Court to proceed to hear and determine the matter in the absence of the defendant.
22I therefore determine that it is appropriate to exercise the power under s 250.  I do not consider it is necessary that the Court must proceed to hear and determine the matter in the absence of the defendant today (being the latest day to which the hearing has been adjourned from the original day of 29 November 2013 stated in the order under s 246) and that the Court may adjourn the hearing to another day.  I do not read s 250(a) as precluding this course.
23Accordingly, I order that:
(1)The matter proceed to a hearing and a determination in the absence of the defendant.
(2)The matter be adjourned to 8 August 2014.

2704780,McDonald v R [2014] NSWCCA 127,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with Fullerton J.
2PRICE J:  I agree with Fullerton J. 
3FULLERTON J:  The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by Sides DCJ on 13 March 2013 following a plea of guilty to one count of specially aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, contrary to 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  That offence attracts a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
4At the time of the offending the applicant was subject to parole for armed robbery together with a number of other matters which were taken into account on a Form 1.  A sentence of 4 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years was imposed in August 2009.  Her parole was revoked on her arrest on 14 November 2011.  The balance of parole of 1 year and 3 months and 25 days expired three days before the date of sentence.  The sentence was backdated to commence on 14 August 2012. 
5After applying a discount of 25 per cent for the early plea of guilty a sentence of 6 years and 9 months was imposed.  A non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months was imposed which reflected a finding of special circumstances as a result of an order for partial accumulation on the sentence for the previous armed robbery. 
6The applicant relies upon two grounds of appeal:Ground 1: There was an important error of fact in respect of the evidence given by the offender.  Sides DCJ noted incorrectly that the offender said that she had been sexually assaulted on only one occasion.  The evidence of the offender was that she had been sexually assaulted twice and on the second occasion by the male victim of the offence for which she was being sentenced. 
Ground 2: The appellant has recently been diagnosed with a serious psychiatric disorder that existed at the time of offending and sentence. 
7The second ground of appeal was the subject of amended grounds of appeal filed within days of the hearing.  
8The notice of intention to apply for leave to appeal was filed on 26 April 2013 exceeding 28 days from the date of sentence imposed under s 10(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) by 16 days.  On the same day an application for an extension of time was filed.  On 27 February 2014 a second notice of intention to appeal and extension application was filed with a supporting affidavit from the applicant's solicitor seeking to explain the further delay because of difficulties in obtaining transcripts of the sentencing proceedings (ordered on 31 May 2013 but not received until 21 November 2013) and issues with regard to obtaining a grant of legal aid to obtain the final report of Tim Watson-Munro (requested on 5 August 2013 but not granted until 25 September 2013).  
9The Crown accepted that there is an adequate explanation for the delay in prosecuting the appeal and no relevant prejudice to the victims or the administration of justice despite the delay (see Miles v R [2014] NSWCCA 72 at [55]) but submitted that the application for an extension of time should be refused because the application for leave to appeal the sentence is without merit.  For the reasons which follow, I am persuaded that submission is made out.
Proceedings on sentence 
10The sentence proceedings were heard on the day of sentence.  A statement of facts was tendered by consent together with a certificate pursuant to s 35A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  The Crown also tendered the applicant's criminal history, a pre-sentence report and victim impact statements. 
11The applicant gave evidence.  A report of Mr Watson-Munro dated 12 March 2013, marked by him as ""draft"", was tendered. 
12At the commencement of the sentencing proceedings the applicant's solicitor informed the sentencing judge that he had been advised that Mr Watson-Munro's report was a draft report because the results of psychometric testing administered by him had been misplaced.  On the appeal the applicant sought to tender a report of Mr Watson-Munro of 1 July 2014 in support of the second ground of appeal.  The Crown objected to the tender of the report. 
The facts for sentencing purposes
13The facts upon which his Honour relied for the purposes of sentence can be stated relatively succinctly.  
14On 13 November 2011 the applicant was at the home of Brendan Kelly drinking wine.  At some point they were joined by Alicia Russell.  The applicant and Mr Kelly had met approximately a week earlier and had started a relationship.  At some point in the evening the applicant accused Mr Kelly of cheating on her.  They had an argument in which the applicant slapped Mr Kelly in the face and threw a drink at him.  Mr Kelly told the applicant to leave.  Shortly afterwards Mr Kelly locked the house and went to bed with Ms Russell.  He was awoken by the sound of loud banging, and saw the applicant banging on the front door.  
15Mr Kelly told the applicant to go away.  The applicant demanded to be let in and threatened to smash the window.  She said, ""I wanna bash that girl inside"".  Mr Kelly again told the applicant to leave, at which point she smashed a window and spat in Mr Kelly's face twice through the window.  Mr Kelly called out to Ms Russell to call the police.  The applicant walked away.  Shortly afterwards Mr Kelly received a text message from the applicant saying, ""Well motha fuca we will be round"". 
16Mr Kelly and Ms Russell went to get help but were intercepted by the applicant and the co-offender, Kenneth Pitson.  Mr Kelly and Ms Russell went back into the house.  The applicant and Mr Pitson broke through the back door.  As Mr Pitson entered the premises he picked up a large kitchen knife.  He pointed the knife at Mr Kelly and yelled, ""How dare you rape her.  Who do you think you are?"".  The applicant repeatedly said, ""Stab him, stab him"". 
17Mr Kelly then heard Ms Russell screaming and the applicant saying, ""Give me your phone or I'm going to stab you"".  The applicant approached Mr Kelly and punched him in the face.  Mr Kelly observed the applicant throwing the victim around the room trying to take her phone from her.  The applicant said, ""If you don't get her phone off her I'm going to stab you"". 
18The applicant picked up a pair of scissors and held the scissors up against Ms Russell's neck, again threatening to stab her.  She took Ms Russell's wallet from her handbag but Ms Russell refused to surrender her phone.  The applicant stabbed Ms Russell in the shoulder blade with the scissors.  The police arrived shortly afterwards.  Ms Russell sustained two lacerations to her posterior right scapula that penetrated superficially into the subcutaneous tissue.  Both wounds were closed with sutures.  
Finding as to objective seriousness
19With regards to the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour noted that the applicant instigated the offence and continued in the joint enterprise after Mr Pitson withdrew.  He also found that the applicant had induced Mr Pitson to participate with her by persuading him that Mr Kelly had sexually assaulted her.  His Honour rejected any reasonable possibility that the offending was motivated by retribution finding that the sole motivation was revenge for what the applicant saw as Mr Kelly's infidelity.  
20His Honour described the offence as ""a serious home invasion"" where the applicant repeatedly directed Mr Pitson to stab Mr Kelly and where she inflicted serious physical violence on both victims, including the deliberate infliction of stab wounds to Ms Russell's scapula.  When considering the combined weight of the aggravating features in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, his Honour disregarded the fact that the offenders were unarmed when they entered the premises, only arming themselves with a knife and scissors upon entry.  He did accept however that the stab wounds inflicted by the applicant, amounting to actual bodily harm, were relatively superficial.  He also noted that it was not surprising that the victims were traumatised in the assault.  
21His Honour was not persuaded that the applicant's moral culpability was reduced by the intoxicating effects of alcohol and prescribed medication or any issues relating to her underlying mental health.  His Honour noted that she deliberately combined medication with alcohol; deliberately targeted Ms Russell; and was able to spin what he described as an elaborate story to coax the co-offender into joining in the joint criminal enterprise.  
22He was unable to find one way or another as to whether the applicant left the house of her own volition or because she became aware of the arrival of the police or their impending arrival.  
The applicant's subjective circumstances
23The applicant was 26 years old at the time of the offence.  She left school during Year 10, after which she worked on an intermittent basis in the retail industry with her last employment being in 2011.  She has two children: her first child was born when she was 16 and the second child when she was 19.  Mr Pitson is the father of her second child.  Both children reside with their maternal grandmother. 
24The applicant started using a combination of illegal substances and prescription drugs as a young teenager.  His Honour accepted that this was probably in an attempt to deal with a dysfunctional upbringing and the consequences of a sexual assault she suffered at the age of 14.  She completed the MERIT program in 2006.  She has also attended various residential drug rehabilitation facilities but has invariably relapsed into drug use.  At the time of sentence she was maintained on methadone.
25His Honour noted that the applicant had a lengthy criminal record including supervised bonds for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2005 and a home detention order in 2007 for offences of dishonesty, an order which was subsequently cancelled.  As noted above, in August 2009 she was sentenced to 4 years and 6 months with a 2-year non-parole period for one count of armed robbery and six other matters being taken into account on a Form 1 and was on parole for that offence at the time of the offending.  His Honour treated that as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  He noted that there was a pattern of reoffending whilst the applicant has been subject to conditional liberty in the past and that the pre-sentence report tendered on sentence gave no insights into her response to supervision whilst on parole for the armed robbery.
26The applicant served the balance of parole on protection after being assaulted in jail.  His Honour was satisfied that had not compromised her access to work or to sessions with a psychologist and a counsellor although he doubted whether she was receptive to addressing the various triggers to her recidivism.  His Honour concluded that whilst the applicant was motivated to remain drug and alcohol free on her release, her prospects of rehabilitation and not reoffending were poor.  
27He also noted that in the sentencing remarks for the armed robbery offence in 2009 the sentencing judge referred at some length to a psychological report which revealed that the applicant had multiple admissions to mental health facilities; had been treated for a major mood disorder; had been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder requiring ongoing treatment; and that she had been treated with antidepressants and antipsychotic medication.  Mr Watson-Munro's report did not refer to a history of hospital admissions for mental illness or to any Justice Health reports.  His Honour did note that Mr Watson-Munro described the applicant as being ""highly depressed and anxious"".  His Honour made no references to Mr Watson-Munro's reported diagnosis of a depressive illness, an anxiety disorder and substance abuse disorder, said to be based upon DSM-IV-TR criteria.  No complaint is made about the omission to refer to Mr Watson-Munro's opinion in this regard or to suggest its relevance to sentence was overlooked.
Ground 1
28The issue as to whether the applicant had been sexually assaulted in the past, and the number of occasions that might have occurred, and whether Mr Kelly had sexually assaulted her in the days preceding the offence, was raised in the material tendered by consent.  In the agreed statement of facts there is a reference to an ERISP in which the applicant participated on arrest in which she claimed to police that Mr Kelly had ""raped her"".  The facts also referred to Mr Pitson's ERISP in which he claimed that the applicant told him she had been raped.  The facts go on to record that the matter was considered by police but no charges were laid. 
29In the pre-sentence report dated 11 December 2012 there is a passing reference to the applicant reporting to the Probation and Parole officer that she was raped when she was 14 but that she had not previously disclosed the assault to anyone having blamed herself for the assault.  It was consequent upon this disclosure that she apparently agreed she would benefit from counselling to address intrusive memories relating to the assault. 
30In her evidence in chief no fresh allegation or further allegation of sexual assault by Mr Kelly was made.  The matter was however explored in cross-examination.  The following questions were asked: 
Q. Madam you remember when you were charged with this matter you were interviewed by the police officer on the 14th?A. Yeah.
Q. Remember?A. Yeah.
Q. November 2011.  And you made an allegation that one of the victims, [Mr Kelly], sexually assaulted you?A. Yeah I did.
...
Q. And the police made inquiries and they found out that is not true?A. They didn't - all right, yeah.  And I am not disagreeing with you.
Q. So you didn't tell the truth to police when the police--A. Yeah, I did the wrong thing, I did.  I sort of embellished a few details and extended - it wasn't that I lied, it was more of the fact of--
Q. If that is not a lie what is that?A. I wasn't lying, I was lying about - the thing is that I am still going through with my solicitor in regards to the sexual assault.  Now what I did change about it was the actual time, timeframe of that.  Now I did tell the police and then they come back and they said their case was closed.  I have never ever spoke to the police since about that.  So no I didn't lie, the time and date I changed.
...
Q. Anyway I'm putting to you, you're not telling the truth?A. All right, well that - you know just because somebody doesn't get charged with something doesn't mean something happens and as a rape victim I'm telling you right now that I am not a liar.
31In cross-examination she was also asked about an account she had given to a psychologist in the report tendered in the sentence proceedings for the armed robbery in 2009 where she said that she he had been sexually assaulted the previous year.  It was suggested by the cross-examiner that because it was her evidence that the only sexual assault other than at Mr Kelly's hand was when she was 14, she must have lied to the psychologist: 
Q. So is it the case that until you told Therese [the Probation and Parole officer] about it that you had not previously disclosed it to anybody?A. There were - there's two separate - there's two separate sexual assaults, I'm not really sure which one you're talking about. 
Q. Well in the pre-sentence report it refers to an incident in the school area where you and your girlfriend were raped?A. Yeah, that - I did - I didn't tell anybody else about that, yes I did tell Therese that.
Q. And Therese was the first person you told about it?A. Yes.  And I also asked her could she not say anything about it because I didn't want her putting that in any report or anything like that, so.
Q. Well was that the only time you claimed you've been raped?A. No.
Q. When else do you claim you were raped?A. There was that time when I was 14 years old and then the time that me and the Crown were just talking about just then. 
Q. Well when you sentenced by the judge in Newcastle there was a psychologist report before the Court wasn't there?A. Yes.
Q. And in his remarks his Honour says this, ""She told the psychologist there was no history of sexual abuse as a child but she had been sexually assaulted approximately a year previously"". Did you say something like that to the psychologist in 2008 or 2009?A. Yeah.
Q. Was that correct or not?A. I don't know whether they've got right or not but when I spoke to the person that wrote that report she started asking ... questions about it and I said to her that I didn't really want to talk to her.  Like when she started asking questions I'm like ""I just don't want to talk about it anymore"".
Q. But you must have conveyed to the psychologist in 2009 --A. Yeah.
...
Q. Well do you say now that apart from what you might claim Mr Kelly did to you that you were previously raped on two occasions? A. Once.  
... 
Q. It wasn't strictly true when you told Therese you had never disclosed the sexual assault previously was it?A. No I didn't realise that I had spoken to her about it, I - that didn't really come into my mind because I don't really see it as I was talking about it with the first - with the psychiatrist in 2009.[Emphasis added.]
32In his sentencing remarks his Honour considered whether the evidence allowed for a finding that the offence was motivated by retribution for a sexual assault perpetrated by Mr Kelly and, in that way, had the potential to mitigate the objective seriousness of the offending (see the discussion in R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130 at [109]-[115]).  
33His Honour rejected the applicant's allegation that Mr Kelly had assaulted her as motivating her to invade his home, being satisfied to the criminal standard that she was motivated by jealousy and a desire to exact revenge.  He came to that conclusion for a number of reasons.  First he regarded the applicant's claim as inconsistent with her stated belief that Mr Kelly had cheated on her; as inconsistent with the fact that, after she smashed the window, she said she wanted to ""bash"" Ms Russell; and inconsistent with Ms Russell being the target of her assault.  He also took into account that the applicant repeatedly demanded that Ms Russell hand over her mobile phone, the irresistible inference being that the applicant wanted to confirm that Ms Russell and Mr Kelly were in a relationship of some kind.  His Honour was satisfied (although not expressly to the criminal standard) that the applicant had also spun an elaborate story that she had been assaulted by Mr Kelly to coax her co-offender to participate in the offence. 
34The Crown submitted that these findings were reasonably open to the sentencing judge on the evidence.  
35The applicant complains that they were based on his Honour's misunderstanding of the evidence in the sense that he appears to have assumed that the applicant had conceded, in the extract of her evidence set out in [30] above, that she lied to police when she said Mr Kelly had sexually assaulted her when no such concession was made, and that she had lied when she told a psychologist in 2009 that she had been assaulted the previous year when, on a fair reading of that aspect of her evidence, she was unprepared to tell the psychologist that she had been abused as a teenager.  The applicant submitted that adverse findings as to her credit were made consequent upon these errors of fact and that this infected his Honour's view of the objective seriousness of the offending.   
36Save for his Honour finding that the home invasion and the offending committed in that context was not motivated by retribution but by jealousy, there is nothing in the sentencing remarks to support the submission that he found that the applicant was lying about having been assaulted by Mr Kelly.  To the contrary.  His Honour made express note on two separate occasions in his sentencing remarks that she maintained the truth of that allegation and that the failure of the police to charge him was because she provided the police with inaccurate information as to when the assault had occurred.  
37As the sentencing reasons make clear, his Honour did not need to find the applicant had made a false allegation about Mr Kelly to reject her explanation for the offending, even if her evidence might easily have supported a finding to that effect.  Furthermore, although his Honour found that the applicant had lied to a psychologist in 2009 when she said she had been raped the previous year, in light of her evidence that the only other rape had occurred when she was 14, he appeared to accept that the lie may be explained by her reluctance to talk about the assault and that she was currently seeking counselling assistance to address the issue.  
38The errors of fact contended for by the applicant are not established.  I would reject first ground of appeal.
Ground 2
39Consideration of this ground of appeal depends upon the report of Mr Watson-Munro of 1 July 2014 being admitted on the appeal over the Crown's objection.  I am satisfied that the report is inadmissible for a number of reasons.   
40Mr Watson-Munro was furnished with a transcript of proceedings on sentence and his Honour's sentencing remarks, together with a letter of instruction in which he was invited, inter alia, to comment upon the sentencing judge's findings as concerns the issue of motive in light of the detailed information he was provided about the alleged rape by Mr Kelly, on instructions from the applicant's solicitor, information not led at sentence and not sought to be led on the appeal.  Mr Watson-Munro also administered a self-reporting questionnaire which he described as ""canvassing psychological and physiological symptoms of depression and anxiety experienced by [the applicant] over the past fortnight"".  
41To seek to tender the report as constituting either fresh evidence or new evidence in these circumstances is to misunderstand entirely the application of established principle where evidence, properly satisfying the test of fresh or new evidence, may be received in an application to appeal against sentence.  To the extent that any part of the report was admissible as opinion evidence (about which I have grave doubts in any event), it would be limited to the question of re-sentence if error is otherwise established.  That was not the purpose of the tender nor the purpose for which the report was sought.  Rather, it seems to have been sought to provide some support for a challenge to the findings of the sentencing judge.
42The letter of instruction also specifically invites Mr Watson-Munro to consider a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder which he then purports to diagnose as consistent with the other psychiatric disorders he purported to have diagnosed in his earlier report.  
43Mr Watson-Munro identifies himself as a consultant forensic psychologist.  No curriculum vitae is attached to his report of 1 July 2014 as might provide a basis for him to offer an opinion about post-traumatic stress disorder, a recognised psychiatric disorder (whether referable to the results of recent research or the prevalence of the disorder), and perhaps to permit him to arrive at a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder in accordance with DSM-IV-TR criteria.  The curriculum vitae attached to his draft report of 12 March 2013 and included in the Appeal Book (at AB 97) attaches as Annexure A (at AB 102) a curriculum vitae from another practitioner.  Although there was no objection to the tender of Mr Watson-Munro's draft report in the sentencing proceedings, as I have noted, that report also includes a diagnosis of related disorders under DSM-IV-TR which I do not understand Mr Watson-Munro was relevantly qualified to make.
Order
44I propose the following order:Application for leave to appeal out of time refused.

2704783,Luong v R [2014] NSWCCA 129,"Judgment

1Hoeben CJ at CL: I agree with Price J.

2Price J: Duc Minh Luong, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Syme DCJ in the District Court at Campbelltown on 29 August 2013. 

3The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a single count of obtaining money by deception between 6 April 2007 and 12 January 2010 in that he dishonestly obtained $730,000 contrary to s 178BA(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He adhered to his plea in the District Court. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 178BA(1) is 5 years imprisonment. 

4The Judge discounted the sentence by 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. Her Honour found special circumstances. 

5The applicant was sentenced by the Judge to a term of imprisonment of 
3 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months to commence on 3 August 2014. 

6The sentence was accumulated upon the expiration of the non-parole period of a sentence that the applicant was serving for importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin, on 4 August 2010 contrary to s 307.1 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). This was a Federal offence for which he had been sentenced in the District Court at Sydney on 15 July 2011 to imprisonment for 6 years commencing on 4 August 2010 with a non-parole period of 4 years concluding on 3 August 2014. 

7As a result of the accumulation, the total effective sentence was 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. The earliest date that the applicant will be eligible to be released on parole is 2 February 2016.

8For the sake of convenience, I will refer to the s 178BA(1) offence as ""the fraud offence"" and the Federal offence as ""the drug offence"". 

9It is appropriate to observe that although the fraud offence was committed before the drug offence, the applicant was not charged with the fraud offence until 2012.

10The notice of appeal identifies two grounds:

1. The sentencing Judge erred in fully accumulating the sentence upon the non-parole period of the earlier sentence. 

2. The sentence is manifestly excessive. 

Facts 

11An agreed statement of facts was tendered which her Honour summarised in her remarks on sentence (ROS 1-2):

""In brief summary, it appears that prior to 2003 the offender was a licensed real estate agent. In about 2004 he sold his business to a third party. In 2006 the offender approached an acquaintance, a Mr Khan and fraudulently told him that he was able to sell him a property in Prestons for about 1.2 million dollars. In fact the offender had no such authority to sell the property and as far as the facts disclose the property was not on the market. Between April 2007 and January 2010 the offender prepared false documents including contract of sale, letters purporting to be from a conveyancer and other documents in order to continue to defraud Mr Khan in relation to the purported sale of the property. The offender maintained regular contact with Mr Khan giving the appearance the property sale was legitimate. On approximately 16 separate occasions the offender contacted Mr Khan and obtained further money from him by way of deposit, partial payment or other contractual obligations pursuant to the property and gave him documents purporting to be from conveyancers during that time. 

During the course of the offence Mr Khan was exploited and encouraged to make additional payments in order to get the property at a cheaper price. Mr Khan finally realised that the offender was not being frank with him in 2010 and after further investigations made a complaint. For unexplained reasons the offender was not spoken to or charged until 2012 but as disclosed in the facts on many separate occasions, on numerous occasions the offender extracted large sums of money from Mr Khan between $30,000 and over $100,000, the total of which, during the course of time was $730,000.""
Personal Circumstances 

12The applicant gave evidence before the Judge and a report from Kathryn Wakely, a forensic psychologist, dated 8 February 2011 was tendered. 

13The applicant was born in Vietnam on 18 February 1976 and was 37 years old when sentenced. He was the youngest of nine siblings. In 1988 he migrated to Australia with his family and lived generally in the outer suburbs of Sydney. He attended High School until year 12 and was an average student. After school, he attended TAFE to study accounting but left after six months. He completed a 12 month training course in management at Woolworths and was employed as a manager for about 3 years. 

14He began working in real estate in 2000 and was employed with Richardson and Wrench until 2002 whereupon he became a part owner of a real estate business. In 2004 he sold his share of the business but remained working there until 2006. Around this time he began to gamble and was experiencing associated financial difficulties. Since 2006, the applicant had not worked consistently but worked in casual positions. 

15Ms Wakely's report was prepared for the drug offence sentencing hearing. Ms Wakely reported that the applicant suffered from Pathological Gambling. She stated that his decision to participate in the drug offence was to assist him to clear a large gambling debt. Ms Wakely considered that the applicant was able to appreciate his previous gambling was highly problematic and reported a willingness to participate in treatment. 

16The applicant married in 1999 and there was one child of the marriage who was born in 2005. The applicant and his wife separated in 2010. Ms Wakely reported that the applicant said that his relationship with his wife had improved and he hoped to resume their marital relationship when he is released. 

17The applicant gave evidence before the Judge that the offences were committed so that he could pay off gambling debts owed to a loan shark. He said that if Mr Khan was present, he would say sorry to him. He told the Judge that he did not know whether his relationship with his wife would be restored upon release. The applicant said that he had completed the SMART drug and alcohol program while in custody. He said that this would assist him to overcome his gambling problem as it helped him to control his emotions. Whilst in custody, he also worked as a chef and commenced a hospitality course. 

18In answering questions from the Judge, the applicant said that he initially owed $30,000 to the loan shark but that he took $120,000 from Mr Khan. He said that he used this money to repay the loan shark and continued to gamble with the $90,000 he had left. He continued to defraud Mr Khan, losing $730,000 by gambling over three years. He said that there were probably no prospects of Mr Khan ever getting his money back. 

Some findings by the Judge 

19During her sentencing remarks, the Judge noted that ""[the applicant] did not disclose this serious fraud offence"" to the psychologist and the report was ""somewhat deficient"" (ROS 5). Her Honour found that the only connection between the fraud offence and the drug offence was the applicant's perceived need for funds to gamble. 

20The Judge said that the applicant had expressed little insight into the effect that the offence may have had on the complainant. Notwithstanding the applicant's expression of remorse during his oral evidence, her Honour said that it was difficult to accept his remorse as genuine. 

21Her Honour noted that at the time of committing the offence, the applicant was a person of prior good character but the length of time over which the offence was committed ameliorated this finding considerably. 

22Her Honour said that the applicant's ""fraudulent behaviour amounted to such serious criminal offending over a long period of time, that it is hard to see [his gambling] as an explanation..."" (ROS 7). 

23The Judge found that this was an offence of greed. Her Honour said that it was impossible to predict whether the applicant would fall into his gambling behaviour on release and it was ""therefore impossible to predict whether he will indulge in further offending behaviour or not"" (ROS 7).

24Her Honour observed that his prospects of rehabilitation ""will be dependent upon a number of issues including the support of his family and friends and the knowledge that his family and friends have in relation to his gambling addiction and the preparedness they have to support him"". However, her Honour said that she had no information on any of these issues (ROS 7). 

Ground 1: The sentencing Judge erred in fully accumulating the sentence upon the non-parole period of the earlier sentence. 

Argument 

25The applicant complained that the sentence for the fraud offence had been fully accumulated upon the non-parole period of the drug offence. As a result, the total effective sentence is 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years 6 months with a slight adjustment to the normal statutory ratio. The applicant pointed to the non-parole period representing approximately 73 per cent of the total effective sentence.

26The applicant argued that the Judge had erred in the exercise of her discretion when the subjective circumstances of the applicant, and especially his gambling, were inherently related to both offences. 

27In oral address, Ms Manuell SC for the applicant, submitted that the appeal essentially turned on the principle stated in Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63. Ms Manuell said that the applicant had committed two offences in the same context of his gambling addiction and had incurred a very large debt that he had no means of repaying. At the time he committed both offences, Ms Manuell said that the applicant was obviously under considerable pressure to pay the rates of interest demanded of him. Although the fraud offence was discovered in May 2010, Mr Manuell said that for some unknown reason the applicant was not charged with this offence until October 2012. 

28Ms Manuell accepted that the Judge had correctly asked what would have happened if the applicant had been sentenced for both offences at the same time. Ms Manuell submitted that the High Court in Mill goes on to say what is the effect of the delay and what was included in that was the impact on the applicant of the nearly 3 years he had spent in custody. Ms Manuell said that the applicant had lost money, had damaged his family relationship and suffered by going to gaol. Ms Manuell pointed out that the applicant had undertaken courses in hospitality and cooking and the Getting Smart program for gambling addiction. Ms Manuell contended that the Judge had no regard to those factors at all. Ms Manuell submitted that the proper approach for the Judge was to impose both a total sentence and non-parole period which was adjusted downwards to reflect the delay. 

29The Crown submitted that her Honour's discretion when imposing the sentence for the fraud offence did not miscarry and her application of the totality principle was correct. The Crown contended that the sentence for the drug offence could not comprehend and reflect the criminality of the fraud offence. The Crown pointed out that the non-parole period for the fraud offence was 42.9 per cent of the head sentence which represented a substantial departure from the usual proportion prescribed by s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). This in turn, the Crown said resulted in the total non-parole period being 73.3 per cent of the total sentence. In order to achieve this, her Honour found special circumstances in view of the need for a 2 year period of supervision and the fact that she was required to set an effective non-parole period for more than one offence. The Crown argued that for this reason, the applicant's submission that the sentence for the fraud offence should have been lowered below that which would otherwise be appropriate, should be rejected. 

Consideration 

30When sentencing an offender serving an existing sentence, the overall sentence must be ""just and appropriate"" to the totality of the offending behaviour. A court must look at the totality of the criminal behaviour and ask itself what is the appropriate sentence for all the offences: Mill at 63.

31As was said by the High Court in Mill at 63:

""Where the principle falls to be applied in relation to sentences of imprisonment imposed by a single sentencing court, an appropriate result may be achieved either by making sentences wholly or partially concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred.""


32Questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary: R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38. There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. If the sentence for the one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentence should be concurrent. If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences: Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41. 

33As in the present case where an offender is serving an existing sentence, the proper approach is to ask what would be likely to have been the effective head sentence and non-parole period if the offender had been sentenced at one time: Mill at 66-67.

34The Judge was clearly aware of these sentencing principles. The Judge referred to ""the issue of totality with respect to both sentences"" (ROS 6). 
Her Honour found that the only connection between the offences was the applicant's perceived need for funds to gamble. She observed that if the fraud offence had been sentenced at the same time as the drug offence, ""a total term of sentence would have been something approaching eight years"" (ROS 8). Her Honour was mindful of what was perceived to be the ratio under Commonwealth legislation between the non-parole and parole periods. The Judge said (ROS 8): 

""In attempting to replicate that position in my view the appropriate way to deal with this matter is to commence the date for sentence from the conclusion of the previous non-parole period and to add a further expanded supervision period to reflect the total time that he will spend in custody and the total time that he will spend under other forms of sentence, that is supervision with the community."" 

35It is argued that her Honour failed properly to take into account 'delay'. Mr Khan reported the fraud offence to police in about May 2010 and the applicant was not charged until October 2012. The delay in charging the applicant was not explained. 

36During the proceedings on sentence, Ms Robinson who appeared for the applicant told the Judge that the effect of the delay in charging the applicant was that ""he is now not eligible for work release"". The Judge responded by asking: 

""Well, if he was sentenced a year ago, he still wouldn't be eligible for work release, would he?"" 

37Her Honour said that when being interviewed by Ms Wakely for the drug offence the applicant ""could have come clean then."" Ms Robinson contended that the delay was important ""because had this matter been investigated in May of 2010, it could have been dealt with by the court at the same time he was to be sentenced for the importation."" Her Honour said:

""I don't think there is any disadvantage [in] sentencing now because there is still a year to go before he is eligible for parole. 
...

So I think rather than that being a mitigating matter, perhaps it is better - better or more practical - to address me on the issue of accumulation..."" 

38Ms Robinson submitted that there ought not to be full accumulation of the fraud offence and the sentence could start from that day. The Judge said that the fraud offence was:

""...not that old in terms of when it was - when it came to light because he kept Mr Khan on a string for a really long time."" 

39In her remarks on sentence her Honour was mindful of the delay in the prosecution of the fraud offence noting that there was no explanation for it. Whilst she referred to the submission that the delay may have caused hardship because of the applicant's inability to access custody work programs and there was uncertainty with respect to his sentence, her Honour was of the opinion that the delay was not a matter of such importance to ameliorate the sentence. She observed that the applicant could have admitted his part in the fraud offence at anytime and had not disclosed the offence to Ms Wakely. Her Honour was circumspect about the offender's remorse and the prospects of his rehabilitation. 

40Substantial unexplained delay in the charging of an offence may entitle an offender to a significant added element of leniency: Mill at 64-66; R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519; R v Blanco [1999] NSWCCA 121; (1999) 106 A Crim R 303 (applying Todd at 306). In Blanco, Wood CJ at CL said at [16]:

""The reason why delay is to be taken into account when sentencing an offender relates first to the fact of the uncertain suspense in which a person may be left; secondly to any demonstrated progress of the offender towards rehabilitation during the intervening period; and thirdly, to the fact that a sentence for a stale crime does call for a measure of understanding and flexibility of approach."" 

41However, the demonstration of substantial delay does not necessarily entitle an offender to leniency. As Wood J (as his Honour then was) said in R v V (1998) 99 A Crim R 297 at 300 (Gleeson CJ and Barr J agreeing): 

""As was pointed out in Thompson each case depends on its own circumstances. In some instances the delay can operate to the offender's advantage so far as it provides an opportunity, for example, for the offender to establish a new life and to positively demonstrate his rehabilitation. In other instances the period of the delay may lead to some constraint upon the offender's lifestyle or involve other detriment which may justify a degree of leniency."" 

42In my view, it was open to the Judge to find that the delay was not such that it ameliorated the sentence. Should the applicant have been sentenced for the two offences at the same time, a longer sentence would have been imposed. The applicant would not have been eligible for release on parole on 3 August 2014 or for work release at an earlier time. The applicant did not give evidence of any uncertain suspense or strain suffered as a result of the delay. This was not a stale offence but one that had been discovered by the victim after the applicant had defrauded him for over two and a half years. If the applicant had any concerns about delay in the prosecution of the fraud offence, it was always open to him to bring his offending to the attention of the police. The Judge was entitled to express her reservations about the applicant's remorse and prospects of rehabilitation. I am not persuaded that the applicant suffered detriment by the delay that entitled him to an element of leniency. 

43I do not detect any error in the approach taken by the Judge in sentencing the applicant. It was open to her Honour as an appropriate exercise of her sentencing discretion to accumulate the sentence for the fraud offence upon the expiration of the non-parole period of the drug offence. This resulted in a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months for the fraud offence which might be considered generous to the applicant. The total effective sentence was well within her Honour's sentencing discretion. In my opinion, the total effective sentence was just and appropriate to the totality of the applicant's criminal behaviour. I would reject Ground 1. 

Ground 2: The sentence is manifestly excessive.

Argument 

44The applicant submitted that the notional starting point of the sentence for the fraud offence of 4 years 8 months against a maximum penalty of 5 years represented a starting point for an offence in the worst category. Whilst accepting that the offence was undoubtedly serious, the applicant contended it was not in the worst category. The applicant argued that the Judge erred in giving too much significance to the objective seriousness of the offence and inadequate weight to the applicant's subjective case. It was submitted that the total effective sentence both as to the non-parole period and parole period is manifestly excessive. 

45The Crown pointed out that as the notional starting point for the fraud offence was close to the maximum penalty, it could be seen that her Honour did not impose the maximum penalty. As to the applicant's submission that the Judge gave inadequate weight to his subjective case and too much significance to the objective seriousness of the offence, the Crown said that matters of weight are classically within the discretion of a sentencing Judge. 

46The Crown submitted that in view of the non-parole period previously imposed for the drug offence (4 years) and the total non-parole period imposed by her Honour when the sentence for the fraud offence is accumulated (5 years 6 months), it could be seen that the applicant will serve only 18 months of the total minimum term for the fraud offence. 

Consideration 

47To establish this ground of appeal, the applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357.

48The amount of money, namely $730,000, that the applicant dishonestly obtained is undoubtedly an important matter in determining the objective seriousness of the offence but it is not the only matter: R v Hawkins (1989) 45 A Crim R 430 at 435. The fraud was committed over a long period of time, it was planned and sophisticated. The applicant's offending included the preparation of false contracts of sale, false letters from a conveyancer and the use of old receipts from the applicant's business. All of these matters justified her Honour's finding that the offence represented a high degree of criminality and ""would have attracted something approaching the maximum penalty"" but for the discount for the plea of guilty (ROS 3). 

49The imposition of the maximum penalty for an offence is reserved for cases falling within the worst category, which her Honour plainly recognised. The undiscounted starting point of 4 years 8 months was less than the maximum of 5 years. In my view, the undiscounted starting point was within the legitimate exercise of her Honour's sentencing discretion. 

50As to the complaint that the Judge failed to attribute sufficient weight to the applicant's subjective case, it is well established that the circumstances in which matters of weight will justify intervention by this court are narrowly confined: Majid v R [2010] NSWCCA 121. In any event, I am not persuaded that the Judge did not carefully consider and give appropriate weight to the applicant's subjective case. 

51The sentence imposed by the Judge for the fraud offence and the total effective sentence is not manifestly excessive. I would reject this ground of appeal. 

52Accordingly, the orders I propose are:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed. 

53Fullerton J: I agree with Price J.

		14 July 2014",2014-07-13 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2704788,State of New South Wales v Cusack [2014] NSWSC 941,"ex tempore Judgment
1This is an application under s 10A of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (the ""Act"") for an interim supervision order in respect of the respondent, Jeffrey Raymond Cusack. 
2Mr Cusack is 51 years of age.  He has an extensive history of criminal convictions.  Two sets of those convictions are especially relevant to this application.  On 8 June 1994 he was convicted on his plea of guilty to one charge of armed robbery, six charges of having sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, being the threatening of actual bodily harm to the victim with a knife, and one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  He was sentenced to various terms of imprisonment for those offences.  Their overall effect was to require him to serve a minimum term of five years and an additional term of two and a half years.  The earliest date that he was eligible for release on parole was 15 February 1998. 
3The second set of offences was committed on 21 June 2000 while Mr Cusack was on parole for the first set of offences.  They comprise one offence of having sexual intercourse in circumstances of aggravation, namely threatening to inflict actual bodily harm upon the victim with an offensive weapon, and one offence of detaining a person with intent to obtain an advantage.  A number of other sexual offences arising out of the same incident were taken into account in the course of his sentencing in accordance with the procedure set out in s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).  The overall effect of the sentences imposed for these offences was that Mr Cusack was required to serve a minimum term of ten years imprisonment expiring 20 June 2010, with an additional term of four years. 
4By way of brief summary, on 21 June 2000 Mr Cusack subjected a seventeen year old girl to being repeatedly raped and subjected her to serious threats of violence over a significant period of time.  The victim was the daughter of a woman Mr Cusack was living with.  He was significantly affected by alcohol and drugs when he committed the offences. 
5Mr Cusack was released to parole on 25 July 2012.  On 16 March 2014, Mr Cusack was breathalysed during an unannounced home visit.  This yielded a blood alcohol reading of .022.  He is also said to have acted aggressively towards the Community Corrections staff who attended.  This led to his parole being revoked. 
6On 9 May 2014, a summons was filed in this Court seeking, inter alia, an extended supervision order under s 9 of the Act.  The summons has been set down for final hearing on 19 August 2014. 
7On 4 June 2014, Hall J heard and granted an application for an interim supervision order.  His Honour imposed various conditions on that order pursuant to s 11 of the Act.  His Honour fixed the interim supervision order to operate from the date of expiry of Mr Cusack's sentence, namely 20 June 2014, and to extend for the maximum period of 28 days (see s 10C(1)).  This period is due to expire some time this week.  Accordingly, application is now made to extend the order. 
8Section 10A of the Act provides:
""Interim supervision order - high risk sex offender
The Supreme Court may make an order for the interim supervision of an offender if, in proceedings for an extended supervision order, it appears to the Court:
(a) that the offender's current custody or supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined, and
(b) that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order.
9I note that at the hearing of this application the legal representative for Mr Cusack indicated that, without making any admissions for the purposes of the final hearing, he did not oppose the making of the order. 
10There is room for debate as to whether an order under s 10A is one that could be made by the consent of the parties or, in fact, requires the Court to be independently satisfied that the preconditions for the making of the order are made out and that it is otherwise warranted.  I do not propose to resolve that debate.  Instead I have considered the material for myself. 
11In light of the criminal history of Mr Cusack, there is no doubt that he is an ""offender"" as referred to in s 10A.  Further, it is also clear that his current period of supervision will expire before the proceedings are determined.  Thus, s 10A(a) is satisfied.  There remains s 10A(b) to consider. 
12The ""supporting documentation"" referred to in s 10A(b) consists of the material supporting the principal application that addresses the criteria in s 9(3) and certain reports referred to in s 6(3)(b) of the Act.  Section 9(3) lists certain criteria that the Court must consider in determining applications for an extended supervision order or interim supervision order.  Those criteria in turn inform an assessment of whether a person such as Mr Cusack meets the definition of a ""high risk sex offender"" in s 5B, which is a necessary precondition to the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order as referred to in s 10A(b).  However, s 10A(b) also makes it clear that the assertions made in that supporting documentation are not to be evaluated in detail on applications such as this.  Instead it suffices if the ""matters alleged"" in the material justify such an order (see State of New South Wales v Reed (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 625 at [16] per McCallum J).
13I have reviewed the material that answers the description the ""supporting documentation"" and considered it against the criteria in s 9(3) of the Act.  Much of that material concerns Mr Cusack's extensive criminal history and his conduct while incarcerated.  There is no doubt that the matters alleged in that material when considered against the criteria in s 9(3), if proved, would justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order. 
14The ""supporting documentation"" also includes a number of assessment reports.  One of those reports concerns his performance in custody in the Custody Based Intensive Therapeutic Program (""CUBIT""). The report bears the date 27 June 2012 and records an assessment of Mr Cusack's ""static factors"" as leading to him being ""assessed as being in the high risk category of sexual offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders"".  The author of that report agrees with that assessment of the risk posed by Mr Cusack. 
15Another report included in the ""supporting documentation"" is a ""risk management report"" which is the report referred to in s 9(3)(d1) of the Act.  That report records an assessment undertaken of Mr Cusack using the ""Level of Service Inventory - Revised"" which found Mr Cusack to fall within the high risk category for serious and violent re-offending.  The author of that report supported the imposition of electronic monitoring as one of the conditions attaching to an extended supervision order. 
16There is also a risk assessment report prepared by a psychologist (see s 9(3)(c)).  That report records a lesser assessment of the risk of sexual re-offending posed by Mr Cusack and was generally dismissive of the utility of using electronic monitoring. 
17Before Hall J the only dispute that was raised for his Honour to determine was whether a condition of electronic monitoring should be imposed.  His Honour decided that it should be, but added a form of notation to the conditions which would modify its effect so as not to prevent Mr Cusack working at some work site approved by his supervising officer. 
18In terms of applying s 10A(b), I respectfully agree with his Honour's approach.  As I have indicated, it is not the function of the Court at this point to make any evaluation of the competing assertions that might be revealed by the supporting documentation.  Instead it is sufficient that the matters alleged in at least parts of the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order including an order that contains conditions requiring electronic monitoring. 
19Otherwise, as I have indicated, I have reviewed the material and the conditions.  The level of risk posed by Mr Cusack as asserted in the supporting documentation, the various factors that exacerbate that risk as supported in the supporting documentation and his general history of offending, in my view, warrant the making of the order and the imposition of the conditions that are proposed. 
20Accordingly, I will make the orders that are set out in the short minutes of order handed to me, which I will initial and place with the papers.  I will also initial and place with the papers the relevant conditions that are referred to in order 2.

		17 July 2014",2014-07-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704798,R v Hunter (No 14) [2014] NSWSC 1157,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1Mr Gary Hunter, a witness, has applied to have the conclusion of his evidence adjourned from now, Wednesday afternoon, until Friday morning of this week and, depending upon the state of his health, possibly longer.  2Regrettably, there have been a number of physical impediments already apparent in the trial to the reception and completion of Mr Gary Hunter's evidence.   3For example, first, he did not have his glasses with him whilst in the witness box, with the result that it was his position that he was unable to read handwritten or typed documents shown to him in cross-examination by the Crown Prosecutor.  4Secondly, earlier today he stated that the lights in court were hurting his eyes and, accordingly, I took the morning tea adjournment a little early, to facilitate his comfort.   5Thirdly, it is his position that he became unexpectedly ill in the cells today, and he informed me that, shortly after lunch, he was incapable of continuing. 
6An ambulance attended at my request.  A report was obtained with regard to his state of health, and that report will be retained on file.  7The fourth physical impediment is that Mr Gary Hunter did not attend court in answer to a subpoena on the first day of the trial, and was arrested pursuant to a bench warrant five days later, and has been bail refused since then.  8I am told that the remaining cross-examination by the learned Crown Prosecutor will be very short indeed, and that the cross-examination by learned defence counsel will not be overly lengthy, and certainly no more than one hour.  9As I say, at my request an ambulance was called and attended on Mr Gary Hunter in the cells, to ensure that his health was not endangered.  The report describes him as providing a history of headache, having vomited on a single occasion today, and severe abdominal pain.  He was offered transport and analgesia by the ambulance officer, but declined.  10In short, the trial has already been delayed for one week because of problems associated with the evidence being received of Mr Gary Hunter.  Although the trial is proceeding well, I consider that it is imperative that it proceed with reasonable dispatch. 
11Certainly, when Mr Gary Hunter gives evidence I would have thought that he should be provided at all times with two or three plastic cups of water, and also a box of Kleenex for his convenience.  I would have thought that, if he seeks it, there could be a break, perhaps every 20 minutes, of five minutes or so. 12As I have indicated, I did not force Mr Gary Hunter to give evidence today between shortly after 2 PM and now, close to 4 PM and, indeed, the jury was invited to leave us at about 3.30 PM.  In the circumstances, my proposal is that Mr Gary Hunter rest up this evening, obtain whatever medical treatment he is able to obtain, and return to the witness box at 10 AM tomorrow morning, but no later. 


13The result is that I will ask Mr Gary Hunter to leave us now, but be available to conclude his evidence at 10 AM tomorrow morning.

2704799,R v Hunter (No 13) [2014] NSWSC 1156,"ex tempore Judgment
1The Crown has made an application pursuant to s 32 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) to permit the witness, Mr Gove Junior, to attempt to revive his memory in the witness box by way of reference to a document, namely Crown voir dire exhibit BB.  2I have considered the provisions of s 32 and, in particular, s 32(2)(b)(i)(ii).  I have also considered the aspects that need to be taken into account with regard to a grant of leave by way of s 192 of the Evidence Act.  Without running through each of those seriatim, I consider that those factors as a whole argue in favour of the application being granted.    3Furthermore, I regard the evidence of what the accused allegedly said in Livingston Avenue on the afternoon of 20 June 2011, in particular with regard to alleged threats of retaliations, as highly probative.   4In the circumstances, I do not see any basis upon which, by way of any discretion, the procedure pursuant to s 32 should not be permitted.  5In short, having taken into account ss 32, 55, 137, and 192 of the Evidence Act, I propose to grant the Crown leave to have the witness use voir dire exhibit BB in an attempt to revive his memory in the witness box.

2704800,R v Hunter (No 12) [2014] NSWSC 1155,"EX TEMPORE Judgment
1Today in evidence, as I understand the testimony of Mr Gary Hunter, he was saying that yesterday on oath he had told lies about some topics.  A question arose in my mind, therefore, whether that admission could be used against him, and perhaps whether or not the certificate which I had granted him yesterday protected him. 2Having reflected on the matter, and having discussed it with both counsel, and having received indirectly the thoughts of Senior Counsel who was assisting the witness, I do not propose to revisit the question.  That is so for five reasons. 3First, as I understand it, this question of whether or not Mr Gary Hunter would give evidence that some of his evidence yesterday was a lie will not be revisited by either party.  4Secondly, I think it unlikely in the extreme that Mr Gary Hunter would ever be prosecuted for perjury arising from the evidence that he gave today or yesterday.  For example, I understand he has not been prosecuted with regard to the evidence he gave at the committal in January 2013 (with regard to which, again as I understand it, he had no certificate) which was clearly contrary to his sworn evidence at the committal of November 2012. 5Thirdly, my reading of the legislation is that, in any event, one simply cannot give a certificate that protects a witness with regard to the alleged falsity of his or her evidence. 6Fourthly, if it be the case that, when Mr Gary Hunter was asked today whether or not his evidence yesterday on oath was a lie, I should have informed him of a right to object at common law with regard to whether or not he had told lies on oath yesterday, I consider it quite likely that any evidence he gave today at any subsequent trial or hearing would be excluded pursuant to s 90 or s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). 7Finally, Senior Counsel for the witness has been contacted.  He is of the view, as I understand, that, at least, a s 128 certificate would not provide protection to the witness in these circumstances.
8It is for those reasons that I propose that we simply proceed without me saying anything to the witness Mr Gary Hunter.

2704810,Howard Smith & Patrick Travel Pty Ltd v Comcare [2014] NSWCA 215,"HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Between 1964 and 1982 Mr David Lindsay was employed by a stevedoring company (a predecessor of the present appellant) as a gearman at Port Kembla. His work required him at times to enter the holds of ships to recover gear, operate the steam winches used to unload ships and wash the clothes of waterside workers. From 1964 to 1974, he claimed to have been regularly exposed to asbestos dust, either from dust given off by worn asbestos lagging on pipes and steam winches or from loose asbestos in the holds of the ships. 

Stevedoring operations were during that time regulated by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority (""the Authority""). Established under the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956 (Cth) (""the Act""), the Authority was to perform its functions and exercise its powers ""with a view to securing the expeditious, safe and efficient performance of stevedoring operations"" (s 8), a requirement given greater specificity throughout the Act. While it did not employ waterside workers, the Authority assigned registered waterside workers to different stevedores, with employment being on a job-by-job basis. Mr Lindsay was not a registered waterside worker under the Act because he was permanently employed (s 7), thus not having the same direct relationship with the Authority. Nevertheless, his employer was registered under the Act, did employ registered waterside workers and the work was subject to control by the Authority.

In October 2008, Mr Lindsay was diagnosed with mesothelioma. He died in 2010. Prior to his death, he commenced proceedings against the respondent, Comcare, the successor to the Authority's liabilities. The respondent settled the claim and sought to recover from the appellant as a joint tortfeasor under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW). For a contribution to be recovered, it needed to be established that both the appellant and the respondent were liable. The Dust Diseases Tribunal found for the respondent and ordered the appellant to pay 75% of the damages as a contribution.

The issues for determination on appeal were: 

(i) Whether the evidence identifying the dust inhaled by the deceased as asbestos was inadmissible as opinion evidence; 
(ii) Whether the class of persons the respondent owed a duty of care was limited to registered waterside workers;
(iii) Whether the evidence established a breach of duty;
(iv) Whether the Tribunal erred in the amount of contribution ordered to be paid.

The Court held, dismissing the appeal:

In relation to (i):

1. The admissibility of evidence as to the identity of a substance depends on the issue in dispute. Where there is no attempt made to distinguish types of airborne material, the evidence may be admitted as an account of perceived facts based on knowledge which was common to those with relevant experience. Evidence of exposure to asbestos dust, given by workers was not inadmissible as opinion evidence: [27]-[29]; [70]

In relation to (ii):

2. The duty of care owed by the Authority extended to those at risk of inhaling airborne asbestos in the course of a stevedoring operation, which was an indivisible activity. It would be incongruous to conclude that the only persons owed this duty were registered waterside workers and not those in regular employment at the same place: [47]-[49]; [72]-[73]

Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee [1999] HCA 59; 200 CLR 1; Graham Barclay Oysters v Ryan [2002] HCA 54; 211 CLR 540 applied.
Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee v Gibson [2000] NSWCA 179; 20 NSWCCR 417; Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649 considered.

In relation to (iii):

3. Once the evidence of the workers was admitted, together with evidence of awareness of the Authority of exposure and associated risks, the argument that there was no evidence to establish a breach of duty was without substance: [60]-[63]

In relation to (iv):

4. There was evidence on which the Tribunal could assess the relative culpability of the parties. No error of law was disclosed in the apportionment of responsibility made by the Tribunal: [66]-[67]




			Judgment
1BEAZLEY P:  I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Basten JA.  I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he proposes.  I also agree with the additional reasons of Sackville AJA.
2BASTEN JA:  In October 2008 David Lindsay was diagnosed with mesothelioma.  He died on 24 July 2010.  Prior to his death, he brought proceedings against Comcare (as the successor to the liabilities of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, ""the Authority""), alleging negligent exposure to asbestos dust whilst working on the waterfront at Port Kembla.  Comcare settled the claim brought by Mr Lindsay, a consent judgment being entered, ""without admission of liability"", on 9 April 2009 in an amount of $350,000.  After Mr Lindsay's death, Comcare commenced proceedings in the Dust Diseases Tribunal against the present appellant, a former employer of Mr Lindsay, seeking contribution pursuant to s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (NSW).  On 21 June 2013 the Dust Diseases Tribunal made an award in favour of Comcare in an amount of $335,125.
3The appellant challenged the judgment against it on two primary bases.  First, it challenged the underlying premise that the Authority owed a duty of care to the deceased worker: notice of appeal, ground 5.  (Not having been a party to the proceedings between the worker and Comcare, it was not bound by the judgment in that case.)  Secondly, it objected to the evidence of exposure to ""asbestos dust"", given by Mr Lindsay and other workers with experience on the waterfront.  It submitted that their evidence should have been rejected as opinion evidence as it involved a conclusion as to the identity of the airborne material they inhaled, based on no relevant expertise and which did not need to be given in that form to provide an adequate understanding of their perceptions: grounds 1-4.
4There were a series of further or secondary grounds of appeal (6-9), identification of which may be deferred to a later stage.  The right of appeal to this Court was limited to an erroneous decision of the Tribunal in point of law or on a question as to admission or rejection of evidence: Dust Diseases Tribunal Act 1989 (NSW), s 32(1).  Not all of the grounds set out in the notice of appeal were articulated in terms which clearly fell within the scope of this provision.
5For the reasons given below, the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.
6Although it may be logical to consider first the alleged duty of care accepted by Comcare, that issue requires reference to the circumstances in which the worker was exposed to asbestos dust, a matter which will become clearer following consideration of the evidence.  Accordingly it is convenient to deal first with the challenges to the admissibility of evidence.
Undisputed facts7Mr Lindsay worked on the Port Kembla waterfront from 1961 until 1988.  He claimed to have been exposed to asbestos dust during his employment from about 1964 until 1974 with Port Kembla Stevedoring and Agency Co Pty Ltd (""Port Kembla Stevedoring""), a predecessor of the appellant.  Although the appellant denied that he was employed by its corporate predecessor, the Tribunal held that he had been so employed and the matter was not in dispute on the appeal.
8Pursuant to the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956 (Cth) employers of waterside workers were required to be registered with the Authority.  Waterside workers were also registered with the Authority.  Although Port Kembla Stevedoring was a registered employer, Mr Lindsay was not registered as a waterside worker.  Rather, from 1964 until 1982 he was continuously employed as a stevedoring gearman and wire rope splicer.  He said he had not been exposed to asbestos otherwise than whilst working for Port Kembla Stevedoring.  Unlike waterside workers who, during at least part of that period, were employed on a job by job basis and allocated work by the Authority, Mr Lindsay was in fulltime employment.
9The Tribunal accepted that Mr Lindsay worked alongside waterside workers, sometimes in the holds of ships and sometimes on steam winches.  At times he was responsible for washing clothes of waterside workers.  He drove a truck loaded with gear used by waterside workers in loading and unloading ships; the gear was often left in the holds of ships or on the wharves: at [14].  There was lagging on steam pipes in the holds of ships and also on pipes carrying steam to the ship's winches.
10While there was a dispute as to much of the evidence relating to the exposure to asbestos dust, there did not appear to be any issue raised by the appellant as to the following matters.  First, asbestos products were used as lagging to insulate pipes carrying steam, both in ships' holds and on steam winches.  Secondly, although cargos of asbestos were ""not normally unloaded"" at Port Kembla (judgment at [24]) ships which carried asbestos, particularly for discharge at Sydney, would continue to Port Kembla.  If there were loose asbestos in the holds following the unloading of part of the cargo at Sydney, the holds would not have been cleaned before Port Kembla.
Evidence of exposure to asbestos dust11Apart from the general propositions set out above, the evidence of Mr Lindsay's actual exposure to asbestos derived from two main sources.  First, there was his own statement, provided by way of particulars to his claim, the correctness of which he affirmed by affidavit on 16 April 2009.  In answer to the question ""How were you exposed to asbestos?""  He stated that ""on average"" he would spend several hours each day below deck on ships: question 4.1, answer (b).  The particulars continued:
""d. I was exposed to asbestos in various ways because of my work.  One of the ways I was exposed to asbestos was because of its presence on ships.  In the holds of ships, bags of loose asbestos were often stored for use as lagging on the ships.  When I was in the holds, I had to move this lagging to access the cargo.  Asbestos dust was given off from the bags as a result.
e. In addition, to get to the holds of some ships, it was necessary to travel some distance below deck.  This included going through sections of ships with asbestos-lagged steam pipes, and also going into and adjacent to engine rooms.  These were dusty areas of the ships, usually with a visible layer of dust on flat surfaces.  I also sometimes brushed against the asbestos lagging below deck.  I was exposed to asbestos dust because of this work.
f. When I first started in about 1964 as a stevedoring gearman and wire rope splicer, steam winches were used for unloading most of the ships.  I operated this machinery on occasion.  The winches, and particular the steam pipes which drove them, were lagged with asbestos slurry and rope.  Often this lagging was worn and dust was given off from the lagging by the operation of the winch.  I inhaled this dust.  By the mid-1970s, most of the ships did not have steam winches.
g. Another way I was exposed to asbestos was from loose asbestos cargo.  I was sometimes involved in the rigging of this cargo for its removal from the ships.  The asbestos cargo was loaded into a sling and lifted out of the hatch on to the wharf.  I was also involved in re-stacking it.  The Hessian bags were pretty strong.  However, sometimes they had holes in them and indeed, sometimes the work of unloading them tore holes in the bags.  When this happened, asbestos dust came out of the bag and I breathed it in.
h. Many of the ships I worked on went to Sydney first, and then came to Port Kembla.  Frequently, these ships had asbestos cargo on board which had been unloaded in Sydney.  When these ships arrived in Port Kembla there was no longer any asbestos cargo on board, but there was plenty of asbestos dust and fibre still in the ship and all over the remaining cargo.  I understand the holds were not cleaned in Sydney after the asbestos was unloaded.  This meant that as soon as I commenced unloading the remaining cargo the asbestos dust and fibre that had settled was disturbed and as a result I breathed it in.""
12Objection was taken to the admissibility of each sentence in these paragraphs where Mr Lindsay expressed an opinion about the substance being asbestos: Tcpt, 17/04/13, p 43(25).  
13Secondly, reliance was placed on statements from three other workers, since deceased, given in other proceedings in the Tribunal, namely Lionel David Foley (22 November 2000), Philip Munro (26 November 2001) and Barry William Wales (20 December 2001).  Each contained a detailed account of the deponent's work experience, starting on the Sydney waterfront.  
14Mr Foley worked on the Sydney waterfront from 1948 to 1958: at pars 12, 14 and 20.  He described unloading ""bundles of asbestos fibro"" which he was told were bound for the Housing Commission: pars 28-29.  He continued at par 30:
""The cargos were contained within hessian bags.  The one name that sticks in my mind is John Manville.  The ships came in from Canada with asbestos cargo mixed with other cargo; in particular it was often carried with paper.  Occasionally the asbestos was also used as a buffer cargo for heavier cargo ....""
15He identified wharves at which he unloaded asbestos from deep sea vessels, the name of the stevedoring companies and on occasion the shipping lines.  He described how the asbestos was stored:
""33. The asbestos was carried in hessian bags.  The bags were not lined and the weave was a loose weave.  These bags were stowed one on top of the other and next to each other.  They were tightly packed so that the ship carried as much cargo as possible.
34. We would unload the cargo using a [rope] sling.  ...  
...
36. Depending on the manner in which the ship had been loaded, sometimes we had to work our way down to the very bottom hole to unload the cargo to be deposited at that particular wharf.  ...  All the cargo would be smothered with the asbestos.  Often you could leave the 'tween alone because the cargo loaded in them would not be in the way. ...
37. The asbestos was a very light cargo and very dusty.  It was stored in the holds of the ships in the upper or lower tween decks, which were above the waterline.  It was also stowed in the lockers and in the deep tanks right at the bottom of a ship.
38. We worked in pairs.  One of us would hook the bags in order to move them from where they were stowed to the square and then load them into the sling, which would lift them from the hold onto the deck.  If the bags were in the lockers we would drag them from the lockers we would use our hooks and our hands to sling the bags.  As a general rule we would get up to 15 bags of asbestos onto a sling ....
39. The bags would rip when I hooked them to haul them out and when we put the slings around the bags they would often burst and the air would fill with dust.  The bags had a tendency to tear very easily.  When the sling was reeved, loose dust would be released.  ...  If the bags broke (and this happened frequently) the asbestos would go everywhere and I couldn't see the hatch. ...""
16From 1958 to 1984, Mr Foley worked at Port Kembla: par 20.  He had one specific recollection of discharging a cargo of asbestos from a coastal vessel, but was told that after his shift the cargo was returned to the vessel.  He had no other recollection of discharging asbestos at Port Kembla.  The main cargos were steel, iron, tinplate, general cargo and paper: par 53.  His affidavit continued:
""54. The ships carrying paper cargo stopped in Sydney first if they had asbestos on board in order to unload the asbestos cargo.  When these ships arrived in Port Kembla there was no longer any asbestos cargo on board but there was plenty of asbestos dust and fibre still in the ship and all over the paper cargo.  In my experience ships were not cleaned in Sydney after the asbestos was unloaded.  This meant that as soon as I and the other wharfies commenced unloading the paper cargo the asbestos dust and fibre that had settled were disturbed and as a result became airborne.  I saw asbestos fibres floating in the hatch.
55. Throughout my time as a waterside worker[,] I worked on steam driven ships where hot pipes were lagged with asbestos.  This included the steam pipes, which operated the winches on old vessels.  Often the lagging on the steam pipes would be worn and we called on the gear man, who was a seaman, to re-lag the pipes.  I saw [them] wrapping asbestos rope around the pipes.""
17Mr Munro gave similar evidence as to the experience on the Sydney waterfront.  At par 20 he stated:
""I recall unloading asbestos from a number of different shipping lines.  I unloaded Manville asbestos.  Waterside workers were familiar with Tommy Manville as he was he man with 9 wives.  I unloaded asbestos from the Straat boats, Bank boats, City boats and from Western Australian State Boats.  I remember the asbestos came from South Africa, Canada and Western Australia.  I have worked unloading asbestos from the 'Kangaroo' and the 'Koolarra' both of which came from Western Australia.  They carried blue asbestos.   There were other boats from Western Australia that carried asbestos too.""
18Mr Munro also moved to Port Kembla, in 1967.  He stated:
""28. At Port Kembla I was never required to unload or stack asbestos cargo.  However I continued to be exposed to an inhale asbestos dust in various ways.  The use of steam winches on all of the BHP 'Iron' boats was a regular thing at Port Kembla.  The steam winches had hot pipes all round the seat where I and other waterside workers sat when driving the winches.  All of the pipes that were only centimetres away from our body and face were insulated with white asbestos cloth that was wrapped around.  The asbestos lagging was always damaged and hanging off.  It was also in bad repair and brittle.  On the steam winches, on the left hand side was the steam control and when I used it the steam winch vibrated and the asbestos lagging on the pipes shook and dust went in the air.  The lagged pipes were very close to my face.  Sometimes the lagging was so damaged and brittle that I told the foreman to relag the steam pipes before I operated the winch.  ...  I operated a steam winch or was present when someone else operated it regularly at Port Kembla until the late 1970s.
29. At Port Kembla I worked in the holds of many dirty and dusty ships.  There were occasions when there was loose asbestos in the holds on some of the ships that came to Port Kembla after unloading at Sydney.  It was just lying on the floor in clumps or it just lay on top of other cargo.  As we worked down below we disturbed it and it was dusty.  I cannot recall how frequently I worked in a hold contaminated with asbestos at Port Kembla, but I know that some of the ships like the Straat line came to Port Kembla and I worked in the holds.  These were the same ships that carried asbestos when I worked in Sydney.""
19Mr Barry Wales also worked on the Sydney waterfront from 1956 to 1966: par 20.  He gave a similar detailed description to that given by Mr Foley and Mr Munro, including naming similar ships as those carrying asbestos.
20In 1966 he transferred to Port Kembla where he continued as a waterside worker until well beyond 1983.  He gave similar evidence as to contact with asbestos in ships while at Port Kembla, again not having unloaded asbestos cargo there: pars 31-33.
Principles relevant to admissibility21Generally evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about which the opinion was expressed and which the opinion is tendered to prove: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 76(1).  The rule does not apply to evidence which constitutes an account of perceptions of facts; nor does it apply if the opinion is based on what the witness perceived and is necessarily so expressed to obtain an adequate understanding of the perception: s 78.  Further, the rule does not apply to ""expert"" opinion.  By that is meant opinion wholly or substantially based on ""specialised knowledge"" which in turn is based on the witness's ""training, study or experience"": s 79(1).  There is, it has been remarked on more than one occasion, a continuum between evidence of objective facts and expert opinions; what are described as lay opinions may fall somewhere along that spectrum between the two identified poles.  Further, it is necessary to draw a distinction between expert opinion based on study and training and expert opinion based on experience.  Although study and training are a form of experience, they tend to assume the imparting of specialised knowledge by another expert, through a process with some degree of formality and structure, rather than unstructured self-trained acquisition of specialised knowledge. 
22In the present case, none of the waterside workers claimed any specialised knowledge by study or training.  The question is rather, particularly in the cases of Messrs Foley, Munro and Wales, whether by working on the Sydney waterfront for periods of some 10 years each, they acquired a degree of experience sufficient to allow them to identify the fibrous substance with which they worked on many occasions as asbestos.  If so, they may have acquired ""specialised knowledge"" sufficient to satisfy s 79.  On the other hand, it is clear that common knowledge is also acquired by experience and may be identified as a perception. 
23The proper analysis in the present case must commence with identification of the facts sought to be proved.  The ultimate fact was that the deceased was exposed to airborne asbestos dust or fibre in the course of his employment with Port Kembla Stevedoring.  To do that he sought to establish that there was loose asbestos in the holds of ships in which he worked, on cargos which he helped to unload, as lagging on steam pipes in the holds of ships and on the piping of steam winches which he helped to operate.  With respect to the lagging, he further needed to establish that it tended to come loose and disintegrate, thus causing dust or airborne fibres which were likely to be inhaled.  It was not in doubt that he could give evidence of his perceptions of dust and fibrous material: the only question was whether, through his own evidence or the evidence of the other workers, he could establish on the balance of probabilities that the dust was asbestos.  
24Asbestos may be identified as a silicon based mineral found in various types, each with its own specific chemical formula.  No doubt it requires specialised knowledge to identify the chemical formula of a particular fibre, but that information is not necessary in order to identify asbestos fibre prepared for industrial use.  Thus, whether expert knowledge is required to form a particular opinion depends on the specific fact to be established and the context in which it is to be established.  Anyone can identify water without knowing its chemical composition.  However, if confronted with two colourless, odourless liquids, one of which is thought not to be water, specialised knowledge may be required to make the necessary distinction.
25People who work with particular materials may acquire knowledge which is not common to the population at large.  A carpenter may be able to identify a wide range of woods, a skill which others would not possess.  If the question is whether particular wood was walnut or mahogany, it might be necessary to know whether the person expressing an opinion had experience with each of those timbers.  There may be also a question as to how the ability to distinguish was originally acquired.  It is true that waterside workers did not construct or manufacture from the materials they handled.  Nevertheless, manual handling and knowledge of shipping will undoubtedly form a basis upon which to identify cargos in an age before cargos travelled in uniform boxes or containers.
26If there were evidence of cargos being unloaded in Sydney which were light and fibrous and contained in hessian bags, coming from Canada, South Africa or Western Australia, there might have been a live issue as to whether experienced waterside workers could distinguish asbestos fibre from other forms of fibre.  However, no such issue arose.  For example, it was not in dispute that two or three ships a month discharged asbestos in the Port of Sydney during the 1960s.  It is also not in dispute that lagging on steam pipes consisted of a form of asbestos rope.  Further, no question arose in the present case as to the quantification of Mr Lindsay's exposure.  
27It was clear from the evidence of the three deceased workers that their jobs involved identifying relevant cargo, ""usually by word of mouth"", as explained by Mr Munro, at par 10.  After describing in detail the manner of unloading and stacking asbestos cargos, he noted that it was ""always the same"": at par 21.
28Given the proper identification of the issue to which the evidence went, the experience of the individual workers over many years and the fact that no attempt was being made to distinguish types of asbestos or quantities of airborne material, what they described was based on what was, for them, common knowledge.  Their evidence in that regard was admissible as evidence of a fact which they perceived.
29It may be accepted that Mr Lindsay's exposure to what the other workers identified as asbestos was more limited than theirs.  Nevertheless, he described exposure as occurring ""regularly"" from about 1964 until the early 1970s.  Despite lesser exposure, there is no reason to suppose that what was common knowledge amongst the waterside workers was not also common knowledge for Mr Lindsay.  It may be that not all of the dust and fibre described as asbestos was in fact asbestos, but again the contextual evidence did not suggest that it was likely to constitute other similar fibres which were not readily distinguishable.  Mr Lindsay's evidence was admissible on the same basis as that of the other workers.
Stevedoring Industry Authority - duty of care30The appellant challenged the finding of the Tribunal that the Authority owed a duty of care to Mr Lindsay.  It accepted that the Authority owed a duty of care to waterside workers, a proposition which flowed inevitably from the decision in Crimmins v Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee [1999] HCA 59; 200 CLR 1.  However, the appellant, noting the Tribunal's reliance on Crimmins, submitted that Crimmins was distinguishable and did not dictate the result in the present case.  The Tribunal, the submission continued, was also in error in relying on Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee v Gibson [2000] NSWCA 179; 20 NSWCCR 417, a case dealing with a waterside worker whose exposure arose in the Port of Sydney.  (The Court in Gibson undertook an expansive review of the facts, as then required because appeals from the Tribunal were not limited to points of law, a matter noted by Mason P at [159].)
31The Tribunal identified two main differences from the circumstances of those cases, namely that Mr Lindsay worked at Port Kembla (where asbestos was not loaded or unloaded) and that he was not a registered waterside worker: at par 30.  The reasoning continued:
""However, he worked for a registered stevedoring company and worked with Waterside workers who were exposed to asbestos during the course of their working day.  This meant that he also was exposed to asbestos.""
32The Tribunal further noted that the Authority had ""port inspectors"" and had ""control of stevedoring operations in Port Kembla just as it had in other ports"": at pars 31 and 32.  The Authority ""could have stopped work being carried out on vessels that had asbestos in their holds and could have directed that no work be carried out until the workers were protected from exposure to asbestos on steam pipes on winches and within ships"": at par 35.
33On the appeal, the points of distinction relied upon by the appellant were both factual and legal.  The factual considerations were that (a) Mr Lindsay did not unload cargo; (b) asbestos was not loaded or unloaded at Port Kembla, and (c) the work conditions at Port Kembla with respect to asbestos were not comparable to those at Sydney or Melbourne.  Each point of distinction may be accepted, but, by reference to the relevant principles for determining whether or not a duty existed, they are of little significance, either individually or collectively.  
34The appellant was on stronger ground in identifying the differences in the legal relationship between the Authority and Mr Crimmins and Mr Gibson, on the one hand, and Mr Lindsay, on the other.  Thus, Mr Lindsay was (a) in continuous employment and not part of a casual workforce; (b) not a registered waterside worker, and (c) not subject to direct control by the Authority.  The respondent contended that the points of distinction were immaterial, relying upon some broad statements as to the operation of the Authority in the reasons of Mason P in Gibson at [35]-[37].  However, as the President noted at [36], it would be ""entirely unproductive to traverse in any detail the statutory material and legal principles"" given the decision in Crimmins.  Because, in the present case, there are points of distinction from Crimmins it is necessary to return to the statute.
35Before doing so, it is helpful to identify the legal principles to be applied in determining whether a defendant owed a duty of care to a plaintiff.  
Legal principles - duty of care36The statements of principles to be applied in determining whether a defendant owes a plaintiff a duty of care have undergone a degree of linguistic metamorphosis over the last two decades.  It is now common in this country to require reference to the ""salient features"" of the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant.  In Caltex Refineries (Qld) Pty Ltd v Stavar [2009] NSWCA 258; 75 NSWLR 649, Allsop P provided a list or catalogue of some 17 salient features, described as ""a non-exhaustive universe of considerations of the kind relevant to the evaluative task of imputation of the duty and the identification of its scope and content"": at [103] and [104].  However, the value of such a catalogue is limited.  As noted by McHugh J in Crimmins at [77]:
""Since the demise of any unifying principle for the determination of the duty of care and the general acknowledgment of the importance of frank discussion of policy factors, the resolution of novel cases has increasingly been made by reference to a 'checklist' of policy factors.  The result has been the proliferation of 'factors' that may indicate or negative the existence of a duty, but without a chain of reasoning linking these factors with the ultimate conclusion.  Left unchecked, this approach becomes nothing more than the exercise of a discretion ....  There will be no predictability or certainty in decision-making because each novel case will be decided by a selection of factors particular to itself.  Because each factor is only one among many, few will be subject to rigorous scrutiny to determine whether they are in truth relevant or applicable.""
37Dealing with a case involving a public authority, McHugh J identified six questions, the answers to which might determine the existence or absence of a duty of care: at [93]; see also Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Ryan [2002] HCA 54; 211 CLR 540 at [84].
""1. Was it reasonably foreseeable that an act or omission of the defendant, including a failure to exercise its statutory powers, would result in injury to the plaintiff or his or her interests?  If no, then there is no duty. 
2. By reason of the defendant's statutory or assumed obligations or control, did the defendant have the power to protect a specific class including the plaintiff (rather than the public at large) from a risk of harm?  If no, then there is no duty. 
3. Was the plaintiff or were the plaintiff's interests vulnerable in the sense that the plaintiff could not reasonably be expected to adequately safeguard himself or herself or those interests from harm?  If no, then there is no duty. 
4. Did the defendant know, or ought the defendant to have known, of the risk of harm to the specific class including the plaintiff if it did not exercise its powers?  If no, then there is no duty. 
5. Would such a duty impose liability with respect to the defendant's exercise of ""core policy-making"" or ""quasi-legislative"" functions?  If yes, then there is no duty. 
6. Are there any other supervening reasons in policy to deny the existence of a duty of care (e.g., the imposition of a duty is inconsistent with the statutory scheme, or the case is concerned with pure economic loss and the application of principles in that field deny the existence of a duty)?  If yes, then there is no duty.""
38Gummow and Hayne JJ in Graham Barclay noted that the existence or otherwise of a common law duty of care allegedly owed by a statutory authority ""turns on a close examination of the terms, scope and purpose of the relevant statutory regime"": at [146].  The joint reasons continued at [149]:
""An evaluation of whether a relationship between a statutory authority and a class of persons imports a common law duty of care is necessarily a multi-faceted inquiry.  Each of the salient features of the relationship must be considered.  The focus of analysis is the relevant legislation and the positions occupied by the parties on the facts as found at trial.  It ordinarily will be necessary to consider the degree and nature of control exercised by the authority over the risk of harm that eventuated; the degree of vulnerability of those who depend on the proper exercise by the authority of its powers; and the consistency or otherwise of the asserted duty of care with the terms, scope and purpose of the relevant statute.  In particular categories of cases, some features will be of increased significance.""
39The joint reasons also noted that ""[t]he factor of control is of fundamental importance in discerning a common law duty of care on the part of a public authority"": at [150].  
Application of principles40The relevant factual findings have been outlined above.  Mr Lindsay did not unload asbestos, nor was he directly involved in unloading cargo.  Nevertheless, he worked in close proximity to waterside workers who were unloading cargo and worked about ships in circumstances where there was loose asbestos capable of being inhaled by both waterside workers and others whose duties required them to be in the immediate vicinity, whether in ships holds or working steam winches.
41The statutory scheme was as follows.  The Stevedoring Industry Act, as in force in 1973, established the Authority (s 10) and required that it ""shall perform its functions, and exercise its powers, under this Act with a view to securing the expeditious, safe and efficient performance of stevedoring operations"": s 8.  The functions, established under s 17, were, relevantly, as follows:
17 Functions of the Authority
(1) The functions of the Authority are -
(a) to regulate the performance of stevedoring operations;...
(c) to pay -
(i) attendance money payable to registered waterside workers ...;
(d) to ensure that sufficient waterside workers are available for stevedoring operations at each port ......
(f) to make arrangements for allotting waterside workers to stevedoring operations so as to ensure, as far as practicable, a fair distribution of work in stevedoring operations amongst registered waterside workers ...;...
(i) to regulate the conduct of waterside workers in an about employment bureaux, wharves and ships;(j) to provide or assist in providing, at places where satisfactory provision therefor is not, in the opinion of the Authority, made by employers or any other person or authority, first aid equipment ... sanitary and washing facilities ... and other amenities for waterside workers;...
(l) to investigate means of improving, and to encourage employers to introduce methods and practices that will improve, the expedition, safety and efficiency with which stevedoring operations are performed;...
(o) to encourage safe working in stevedoring operations and the use of articles and equipment, including clothing, designed for the protection of workers engaged in stevedoring operations and, where necessary, to prove waterside workers with articles and equipment designed for that purpose;...
(2) In regulating the performance of stevedoring operations under this Act, the Authority shall, except to such extent as, in the opinion of the Authority, is essential for the proper performance of that function, avoid imposing limitations upon employers with respect to their control of waterside workers engaged by them and their manner of performance of stevedoring operations.
(3) In the performance of its functions under sub-section (1) of this section, the Authority shall have regard to the desirability of encouraging employers to engage waterside workers for regular employment in stevedoring operations and waterside workers to offer for regular employment with employers in stevedoring operations.
42The Authority had power to appoint inspectors: s 23.  Inspectors were required to investigate and report in relation to stevedoring operations as the Authority directed and ""to suggest to employers and waterside workers, in appropriate cases, means by which stevedoring operations may be performed with greater expedition, safety and efficiency ..."".
43Section 28 provided for the registration of employers carrying out stevedoring operations at a port and s 29 provided for the registration of persons seeking employment as waterside workers at a port.  Obligations to carry out stevedoring operations in an expeditious, safe and efficient manner were imposed on registered employers: s 33.  There was a prohibition on employment of unregistered persons as waterside workers and for unregistered employers to engage persons as waterside workers: ss 39 and 41.
44There was a definition of ""waterside worker"" which meant ""a person who accepts, or offers to accept, employment for work in the loading or unloading of cargo into or from ships"", but excluding ""persons in the regular employment of a person engaged in an industrial operation, being persons whose duties include the performance of stevedoring operations in connection with that undertaking"": s 7(1), ""waterside worker"", chapeau and par (n).  Mr Lindsay was not a waterside worker because he fell within the last exclusion: he was excluded because he was in regular employment by an employer undertaking stevedoring operations.    Nevertheless, his work, including the ""driving or operation of mechanical appliances used in connexion with the loading or unloading of ships or with the handling or storage of cargo or other goods at or adjacent to a wharf"", fell within the broad description of work undertaken by a waterside worker.  
45The other phrase used regularly in the provisions set out above is ""stevedoring operations"", which was defined to mean activities mirroring those in the definition of waterside workers, but only when performed by a person who was a member or applicant for membership of the Waterside Workers' Federation.  There was no finding that Mr Lindsay fell within that category: he was therefore not engaged in stevedoring operations within the meaning of the statute.  
46Accepting that the Authority had a duty of care to those who were involved in stevedoring operations and were registered waterside workers, the question is whether that duty extended to others undertaking similar or related work, even work that fell within the physical descriptions set out above, but who were not covered by the statutory scheme, for example because they were in regular employment.
47In this case, the existence of a duty will depend in part on its content.  The point is helpfully considered by reference to the questions identified in Crimmins.  If the obligation of the Authority, in exercise of its duty of care to registered waterside workers, was to issue those persons with protective equipment, it is arguable that the duty would be restricted to those subject to its direction and control, which would have excluded Mr Lindsay.  On the other hand, if the duty extended to refusing to allocate registered waterside workers to unload ships which contained loose asbestos or deteriorating lagging on steam pipes, then the class of persons who would benefit from the direction given or suffer from the failure to give the direction, would include Mr Lindsay.  Without people to unload a vessel, he would have had no function to perform.  There would be no reason why, in determining whether to take steps to protect registered waterside workers, the Authority could not properly have taken into account the consequences for other workers working in close proximity to registered waterside workers.  A stevedoring operation involving the physical activity of loading or unloading a ship is an indivisible operation: if the duty of the Authority to registered waterside workers required that the operation not be undertaken otherwise than in safe conditions, absent some statutory indication to the contrary, it should be accepted that the duty was owed to an indivisible class, namely those who were at risk of inhaling airborne asbestos in the course of the stevedoring operation.
48The analysis in Crimmins, with respect to the functions of the Authority and registered waterside workers, concluded that there was nothing inconsistent between the duty of care upheld in that case and the scheme of the statute.  McHugh J stated at [103]:
""Safety on the waterfront was part of the Authority's general responsibilities. I do not understand the respondent to contend otherwise.  Keeping in mind the generalised nature of the inquiry at the duty stage, it is clear that it was reasonably foreseeable that, if the Authority failed to perform its safety functions with reasonable care, then waterside workers would be liable to suffer injury, even if only because it was reasonably foreseeable that the employers might be derelict in performing their own duties.""
49The same reasoning would apply with respect to workers with regular employers.  All waterside workers were employed by stevedores which were themselves required to be registered with the Authority as employers.  Indeed, the evidence of other workers revealed that Mr Lindsay's employer was a registered employer to which registered waterside workers were allocated.  To the extent that the Authority was required to exercise its powers by giving directions to employers, providing information and instruction to employers, or deciding whether or not to allocate waterside workers to unload particular ships, absent the proper exercise of which registered waterside workers would be exposed a risk of harm, it would be incongruous to conclude that the class which would benefit from the Authority carrying out its duty (and suffer from a negligent omission) would not include those in regular employment as well as those allocated to the employer by the Authority from time to time.
50In its statement of claim, the Authority asserted at par 4.3 that Mr Lindsay had alleged, in his claim against the Authority, that:
""At all material times [the Authority and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board] were under a continuing duty of care in the exercise of their statutory functions, duties and powers, to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risks of injury to waterside workers including Mr Lindsay as a result of performing the work in the course of stevedoring operations at the port.""
51No more precise detail of the scope of the Authority's duty was identified.  The Authority further noted (par 5) that it had settled the proceedings ""without an admission of liability"".  In its defence, the appellant admitted par 4 of the statement of claim, admitted par 5 and affirmatively stated that the Authority was ""not a tortfeasor"" noting as a particular that the Authority had denied that it owed a duty of care to Mr Lindsay.
52If the basis on which the Authority had been said to owe a duty had been limited to the provision of protective clothing, there was an arguable case that such a duty did not extend to Mr Lindsay who was not a registered waterside worker, nor, it appears, engaged in ""stevedoring operations"" within the meaning of the Act.  However, no such restricted duty was alleged and the appellant admitted that Mr Lindsay had formulated the duty of the Authority in accordance with statement set out above.
53In these circumstances, there was no error in point of law on the part of the Tribunal in accepting that the Authority owed a duty of care to Mr Lindsay.
Stevedoring Industry Authority - breach of duty54Breach of duty is generally a question of fact.  Ground 6 in the notice of appeal alleged error on the part of the Tribunal in failing to take into account evidence of an industrial hygienist, Mr Pickford, parts of whose report were tendered by the appellant.  In the course of argument, the appellant conceded that this ground did not raise a point of law and it was not pressed.  However, grounds 7 and 8 were pressed, on the basis that they were formulated as ""no evidence"" grounds. 
55Ground 7 alleged that the Tribunal had, at par 38, based a finding that the Authority had actual knowledge of the hazards of asbestos ""on determinations of this Court in other proceedings"", contrary to s 91 of the Evidence Act.  At par 38 the Tribunal had said:
""The actual knowledge of [the Authority] of the hazards of asbestos is clear.  Indeed it was spelt out in Gibson [supra].  See para 91.""
56Unlike the ground of appeal, the written submissions did not isolate par 38 of the judgment, nor did they make any submissions by reference to it.  Nothing was said in the course of oral argument to expand upon that ground.  It must be rejected for that reason alone.  However, the ground should be rejected because, as a matter of substance, it was misconceived.  The reasoning at pars 37 and 39 provided the substance of the findings: par 38 was an aside.
57Ground 8 did in fact assert that there was ""no evidence"" to support two findings by the Tribunal at par 39, namely, (a) ""that both Authorities were aware, because of their membership of the various Committees described in the statement of Mr Dalziel that ships in Sydney that unloaded asbestos had residues of asbestos in their holds and had asbestos lagging in their steam pipes"", and (b) they ""were aware that those ships came to Port Kembla carrying other cargoes with asbestos in the holds as well as asbestos lagging on ships steam pipes and on the steam pipes of wharf winches.""
58The written submissions did not make such a claim good and in oral argument, counsel disavowed the relevance of those grounds as going to breach, saying that they ""really bear on the duty question"": CA Tcpt, 16/05/14, p 2 (3).  Nevertheless, little was said about those passages in relation to duty.  In the written submissions dealing with duty, the complaint was made that Mr Dalziel's statement ""does not refer to asbestos at Port Kembla"": submissions, par 69.  So far as it went, that statement was true, but beside the point.  The Tribunal referred to Mr Dalziel's statement as the source of information about the various committees to which he referred.  The statement discussed the work of various organisations, including those responsible for operational training programs for waterside workers: at par 23.  It said that the NSW State Training Officer ""was responsible for the ports of Newcastle, Sydney and Port Kembla"": at par 24.  As a result of recommendations he had made, Mr Dalziel noted the establishment in 1960 of the ""Federal Advisory Committee on Waterfront Accident Prevention"": par 27.  It was a national body which liaised with States by setting up ""Port Advisory Panels"" in each State: par 31.  There was reference to a minute of a meeting in April 1963 dealing with asbestos in Freemantle and seeking a survey of workers who had handled asbestos over a long period: par 52.  The possible issue of suitable respiratory equipment was dealt with at another meeting, in October 1963, on referral from the Hobart Port Advisory Panel.  At numerous meetings there was a record of asbestos being discussed: the point of the reference by the Tribunal was not that there was discussion with respect to particular ports but that there were committees established which had knowledge of asbestos cargos and acquired and distributed information.  The complaint is not that the Authority was not aware of the hazards of asbestos, but that Mr Dalziel's report did not establish that the Authority was aware that ships unloaded in Sydney carried residues to Port Kembla, or that winches and steam pipes had asbestos lagging.
59The narrowness of the complaint is significant.  Amongst other evidence, Mr Dalziel reported that, as a stevedoring supervisor for some years, he was notified of cargo to be loaded or unloaded and was required to provide information ""through a senior manager of his stevedoring company, to the Authority seeking labour"": par 6.  In 1959, he worked for a committee of overseas ship owners, investigating accidents, in the course of which he visited ""all the major ports ... to see what they were doing about safety"": par 13.  He also said that he discussed safety issues with members of the Authority.  The report recommended the establishment of the Federal Advisory Committee: par 15.  
60Further, the ground of appeal (whether relevant to duty or breach) was not a complaint about the reasons of the Tribunal, but about the lack of evidence to support a finding.  There was, however, detailed material as to the operation of the Authority and other stevedoring industry employers.  There was, for example, a statement from Mr William Fleming.  He was an employee of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board from 1954 until 1956 when he became an employee of the Authority.  He described the system for allocation of labour, by reference to Sydney.  Mr Fleming was also a port inspector from 1956 to 1962.  He was the Authority's representative on the Federal Advisory Committee from 18 March 1961.  
61There was in evidence a letter of May 1969 from the Federal Advisory Committee concerning information on asbestos gathered from various sources, addressed to the Occupational Health Committee, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at the University of Sydney.  The letterhead listed a number of Port Advisory Panels, including one at Port Kembla.  
62It was also open to the Tribunal to infer from the evidence of the waterside workers discussed above that the Authority and the appellant would have been aware of the existence of loose asbestos in the forms discussed.  Mr Foley and Mr Munro, for example, were able to identify a specific ship from Western Australia, the ""Kangaroo"" which was unloaded at Port Kembla and which carried asbestos to the Port of Sydney: see Foley affidavit, par 52; Munro affidavit, par 20.  Further, the descriptions prepared in 1969 and 1970 by those working at the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine on its study of '""Asbestos on the Waterfront"" allowed an inference to be drawn that other cargos, which remained in ships carrying asbestos after the asbestos had been removed, would almost inevitably be contaminated and would themselves raise a ""snowstorm"" when handled.
63There was no substance to the ""no evidence"" grounds.
Apportionment64The trial judge apportioned responsibility for what he found to be a fair settlement as to 75% against the appellant.  He did so on the basis that the appellant was the worker's employer and thus bore a greater degree of responsibility than did the authority.  Ground 9 asserted that the Tribunal ""failed to assess the relative causal potency and culpability of"" the appellant and the respondent and to give reasons for the apportionment.  Given that the primary position of the appellant with respect to the duty of care of the Authority was that it owed none to Mr Lindsay, whereas the appellant undoubtedly owed him a duty as his employer, there is some irony in it challenging the apportionment adopted by the Tribunal.  However, the appellant's primary position having been rejected, ground 9 must be assessed in its terms.
65The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act provides, relevantly to this question:
5 Proceedings against and contribution between joint and several tort-feasors
...
(2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person's responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity.
66The appellant complained that there was no evidence before the Tribunal to allow it to assess the relevant culpability of each party.  However, that was not true.  There was evidence accepted by the Tribunal as to the conditions in which Mr Lindsay worked at Port Kembla.  Once it was accepted that Mr Lindsay was exposed to significant levels of asbestos dust, and that the Authority had or should have had actual knowledge of that fact and the hazards of asbestos, it was open for the Tribunal to conclude that a stevedoring company operating at the same time in the same port with knowledge of the same circumstances, would share that knowledge.  The remaining question did not depend so much on the evidence, as the respective duties of care of the Authority and the employer.  Apportionment between them was a matter of evaluative judgment; no error of law is demonstrated by according a higher proportion to the employer than to the Authority, given the nature of the duty of an employer under the general law and the limited responsibility of the Authority with respect to Mr Lindsay, as outlined above.
67Secondly, the appellant complained that the Tribunal failed ""to assess and give reasons for"" the quantum of the liability incurred by Comcare, pursuant to the settlement.  The Tribunal addressed the quantum of the verdict in favour of Mr Lindsay, namely $350,000 inclusive of costs and noted that ""[m]ost plaintiffs in the Tribunal receive by way of general damages if the case goes to judgment, something in the order of $250,000 to $290,000"": at par 43.  On that basis, and given that the evidence of Mr Lindsay's condition did not demonstrate some unusual form of mesothelioma, it was open to the Tribunal to reach the conclusion that the settlement was fair and not excessive.  The reasons given were those stated above and were, in the circumstances, adequate.
Conclusion68The appellant having failed on each of the various grounds raised in its notice of appeal, the appeal must be dismissed; the appellant must pay the respondent's costs of the appeal.
69SACKVILLE AJA:  I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA and with his Honour's reasons.  I add two observations.
70Basten JA has referred to the evidence of the deceased workers as to their experiences with the substance they identified as asbestos.  One of those workers in particular, Mr Foley, gave evidence, quoted at [16] above, concerning his observation of asbestos dust at Port Kembla.  Earlier in his affidavit (at pars 26-39), Mr Foley gave a detailed account of his experience in loading and unloading cargoes of asbestos on the Sydney waterfront between 1948 and 1958.  Mr Foley described the manner in which asbestos was packaged in hessian bags, how the asbestos was transported and unloaded, the circumstances in which loose asbestos came to be scattered around the vessels and the appearance of the asbestos dust that Mr Foley frequently saw both during unloading operations and after the operations had been completed.  In my opinion, Mr Foley's extensive experience in handling and observing asbestos amply qualified him to give opinion evidence as to whether the dust and fibres he observed at Port Kembla were indeed asbestos.
71The second observation concerns the statutory functions of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority (Authority).  Under s 17 (1) of the Stevedoring Industry Act 1956 (Cth) (Act), as in force in 1973, those functions included:
""(l) to investigate means of improving, and to encourage employers to introduce methods and practices that will improve, the expedition, safety and efficiency with which stevedoring operations are performed; 
...
(o) to encourage safe working in stevedoring operations and the use of articles and equipment, including clothing, designed for the protection of workers engaged in stevedoring operations ...""
Section 18(1) of the Act provided that, for the purpose of the performance of its functions, the Authority could make such orders and do all such other things as it thought fit.
72Mr Lindsay performed work of a kind that was within the definition of ""stevedoring operations"" in s 7(1) of the Act. However, his work was excluded from the definition because he was not a member of the relevant union.  But if the Authority effectively carried out its functions under s 17(1)(l) and (o) of the Act, its actions inevitably would have protected not only members of the relevant union engaged in stevedoring operations, but other workers engaged in precisely the same activities.  As a practical matter, it is difficult to see how vessels could have been loaded and unloaded without proper safety precautions if the Authority, acting in accordance with its statutory functions, required appropriate safety precautions to be put in place to protect members of the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia engaged in stevedoring operations.  At the very least, s 18(1) of the Act would have permitted the Authority to advise Mr Lindsay's employer of the dangers of asbestos and of the need to take appropriate precautions to prevent Mr Lindsay being exposed to asbestos fibres.
73In terms of the questions posed by McHugh J in Graham Barclay Oysters Pty Ltd v Bryan [2002] HCA 54: 211 CLR 540 at [84], there could hardly be a worker in a more vulnerable position than Mr Lindsay, given his exposure to asbestos dust.  If the Authority should have known of the dangers posed by asbestos fibres, it had the power to ensure that no operations of the kind included in the definition of ""stevedoring operations"" took place, whether or not conducted by members of a particular union.  It is unthinkable that if the Authority appreciated the dangers posed by asbestos fibres and took measure to ensure the safety of the members of a particular union, it would not be obliged to exercise all powers available to it to prevent other workers engaged in the same activities being exposed to precisely the same risk.

2704819,R v Hunter (No 6) [2014] NSWSC 1149,"Judgment

1Objection has been taken by defence counsel to the reception into evidence of a number of admissions alleged to have been made by the accused to police officers. The objection is founded on s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). 

2The admissions are alleged to have been made on three occasions: when the accused spoke to Detective Senior Constable Burton and Detective Mackie whilst travelling in a police vehicle on 21 June 2011; when the accused spoke to Detective Sergeant Evans and Detective Senior Constable Hind-Spiteri at Mt Druitt Police Station on 21 June 2011; and, finally, when the accused allegedly spoke to Detective Sergeant Lowe and Detective Hind-Spiteri when he was in a room attached to a gaol on 20 October 2011.

3Defence counsel tendered a number of statements of police, with some annexures, on the voir dire. Neither party called oral evidence or sought to cross-examine the makers of those written statements.

4It is convenient to set out extracts from those exhibits on the voir dire. There is a degree of repetition between the statement of Detective Hind-Spiteri and the statements of Detective Evans and Detective Lowe, making it unnecessary to extract any portion of the two latter statements. Of course, my determinations will relate to evidence of the alleged admissions from any source. 

5Shorn of material not pressed in the trial by the Crown Prosecutor, the three passages that are subject to an objection are as follows.

6The first passage is at [20] of the statement of Detective Burton of 22 June 2011, which became voir dire exhibit 1:

...
Detective MACKIE said, ""Paul, we heard you hurt your head. Is your head alright?"" 

He said, ""My head, yeah it's ok, why?""

Detective MACKIE said, ""We heard you went to the Hospital last night and left before being treated.""

He said, ""Yeah, I got hit in the back of the head with a pole. It took ages for them to see me so I couldn't be bothered and left."" As he said this, I saw him reach around the back of his head and rub the rear left hand side for about 2 to 3 seconds.
...

7The second passage is at [16] of the statement of Detective Hind-Spiteri of 12 January 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 2:

Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul my name is Detective Sergeant EVANS and this is Detective Senior Constable HIND-SPITERI. We are Detectives here at Mt Druitt.""

Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah.""

Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul Detective Senior Constable HIND-SPITERI and I are investigating some matters and I want you to understand that you are not obliged to say or do anything and anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence at court. Do you understand that?""

Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah.""

Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul I want you to understand that you are under arrest for and [sic] affray which occurred at 9 Livingston Avenue Dharruk. You are not obliged to say or do anything and anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence at court. Do you understand that?""

Paul HUNTER said, ""I was the one who got hit, he hit me."" 

Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Do you understand what I said?""

Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah but he hit me."" 
...
Detective Sergeant EVANS said, ""Paul I also want you to understand you are under arrest for the assault, serious assault upon Jason DIXON on 20th June 2011. You are not obliged to say or do anything and anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence at court, Do you understand that?""

Paul HUNTER said, ""Yeah, I was at Mt Druitt Hospital, you do the maths.""
...

8This extract of Detective Hind-Spiteri's statement is in almost identical terms to [22] of the statement of Detective Evans completed 22 February 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 3.

9The third passage is from [46] of Detective Hind-Spiteri's statement of 12 January 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 2.

About 11am on Thursday the 20 October 2011 Detective Sergeant LOWE and I attended the Metropolitan and Remand Reception Centre at Silverwater. When there I saw Paul HUNTER taken into police custody in the police charge room situated there. After HUNTER spoke to the custody manager I heard Detective Sergeant LOWE say, ""Paul HUNTER, I am Detective Sergeant LOWE from the Homicide Squad and this is Detective HIND-SPITERI you are under arrest for the murder of Jason DIXON. You are not obliged to say or do anything but anything you say or do will be recorded and may later be used in evidence. Do you understand that?""

HUNTER said, ""I'm not saying anything I wasn't even there I was at the hospital.""

Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""We have information that suggests otherwise. What we propose to do is ask you a number of questions that will be recorded on the DVD system.""

HUNTER said, ""No.""

Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""Will you sign my notebook refusing to be interviewed.""

HUNTER said, ""No I am not saying or signing nothing.""

Detective Sergeant LOWE said, ""It is just a matter of time before your [sic] charged with murder.""

HUNTER said, ""He hit me and your [sic] going to charge me?""
...

10This extract of Detective Hind-Spiteri's statement is in almost identical terms to [6] of the statement of Detective Lowe of 12 January 2012, which became voir dire exhibit 6.

11Section 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act is as follows:

281 Admissions by suspects

(1) This section applies to an admission: 
(a) that was made by an accused person who, at the time when the admission was made, was or could reasonably have been suspected by an investigating official of having committed an offence, and

(b) that was made in the course of official questioning, and

(c) that relates to an indictable offence, other than an indictable offence that can be dealt with summarily without the consent of the accused person.

(2) Evidence of an admission to which this section applies is not admissible unless: 

(a) there is available to the court: 
(i) a tape recording made by an investigating official of the interview in the course of which the admission was made, or
(ii) if the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in subparagraph (i) could not be made, a tape recording of an interview with the person who made the admission, being an interview about the making and terms of the admission in the course of which the person states that he or she made an admission in those terms, or

(b) the prosecution establishes that there was a reasonable excuse as to why a tape recording referred to in paragraph (a) could not be made.

(3) The hearsay rule and the opinion rule (within the meaning of the Evidence Act 1995) do not prevent a tape recording from being admitted and used in proceedings before the court as mentioned in subsection (2).

(4) In this section: 
investigating official means: 
(a) a police officer (other than a police officer who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior), or
(b) a person appointed by or under an Act (other than a person who is engaged in covert investigations under the orders of a superior) whose functions include functions in respect of the prevention or investigation of offences prescribed by the regulations.

official questioning means questioning by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence.

reasonable excuse includes: 
(a) a mechanical failure, or
(b) the refusal of a person being questioned to have the questioning electronically recorded, or
(c) the lack of availability of recording equipment within a period in which it would be reasonable to detain the person being questioned.

tape recording includes: 
(a) audio recording, or
(b) video recording, or
(c) a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously recorded audio recording.

12It is convenient to deal with each extracted passage in turn, and to deal with each question and answer within each passage seriatim as necessary.

The first passage

13The statement of Detective Burton of 22 June 2011 (which became voir dire exhibit 1) establishes that the alleged conversation occurred in a motor vehicle sometime after 4:30 PM on 21 June 2011. Previous to that, a number of events had occurred. Detective Burton had commenced duties at 7 AM, and soon after had attended a briefing with regard to the assault (as it was at that stage) on the deceased. From about 9:45 AM Detective Burton and Detective Mackie patrolled a number of locations. Over the course of that patrol, they encountered Mr Wade Hunter and Mr Gary Hunter, and arrested the latter pursuant to an outstanding warrant. 

14Detective Burton, along with other police, also undertook a search at an address in Hebersham in connection with the matter. Detective Burton and Detective Mackie later attended 4 Toricelli Avenue, Whalan, where Mr Wade Hunter and the accused were present. Detective Burton observed that the accused appeared to be under the effects of an intoxicating substance. The accused was placed under arrest, and escorted by Detective Burton and Detective Mackie to the Mt Druitt Police Station. The conversation recorded in the first passage took place en route to the Police Station.

15Subsequent to the conversation that is the subject of objection, in a passage that is not pressed by the Crown Prosecutor in the trial but is relied upon by the Crown on the voir dire, the following exchange occurred: 

Detective MACKIE said, ""Are you alright now?""

[The accused] said, ""Yeah, you know me, I'm not going to say anything. If you decided to charge me, I'll take it to court.""

[Senior Constable BURTON] said, ""No, just checking you're alright.""

16With regard to the first passage, defence counsel submitted that the enquiries about the head injury of the accused were ""official questioning"". He submitted that I would not accept that they were mere enquiries checking on the health and welfare of the accused. He submitted that the other preconditions for application of the section had been made out. He submitted that there was no evidence upon which the Crown had established a reasonable excuse for not recording the alleged admission in the motor vehicle, pursuant to s 281(2)(b). Accordingly, he submitted, the second enquiry envisaged by s 281(2)(a)(ii) does not arise.

17The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, looked at as a whole and in context, the police were doing nothing more than checking the health of the accused, whom they had arrested and were taking to a police station. In particular, she submitted, the exchange must be seen in the context of the previous observations of the seeming intoxication of the accused, and in light of the fact that the police made it clear very shortly after the exchange that is the subject of objection, that that was indeed the nature of their enquiry of the accused.

18Turning to my determination with regard to the first passage, I consider that it has been established on the balance of probabilities that the exchange in question occurred in the course of official questioning. Whilst I accept that the police were checking the mental state and any head injury of the accused, I am also satisfied, in light of the investigative context to which I have referred, that the police were asking questions ""in connection with the investigation of the commission ... of an offence"". In particular, the specificity of the question with regard to the attendance of the accused at the hospital leads me to the view that the police were asking questions as part of their investigation into the background of the assault on the deceased, and not solely as a result of their concern for the welfare of the accused.

19The fact that the second exchange began with, as a matter of grammar, a statement as opposed to a question, on the part of the police officer, to my mind is not determinative. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that that statement was designed to elicit a response, as indeed it did on the Crown case.

20No reasonable excuse has been posited for not recording the passage that is the subject of the objection. It follows that the legislation commands exclusion of the evidence.

21In short, the pressed portions of the exchange between the accused and the police in the police vehicle on 21 June 2011 will not be admitted in the trial.

22I have also considered whether the act of rubbing his head, said to have been undertaken by the accused, should be excluded pursuant to the section, despite the fact that it is not an alleged oral admission. 

23R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426 establishes that a seemingly exculpatory statement can be excluded as an admission, if it is capable of being relied upon as being a lie. It also establishes that conduct able to be characterised as an admission was captured by the predecessor of s 281: at 437-8. That is consistent with the definition of an admission and the definition of a representation contained in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).

24In short, I consider that that alleged act of the accused, in rubbing his head during the course of the official questioning, should be excluded pursuant to the section.

The second passage

25Turning to the second passage, defence counsel submitted that the questions were ""official questioning"" as defined in the legislation. He submitted that they were indeed asked ""in connection with the investigation of ... an offence"". In the alternative, he relied upon what was said by McHugh J in Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12; 218 CLR 216 (in dissent in that case) and in particular the proposition at [106] that one should not create ""a fortress out of the dictionary"", thereby standing in the way of the undoubted purpose of Parliament in enacting s 281 and its predecessors; namely, putting an end to a number of markedly negative aspects of the criminal justice system.

26The Crown Prosecutor submitted that a question about whether the accused understood that he was under arrest, that the arrest was for a particular offence, and that he enjoyed a right to silence cannot be characterised as ""official questioning"". If it be the case that an accused person determines to give a response to such a question that is an admission, so be it, she submitted; that does not alter the characterisation of the context in which the accused responded.

27To my mind, although the accused was indeed asked a question by the detective, that process does not constitute ""questioning"", as a matter of plain English. The detective was complying with the law in informing the accused of his arrest, the offence upon which that arrest was based, and providing the accused with a caution. She made a repeated enquiry as to whether the accused understood those things. To my mind that enquiry, although it does constitute the asking of a repeated question, does not constitute ""questioning"". That word to my mind connotes something of an ongoing process, albeit it may be an extremely brief process.

28Separately, I am not satisfied that the single repeated question constitutes ""official questioning"" as defined in the statute. Although in a very broad sense, an enquiry of an arrested person about whether he or she understands that his or her liberty has been curtailed and why, along with his or her right to silence, could be said to be asked ""in connection with the investigation of the commission of ... an offence"", I do not consider that the phrase is so elastic as to extend to the situation under consideration. Were it otherwise, Bryant v R [2011] NSWCCA 26 would have been differently decided. And so would the well-known decision of Howie J in R v Naa [2009] NSWSC 851, a decision that, although not strictly binding, I accord great weight.

29Thirdly and finally, I am bound by the approach of the majority of the High Court in Kelly v the Queen, in which the identical phrase (albeit in a somewhat different provision) was interpreted narrowly.

30I adopt an identical analysis with regard to the second portion of the second passage. In short, I do not regard the exchange as having occurred ""in the course of official questioning"".

31In summary I regard the pressed portions of the second passage as not falling within s 281, and therefore admissible.

The third passage

32Turning to the third passage, I consider that the first portion of the exchange leading to the alleged admission, namely, ""I'm not saying anything I wasn't even there I was at the hospital"" is subject to an analysis identical to that provided by me a moment ago. In short, on three bases I do not consider that asking an accused person whether he or she understands his custodial position and right to silence constitutes official questioning. It follows that that exchange is not captured by the section, and is not excluded as a result.

33As for the second part of the third passage, on the Crown case, the accused indicated that he did not wish to engage in a recorded interview; nor did he wish to sign a notebook entry recording that refusal. 

34Thereafter, the detective made the statement ""It is just a matter of time before your [sic] charged with murder"". Although as a matter of formal sentence structure that utterance was a statement, in truth I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was a statement made in the hope that the accused would respond to it. As the authorities make clear, merely because an utterance or other conduct by a police officer is not, strictly speaking, a question does not mean it cannot be part of a ""course of official questioning"": see Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12; 218 CLR 216 at 234-5.

35As a matter of fact-finding, I characterise that statement of Detective Lowe and the exchanges that preceded it about a recorded interview and a notebook entry as being official questioning, and the alleged response of the accused as occurring in the course of that process.

36Again, the Crown posited no reasonable excuse for the fact that the response of the accused to that official questioning was not electronically recorded. It follows that the words ""He hit me and you're going to charge me?"" must be excluded pursuant to the section.

Conclusion

37In summary then, my determination is as follows:
(1)The whole of the first passage pertaining to the conversation in the police vehicle is excluded.
(2)None of the second passage pertaining to the conversation at the police station is excluded.
(3)None of the third passage pertaining to the conversation at the gaol is excluded, except for the final statement of Detective Sergeant Lowe and the words alleged to have been said by the accused, ""He hit me and you're going to charge me?""

		21 August 2014",2014-07-03 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704822,Freeburn v The Cake Decorators Association of NSW Inc. [2014] NSWDC 88,"Judgment
1The plaintiff brings proceedings for defamation against the publishers of ""Pipeline"", the bimonthly newspaper of the Cake Decorators Association of New South Wales (an incorporated association under the Associations Incorporations Act 2009 (NSW)) and two individuals who were members of its committee. The matter complained of was a notice (published on 21 November 2012 in the December issue of ""Pipeline"") to be moved by the State Committee of the First Defendant on 23 February 2013, the text of which was one of a series of such motions set out on page 17 of the newsletter.
2The text of the matter complained of was as follows:
""I [sic] State Committee of NSW give notice that I will move the following motion to be held on the 23rd February 2013:
That Mrs Kay Freeburn be expelled as a member from the Association at teh [sic] 2012 AGM and not allowed to rejoin the Association as a member.Reason For [sic] continually bombarding memebes [sic] with letters for her personal agenda.  For committing acts that bring the Association into disrepute - for failure to follow the Constitution.  For accusing the State committee of mal-administration and suppling NO proof of this.  For causing members distress by her repeated letters to them and brenaches [sic].  Failure to give good reason why the Committee should not rescind her membership.""
3The imputations pleaded to arise were as follows:
(a)That the plaintiff made allegations of maladministration by committee members of the first defendant when she had no evidence of such allegations.
(b)That the plaintiff is dishonest in that she made allegations of maladministration by committee members of the first defendant when she had no evidence of such allegations.
(c)That the plaintiff has attempted to deceive the members of the first defendant.
(d)That the plaintiff does not act fairly and reasonably.
(e)That the plaintiff has a personal agenda which is not in the best interests and to the detriment of the first defendant.
(f)That the plaintiff is motivated by personal and selfish reasons.
(g)That the plaintiff has acted outside the bounds of the constitution of the first defendant.
(h)That it was necessary to expel the plaintiff as a member of the first defendant in order to resolve the abovementioned improper conduct of the plaintiff.
(i)That it was necessary to prevent the plaintiff from ever again rejoining as a member of the first defendant in order to resolve the abovementioned improper conduct of the plaintiff.
(j)That the plaintiff is unfit to be a member of the first defendant.
4Three applications were brought before the court on 4 July 2014:
(a)The defendants' application to ""strike in"" the whole of the December issue of ""Pipeline"";
(b)The plaintiff's application to ""strike in"" the motion from the August 2012 edition of ""Pipeline""; and
(c)The defendants' objections to the form and capacity of the imputations pleaded.
5These are my reasons for the rulings I made on 4 July 2014.
6The application by the defendants to strike in the whole of the December issue of ""Pipeline"" is consented to by the plaintiff, and the amended statement of claim to be filed in accordance with the orders I made on 4 July 2014 should include this entire document. Any portions of that document relevant to the imputations pleaded should be so noted by the plaintiff in the body of the statement of claim. However, the plaintiff's application to strike in a motion contained in the August 2014 issue of ""Pipeline"" is contested, and I set out my reasons for refusing that application.
Application to strike in the motion published in the August 2012 edition of ""Pipeline""
7The text of the motion is as follows:
""Motion 4
The State Committee give notice to move the following motion at the Annual General Meeting that: Mrs Kay Freeburn be expelled as a member from the Association at the 2012 AGM & not allowed to join the Association as a member.
Reason: For continually annoying members with letters for her personal agenda for committing acts that bring the Association into disrepute - for failure to follow the constitution.  For accusing the State Committee of maladministration and supplying NO proof of this.  For causing members distress by her repeated letters to them and branches.  For failure to give good reason why the committee should not rescind her membership.""
8The plaintiff relies upon the explanation of the relevant principles by Tobias JA in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Obeid (2006) 66 NSWLR 605 at [26] as follows:
""[26] Her Honour then considered the law relating to ""strike in"" applications in respect of which there does not appear to be any significant dispute between the parties. Drawing heavily on the statement of the relevant principles by Hunt J in Gordon v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 410 and Burrows v Knightley (1987) 10 NSWLR 651, I would summarise those principles as follows:
(a) Where the publication sued upon is in written form, a plaintiff is obliged to include within his or her pleading every passage which materially alters or qualifies the complexion of the imputation complained of: Ron Hodgson (Trading) Pty Ltd v Belvedere Motors (Hurstville) Pty Ltd [1971] 1 NSWLR 472 at 477, 480; Gordon (at 413 [6]). The justification for that rule lies in the principle that the effect of the matter complained of must be taken from the whole of what has been published: Gordon (at 413 [6]).
(b) In the case of oral defamation, that basic principle cannot, however, be applied without any qualification. In the case of radio and television publications, a plaintiff is entitled to submit to the jury that the reasonable listener or viewer, as the case may be, although deemed to have listened to or watched the whole of the broadcast, nevertheless may not have devoted the same degree of concentration to the broadcast as he or she would have to a written document: Morosi v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 418(n) at 420 [12]; Gordon (at 413 [7]).
(c) Each case will depend upon its own circumstances, but it is easy to imagine a listener or viewer missing the significance of a qualification or contradiction at the beginning or (perhaps less likely) at the end of a segment. On the other hand, it is difficult to accept the existence of a reasonable listener or viewer who failed to comprehend a refutation in the sentence following that in which a charge was made or whose concentration selectively increased in relation to random passages between those which materially qualified the effect of those he or she comprehended.
(d) It is true that that principle is not to be applied without qualification in the case of oral defamation. Nonetheless, the rule remains that the capacity of the matter complained of to convey particular defamatory imputations of and concerning the plaintiff must be judged by what the ordinary reasonable listener or viewer of average intelligence would have understood from the context constituted by the broadcast as a whole: Morosi (at 419 [5]); Gordon (at 413 [9]).
(e) Accordingly, a defendant is entitled to require the plaintiff to plead the full context of what is broadcast if that context is capable of materially affecting the imputations complained of by the plaintiff.
(f) Thus, if there are passages not pleaded in an agreed context relating to the complaint by the plaintiff, and those passages materially alter or qualify the complexion of the imputations complained of, the plaintiff is obliged to plead those additional passages in oral as well as written defamation: Gordon (at 414 [15]).
(g) However, where in a case of oral defamation the context of the matter complained of is in dispute (as in the present case), the question arises as to whether in these circumstances the plaintiff is bound to plead any more than what he or she alleges is the whole context: Gordon (at 414 [11]-[12]).
(h) Relevant to the question of context is the principle that where the matter complained of is contained in a newspaper and refers to othermaterial in the same newspaper, the plaintiff may be required to tender that other material in his or her case provided that such other material is capable of affecting the sense of the matter complained of. Where there are two separate publications by the defendant, the plaintiff is entitled (or may be obliged) to have them considered together in order to determine the sense in which either was understood, provided that they are sufficiently connected and identified with each other: Burrows (at 655 F-G).
(i) However, another principle applies where the matter of which a plaintiff complains consists of related material published by the defendant on different occasions, and where there is apparent, on the face of the matter complained of itself, either an intention on the part of the defendant that it be read together or direct internal references are made from one to the other, so that the reader may reasonably be expected to read it together. In such cases it is acceptable practice to plead all of the material in the one paragraph of the statement of claim and to identify the imputations said to have been conveyed by the material as a whole: Burrows (at 657E).""
9Mr Dilworth particularly referred me to paragraphs (h) and (i), submitting that the plaintiff was entitled to have both the August and December issues considered together, given that the motion to expel the plaintiff was first published in the August issue, and was the first in what he described as a ""continuing and developing series of events"" which reached their peak in the motion in the December issue. The gap in time could be explained by the fact that nothing about this ongoing dispute appeared in the October issue. The August and December newsletters were ""sufficiently connected"", in the sense set out by Tobias JA at (h) above, for them to be read together in order to understand the defamatory sting. The two publications were connected: Burrows v Knightley (1987) 10 NSWLR 651.
10There are compelling reasons why the striking in of this additional material should not be permitted:
(a)These publications were not connected in the sense described by Tobias JA, whose example of such a requirement was the publication of two articles in the same newspaper. In the present circumstances, not only were these two publications four months apart, but there had been no ""continuing or developing"" discussion of the kind posited by Mr Dilworth in his written submissions (page 2) in the intervening October issue, let alone any ""crescendo"" in December referring back to these prior events. Nor is ""Pipeline"" a continuous narrative comparable to the instalments of Mr Knightley's book.
(b)There is no cross-reference, or even reference, between these two publications (Burrows v Knightley, supra, at 657). These are not two publications that are ""identified with each other"" in the sense set out by Tobias JA at [26(h)]. Nor is there any evidence of a true innuendo arising out of the second publication as a result of the first, or any claim that the first publication alters the meaning of the second.
(c)Where there is a series of defamatory publications, the better course is that the plaintiff should commence proceedings in relation to each such publication. That is particularly the case given the four month gap between the two publications.
(d)The addition of the August 2012 publication to the matter complained of is impermissible because it was published more than twelve months before proceedings were commenced: s 14B Limitation Act 1969 (NSW). 
11Accordingly I have refused the plaintiff leave to strike in the relevant portion of the August 2012 newsletter.
Form and capacity of the plaintiff's imputations  
12The text of the matter complained of is as set out at [2] above. The plaintiff challenges the form and capacity of all but imputations (a) and (g) of the imputations pleaded. In the course of argument, Mr Dilworth sought leave to amend imputations (d) and (e) and did not press imputation (f). The remaining imputations falling for consideration are as follows: 
Imputations (b) and (c)
13The defendants' principal submission is that neither of these imputations is capable of being conveyed. The matter complained of paints a picture of the plaintiff bombarding the committee and its members with discursive complaints about maladministration, but without providing any evidence. The defendant submits that an imputation that the plaintiff dishonestly made these allegations when she knew they could not be proved, as opposed to making allegations without providing the evidence to back them up, goes too far.
14The plaintiff submits that the imputation arises from the fact that ""NO"" is in capital letters, and that the word ""maladministration"" connotes allegations of serious and wrongful conduct. Any person who made such serious allegations and failed to back them up with proof was, by inference, dishonest.
15The dictionary definitions of conduct amounting to ""maladministration"" refer to such conduct as inaction, delay, incompetence and failure to deal with administrative issues. The ordinary reasonable reader would not read anything more sinister into such a word. The word ""NO"" in capital letters, in the context of the other conduct attributed to the plaintiff such as prolix correspondence and raising matters on her own agenda, would be seen by the ordinary reasonable reader as being a response to the lack of proof rather than a claim that the plaintiff was making these claims dishonestly or deceitfully. The overall impression is that the plaintiff is a nuisance and troublemaker who does not provide any proof for her claims, rather than a person dishonestly or deceitfully making false allegations knowing that she has no proof. Applying the test for capacity as most recently enunciated by the NSW Court of Appeal in Toben v Milne [2014] NSWCA 200, neither of these imputations is conveyed. 
16In addition, if the failure to offer proof is the basis upon which imputation (b) is pleaded, these imputations do not differ in substance: Toben v Milne, supra, at [10]. Both are pleaded as acts, and both could only arise from the reference to failure to provide proof, as this is the only conduct in the matter complained of with any capacity to support any imputation of deceitful conduct.
17While the test for capacity of an imputation is at a very low level (Malcolm v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81-915), neither of these imputations is capable of being conveyed and, in addition, do not differ in substance.
Imputation (d)
18The plaintiff has been granted leave to replead this imputation as set out in the orders below.
Imputations (e) and (f)
19Mr Dilworth conceded these imputations did not differ in substance and ultimately did not press (f). His principal argument was that these imputations ""use some of the words"" from the matter complained of, which he submitted was permissible, having reference to McHugh J's statement in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin (2003) 201 ALR 77 at [63] that if the imputation ""closely followed the text"" no jury could reasonably reject it.
20However, as the Court of Appeal explained in Toben v Milne, supra, at [21]:
""[21] An imputation may plead or closely follow the exact words used in the alleged defamatory publication: see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v Rivkin [2003] HCA 50; 201 ALR 77 at [63]. However, as Hunt AJA pointed out in Harvey v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 255 at [126]:
Merely pleading the words of the matter complained of as the imputation for which the plaintiff contends where those words do not adequately distil the act or condition attributed to the plaintiff, and thus identify his cause of action, is not a compliance with Pt 67 r 11(2).""
21The plaintiff has been given leave to replead, but should bear these principles in mind.
Imputations (h) and (i)
22The plaintiff's submission was, again, that these imputations should be permitted because they use some of the actual words. The real problem, however, lies in the form of the imputations. Both use the formula ""it was necessary"" without saying by whom it was necessary. Mr Dilworth himself was uncertain whether the committee, the organisation, the defendants or the ordinary reasonable reader was the person identified as considering it was necessary. In those circumstances, the defendants' complaint that it is defective in structure is made out.
23Additionally, the reference to ""the abovementioned improper conduct"" seeks to roll up a series of acts. Use of the word ""improper"" should be avoided in any event.
24The difference between these imputations is very slight indeed, and any redrafted imputations will need to differ in substance.
25Finally, the imputation amounts to an exhortation and is this rhetorical: Hanson-Young v Bauer Media Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1306 at [13], [18] - [19]. 
26For all of the above reasons, these imputations should be struck out with leave to replead.
Imputation (j)
27Mr Dilworth referred to my judgment in Renshaw v Reed Business Information Pty Ltd t/as Lawyers Weekly (2013) 16 DCLR (NSW) 38 as authority for the proposition that a bare imputation of unfitness is not rhetorical.
28The plaintiff in Renshaw v Reed Business Information Pty Ltd t/as Lawyers Weekly, supra, was a barrister. As in Ainsworth v Burden [2000] NSWSC 105 (Simpson J), where the plaintiff held gaming licences requiring that he be a fit and proper person, Mr Renshaw had to satisfy a specific test of being a fit and proper person to be a barrister, where the character flaw attributed was inherent in the role for which he was said to be unfit. As a general rule, however, as the New South Wales Court of Appeal explained in Waterhouse v Hickie (1995) Aust Torts Reports 81-347, imputations of being ""unfit"" are a rhetorical flourish. 
29As Ms Rao explains in her helpful submissions, this is particularly the case where what is asserted is unfitness for office or membership of an organisation: Fierravanti-Wells v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 648 (unfit to be a senator); O'Shane v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd (2004) Aust Torts Reports 81-733 (unfit to be a magistrate). Generally speaking, such an imputation is permissible only if the fitness for a specific profession is capable of this kind of specific definition, where an imputation of being unfit for that position is capable of conveying a defamatory meaning. Where this occurs, the nature of the unfitness is generally specified in the imputation, such as being unfit to be a councillor after failing to disclose a conflict of interest (Bennison v O'Neil [2012] NSWSC 360), being unfit to be a director after displaying bad commercial judgement (Heugh v Askin [2014] WASC 30), or being unfit to be in charge of Olympic swimmers because of his improper sexual attentions to a minor (Hodge v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 933). 
30Without being disrespectful to the importance of cake decorating, the matter complained of refers to the basis upon which the plaintiff should be expelled from an organisation membership of which says nothing about her character. As Ms Rao points out in her written submissions at [23], a general allegation of unfitness for membership of the Cake Decorators Association would say nothing about the plaintiff, except possibly being a disinterested or poor cake decorator. No such imputation is capable of being conveyed. Ms Rao submits that an imputation casting aspersions on cake decorating skills or interest is also incapable of being defamatory, but as I am satisfied that no such imputation is conveyed, this is not an issue upon which I need to make any findings. 
Orders
31I set out below the orders I have made. These include orders for the parties to attend a court-arranged mediation before one of the registrars of this court pursuant to s 26 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). These mediations, which are conducted without charge to the parties, form an essential part of the court's case management process, and are of particular assistance in defamation actions, where the technicality of the law and expense of proceedings may mean that the results of litigation may be as uncertain as they are pyrrhic. I have stood these proceedings over to a date after the mediation has taken place.
(1)On the application of the defendant, with the plaintiff neither consenting nor opposing, the entire issue of ""Pipeline"" for December 2012 is struck in to the matter complained of.
(2)The plaintiff's application to strike in Motion 4 from the August 2012 edition of ""Pipeline"" is dismissed.
(3)Imputations (b) and (c) are struck out.
(4)Grant leave to the plaintiff to replead imputation (d) as ""That the plaintiff does not act fairly"".
(5)Grant leave to the plaintiff to replead imputation (e) to delete the words ""and to the detriment of"".
(6)Imputation (f) is not pressed.
(7)Imputations (h) and (i) are struck out with leave to replead.
(8)Imputation (j) is struck out.

2704825,Deakin v R [2014] NSWCCA 121,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J.

2ADAMS J: I agree with Hall J.

3HALL J: The applicant, Andrew Benjamin Deakin, seeks leave to appeal in respect of a sentence imposed on him by the District Court on 26 June 2012.

4On 27 May 2011, the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing the following counts:

Count 1: supply a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug (30.242 kg of MDMA) contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole of 15 years applicable.

Count 2: participate in a criminal group contrary to s 93IK(1) Crimes Act 1900 [since renumbered to s 93T(1)], which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment."" 

1. Delay

5A Notice of Intention to Appeal was signed by the applicant on 20 July 2012. It was filed in the Registry on 3 August 2012. Following a number of extensions of time being granted, the present Notice of Appeal dated 14 November 2013 was filed on 19 November 2013.

6The reasons for the delay are set out in the affidavit of Martin Ricci, solicitor for the applicant sworn on 31 March 2014.

7The Crown did not make submissions opposing the grant of leave to appeal. The circumstances explaining delay, on the evidence in Mr Ricci's affidavit, establish that the delay was not occasioned by inactivity on the part of the applicant.

8In the circumstances, I consider that leave to appeal should be granted, notwithstanding the delay that has occurred.

2. Sentences Imposed on 26 June 2012

9In respect of Count 1, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months commencing 29 January 2011 to expire on 28 July 2018 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 28 July 2021.

10In respect of Count 2, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months commencing 29 January 2011 and expiring on 28 January 2012.

3. Grounds of Appeal

11The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

Ground 1 - Her Honour erred in commencing the sentence only two months before the completion of the earlier non-parole period being served by the applicant

Ground 2 - Her Honour made inadequate allowance for the finding of special circumstances when setting the non-parole period on Count 1

Ground 3 - Her Honour erred in selecting the commencement date for the sentences imposed on Counts 1 and 2

12In relation to Ground 3, I note that the Crown conceded in its written submissions (at [19]) that whilst the sentencing judge stated that she intended to backdate the sentences by three months that the sentences were in fact backdated by two months. Accordingly, in those circumstances leave to appeal should be granted in respect of that ground to give effect to the sentencing judge's intention. 

4. Facts Concerning Previous Offences

13Before considering Grounds 1 and 2, I will address the relevant matters in relation to earlier sentence proceedings concerning the applicant.

14On 5 December 2008 the applicant appeared in the District Court (Flannery DCJ) for sentence regarding drug offences committed in 2000. He had avoided detection until his arrest in 2007.

15Her Honour sentenced the applicant for the following offences:

(1)Attempting to possess a trafficable quantity of a prohibited substance (116.7g of MDMA).

(2)Possession of prohibited import (121.92g of MDMA).

16The relevant facts on the sentencing hearing for those offences were that the applicant had been involved in a drug importation in 2000. On 6 January 2000, Australian Customs had intercepted two packages from South Africa. MDMA in the amount of 116.7g was secreted inside them. 

17The applicant and a man named Edrie Youssef had accepted delivery of the packages in a controlled operation. The applicant subsequently evaded police. The car that he had been driving was searched and a further 121.92g of MDMA were found along with the applicant's passport and a pill press machine.

5. Sentences Imposed by Flannery DCJ

18On 5 December 2008 the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant to an overall sentence of 6 years 6 months imprisonment dating from 29 June 2007 with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months. The non-parole period for these sentences expired on 28 March 2011. The total sentence expired on 28 December 2013.

19The sentencing remarks of Flannery DCJ on 5 December 2008 were provided to the sentencing judge (Tupman DCJ) at the sentencing hearing on 31 May 2012.

20The applicant was 25 years of age when he committed the offences dealt with by Flannery DCJ. He was 32 years of age when he committed the offences dealt with by Tupman DCJ.

6. Facts Relating to Counts 1 and 2

(a) Count 1: Supply large commercial quantity of prohibited drug

21An Agreed Statement of Facts dated 27 May 2011 was tendered at the sentencing hearing (Exhibit A). The facts in relation to Count 1 are that on 19 April 2007 three persons by the name of Brack, Caristo and Teakaraanga were seen by surveillance officers at a residential unit at Warayama Avenue, Rozelle. Those premises were believed to be a ""safe house"" used by the relevant criminal syndicate. The men were subsequently followed to a factory in Wirega Avenue, Kingsgrove. On 20 April 2007 police carried out surveillance at or near the factory premises. The men were seen leaving the factory unit and were followed by surveillance officers. Police followed the vehicle in which they were travelling to Hurlstone Park and subsequently stopped the vehicle in which Brack, Caristo and Teakaraanga were situated. Caristo and Teakaraanga were arrested.

22Brack was allowed to leave. He was followed in his vehicle during which he had telephone conversations with the applicant.

23On 20 April 2007 police executed a search warrant at the Rozelle unit which had been leased by Caristo and which was used by the syndicate as a place to store drugs and other items.

24Police located a suitcase and found within it 19 vacuum sealed bags each containing a brown powder. The bags were seized and sent to the Division of Analytical Laboratories for analysis. Tests found that the total weight of the powder inside the bags was 18.976 kg. The powder was identified as MDMA and was found to have a purity of 58%. 

25During the investigation police found the applicant's DNA and fingerprints on various items found in the home unit.

26On 21 June 2007, an intercepted telephone conversation on the applicant's phone was made. The conversation was between the applicant and another male. The Crown contended that during these calls arrangements were made for the applicant to move from Sydney to Queensland and also to transport the MDMA to Queensland.

27On 29 June 2007, the applicant entered a vehicle driven by another person. On that day he, and persons Connell and Makrillos were stopped and arrested. The applicant declined to be interviewed and was later charged.

28Two vehicles were taken to the police station at the Entrance. It was there that the applicant was charged. A search of one of the vehicles found a large blue duffle bag. Inside the bag police found a number of plastic bags containing a large quantity of coloured tablets. These were seized and sent for analysis. Tests found the total weight of the tablets to be 11.266 kg. The tablets were identified as containing MDMA with a purity ranging from 24% to 28%. These drugs, along with the MDMA powder found in the unit at Rozelle, made up the total weight of 30.242 kg that is the subject of Count 1 on the indictment.

29Further tests conducted on the plastic bags revealed that the applicant's DNA was located on some of the bags. 

(b) Count 2: Participation in a Criminal Group

30Between 2 March 2007 and 29 June 2007 the offender was involved with a criminal group carrying out drug-related activity.

31The Agreed Facts recorded that whilst the applicant's participation was directly related to the supply of the MDMA the subject of Count 1, the criminal group itself had access to large amounts of other prohibited drugs including 31.6 kg of MDMA (found at the Kingsgrove factory), 7.4 kgs of cocaine and 12.88 g of lysergide (found at the Rozelle unit) and a further 12.9 kg of MDMA (found at the Rozelle unit in a locked container). 

32Police identified a number of properties used by the criminal group. These included the factory at Kingsgrove (used for the production of MDMA tablets), a serviced apartment in Pitt Street, Sydney (used to count money), and a storage unit at Camperdown (used to store cash and other items). The criminal group also had access to firearms and large amounts of cash. During the investigation police seized four handguns and $635,000 in cash.

33In a Further Agreed Statement of Facts dated 31 May 2012 (Exhibit B) the following were recorded as agreed facts concerning the characterisation of the applicant's role in the organisation:

""i. The offender's role in the organisation was equivalent to that of the co-offender Peter CARISTO;

ii. The offender was an employee of the organisation in whom there was a degree of trust placed. The offender was entrusted with the transportation of 11.266 kilograms of MDMA tablets to Queensland (referred to in paragraph 24 of the agreed facts dated 27 May 2011) and the control and later transport of the 18.976 kilograms of the MDMA powder in the locked black suitcase in the second bedroom of the unit at Rozelle (referred to in paragraph 10 of the agreed facts dated 27 May 2011); and

iii. Although the offender's role was to transport the MDMA to Queensland for the organisation, his role was not limited by a lack of knowledge of the other participants or scope of the organisation.""

7. The Applicant's Subjective Case

34There were two reports of Mr Watson-Munro, psychologist, tendered at the sentencing hearing before Tupman DCJ, the first of which had been prepared for the sentence proceedings before Flannery DCJ.

35The applicant's background was detailed in both reports. Mr Watson-Munro noted in his earlier report, dated 17 November 2008, that the applicant was born on 18 August 1974 to parents who were both heroin addicts. Mr Watson-Munro summarised the applicant's social history which included various traumas referrable to his formative childhood years. The deprivation that he suffered in those years resulted in him experiencing feelings of anxiety, depression and insecurity. These, in addition to the genetic determinants identified by Mr Watson-Munro, were said to offer an explanation into his early foray into illicit drug use involving cannabis as a means of self-medication.

36In evidence at the sentencing hearing Mr Watson-Munro described the applicant's drug use as ""an addiction of majestic proportions going back to his teenage years"": T 17:25-26.

37In his second report, dated 30 May 2012, Mr Watson-Munro observed that in times recent to the report the applicant had continued in custody to use drugs on a limited and intermittent basis. By the time of the sentencing hearing before Tupman DCJ the applicant had started on a methadone program. Mr Watson-Munro observed:

""In this regard he appears to have reached a point of 'criminal burnout' arising from his age and his extensive years of time in prison coupled to his exposure to the criminal element"": Report of Mr Watson-Munro, 30 May 2012, p 4. 

38Mr Watson-Munro gave evidence at the sentence hearing. He had seen the applicant over a number of years and considered that there had been a dramatic shift in his psychological wellbeing. He considered that he was intelligent and had increasing insight into the origins of his problems, and he had ongoing family support. He expressed the opinion that an extended period of parole supervision was in both the applicant's and the community's best interests: T 16:5-10. He considered that the applicant was more amenable to supervision and treatment than he had been in the past. He confirmed that recent relapses confirmed the applicant's need for treatment in custody as well as on parole.

39There were two character references. The authors of both had known the applicant for many years. Both described the development of his drug addiction. Both expressed the view that his arrest in 2007 had saved his life. They also considered he had significantly changed since entering custody and was remorseful for his conduct.

40The Crown did not dispute the applicant's history as contained in the references, in the reports of Mr Watson-Munro or in a letter that he had written and which was tendered at the hearing.

8. Remarks on Sentence

41In respect of the subject offences her Honour noted that the maximum penalty for the offence constituting Count 1 was life imprisonment and that there was a prescribed standard non-parole period of 15 years, and that the maximum penalty for the offence the subject of Count 2 was 15 years imprisonment (the maximum penalty was, in fact, 5 years imprisonment, but no point arises in the present proceedings in that respect). 

42Her Honour set out the facts in relation to Count 1. These reflected the relevant matters set out in Exhibit A.

43Her Honour noted that the facts for the second count to some extent overlapped the facts for the first and that the applicant's commission of the first offence was, as part of a criminal group, obviously contributing to the criminal activity of drug supply.

44The sentencing judge noted that the criminal group in question had access to large amounts of other drugs which included the quantity of 31.6 kg of MDMA found at the factory in Kingsgrove. 

45Her Honour noted that Count 1 was a very serious offence as reflected in the maximum penalty and that only a term of full-time custody would suffice to deal with the seriousness of that offence. 

46In determining the objective seriousness of the offence, Count 1, her Honour stated:

""... I take into account the quantity of ecstasy, the subject matter of the count, which is in fact sixty times more than the quantity defined as being a large commercial quantity, namely 500 grams. More than half of the total of thirty kilograms was also of relatively high purity, indicating, I find, that at least that portion would be further diluted before being supplied ultimately to end users. Also the offender's involvement was over a period of time, not just one or two days, almost four months, as part of an organised criminal activity which was well planned and sophisticated and he was clearly significantly involved in this syndicate"": Remarks on Sentence at pp 4-5.

47Her Honour then addressed the applicant's role stating:

""His role is important in assessing the seriousness of his offending. In the end this was not a matter of dispute between the parties. It is agreed that he played an important role and was an important part in the ongoing operation of this syndicate. His role included transporting the drugs from New South Wales to Queensland for the purpose of getting it to the market and it is conceded on his behalf that he intended to do something similar with the other drugs found under his control in the suitcase in the unit at Rozelle. He also had knowledge of what others in the syndicate were doing and was kept informed by Brack at least of the arrest of Caristo and Teakaraanga"": Remarks on Sentence at p 5.

48Her Honour continued that the applicant played:

""...a pivotal role in getting the drugs to market but there is no evidence before me that even if such an identity in fact exists in drug syndicates such as these, that he was the principal or the leading light ..."": Remarks on Sentence at p 5.

49Her Honour further noted that to the extent that it was possible to identify specific roles by title in drug syndicates, there was no evidence that the applicant was a principal or leading member of the syndicate: Remarks on Sentence at p 5.

50Her Honour finally accepted that the applicant's role, like Caristo, was as an employee of the syndicate and not as a principal, however, her Honour further observed:

""... However I assess his role as being slightly higher than Caristo, who was found to be simply a mixer of drugs, an employee only, on the findings made on his sentence..."" 

51In relation to the applicant's plea of guilty it was noted that the plea was entered on 27 May 2011 and was therefore a late plea. Her Honour noted that he was arrested on 29 June 2007.

52The trial date of 23 May 2011 was vacated on 13 May 2011 when the applicant's legal advisors informed the court that there would be a plea of guilty. 

53Her Honour allowed a discount on sentence of 15%: Remarks on Sentence at p 9.

54Her Honour noted that the applicant did not give evidence. In relation to the matter of assistance, her Honour allowed an additional 10% discount: Remarks on Sentence at pp 9-10.

55In relation to subjective circumstances, the sentencing judge referred to the fact that she had read the reports of Mr Watson-Munro and also the sentencing remarks of Flannery DCJ in 2008 for the drug-related offences which occurred in 2000. Her Honour also noted that she had read the references tendered in evidence, as well as the letter of apology which the applicant wrote on 31 May 2012 and noted the evidence relating to the applicant's dysfunctional and difficult upbringing. 

56Her Honour observed that the offences for which he was sentenced in 2000 related to possession of what he thought was ecstasy in a parcel imported from South Africa and being in possession of ecstasy in the car from which he fled. He claims to have only had a peripheral involvement with the drugs, although it seemed that the sentencing judge did not accept his account in that respect. Flannery DCJ, however, found that his involvement was as a result of his very extensive drug use. In relation to the subject offences in these proceedings, her Honour observed:

""He was involved in the offences before me at around this time or towards the end of this period and I accept, more probably than not, there is a connection between his extensive drug use and his commission of the offences ..."": Remarks on Sentence at p 11.

57Her Honour accepted that his motive was one of financial gain.

58As to the applicant's real prospects of rehabilitation, her Honour considered that they were hard to gauge because of his addiction over such a long period. Her Honour then stated:

""...He will however need a longer than normal period of supervision in the community in due course and hopefully access to drug and alcohol counselling whilst in custody ... He has also been studying the equivalent of the HSC in custody and other courses to improve his life chances on release..."": Remarks on Sentence at p 12.

59Her Honour noted that he had the support of family members and had an ongoing relationship with a female friend for almost 20 years. Her Honour stated:

""...All of this will assist his prospects of rehabilitation, although it must be noted that they were also part of his life at the time he committed these offences"": Remarks on Sentence at pp 12-13.

60Her Honour accepted that he had a genuine desire to move on and remove himself from the criminal milieu, to remain free of drugs, and to attempt to rehabilitate himself. Her Honour accepted that up to the time of sentencing he had demonstrated some insight into the connection between his offending behaviour and his use of drugs and that provided some optimism: Remarks on Sentence at p 13.

61In formulating the sentence her Honour took a starting point for the applicant of 14 years imprisonment. The combined discount of 25% produced an overall period of 10.5 years. Her Honour then observed that the applicant would need a longer than normal period of supervision and that there would be an accumulation on the sentence imposed for the 2000 offence. Her Honour observed:

""...For those two reasons there will be some special circumstances and a reduction in what would otherwise be the appropriate non-parole period. I have determined that his non-parole period should be 7½ years, a little below the statutory ratio"": Remarks on Sentence at p 16.

62Her Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 above. As there stated, the sentence for Count 2 was imposed on a concurrent basis, being a fixed term of 12 months.

9. Applicant's Submissions

63It was noted that although the sentence determined by Flannery DCJ provided for a non-parole period that expired on 28 March 2011, the applicant was in fact not released from custody at that time because the proceedings in respect of the subject offences had yet to be concluded.

64The sentence imposed by Tupman DCJ commenced on 29 January 2011 which it was said was the subject of an error as it had not been backdated by three months as had been intended, but only by two months. There was accordingly a period of partial concurrency of 2 months between the two sentences.

65It was noted in the submissions for the applicant that the consequence of the decision of Tupman DCJ to partially accumulate the sentences by only two months was that the effective overall sentence being served by the applicant in relation to all offences amounted to 14 years 1 month, with a non-parole period of 11 years 1 month.

66The submission noted that the application of the totality principle required an evaluation of the overall criminality involved in all of the offences with which the applicant was charged. It was submitted that, where necessary, the Court must adjust the prima facie length of the sentences downward in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences: Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 per McHugh J at 308.

67Reference was also made to the decisions in R v Close (1992) 31 NSWLR 743 per Hunt CJ at CL at 748; Kalache v R [2011] NSWCCA 210 at [31]-[32] per Buddin J. 

68It was submitted that had her Honour properly applied the sentencing principles regarding totality, the result would have been that the sentence for Count 1 would have overlapped the non-parole period imposed by Flannery DCJ to a considerable degree. Such an approach, it was contended, was necessary when sentencing the applicant, in order to avoid the imposition of a 'crushing' total term.

69The decision to impose a sentence that only backdated the sentence by two months, it was submitted, brought about a total sentence that was not just and appropriate in all of the circumstances.

10. Crown Submissions

70The Crown submitted that the decision as to whether to accumulate in respect of multiple sentences was fundamentally an exercise within the discretion of a sentencing judge.

71It was plain, it was submitted, that the parties at the sentencing hearing had focussed upon the issue of totality. The Remarks on Sentence and the Statement of Facts in the prior proceedings heard by Flannery DCJ were before the sentencing judge. Her Honour gave consideration to the question of totality and determined that the sentence being imposed should be backdated ""slightly"" to reflect the overall totality. In this respect, reliance was placed upon the observations in Franklin v R [2013] NSWCCA 122 at [44] per Hoeben CJ at CL.

72It was further submitted that the criminality involved in the prior offences was serious. Further, those offences were totally unrelated to the present matters. There was not involved here one course of conduct. Further, the criminality of the earlier offences could not be encompassed in the criminality of the offences in Count 1.

73It was submitted that it was clear that her Honour took into account the appropriate considerations in determining to partially accumulate the sentence, being fundamentally an exercise within the discretion of the sentencing judge. Reliance was placed upon the observations of Simpson J in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7].

74The Crown submitted that Ground 1 was without merit and should be dismissed.

11. Consideration

75The offence of supply a large commercial quantity of prohibited drug contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (Count 1), carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. They are to be taken as statutory guidelines in the overall assessment of the relevant objective and subjective factors. 

76The offence of participate in a criminal group contrary to s 93IK(1) of the Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.

77The sentencing judge, as the above summation indicates, had regard to all relevant objective and subjective factors. Her Honour also undertook a comparative analysis of the applicant's offending to that of Mr Caristo, her Honour noting that both offenders were employees and not principals. She concluded, as earlier noted, that the applicant's role was ""slightly higher"" than Caristo. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr Caristo had been involved with a greater quantity of drugs, he had only been involved for a very short time.

78Her Honour also observed that the subject offences were committed when police had been wanting to apprehend him for the offences committed in 2000. He had continued his criminal conduct in 2007 even after Caristo, Teakaraanga and others had been arrested earlier that year. Her Honour considered these factors were relevant to the applicant's moral culpability and elevated his offending above that of Caristo. This aspect of the proceedings, her Honour observed, made specific deterrence a more significant issue on sentencing. It also was said to have some bearing on the assessment of the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation. His relapses into drug use in August 2010, February 2011 and January 2012 impacted upon her Honour's assessment of the prospects of his rehabilitation. Understandably, her Honour concluded that the applicant's future prospects were hard to gauge because he had such a long history of drug abuse: Remarks on Sentence at pp 9-12.

79Her Honour did not consider that the applicant's criminal record was of great moment, consisting mainly of Children's Court offence, other than the offences committed in 2000. Her Honour considered general and specific deterrence were important given the applicant's extensive drug history.

80Her Honour made a finding of special circumstances upon the basis that the applicant needed a longer period of supervision as well as the accumulation on the sentence imposed for the offences committed in 2000.

81Her Honour observed:

""One issue remains and that is the commencement date of this sentence. As I said Judge Flannery sentenced him to 6 years with a non-parole of 3 years and 9 months backdated to commence on 29 June 2007 when he was arrested for these offences. It follows that, had it not been for these matters before me, he would have been eligible for release to parole on 28 March 2011. Since then he has remained in custody, ineligible for release to parole because of the matters before me. In fact his overall sentence on that matter does not expire until 28 June 2013. The Crown argues that I should commence this sentence from 29 March 2011, the day that he became eligible for release to parole. I have actually decided to backdate it slightly by three months to reflect overall totality, that is the totality of all matters for which he is in prison."" (Remarks on Sentence at p 16)

82I note that the issue of totality was raised in submissions, although dealt with quite briefly. The transcript of 31 May 2012 records the following (at p 26):

""HER HONOUR: The Crown is urging me effectively to have not even a partial accumulation of full concurrency of this sentence with the pre-existing non-parole period. At the very least a partial accumulation is a fact to take into account when determining whether or not there should be special circumstances.

BOULTEN: That's the one feature of course.

HER HONOUR: If I accept there's a need for a longer than normal period of supervision in the community, that's another feature.

BOULTEN: Your Honour's got some evidence too. He's in the main [sic] but he's been assaulted a few times and it's not an easy gaol sentence for him. It's the first time he's been to gaol. These are added reasons why there are special circumstances. My friend's submission that this sentence should commence at the expiration of the non-parole period should not be accepted unless your Honour takes the course which has been largely frowned upon for ten or 15 years, namely that you just squash this sentence down to take into effect totality.

HER HONOUR: That was contrary to what Pearce said in any event. Pearce says it should be an appropriate sentence and then there should be considerations, when there is more than one charge, considerations of totality as between those charges, and Pearce doesn't say this, but over all as a matter of law there should be considerations of totality with pre-existing sentences and periods of time in prison.

BOULTEN: Had this Court or Flannery DCJ dealt with these two cases simultaneously then there wouldn't really have been this argument almost certainly I submit. But your Honour would in my submission partially accumulate. A number of years in custody for the 2000 offence would in my respectful submission more than adequately give effect to all of the relevant principles of totality, including give [sic] effect to the proportionality of offending for the totality of both offences."" 

83In Postiglione v R, supra, McHugh J observed (at 307-308):

""The totality principle of sentencing requires a judge who is sentencing an offender for a number of offences to ensure that the aggregation of the sentences appropriate for each offence is a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved. In Kelly v R, O'Loughlin J, sitting in the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, applied the following unreported remarks of King CJ in R v Rossi:

'There is a principle of sentencing known as the principle of totality, which enables a court to mitigate what strict justice would otherwise indicate, where the total effect of the sentences merited by the individual crimes become so crushing as to call for the merciful intervention of the court by way of reducing the total effect.'

The application of the totality principle therefore requires an evaluation of the overall criminality involved in all the offences with which the prisoner is charged. Where necessary, the Court must adjust the prima facie length of the sentences downward in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences.

Recent decisions in the Court of Criminal Appeal have extended the ambit of the totality principle. Those decisions hold that, in order to comply with the totality principle, a sentencing judge must consider the total criminality involved not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, but also in any offences for which the offender is currently serving a sentence.

The most recent statement to this effect was made by Hunt CJ at CL in R v Gordon:

'When a custodial sentence is to be imposed which will be cumulative upon, or which will overlap with, an existing custodial sentence, the judge must take into account that existing sentence so that the total period to be spent in custody adequately and fairly represents the totality of criminality involved in all of the offences to which that total period is attributable.' 

This line of authority is consistent with the recognition of the totality principle found in s 16B of the Act which provides ..."" (footnotes omitted)

84In the present proceedings it was submitted that the sentencing judge's decision to impose a sentence backdated by two months has brought about a total sentence that is not just and appropriate in all the circumstances: Applicant's Written Submissions at [62].

85The sentence imposed for Count 1 constituted a non-parole period of 71.4% of the overall term. As noted in the written submissions for the applicant, had her Honour not found special circumstances, the non-parole period on a sentence of 10 years 6 months (126 months) imprisonment would have been 7 years 10.5 months (94.5 months). 

86The practical consequence of the finding of special circumstances, it was noted, was that the applicant's non-parole period was reduced by 4.5 months. This, it was contended, resulted in an inadequate reduction in the non-parole period.

87As earlier noted (at paragraph [63]) the effective overall sentence to be served by him, if one includes the sentences imposed by Flannery DCJ, amounts to 14 years 1 month imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years 1 month. The total non-parole period constitutes 78.6% of the overall term.

88It was submitted that at no point in the Remarks on Sentence did the sentencing judge refer to the impact of the combined or overall non-parole period on the proportion of time to be spent in custody as opposed to the period on parole supervision. It was said that this was an important issue that appeared to not have been given consideration: Applicant's Written Submissions at [70].

12. Conclusion and Orders

89I consider that Grounds 1 and 2 should be considered together.

90It is first relevant to note that the practical consequence of the finding of special circumstances produced only a very small reduction in the applicant's non-parole period in respect of the sentence imposed for the offence in Count 1, namely, 4.5 months.

91The sentencing judge was required to determine what would constitute an appropriate application of the totality principle having regard to the term of the sentences imposed by Flannery DCJ in determining what should be an appropriate overall non-parole period having regard to the criminality involved in the subject offences and issues of concurrence and accumulation of sentences. 

92I have referred above to the very serious nature of the offence constituting Count 1 and the particular matters her Honour, with respect, correctly identified bearing upon the objective criminality of that offence. Her Honour also observed that the offending in respect of counts 1 and 2 occurred in the period in which the applicant was wanted by police in respect of the 2000 offences. These are all matters required to be taken into account in the application of the totality principle in determining whether the aggregation of the sentences imposed on the previous sentences is a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved.

93Ground 1 requires a determination as to whether, as submitted for the applicant, the sentencing judge erred in the application of the totality principle. Error is argued upon the basis that the commencement date of the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1 and 2, namely a date that was only two months before the completion of the earlier parole period being served by the applicant, did not give effect to that principle.

94I have concluded that error has been established in that respect. In so concluding, I proceeded upon the following bases:

(i)It has long been established that the totality principle applies where an offender is serving an existing sentence and is sentenced by a second court for a period after the first offence: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 66; Choi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 150 at [157]. In R v MMK (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [11] the Court observed:

""It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616.""

(ii)Questions of concurrence and accumulation are discretionary matters for the sentencing judge: R v Hammoud, supra, at [7]; R v Scott [2005] NSWCCA 152 at [31]; LG v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 249 at [24].

(iii)Judges at first instance should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected: Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [26].

(iv)That said, the discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality: R v MMK, supra, at [11]. 

(v)In the present case the relevant matters on the question of concurrence and accumulation are:

(a)The terms of the sentence imposed by the District Court on 5 December 2008, including in particular the non-parole period of 3 years 9 months; 

(b)The sentence including, in particular, the non-parole of 7 years 8 months imposed by the sentencing judge in these proceedings on 26 June 2012 imposed in respect of Count 1; 

(c)The assessment of the applicant by Mr Watson-Munro including his opinion that an extended period of parole supervision was in both the applicant's interests and the community's interests, an opinion that was accepted by the sentencing judge.

(vi)The matters referred to in (v), in my opinion, required a greater degree of concurrence than was provided for by the sentences imposed on 26 June 2012 in respect of Counts 1 and 2 to ensure a proper application of the totality principle, having regard to the full circumstances of the case. 

95A proper application of the totality principle in this case, in my assessment, would require that the sentences imposed in respect of Counts 1 and 2 commenced 12 months prior to the completion of the non-parole of 3 years 9 months in respect of the earlier sentence imposed on 5 December 2008.

96I am of the further opinion that, apart from the issue of concurrency of the sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2, the total terms of these offences and the non-parole period imposed in respect of Count 1 represent appropriate sentences having regard to all relevant factors identified by the sentencing judge.

97The effective overall non-parole period by reason of the order I propose in these proceedings will be a period of 9 years 6 months in lieu of the total effective non-parole period of 11 years 1 month arising under the sentences imposed respectively by Flannery DCJ and Tupman DCJ on 5 December 2008 and on 26 June 2012. As a result of the variation to the concurrence of the sentences the effective overall non-parole period is therefore reduced by 1 year 7 months.

98The order I propose I consider will also make the appropriate adjustment to the sentences imposed on 26 June 2012, thereby addressing the issue raise by Ground 3: see paragraph [12] above. 

99In re-sentencing, the finding of special circumstances by Tupman DCJ should apply in determining the ratio of the non-parole period to the total term in respect of Count 1. 

100Additionally, I note that on the orders I propose the ratio of the overall non-parole period to the overall term in respect of sentences imposed on 5 December 2008 and on 26 June 2012 will be approximately 71.6%.

101Accordingly, I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on the applicant by the District Court on 26 June 2012 be granted. 

(2)Appeal allowed. 

(3)Quash the sentences imposed by the District Court on 26 June 2012.

(4)In lieu thereof, the applicant be re-sentenced as follows:

(a)In respect of Count 1, to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 years 9 months to commence on 28 March 2010 and to expire on 27 December 2016 with a balance of term of 3 years 9 months to expire on 27 September 2020. 

(b)In respect of Count 2, to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months, commencing on 28 March 2010 and to expire on 27 March 2011.

(5)The earliest date upon which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 28 December 2016.

2Charges 7 and 8 were added to the indictment at the commencement of the trial of the appellant on 18 March 2013.

3A jury entered a verdict of guilty on Counts 4 and 5 but acquitted the appellant on the other counts.

4The appellant has appealed against his conviction on the following grounds:

""Ground 1

That the Jury's verdicts of guilty on Counts 4 and 5 were inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on Counts 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8.

Ground 2

That the Jury's verdicts of guilty on Counts 4 and 5 were unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.""

5The grounds of appeal involve questions of mixed fact and law so leave to appeal is necessary. In my opinion leave should be granted.

6Because of the nature of the grounds of appeal it is necessary to set out the evidence adduced at the trial in some detail.

The course of the trial

7The principal witness was the complainant. She was born on 1 February 2005 and thus at the time of the incidents the subject of the counts on which the appellant was convicted was four years of age.

8The complainant's evidence in chief primarily consisted of three video-recorded interviews with a police officer, Detective Senior Constable Kate Gregory (DSC Gregory). The first two of these interviews took place on 5 and 23 August 2011 at which time the complainant was 6 years of age. The third interview took place some 14 months later on 10 October 2012 by which time the complainant was aged 7. The tapes for the interviews were marked for identification and played to the jury. Transcripts of the tapes were made available to the jury to assist them in their deliberations.

9The complainant also gave evidence at the trial on 19 March 2013 by which time she was 8 years of age.

(a) The first interview

10In this interview the plaintiff was shown a drawing of a female figure. She described the vagina as the ""pussy cat"". She said it was used to ""wee and poop"".

11The complainant was asked who was allowed to touch her ""pussy cat"". She said nobody and initially said no one had touched it. Immediately after that she said ""I mean dad touched my pussy cat"". 

12Shortly thereafter the following questions were asked:

""Q118 No, O.K. all right. So you said to me when I pointed to your pussy cat that your dad has touched your pussy cat?A Yep and he weed on me.

Q119 And he weed on you?A A-huh.

Q120 ... When did your dad touch your pussy cat?A Before I went to foster care cause of DOCS.

Q121 And where were you when dad touched your pussy cat?A At home.

Q122 O.K. So I wasn't there when your dad touched your pussy cat before foster care when you're at home can you tell me everything that happened from the start to the finish?A Dad touched me in the rude spot and then he weed on me and he kept on touching me only and on me on the other days as well and that's it.

Q123 All right. So when you say your dad touched you on your rude spot, what's your rude spot?A My pussy cat.""

13She said that this incident occurred at her home. She subsequently gave the following answers:

""Q143 O.K. So tell me more about how dad touched you on the rude spot?A I don't remember the rest.

Q144 Why don't you remember?A I don't know 'cause I just forgot.

Q145 O.K. How did he touch you on the rude spot?A With his fingers.

Q146 How did he touch you on the rude spot with his fingers?A Like through my undies.

Q147 What do you mean through your undies?A Like on my undies.

Q148 Do you remember what undies you were wearing?A Purple ones.

Q149 Did they have anything on them?A No, just plain purple undies.""

14Subsequently she stated that her father touched her in the lounge room having woken her up and put her on the lounge. She said he woke her up in the middle of the night. She was then asked these questions:

""Q174 ... and you said it was with his fingers, yes and you said it was through your undies, what do you mean it was through your undies?A On my undies.

Q175 O.K. So was it on the outside or the inside of your undies or something else?A Outside.

Q176 O.K. And what was dad doing with his fingers?A Touching me in the rude spot.

...

Q183 All right. So you said earlier that dad weed on you tell me more about that?A First he wiggle his rude part then he weed on me.

Q184 He What sorry?A He pulled his pants down and wiggle his rude part then weed on me. This is ...

...

Q197 O.K. How do you know he weed on you?A Because I saw white stuff coming out his rude part.""

15Subsequently the complainant said that the appellant took off her night-time pants and told her to lie down with her legs open. She said the appellant touched her on the ""rude spot"" and ""weed"" on her on other days, saying one of them was the very next day after the incident she first described. The interview proceeded in the following terms: 

""Q262 O.K. Can you tell me everything that happened from the start to the finish?A Well first he touched me in the rude spot with his fingers then he weed on me and that's it.

...

Q269 ... how did he touch you on the rude part?A With his fingers.

Q270 ... How did he use his fingers to touch you on the rude part?A Like, he left my undies on and touched me like that.

Q271 Like what?A Like my undies were on then he touched me.

Q272 Do you remember what colour undies you were wearing this day?A Purple I mean pink.

Q273 Pink. How do you know they were pink?A The very next day was pink.

Q274 O.K. Were you wearing anything else on this day?A In the night no he took my pants off and top off it's against the law.

Q275 It is. So you said he took your top off ...A A-huh.

Q276 ... so how did he take your top off?A He undid the buttons and took my arms out of the arm holes.

Q277 And then what happened?A And then he touched me on the rude spot again.

...

Q281 And when he touched you in the rude spot again was it on the inside, outside, or something else of your undies?A Outside.

Q282 On the outside of your undies. What did you feel when he touched you on the rude part?A It tickled. I farted again.

Q283 Lovely. What, can you tell me what happened after he touched you on the rude part again?
A I can't remember the rest of the story. 

Q284 O.K. you said earlier that he touched you on the rude part and he weed again, yeah? How did he wee?A Like he shaked his rude part then he weed on me with my shirt off on my tummy.

Q285 All right. So when you said he shaked his rude part what was he doing?A Trying to wee.

Q286 O.K. So how was he shaking his rude part?A Like with his hands.

Q287 O.K. And what was his hand doing?A His hands were shaking his rude part and then he weed on me.

Q288 O.K. And when, when he was touching you on your rude part was he, and you said he was using his fingers was he using one hand, two hands, or something else?A One.

Q289 And what was he doing with his other hand?A Putting it on his ...

Q290 ... Putting it on what, sorry?A On his rude part.""

16The complainant said that the very last time the appellant touched her on the ""rude spot"" was two nights before she went to foster care. She remembered that because the next night (after the appellant touched her on the ""rude spot"") the complainant, her mother and siblings ""...had heaps and heaps of fun [and] that was the day before we went to foster care"". She said that on that night she had blue undies on. She did not refer at this stage of the interview to the fact that the appellant ejaculated on her, although she was not asked.

17The complainant finally said in that interview that she thought the appellant had done it to another girl or boy before her because that was how he learnt to do it. She said the appellant did not say he had done it to another girl or boy.

(b) The second interview

18This interview took place some 18 days after the first. However, the complainant said she initially could not remember the last time she spoke to DSC Gregory. She declined to let DSC Gregory record their conversation. However, she eventually agreed. She said she did not want anyone to know what they talked about.

19She said that she did not remember telling DSC Gregory that her father had touched her on her ""pussy cat"". She then said she remembered it ""a little bit"" and subsequently a ""little tiny bit"".

20She was reminded by DSC Gregory that she told DSC Gregory at the previous interview that she remembered her father touching her on the ""pussy cat"" because the next day she had lots of fun with her mum and siblings and then went to foster care. She was then asked whether she remembered that and said ""Well that, that night we had heaps of fun but the night before that that was the last time he touched me"".

21When asked to describe her father touching her on the ""rude spot"" for the last time the complainant said again she did not remember, but subsequently said she remembered ""some stuff"". She was asked what she remembered and said that she remembered ""[w]hen dad touched us on the rude spot"". She was asked these questions and gave these answers:
""Q118 O.K. Can you tell me everything that happened from the start to the finish?A Well I can't remember.

Q119 O.K. Is this one of the times we talked about last time or a different time?A I can't remember that.

Q120 ... O.K. The last time you talked you told me about a time where your dad woke you up in the middle of the night and you were in the bunk in yours and [A]'s room?A In the top bunk.

Q121 You were in the top bunk were you?A And [A] was in the bottom bunk.

Q122 O.K. So was [A] in the bottom bunk when your dad woke you up?A Well we were in different beds, we wasn't in the top bunk and bottom bunk and we were in separate beds. I was in one side of the room where the door was and [A] was in the other side.

Q123 O.K. But you said you were on the top bunk?A Yeah.

Q124 How many beds are in yours and [A] room?A There used to be two.

Q125 Just two beds?A Yeah but now we got a top bunk and bottom bunk.

Q126 O.K. So when, the time when your dad come in and woke you up in your room you said you were in the top bunk?A That I don't remember much of that part but we were in different beds.

Q127 You were in different beds?A And now I remember some stuff.

Q128 What do you remember now?A Well I remember when dad touched us in the rude spot.

Q129 When you say, Dad touched us, what do you mean by that?A I mean me.

Q130 ... O.K. So what is it that you remember?A That when I was three a couple of nights I stayed in my bed without dad waking me up in the middle of the night or touching me on my rude spot ...

Q131 Mmm MmmA ... and then a couple more nights ago he touched me.

Q132 O.K. So can you remember one specific time that dad touched you?A Pardon?

Q133 Can you remember one, one time that he touched you?A The first night.

Q134 The very first time that dad touched you?A No I can't remember.

Q135 O.K. What about the very last time that dad touched you?A Well the very last time he wee'd on me?""
(Names have been anonymised)

22She said this occurred in the middle of the night and on a lounge in the lounge room which she said ""[l]ooks a bit stripy when it's not."" She said there was a blanket on the lounge but she could not remember its colour.

23She was then asked these questions and gave these answers:

""Q159 Was this on the time we're talking about, the very last time or is that on a different time?A That was on the very last time.

Q160 ... O.K. So you said he was wearing a black shirt?A Yes.

Q161 Was he wearing anything else?A I can't remember.

Q162 All right. And you told me last time that dad touched you on your rude part?A Yes.

Q163 What did he touch you with?A His fingers.

Q164 And what did he touch?A My rude spot.

Q165 What were you wearing when dad touched your rude spot?A My pyjamas.

Q166 And did dad touch you on the outside of your clothing, the inside of your clothing or something else?A I can't remember anything else and I had enough.

Q167 And what sorry?A I had enough.""

24Following a break, she was asked these questions:

""Q182 Tell me more about how he wee'd on you?A He wiggled his rude part and then wee'd on me.

Q183 Mmm Mmm.A I can fly like a bird.

Q184 And what did the wee look like?A It looked white.

Q185 And where did the wee go?A On me.

Q186 Where on you?A On my tummy 'cause he took my shirt off.

Q187 What did the wee feel like?A It feels slimy.

Q196 Where did he get the towel from?A From the door.

Q197 What door?A Like it was like the holes underneath the door it was there.

Q198 What do you mean the holes underneath the door?A Like that door has a tiny weeny hole underneath.

Q199 Yeah.A That's what type of hole ...

Q200 O.K.A ... under the door and mum put that towel there so no creatures come in the house or cockroaches.

Q201 OK So what door was the towel on?A The outside door and he took the towel and he wiped it off, up.

Q204 O.K. And what did he do with the towel after he wiped off his wee?A He put the towel back where it belonged.

Q205 Which was where?A Near the hole of the door, where it was.""

25DSC Gregory reminded her that she said earlier that her father had touched her 10 times. She was asked how she knew it was ten times and she said because she counted. She said the first occasion was when she was about three. She remembered telling her mother but she could not remember when, although she thought it was about a week after her dad went to his house but she later said it was a week before she went to foster care. She said she told her mother that ""daddy touched me in the rude spot"".

26She was shown a drawing of a male body and identified the penis as ""his doodle"" which she said was used for weeing. She stated that on one occasion the appellant asked her to touch him on his doodle and gave these answers:

""Q291 All right. So you said just before that your dad asked you to touch him on the doodle but you didn't. Can you tell me more about that?A Well he asked me and then I said, No, and he asked me again and I still said, No, then again, then again and I still said, No and that's it. I can't remember anything more.

Q292 ... Can you remember what it was that he said?A No.

Q293 Where were you when he asked you to touch him on the doddle?A Lounge room. I can fly.

Q294 When did he ask you to touch him on the doodle?A In the night. I'm flying back up.

Q295 When in the night?A Middle of the night.""

27She said at the time this occurred he was reading her a story called ""The Wishing Chair"".

28Finally in this interview she was asked the following questions:

""Q314 It is too. All right. So you said that dad's touched you on the rude part about ten times?A Yes.

Q315 How many times has dad wee'd on you?A One.

Q316 Just the once. And that was the last time that he touched you. Is that right?A Yeah. Look this can make a noise without it touching anything.

Q317 Wow. All right.A Now can I have my honey sandwich again.

Q318 Yeah just about, have you told anyone about dad asking you to touch his doodle?A No.""

(c) The third interview

29In the third interview the complainant said that she was seven years old. She was able to remember DSC Gregory. She said she had come to talk to DSC Gregory on that day about ""when...[CH] took photographs of her rude part"". She was asked these questions and gave these answers:

""Q45 All right. All right. So tell me, [DH], what have you come to talk to me about today?A About when [CH] took photos of my rude part.

Q46 And when you say 'rude part' what do you mean?A Like, where he's not meant to.

Q47 O.K. do you have another name for your rude part?A Vagina.

(Names have been anonymised).

30This was the first time the complainant used the word ""vagina"".

31The complainant then gave these answers:

""Q50 O.K. So when you got home. Can you tell me everything that happened from start to finish?A Yep. Well, we went to church and then church finished after we had morning tea. And then we had to walk up the hill since we didn't have a car. And then we walked up, [CH] gave me a lift and then he had the keys to the door. So he opened up the door with the keys and then went and said, 'Let's go onto your mum's bed and do stuff.' And I didn't know what he was going to do.

Q98 O.K. All right. And then you told me that [CH] said to go to your mum's bed. Tell me more about that?A Then as he did he pulled down my pants and then did it.

Q99 All right. So how did you get to your mum's bed?A He took me there.

Q100 How did he take you there?A Walked me.

Q101 O.K. And what did you do when you got into, was it in your mum's bedroom or somewhere else?A In my mum's bedroom.

...

Q113 O.K. So you say he took pictures. How did he take pictures?A Well, he had, like, this camera thing, I'm not sure but it's like a camera. Then he just pressed the button and kept on doing it.""
(Names have been anonymised).

32The complainant said he took six or seven photographs, pointing the camera ""down near my rude part"".

33She said when this concluded he told her to quickly pull up her pants and go to her room and not to tell anyone else.

34The complainant said she received an early present for her sixth birthday in summer on a Saturday and the above incident occurred on the following Sunday. She was then asked these questions:

""Q156 Yep. All right. So what else do you want to tell me about today?
A When he forced me to, like, get my rude part, I mean, my mouth onto his penis.

Q157 All right. And when you say ""he"" who do you mean?
A [CH].

Q158 And is that the same [CH] we've been talking about?A Yeah.

Q159 And when you say 'his penis' do you have another name for penis?A Rude part.

Q160 And what's the penis used for?A Weeing.

Q161 O.K. And so when did this happen?A I think it was when I, it was younger than before ...

Q162 Ah hmm.A ... when I was about 3.

...

Q165 All right. So I wasn't there when [CH] forced you to put your mouth onto his penis when you were at home in the night. Can you tell me everything that happened from the start to the finish?A Well, when everyone went to sleep and even I went to sleep then he woke me up. Then he said. 'Let's do some things.' And then I didn't know what he was going to do, and then he forced me and forced me to, like, do it. So then I just did it because he forced me. And then he told me not to tell anyone and then that's what he did. And he did that, like, every time I saw him in the night when he slept over.""
(Names have been anonymised). 

35She said the first time such an incident occurred was when she was three.

36She said what occurred on the first occasion was that CH had woken her up and told her to go to the lounge room without waking anybody. She said he was already in the lounge room waiting until she came down. She then said he then told her to open her mouth and he put his penis in it, having told her to close her eyes. She was then asked these questions:

""Q198 O.K. How do you know he put his penis in your mouth?A Because then when I opened up my eyes I saw him standing on the lounge trying to keep it in.

Q199 And you say 'trying to keep it in.' What do you mean 'it'?A The penis.

Q200 Can you stop playing with the microphone please? Thank you. All right. So you said when you opened your eyes he was standing on the lounge. How was he standing on the lounge?A Like, he told me before to, like, sit back and then that, and open my legs, and then, and so he's standing between my legs without him, like, making his feet touch me, like, not making it touch me.""

37The complainant said she said ""Get off"" and he said ""No"". She said she tried to push him away but he just kept on coming back. She said that he told her that if she told people he would not give her any more lollies.

38The complainant said that she thought the appellant forced her to put her mouth on his penis about six or seven other times. She said the last time was when she was five. She said she thought she was five because ""mostly everything happened"" when she was five.

39The complainant said the last time this occurred was on a day her mother was out. She described the incident in much the same terms as she described the previous incident. She said that she believed his penis was in her mouth for about 5-10 minutes.

40Towards the conclusion of the interview she was asked these questions:

""Q314 All right. Ah hmm. Yep. Has anything like this happened with anybody else before?A Well, once I asked my mum if, like, you know, how [CH] wee's on me?

Q315 Yep.A Yeah, if I, once when I was younger I asked if that happened. And then she said, 'My father did it to me and then did it to another child and then the other child then died and I don't know how.'""

41It is apparent that the complainant gave a different and more elaborate description of the sexual assaults which she said had occurred in the third interview as compared to the first and second interviews. It is also apparent that the information given in the third interview formed the basis of Counts 7 and 8 in the indictment.

(d) The complainant's evidence at trial

42The complainant was examined and cross-examined after the records of interview were played to the jury. 

43In her evidence in chief she was asked about the incident when she went with the appellant on a bike from church to her home. She said the trip took about two or three minutes.

44The complainant identified certain photographs inside or outside where she was living when the incidents occurred. She was shown a photograph of the lounge room which contained two lounges but said she did not know exactly where the lounges were at the time but they were near a window. She was pretty sure when she was living there that the lounges were in the place shown by the photograph.

45She was then asked about the incident where the appellant took photographs of her rude parts. She was referred to the fact she told DSC Gregory that she was turned round and she was looking out the window. She said the appellant was about a metre away from her. She said that when the photographs were taken she was still.

46She was then asked about the towel which she had referred to in her second interview. She said it was inside the front door, pushed close to the door so that mosquitos and cockroaches did not get in. She identified the door from the photographs.

47In cross-examination she said she was sure she could remember back to when she was three. She agreed that when the appellant stayed at their home he would sleep in the lounge room. However, she denied that she saw the appellant and her mother sleeping together in the lounge room and said she never saw them nude together in the lounge room. She also denied she ever saw them together in the lounge room when one of them was nude.

48It was suggested to her, and she denied, that she told one of her foster parents, SS, that ""Mum said if I be naughty I'll be allowed to go home"".

49The complainant said she could not remember being told by her mother about a song ""Concrete Angel"" which she said was about a girl who went to foster care and the foster parents were mean to her.

50The complainant was referred in cross-examination to her statement in the first interview that at the time of the incidents she described in that interview, she was wearing purple undies. She was asked how she remembered she was wearing purple undies and she said because she had a good memory. She was then referred to the fact she subsequently said they were blue and she thought that might be correct.

51She was asked whether she remembered which lounge she was on when the incidents took place and she said the bigger one. She said the television was on but the appellant put a cover over her so she could not see it.

52She was again referred to the first interview where she said the appellant had touched her on her undies. She was asked whether she remembered that or whether she was told to say it and she said she remembered it. She said when the incident occurred she was ""sort of laying, sort of sitting"" on the lounge and her feet were on the lounge. She was referred to the statement in the first interview (Question 122) that the appellant touched her on the ""rude spot"" and ""weed"" on her. She said he was on his knees and he had his penis facing her belly and then he started weeing. She was then asked these questions:

""Q. Was it like, did the wee come out like going to the toilet?A. Yes.

Q. And how long did it take him to wee?A. Well I don't know how long it took. I don't know.

Q. And you say this wee went on your tummy?A Yes.

Q. And that you were dried up?A. What do you mean dried up?

Q. Dad would dry you up, get a towel or something, a shirt or something and dry you?A. Yes.

Q. And then you'd go back to bed?A. Yes.

Q. And this happened when you were three?A. Yes.

Q. And you told -A. It happened quite -

Q. Sorry?A. It happened quite a few times.""

53The complainant was then cross-examined on the incident which she said occurred after she and the appellant came home from church. She confirmed the incident where the appellant put his penis in her mouth occurred in the lounge room and acknowledged she told DSC Gregory that the appellant was standing on the lounge and she was sitting. Notwithstanding that, she denied that it would follow that the appellant's penis was above her head. She also insisted that what occurred happened on a number of occasions and always the same way.

54She was later asked the following questions:

""Q. I just need, sorry, need to go back just a little bit, I apologise. Just back on the lounge when you said your dad put his penis in your mouth and that you said you - that you told him that you wanted him to stop?A. Hmm.

Q. How were you able to talk at the time when he had his penis in your mouth?A. Well I wasn't actually talking I was putting my hand up as a stop sign.""

55She was then asked these questions:

""Q. Right, so if I was to say to you that your dad never put his rude spot or his penis in your rude spot, your vagina, that that never happened. Would you agree with that?A. Well it didn't happen. He - what he did is everything else, but he didn't put his rude spot on my rude spot.

HIS HONOUR

Q. And [DH] did you ever tell your mum that he did that - put his rude - that he did put his rude spot in your rude spot?A. No I never told her cause it never happened.

DOYLE

Q. Did you ever say that to anyone, that your dad put his rude spot in your rude spot?A. No I didn't say that to anyone because it wasn't the truth.""
(Names have been anonymised).

56It was then suggested to her that she told JT (a foster carer) that the appellant put ""his wee wee inside of mine"" and she denied it.

57In re-examination she was asked the following questions:

""Q. When Mr Doyle, the other gentleman here, the other lawyer, was asking you some questions this afternoon about your dad weeing on you and he said 'Was it just like wee?' and you said, you agree that it was, do you remember that?A. Oh, yeah.

Q. All right. You know when you do a wee yourself?A. Mm.

Q. What colour is it?A. Just like yellow liquid.

Q. Can you see through it?A. Yeah.

Q. When your dad weed was it that sort of stuff?A. No it was white slimey stuff.""

(e) DSC Gregory

58DSC Gregory gave evidence of the interviews she conducted with the complainant. She also identified a number of photographs. She said photographs No. 1, 2 and 3 were photographs of the bedroom in which the complainant and her sister used to sleep. She said photograph No 4 showed an upstairs hallway and landing, photograph No 5 the view coming up the stairs and photographs No 6 and 7 the lounge room area. She said that photograph No 8 showed the lounge room looking towards the front door and photograph No 9 a close-up of the front door with a towel at the bottom of it.

59DSC Gregory said the towel was seized by the police and subjected to DNA analysis. She said that a swab of DNA was taken from the mouth of the appellant and the appellant's DNA had the same profile as the analysis taken from the towel, on which semen had been detected.

60In cross-examination DSC Gregory confirmed that a complaint was made by JT that the complainant had said to her ""My daddy did something bad to me, he put his wee wee inside mine and then he wee'd all over me"". She acknowledged that the complainant had never told her that anything of that nature occurred. DSC Gregory also said that the complainant told her she had learned of the song ""Concrete Angel"" from her mother.

61DSC Gregory agreed the complainant's house, when she saw it, was a bit of a mess. She said it was not a very nice smelling house and that on the lounge room floor there were lots of dirty dinner plates, clothes, computer-type cords and a keyboard.

(f) The evidence of the complainant's mother

62The complainant's mother (SB) said that at the time she gave evidence she saw the complainant about once a month. She said that since the complainant was moved from her care in August 2011 the contact was supervised.

63SB said that she met the appellant in 2002 and formed a romantic relationship with him. However, she said that when she moved into her residence where the offences were said to have been committed, they had separate housing arrangements although the appellant stayed over from time to time normally sleeping on the couch. She said the three-seater couch was always against a window as shown in the photographs although the two-seater couch used to be against another window.

64SB said she broke up with the appellant in 2006 but their contact remained sexual until March 2009. However, she said that after that she still remained in contact with the appellant. He would stay over at the house on a weekly basis, normally sleeping on the lounge.

65SB was asked about the towel at the front door and she said it was there to keep the draught and the insects out at night. She said she washed it regularly. She said she recalled that on one occasion when the appellant was staying the night the towel was wet with a very foul smell like someone had urinated on it. She said the wet portion of the towel did not have any particular colour.

66She said the incident when she noticed the towel was wet took place in 2009. She said she knew that because she was pregnant with her youngest child at the time.

67SB said that the room in which the complainant slept was set up with bunk beds in 2010 and that the complainant's sister moved in with the complainant in 2011.

68SB referred to an incident in 2009 when she said she saw the appellant tickling the complainant under the blanket. At the time there was a single bed in the room. She said she recalled the complainant saying ""Don't touch my knickies"".

69SB then said that she was told by a number of persons to take the complainant for a check-up. She said she was taken to see a Dr Lim by a friend of hers from church. She said the doctor did not examine the complainant but suggested if a similar incident occurred again, she should take the complainant to a paediatrician.

70SB said that in 2009 she remembered some persons from the Department of Community Services coming to her house and speaking to her about an allegation that the appellant had touched DH's ""dicky"". She said she did not know the source of that information.

71SB said that her daughters were returned to her care in January 2011. She said that the arrangement after that time was that she would bath them but if the appellant was there he would help. She said on those occasions she would put them to bed and the appellant would read them stories.

72SB was referred to a statement she made to the police about an incident which occurred on 2 or 3 August 2011. She said that on that day she was at home with WB, a person with whom at that time she was in a relationship with (they married in January 2012), and the appellant was at the premises. She said the appellant bathed the children and then started reading them a story called ""The Wishing Chair"". She said in her statement that after about 20 minutes she went to check on the appellant because she thought he was taking too long to read one chapter but she did not get all the way upstairs as the appellant was coming downstairs in a very rushed agitated state. 

73SB was then asked about events which occurred on 4 August 2011. She said she got a call from a case worker from DOCS, JM. She said the conversation concerned the appellant having supervised visits with the children. She denied she said in that conversation ""[CH] is touching his own daughter and you want him to have visit rights"" but claimed she said, ""[CH] is abusing his own daughter"".

74SB was then asked questions about an incident which she told the police occurred on the same night. She said the complainant said that she needed to tell WB something. She said the complainant was very scared and shaking. She said in her statement she remembered the complainant saying ""Daddy wiggled his thing inside me and weed on me"". She said the complainant also said ""I was watching cartoons and Daddy weed on the lounge"". She said the complainant was taken from the house in the early hours of the next morning. 

75SB was cross-examined about a recording she made of that incident on her computer. The recording which SB said was correct became Exhibit 2 in the proceedings.

76SB said in cross-examination that she knew the complainant was listening to the song ""Concrete Angel"". She denied telling the complainant it was the foster carers who killed the girl in the song. 

77SB was asked in cross-examination about the sexual relationship she had with the appellant. She agreed that she and the appellant had sexual intercourse in the lounge room, that the appellant used the withdrawal method for contraception and that on occasions after he withdrew he would ejaculate on her stomach. She denied the towel was used to clean up after they had sexual intercourse.

78SB said in cross-examination that she washed the towel ""monthly or a bit more often"" in the washing machine with detergent.

79SB said she never saw the complainant inappropriately touch the children and she was not concerned about the incident when he was tickling the complainant. SB stated that the appellant never went to the Rosemeadow church that was within walking distance of her residence with her.

(g) WB

80WB gave evidence that on 4 August 2011 he was at SB's residence. He said that about 8.30 or 9.00 pm the complainant came into the lounge room and said that she had something to tell him. 

81WB said that the complainant said ""My daddy touched me in my private part"". He said she needed to tell somebody. 

82He said that some 15 to 20 minutes later the police arrived.

(h) JT

83JT gave evidence that she had been caring for the complainant and her sister since about 12 September 2011.

84She said that on 14 September 2011 she had put the complainant to bed and finished the bedtime story when the complainant whispered to her ""My daddy did something bad to me as he put his wee wee inside of mine and then he wee-ed all over me"". 

85JT said the complainant then said in her normal voice ""I'm very brave. My mummy went through the same thing. It happened when my mum was little. Her dad did the same thing to her. I am very brave. Mum didn't report it till later on, so I'm really brave 'cause I told the police"".

(i) Melissa Bohocki

86Leading Senior Constable Bohocki gave evidence that on the night of 4 August 2011 she attended SB's residence. 

87She said the complainant said to her ""Daddy has said that [WB] touches us, so that [WB] would get in trouble. [WB] does not touch us. Daddy touches us"". She said the complainant went on to say ""Daddy put his rude bit on my rude bit and wiggled it and wee-ed on me"".

(j) Jeremy Watherston

88Mr Watherston was an employee of the Forensic and Analytical Science Services previously known as the Division of Analytical Laboratories. He described DNA, stating that it could be found in saliva.

89He said he conducted a DNA analysis on a buccal sample, a sample taken inside of the mouth of the appellant, and on a bath towel which was received by the laboratory on 31 October 2011. There was no issue that the buccal sample analysed was that taken from the mouth of the appellant and that the towel in question was the towel which was used to protect the front door of the complainant's mother's house.

90Mr Watherston said that two semen stains were detected on the towel but DNA testing was unsuccessful on one. In relation to the other stain he said the laboratory was successful in identifying DNA from within the sperm cell contained in that semen and the profile was the same as the appellant's DNA profile, agreeing that it would be expected to be found in less than one in ten billion individuals in the general population.

91Mr Watherston gave evidence that it was unlikely that the towel had been washed since the semen was deposited on it. He said it was very unlikely the part of the semen which the testing detected, acid phosphatase, would remain after washing. He was unable to put a time frame on how long the DNA had been stored on the towel stating that as long as the towel was stored under ideal conditions the stain could stay there for a matter of years.

92In cross-examination Mr Watherston agreed that DNA testing had been conducted on a semen stain contained on a brown cushion found on the premises. He said the DNA sample obtained did not match the appellant's profile.

(k) JM

93JM was a Child Protection Case worker employed by Family and Community Services. She gave evidence that in August 2011 she was the case worker with respect to DH.

94She said she had a conversation with the complainant's mother on 4 August 2011 in connection with the appellant having contact with his children on 6 August. During the course of that conversation JM expressed concern that WB had stayed over at the house. The conversation took place over the telephone and in the course of it the complainant came on the phone and said ""Yeah I talked to him [WB]. I told him my father touched me in my rude parts"".

95In cross-examination JM said that the appellant alleged that the complainant had told the appellant that she liked sleeping with WB.

(l) SS

96SS was a foster carer for the complainant between 6 January 2010 and 23 May of the same year. She stated that when the complainant was in her care the complainant said on numerous occasions ""Mum said if I be naughty I'll be allowed to go home"".

(m) The appellant

97The appellant did not give evidence but an ERISP was conducted between him, DSC Gregory and Constable Jason Darley on 24 November 2011 in the presence of the appellant's solicitor.

98The appellant said that when he stayed over at SB's residence he usually slept on a lounge or a foldout mattress. He said no one else slept in the lounge room when he was there.

99He denied that he indecently assaulted the complainant.

(n) The directions to the jury

100The trial judge gave the following directions to the jury:

""The Crown rely substantially on the evidence of [DH] to prove the critical aspects of its case. In any case where the Crown rely on one witness to prove a case against another, it is important the jury are told that they should exercise caution before they proceed to convict the accused. Unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that [DH] is an honest, reliable and accurate witness in the account she has given, you could not find the accused guilty. Therefore you should examine her evidence very carefully in order to satisfy yourself that you can safely rely upon her evidence to the high standard required. In a criminal trial that standard is proof beyond reasonable doubt.

...

Because this prosecution turns on whether you accept her in relation to a number of counts and critical matters, there would need to be a good reason for you to accept her on some matters but not on others or reject her on some matters but not others. You must consider each count separately by reference to the evidence that applies to it.

...

Now giving separate consideration to the individual counts means that you are entitled to bring in verdicts of guilty on some counts and not guilty on some other counts if there is a reason for that outcome as I explained earlier. It is for you to assess [DH's] credibility. As I said earlier the case depends on her evidence and if you have a reasonable doubt concerning the truthfulness or reliability of her evidence then you might say that the Crown have not proved the case beyond reasonable doubt on a count. Now if you have a reasonable doubt concerning her truthfulness or reliability on one or more counts. Any doubt about that count could impact on your consideration of her truthfulness and reliability on the remaining counts. In other words, a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant's evidence on one count ought to be considered in your assessment of her evidence generally, particularly her credibility.""
(Names have been anonymised).

101The jury requested and were given a copy of the transcript of the evidence of the complainant.

102At the conclusion of the day on which the judge directed the jury, a juror asked what the position was if a unanimous verdict could not be reached.

103At the commencement of the following day the jury sent a note, ""Jury can't come to a unanimous decision, guidance required"". The jury was then given a Black direction. The jury deliberated further but on the following day again stated they required assistance in coming to a unanimous decision. They were then directed that they could bring in a majority verdict according to s 55F of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW). The jury subsequently brought in the verdict to which I have referred.

104Although the submissions on each ground of appeal overlapped to a large extent, it is convenient to deal separately with the parties' submissions on each ground.

Ground 1

The parties' submissions

105The appellant accepted correctly that for this ground to be made out he needed to establish that the verdicts were an affront to logic and commonsense (MacKenzie v The Queen [1996] HCA 35; (1996) 190 CLR 348 at 368) and that they would not be set aside on this basis unless there was no rational way of reconciling them with the verdicts of acquittal.

106The appellant submitted that the verdicts in relation to Counts 4 and 5 were inconsistent with the verdicts of not guilty on the other counts. He submitted that the DNA evidence should not have led to a different result.

107The appellant submitted there were serious questions concerning the complainant's memory. He pointed to the fact that in the first interview the complainant repeatedly said she had forgotten some matters, including what happened when the appellant ""weed"" on her. The appellant referred to five instances but it is important to put them in context. The first instance occurred immediately after she told DSC Gregory that the appellant had touched her on her rude part just before she went into foster care. She was then asked the questions and gave the answers referred to in par [13] above, contrary to her stated lack of recollection. Her statement that she did not remember is, in my opinion, consistent with a child seeking to avoid answering the question.

108The second occasion occurred immediately prior to her giving the answers to which I have referred in par [14] above. Once again despite her statement that she could not remember what happened in the lounge room, she was immediately able to describe what occurred. The same may be said about the third, fourth and fifth occasions which respectively preceded, were during and followed that portion of the interview to which I have referred in par [15] above.

109Although it is correct as the appellant submitted that the use of the towel was not mentioned in the first interview, the complainant's attention was not directed to this matter by the interviewer. When asked in the second interview ""[w]hat happened to the wee?"" she volunteered the evidence concerning the towel.

110The appellant also submitted that the complainant was unable to recall in the second interview the discussion which took place in the first interview. However the occasions referred to by the appellant where the complainant said she did not recall were followed, as described in par [19] above, by the complainant saying she remembered ""a little bit"". The complainant then went on to repeat the allegations made against the appellant which she had made in the first interview. 

111The appellant also contended that the complainant at the second interview could not recall if the appellant had touched her on the inside or outside of her clothing. Her answers in fact were as follows:

""Q166 And did dad touch you on the outside of your clothing, the inside of your clothing or something else?A I can't remember anything else and I had enough.

Q167 And what sorry?A I had enough.

Q168 You've had enough? Do you want to take a break?A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)""

A break was then taken and thereafter the appellant answered the questions, although the question of where her dad touched her was not repeated (see par [24] above).

112The appellant also referred to the fact that the complainant appeared to conflate the two occasions in which the police visited SB's residence and gave inconsistent confused evidence as to the timing of the complaints. He also pointed to the fact that in the third interview she could not remember the last time her father forced his penis into her mouth and that in her cross-examination she said she remembered things which happened when she was three but not when she was four.

113The appellant also submitted the complainant's evidence was undermined by clear instances of reconstruction from other's statements and guesswork. He submitted that her evidence as to the colour of her underwear was unconvincing. He pointed to the fact that she said she knew she was three years old when the events took place because her mother had told her.

114The appellant submitted the complainant said that the appellant had touched her on her ""rude spot"" 10 times but she did not know how she counted the number of these incidents. In fact she said she counted them in her head but when asked if she counted them properly she said she did not know.

115The appellant also pointed to her evidence in cross-examination that she remembered things now which she did not remember in her second interview and her inability to give clear evidence as to the age of her sister and to clearly recollect SB's residence.

116The appellant also pointed to what he described as notable inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence. He pointed to the fact that the towel was not mentioned in the first interview and the allegations underpinning Counts 7 and 8 were not made until the third interview. The appellant also pointed to the fact that in the first interview the complainant said there were a number of instances when the appellant ""weed"" on her but said in the second interview that this occurred only once. 

117The appellant also pointed to inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence as to the timing of her complaint and inconsistencies as to her sleeping arrangements particularly what he described as the inconsistency between her statement in the first interview that she was shaken awake whilst she was in a bunk bed and her statement in the third interview when she said she was sleeping in the ""top bunk"" when she was three compared with her statement in the second interview to the effect that she was in a separate bed to her sister at the time of the incidents the subjects of Counts 4 and 5.

118The appellant also pointed to what he described as unsubstantiated assertions by the complainant, in particular the complaint of vaginal intercourse in the recorded conversation of 4 August 2011 (see par [75] above) and the statement by the complainant that the appellant had abused other children.

119The appellant also pointed to evidence which he submitted contradicted central aspects of the complainant's evidence. He referred in particular to her evidence concerning Counts 7 and 8, her denial that she had complained of vaginal intercourse contrary to the recording made by her mother and the evidence of JT and the inconsistent version of the complaints given by the complainant, SB, WB and JM.

120The appellant also contended that the complainant could have imagined the relevant events based on things she had witnessed or was told. He pointed to the suggestion that she may have seen the appellant and SB having sex on the lounge using the withdrawal method of contraception, the evidence of WB that he told the complainant she should tell someone what the appellant did so as to stop it happening to other children and what he described as allegations in the first and third interviews that the appellant may have abused or killed other children.

121The appellant also contended that the complainant's evidence in respect of Counts 4 and 5 suffered from significant difficulties. He referred again to the complainant's lack of recollection to which I have referred above; her evidence concerning the colour of her underwear; the lack of reference to the towel in the first interview; and the suggested inconsistency in her evidence as to the number of times the appellant ""weed"" on her and where she was sleeping at the time of the incidents.

122The appellant submitted that the difference in verdicts was unable to be explained by the DNA evidence. He pointed out that the incidents were said to have taken place before 6 January 2010 whereas the towel was seized in October 2011. He pointed out that only one of the two semen stains on the towel could be matched to the appellant's DNA. The appellant submitted that it was clear on the evidence that if the towel was washed between January 2010 and October 2011, semen deposited in late 2009 and early 2010 would not have been detected. In that context it must be remembered that the evidence of SB was to the effect that she and the appellant ceased to have a sexual relationship by March 2009.

123The appellant submitted that even if the jury rejected the evidence that the towel had been washed, there was strong temporal evidence that the towel could have been used when the appellant and SB were engaged in sexual intercourse using the withdrawal method of contraception.

124In these circumstances the appellant contended that the DNA evidence could not explain the inconsistencies in the jury's verdict.

125Counsel for the appellant submitted the case was one where the evidence clearly pointed to the fact that the jury had departed from their obligations (R v TK [2009] NSWCCA 151; (2009) 74 NSWLR 299 at [135]). He pointed in particular to the fact that the evidence on Counts 7 and 8 was patently false. He said that contrary to what was submitted by the Crown there could be little doubt the complainant in her third interview and in her statements to SB and JT, was referring to penile/vaginal sexual intercourse. He submitted these statements led to the conclusion that the complainant completely lacked veracity.

126Counsel for the appellant accepted there was no direct evidence contrary to that of the complainant as to how semen which matched the appellant's DNA ended up on the towel. However, he submitted a contrary inference could be drawn from the evidence of SB as to the manner she and the appellant had sexual intercourse on the lounge.

127The appellant submitted the other matters relied upon by the Crown in distinguishing Counts 4 and 5 from the other counts, namely the temporal link between the two counts, the fact that the complainant was able to identify with some precision when they occurred and that it was memorable to the complainant because it was the last occasion the appellant touched her rude part, did not assist because the difficulty of following in the first and second interviews when particular incidents occurred. He referred in particular to the fact that the complainant said the appellant only ""weed"" on her once, but described it in the first interview as the second time he touched her and in the second interview as the last time.

128The Crown pointed out there was no challenge to directions given to the jury, who were warned of the need to scrutinise the complainant's evidence with care, to consider each charge separately and the need for logical consistency between verdicts. The Crown also submitted there was no general rule that where several offences depend on the evidence of a single complainant, acquittal on some counts compels the conclusion that the jury regarded the complainant generally as an untruthful witness.

129The Crown submitted that there were four factors which distinguished Counts 4 and 5 from the other counts. First, the presence of the appellant's semen on the towel, second, that Count 4 immediately preceded Count 5, third, the ability of the complainant to identify with some precision the day the incidents occurred and, fourth, that they were memorable to her because it was the last occasion the appellant touched her ""rude spot"". The Crown pointed to the fact that the complainant said the incident happened the night before she had ""heaps of fun"", which was the night before she went into foster care and described it as the last occasion the appellant touched her ""rude spot"" and ""weed"" on her. The Crown submitted this evidence, given over the course of two interviews, supported the conclusion that the complainant had a reliable memory of this incident.

130The Crown accepted that the complainant's evidence was inconsistent in some respects and that she often said she did not remember things. It was pointed out that this was drawn to the jury's attention in closing and in the summing-up by the trial judge. It was also submitted that many occasions when the complainant said she did not remember, were in fact instances of her seeking to avoid being questioned.

131The Crown submitted that the failure to mention the towel in the first interview was not demonstrative of unreliability. It was pointed out that the questioning on Counts 4 and 5 commenced late in the first interview and was directed to fixing a timeframe for the offence, whilst in the second interview she was questioned directly as to what happened during the course of the interview. The Crown pointed out that the complainant referred to the towel the first time she was asked about what happened to the ""wee"".

132The Crown submitted that given the complainant's age it was not surprising that she was confused as to the date she told her mother about the incident.

133The Crown submitted that although the complainant wrongly said in her third interview that she was sleeping in a bunk bed when she was three years of age, her evidence on this question in the first and second interviews was not unreliable. The Crown pointed out that in the first interview she said she was shaken awake while she was in bed. She was asked where her bed ""is"" and her answer referring to a bunk bed was correct at the date of the interview. The Crown pointed to the fact that in the second interview she stated that she and her sister were in separate beds at the time of the incident.

134The Crown submitted that the complainant did not allege the appellant abused other children. It was submitted that the evidence relied on did not involve such an allegation. The relevant evidence was in the first and third interviews. In the first interview the following questions were asked and answers given:

""Q344 O.K. So has anything else like this happened with dad?A No, I think dad done it to a another girl or boy before me.

Q345 What makes you think that?A Because if he done it to, I think he done it to a other little girl or boy because he learnt how to do it to me.

Q346 Did dad tell you he done it to another girl or boy?A No.

Q347 Did anyone else tell you that maybe dad had done it to someone else?A [NO AUDIBLE REPLY]

Q348 Has anything like this happened before with somebody else?A I don't know.

Q349 What do you mean you don't know?A I just don't know if he done it to someone else.

Q350 No, No, what about with you, has anyone done something like this to you before?A No, just dad.""

Whilst in the third interview the questions and answers were as follows:

""Q316 OK. Has anything like this happened with you before with anyone else other than [CH] your real dad?A I'm not sure if ...

Q317 You're not sure?A I'm not sure if he's done it to other children.

Q318 No, no. Sorry. Has, has anyone else other than [CH] done anything like this to you?A No.""
(Names have been anonymised).

135The Crown submitted that the appellant overstated the complainant's evidence in asserting that she complained to her mother and JT of penile/vaginal intercourse.

136So far as the towel was concerned the Crown pointed to the fact that Mr Watherston stated that if the towel was stored in ideal conditions, the sperm could have been on it for years. The Crown also noted the comments of the trial judge in his remarks on sentence that the jury were entitled to reject the evidence of SB that she washed the towel regularly given the general state of the premises. The Crown also noted that SB denied it was used to clean up after she and the appellant had sexual intercourse in the lounge.

137The Crown pointed out that an acquittal did not necessarily mean the complainant's evidence was rejected but rather that on the counts on which they acquitted, the jury was unable to reach a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. It was submitted that the jury acting consistently must have convicted only on counts supported by evidence additional to the testimony of the complainant.

138Senior counsel for the Crown also pointed to the fact that the complainant was examined (in re-examination) on the texture of the product discharged on her, in the context where SB stated that she had never seen the complainant come into the room whilst she was having intercourse. She accepted that there were problems with the complainant's evidence submitting that this was the reason there was no conviction on the other counts.

139Senior counsel for the Crown also submitted that even if the jury concluded the third interview had been corrupted, they would be entitled to accept what the complainant said in the first two, having regard to the DNA evidence.

Ground 2

The parties' submissions

140Generally speaking the parties were content to rely on the factual submissions on Ground 1 when dealing with Ground 2. The Crown emphasised that the task of an appellant court is not to form its own assessment of the verdict it would reach. It submitted that the principle which informs the court are those set out in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [113].

141The Crown emphasised that the Court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt, or the consideration that the jury had the advantage of seeing or hearing the witnesses. In this context it pointed to the fact that the jury had the advantage of seeing and hearing the complainant under cross-examination and hearing the evidence of SB.

Consideration

142It is evident from the parties' submissions that the grounds of appeal overlap. That is hardly surprising for two reasons. First, s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) refers to unreasonable not inconsistent verdicts. Second, the appellant recognised that the DNA analysis of the towel which identified the appellant's semen on it may provide an explanation for the different verdicts but argued in effect that having regard to the other difficulties with the complainant's evidence, that could not provide a logical explanation for them. That is why counsel for the appellant ultimately accepted in argument that the real issue was whether the verdict was unreasonable. 

(a) The relevant principles

143In MacKenzie v The Queen supra at 366-368 the plurality stated that where factual inconsistency is said to arise by reason of different jury verdicts upon different counts of the originating process, the test is one of logic and reasonableness. Further, if there was a proper way by which the verdicts could be reconciled allowing it to be concluded that the jury performed its functions as required, that conclusion generally will be accepted. It is only where inconsistency rises to the point that intervention is necessarily required to prevent a possible injustice that the relevant conviction will be set aside (see also Still v R [2010] NSWCCA 131 at [60] and Dungay v R; R v Dungay [2010] NSWCCA 82 at [22]).

144Appellate courts should generally proceed on the assumption that juries follow the directions of the trial judge (Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [13] and HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 235 CLR 334 at [52] and [353]). As the plurality pointed out in MacKenzie v The Queen supra (at 367) the view may be taken in a criminal appeal that the jury simply followed the instruction to consider each count separately and to apply to each count the requirement that all elements must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 

145In R v Markuleski [2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [31] Spigelman CJ emphasised that it was not necessarily inappropriate for a jury to accept the evidence of a witness on one count whilst retaining a reasonable doubt about the commission of other events about which the same witness is the only substantive witness. He stated (at [76]) that there are often numerous explanations for seemingly inconsistent verdicts that do not necessarily derive from the jury doubting the complainant's credibility on all counts. Wood CJ at CL expressed the same view at [212], giving examples at [234]-[235] of circumstances which on the one hand would support an argument that the jury looked with disfavour upon the credibility of the complainant and on the other hand, that there were other possible basis for differentiation.

146In MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 the High Court approved (at [32]) the approach in R v Markuleski supra. In the course of their judgment Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Callinan JJ, dealt with the issue of different verdicts in the following terms (at [34]):

""Since the ultimate question concerns the reasonableness of the jury's decision, the significance of verdicts of not guilty on some counts in an indictment must necessarily be considered in the light of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, it must be considered in the context of the system within which juries function, and of their role in that system. A number of features of that context were emphasised in MacKenzie. They include the following. First, as in the present case, where an indictment contains multiple counts, the jury will ordinarily be directed to give separate consideration to each count. This will often be accompanied by a specific instruction that the evidence of a witness may be accepted in whole or in part. Secondly, emphasis will invariably be placed upon the onus of proof borne by the prosecution. In jurisdictions where unanimity is required, such as New South Wales, every juror must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every element in the offence. In the case of sexual offences, of which there may be no objective evidence, some, or all, of the members of a jury may require some supporting evidence before they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the word of a complainant. This may not be unreasonable. It does not necessarily involve a rejection of the complainant's evidence. A juror might consider it more probable than not that a complainant is telling the truth but require something additional before reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. The criminal trial procedure is designed to reinforce, in jurors, a sense of the seriousness of their task, and of the heavy burden of proof undertaken by the prosecution. A verdict of not guilty does not necessarily imply that a complainant has been disbelieved, or a want of confidence in the complainant. It may simply reflect a cautious approach to the discharge of a heavy responsibility. In addition to want of supporting evidence, other factors that might cause a jury to draw back from reaching a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt in relation to some aspects of a complainant's evidence might be that the complainant has shown some uncertainty as to matters of detail, or has been shown to have a faulty recollection of some matters, or has been shown otherwise to be more reliable about some parts of his or her evidence than about others. Thirdly, there is the consideration stated by King CJ in R v Kirkman, and referred to in later cases: it may appear to a jury, that, although a number of offences have been alleged, justice is met by convicting an accused of some only. And there may be an interaction between this consideration and the two matters earlier discussed.""
(Citations omitted). 

McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ adopted a similar approach at [85]-[86].

147The principles governing the question of whether a verdict should be set aside as unreasonable are well established. In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 at [11]-[13] the High Court stated that the approach to be adopted was that laid down by it in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-494. The Court is required to make its own independent assessment of the evidence and if after taking into account the primary responsibility of the jury in determining the question of guilt or innocence and the benefit of the jury of having seen and heard the witness the Court is left in doubt as to the reasonableness of the verdict, the doubt in most cases is a doubt that the jury should have experienced.

148It is not enough for a verdict to be unreasonable that a review of the evidence shows only that it was possible for the jury to have reached a different outcome. As was stated by Hayne J in Libke v The Queen supra at [113] for the verdict to be set aside as unreasonable the jury must have had, as distinct from might have had, a reasonable doubt (Gleeson CJ and Heydon J agreeing).

149However, it not sufficient for a verdict to be reasonable that there was evidence on which a jury could convict. So much is made clear from the passage from M v The Queen supra cited in SKA v The Queen supra at [13]. If after giving full weight to the primacy of the jury the court is left in reasonable doubt as to the verdict, it is only where the advantage of the jury in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving the doubt can a court conclude there was no miscarriage of justice (see also MFA v The Queen supra at [26] and [53]-[56]). 

150This Court in R v TK supra suggested (at [135] per Simpson J, Latham J agreeing at [204]) that where the unreasonableness is said to be based on the existence of inconsistent verdicts, the issue is not just whether the verdict was open on the whole of the evidence but whether it was open on the whole of the evidence, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances (including that the jury acquitted on one or some counts), whatever can be discerned as the explanation for the acquittals and whatever insight can be gained into the jury's thinking and reasoning.

(b) Disposition

151The Crown pointed to four factors which distinguished Counts 4 and 5 from the other counts (see par [129] above). The appellant contended that the DNA evidence on the towel was insufficient to explain the difference in the result and the other matters referred to by the Crown provided little assistance (see pars [126] and [127] above).

152In these circumstances the disposition of the appeal depends in my opinion on the answer to the following question. Taking into account the advantage of the jury, was it open to them to convict on Counts 4 and 5 on the evidence before them, having regard to the different features of the evidence on those counts, notwithstanding the fact they were unable to accept the complainant's evidence beyond reasonable doubt on the other counts? The question can only be answered by reviewing the whole of the evidence in the manner referred to by the High Court in M v The Queen supra. Such a review is to include but not be limited to the distinguishing features relied on by the Crown and always bearing in mind the doubts the jury must have had on the other counts.

153It is evident that there were very real difficulties with the complaints made by the complainant in the third interview. The incidents described in that interview, which were the subject of Counts 7 and 8, had not been referred to in the previous interviews which had taken place 14 months earlier. SB stated the appellant had never been to the Rosemeadow church that was within walking distance of her residence with her. Further the complainant's account of the manner that the appellant put his penis in her mouth was inherently improbable. Notwithstanding this the complainant persisted with this assertion in the evidence which she gave at the trial.

154The appellant also pointed to the evidence of what SB said she heard the complainant tell WB on 4 August 2011 (see par [74] above), the recording of the conversation between the complainant and her mother on the same day which became Exhibit 2 and the statements she was said to have made to JT on 14 September (see par [84] above). The appellant submitted that those statements involved allegations of penile/vaginal intercourse, something which during cross-examination the complainant denied had occurred.

155In considering these matters it is important to put them in context. The interview of 10 October 2012 took place some 14 months after the first interview. However, the complainant was still only seven years of age and it would be open to the jury to infer that by the time of the third interview her evidence had been corrupted, or at least there was a tendency to exaggerate. It must be remembered that in this context the complainant had already described herself as a ""very brave"" girl in complaining.

156It is also important to consider the context of the recording which became Exhibit 2. At the time the complainant was six years of age. The evidence of SB was that prior to the recording she heard the complainant saying to WB ""Daddy wiggled his thing inside me and weed on me"". By contrast WB said the complainant told him ""My daddy touched me in my private part"" (see pars [74] and [81] above respectively). The latter is consistent with what she said to JM on the same day (see par [94] above). Further the evidence of SB is inconsistent with the evidence of JM. JM said she spoke to the complaint on 4 August 2011 when a complaint was made, whereas SB does not suggest any complaint was made on that day on the telephone to JM, rather suggesting that the conversation with WB in which DH made a complaint took place after that telephone conversation later that night.

157In that context Exhibit 2, the voice recording, records the following conversation:

""Complainant: 'Hi'

SB: 'And what happened when you came down what ...[DH]'

Complainant: ...

SB: 'What did you say, tell mummy again please.'

Complainant: 'He touched me through the knickers and he started to ... the rude spot ... in mine ... at me and put his rude spot in my rude spot and he wiggled it.'

SB: 'And what happened then [DH]?'

Complainant: 'And then the next days after'

SB: 'Yes [DH], just hang on'

Complainant: 'He made me ... a ... and he weed on me ...'""
(Names have been anonymised).

158Thus, the only occasion on 4 August 2011 where there was anything that could be said to amount to direct evidence of an allegation of penile/vaginal intercourse was in the conversation with her mother, a conversation which at the very least contains some suggestions of prompting. The complaints were not repeated in the two interviews which subsequently took place in August of that year.

159It seems to me in these circumstances it would be open for the jury to accept the complaints made at the first two interviews and to WB and JM, irrespective of whether they had doubt as to whether the complaint made by the complainant to her mother was accurate. This needs to be considered in the context that the complaint denied in cross-examination that she told her mother that penile/vaginal intercourse occurred saying ""No I never told her cause it never happened"".

160I have referred to the evidence of JT (see pars [83]-[85] above). That conversation took place after the interview in which she made no suggestion of penile/vaginal intercourse. It would be open to the jury to reject the truth of this complaint, which was in fact denied by the complainant in cross-examination whilst accepting the complaints made at the interview. Once again there is some evidence of the influence of her mother (see par [85] above).

161I have also referred to the other difficulties with the complainant's evidence (see pars [107]-[112]). The statements of loss of memory are explicable by a desire to finish the interview or avoid questioning. It is also correct that the appellant gave inconsistent evidence as to the colour of the underwear she was wearing at the time of the incident. The fact that she gave inconsistent evidence between her first interview (and in cross-examination at trial) and her second interview, as to how often the appellant ""weed"" on her, does not alter the fact that the complainant said in both the first and second interviews that the appellant ""weed"" on her two nights before she first went into foster care. 

162I agree with the submission made by the Crown that the complainant did not state in the first or second interviews that at the time of the incidents the subject of Counts 4 and 5, she was sleeping in a bunk bed (see par [133]). Further, I agree that the evidence referred to in par [134] above does not amount to an allegation that the appellant had abused other children. That was apparent from her answer (""Because if he done it to, I think he done it to a other little girl or boy because he learnt how to do it to me""). Immediately thereafter she denied that the appellant told her he had done it to another girl or boy and she said that she did not know if he had.

163The description by the complainant of the product of the ejaculation as white in the first interview and white and slimy in the second interview and in re-examination at trial was consistent with the alleged event occurring. SB denied the complainant was in the lounge room whilst she and the appellant were naked, although she accepted it was possible the complainant saw them there after they had had sex. The complainant denied she saw her mother and the appellant nude or sleeping together in the lounge room.

164There remains the evidence of the DNA analysis of the semen on the towel. The appellant points to the fact that the complainant did not state that she was cleaned with the towel at the first interview. However, she was not asked and she volunteered the information at the second interview. SB stated that the towel was not used to clean up after she and the appellant had sexual intercourse and that she ceased to have sexual intercourse with the appellant in March 2009. In these circumstances the presence of the appellant's DNA on the towel is consistent with the complainant's evidence. Counsel for the appellant accepted there was no direct evidence to the contrary, although he submitted different inferences could be drawn. However, those inferences would involve the jury rejecting the evidence of SB on this point.

165Having regard to the inconsistencies and uncertainties in the complainant's evidence (although explicable in the case of a young child), the evidence so far as Counts 7 and 8 is concerned and the failure of the jury to convict on those counts and Counts 2 and 3 in the indictment (the other alternatives to Count 1), it would not have been open to the jury to convict on Counts 4 and 5 without any particular features in the evidence which distinguished those counts. However, the DNA analysis, the evidence surrounding it and the relative precision in which the complainant was able to identify when such incidents occurred, present such distinguishing features.

166The question which remains is whether the distinguishing features are sufficient to enable the jury to accept the evidence of the complainant on Counts 4 and 5 beyond reasonable doubt notwithstanding their failure to be so satisfied on the other counts. In my opinion having regard to the advantage which the jury had in seeing and hearing the complainant as well as in this case the other witnesses, coupled with the objective evidence of the DNA on the towel, it was open to the jury in the sense described in the authorities to come to the verdicts which they reached. In the present case the evidence of the complainant was vital. There is no reason to assume that the jury did not consider each count separately and study her evidence with care as they were directed to do. Having studied the evidence myself and taking into account the advantage possessed by the jury, I am not satisfied that the verdicts were unreasonable or inconsistent with the acquittals on the other counts in the sense of being an affront to logic and reasonableness.

167It follows that neither ground of appeal has been made out.

168There is one further matter. We were invited to view video recordings of the interviews of the complainant. It is an invitation I have declined for three reasons. First, the tapes were not in evidence. Second, an appeal is not a retrial but a review of the evidence on the papers in accordance with the principles to which I have referred above. To review the evidence by reference to tapes not in evidence would be to usurp the functions of the jury. Third, a review of the tapes would result in seeing only part of the complainant's evidence and none of the other evidence, a matter which could undermine any assessment. In SKA v The Queen supra the High Court held at [29]-[35] that Simpson J was not in error in declining a similar invitation in this Court.

Conclusion

169In the result the appeal should be dismissed.

170HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

171ADAMS J: I agree with the reasoning and conclusion of Bathurst CJ.

2704832,R v Loveridge [2014] NSWCCA 120,"Judgment

1THE COURT: The Crown appeals under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against sentences imposed upon the Respondent, Kieran Loveridge, on 8 November 2013. 

2The Notice of Appeal was signed by the Director of Public Prosecutions on 15 November 2013 and served upon the Respondent in custody on the same day. 

The Offences and Sentences

3The Respondent pleaded guilty to the following offences:

(a) Count 1 - manslaughter of Thomas Kelly at Potts Point on 9 July 2012, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment (ss.18(1)(b) and 24 Crimes Act 1900);

(b) Count 2 - assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Marco Compagnoni at Potts Point on 7 July 2012, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years (s.59(1) Crimes Act 1900);

(c) Count 3 - assault upon Matthew Serrao at Potts Point on 7 July 2012, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment (s.61 Crimes Act 1900);

(d) Count 4 - assault of Rhyse Saliba at Potts Point on 7 July 2012, an offence also punishable by two years' imprisonment (s.61 Crimes Act 1900); and

(e) Count 5 - assault of Aden Gazi at Potts Point on 7 July 2012, a further offence also punishable by two years' imprisonment (s.61 Crimes Act 1900).

4The sentencing Judge imposed the following terms of imprisonment:

(a) Count 3 - a fixed term of four months' imprisonment commencing on 18 September 2012 and expiring on 17 January 2013.

(b) Count 4 - a fixed term of four months' imprisonment commencing on 18 November 2012 and expiring on 17 March 2013.

(c) Count 5 - a fixed term of four months' imprisonment commencing on 18 March 2013 and expiring on 17 July 2013.

(d) Count 2 - a fixed term of six months' imprisonment commencing on 18 May 2013 and expiring on 17 November 2013.

(e) Count 1 - imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of four years commencing on 18 November 2013 and expiring on 17 November 2017, with a balance of term of two years commencing on 18 November 2017 and expiring on 17 November 2019.

5The fixed terms of imprisonment were set by his Honour upon the basis that they represented what otherwise would have been the non-parole periods for those offences.

6The total effective term of imprisonment involved a non-parole period of five years and two months commencing on 18 September 2012 and expiring on 17 November 2017, with a balance of term of two years commencing on 18 November 2017 and expiring on 17 November 2019. 
 
Grounds of Appeal

7The Crown relies upon the following grounds of appeal:

(a) Ground 1 - his Honour erred by failing to take into account the additional need for general deterrence due to the prevalence of alcohol-fuelled offences of violence.

(b) Ground 2 - his Honour erred by failing to take into account the need for specific deterrence of the Respondent.

(c) Ground 3 - his Honour erred by double counting subjective features when making a finding of special circumstances.

(d) Ground 4 - his Honour erred in failing to take into account material considerations in relation to intent and risk.

(e) Ground 5 - his Honour erred in classifying each offence as spontaneous.

(f) Ground 6 - his Honour failed to accumulate the sentences sufficiently.

(g) Ground 7 - the sentences, individually and in total, are manifestly inadequate.

Facts of Offences

8A Statement of Agreed Facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. In addition, a report of Mr Peter Champion, clinical psychologist, dated 22 August 2013 was tendered in the Respondent's case, together with a number of references. The Respondent did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing.

9The Respondent was born in March 1994. As at 7 July 2012, he was 18 years and four months old. He was living, at that time, with his family in Seven Hills.

A Saturday Night Out Begins - Purchase and Consumption of Alcohol

10At about 5.00 pm on Saturday, 7 July 2012, the Respondent and two companions purchased 24 cans of vodka drinks called ""Smirnoff Ice Double Black"", with each can containing 1.9 standard drinks (giving a total of 45.6 standard drinks contained in the carton).

11The three youths drove to the residence of one of them at Quakers Hill where each consumed one can. 

Journey by Road to the City - Further Consumption of Alcohol

12At about 6.30 pm, they were picked up by a fourth male and departed with the carton, then containing at least 18 cans. A fifth person joined them on this journey.

13The five young men then set off by car from Quakers Hill bound for the Star City Casino, arriving at about 7.30 pm. During the journey, the Respondent and three of his companions consumed most of the remaining cans from the carton. 

14Upon arrival, the five youths walked to the Cargo Bar at Darling Harbour. The male driver noticed that the Respondent was affected by alcohol at that time. As they were walking, the Respondent and one of his companions went up to people, shouting ""Raaaaa"" at them. 

15The Respondent and two of his companions were denied entry to the Cargo Bar, but were admitted to the Pontoon Bar at Darling Harbour, where they each had a vodka raspberry.
 
A Taxi Journey From Darling Harbour to Kings Cross

16Between about 8.45 pm and 9.00 pm, the Respondent and two of his companions travelled by taxi to Brougham Street, Kings Cross. They walked to the Dragon Lounge at 111 Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross. They left the Dragon Lounge and walked to The Club located at 33 Bayswater Road, Potts Point. The Respondent and one of his companions were refused entry to those premises because they were not on The Club's guest list.

Aggressive Conduct of the Respondent

17Between about 9.30 pm and 9.45 pm, the Respondent appeared agitated. A witness observed the Respondent's companion pushing him against a wall in an attempt to calm him down. 

18In another incident, two males saw the Respondent with another male as they were walking towards them between the Kings Cross Railway Station and the intersection of Victoria Street and Darlinghurst Road. The two males went to shake hands with the Respondent who ""appeared drunk"", but the Respondent said to them ""Who are youse?"" and grabbed their shirts. The Respondent let go of one of them, said ""Oh sorry"" and gave him a hug. 

Count 2 - Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm Upon Marco Compagnoni

19At about 10.00 pm, Marco Compagnoni was walking along Victoria Street with two companions in the direction of Darlinghurst Road. He observed three males (the Respondent and two companions) on Victoria Street who were being loud, fighting and pushing each other. As they approached the males, Mr Compagnoni walked behind his two companions. 

20However, suddenly, without warning and for no apparent reason, the Respondent elbowed Mr Compagnoni above his left eyebrow, lacerating his skin and drawing blood. 

21The Respondent and Mr Compagnoni were complete strangers.

22Mr Compagnoni kept walking, but shortly afterwards he realised that he was bleeding from above the eyebrow. He went to St Vincent's Hospital where the cut was cleaned. The cut did not require any stitches.

23The assault upon Mr Compagnoni took place very shortly before, and in the same area as, the attack on Thomas Kelly, who was recorded on CCTV footage walking along the same part of Victoria Street some 40 seconds after Mr Compagnoni. 

Count 1 - Manslaughter of Thomas Kelly

24At about 9.45 pm, Thomas Kelly (aged 18 years and six months) arrived at Kings Cross by taxi with two female companions. They were walking along Victoria Street at about 10.03 pm. They were planning to meet friends at the Trademark Hotel at 1 Bayswater Road, Kings Cross. 

25As they were walking, Mr Kelly was speaking to a friend on his mobile telephone saying, ""We are near the Coke sign"". 

26As Mr Kelly and his companions walked peacefully along the footpath, the Respondent was standing against the wall of the Mercure Hotel. The Respondent took two or three steps towards Mr Kelly and his companions. For no reason, and without notice, the Respondent punched Mr Kelly to the head whilst he was speaking on the telephone. The punch carried sufficient force to knock Mr Kelly to the ground, causing him to hit his head on the pavement. He was completely limp and did not move. A pool of blood started to form around his head. The impact of the pavement caused a severe fracture to Mr Kelly's skull and severe injuries to his brain, which proved fatal. 

27Mr Kelly and the Respondent were complete strangers.

28Mr Kelly's two companions described the Respondent's entirely unprovoked and gratuitous attack upon Mr Kelly. One saw the Respondent's ""forceful"" punch connect to the left side of Mr Kelly's face at about eye level, causing his whole body to turn around. She said that the punch ""looked like it required a lot of effort and because the effect it had on Thomas Kelly's body"". 

29The second companion saw the Respondent punch Mr Kelly around the nose area and he then fell ""directly backwards landing flat on his back"". In light of the medical evidence, the sentencing Judge was satisfied that Mr Kelly did fall directly backwards and land flat on his back. 

30The second companion also saw the Respondent look at Mr Kelly. The Respondent appeared to her to be ""angry and possibly intoxicated"". She watched as the Respondent turned around slowly and sprinted towards the intersection of Victoria Street and Darlinghurst Road. 

31The sentencing Judge found that the Respondent's act of running away ""betrayed his consciousness of guilt"": R v Loveridge [2013] NSWSC 1638 at [17].

32The Respondent admitted to Mr Champion that he had a vague memory of seeing blood on the ground and later seeing an ambulance.

33An ambulance arrived about six or seven minutes after Mr Kelly was struck. An ambulance officer observed that Mr Kelly was breathing, but did not respond to verbal or painful stimuli. His airway was occluded with blood and saliva. He had a strong regular pulse, but his pupils were fixed. His condition was assessed as ""severe and life threatening"". 
 
Fatal Injuries to Mr Kelly

34After the fixing of a spinal collar, Mr Kelly was placed on a stretcher and taken to St Vincent's Hospital, where he arrived at 10.33 pm. He was intubated and ventilated. There was blood from his right ear canal. He was deeply unconscious with fixed, dilated pupils and no movement in his limbs.

35A cranial scan indicated intracranial haemorrhaging and other features constituting a very severe head injury and high intracranial pressure and a fracture of the base of the skull on the right side. An urgent operation was undertaken, but the intracranial pressure rose following the operation. Mr Kelly remained in intensive care until 9 July 2012. However, given the catastrophic nature of his injury, the decision was taken, in conjunction with his family, to remove life support and he was pronounced deceased at 7.59 pm on 9 July 2012. 

36A post-mortem examination indicated that the cause of death was blunt force injury to the head caused by the impact on the pavement. The severe single blow from the pavement to the back of the right side of Mr Kelly's head fractured the base of his skull, and triggered the intracranial injuries which eventually caused brain death.

The Respondent's Further Aggressive Conduct Following the Attack on Mr Kelly

37After punching Mr Kelly to the head, the Respondent was seen by another witness running towards a food store on Darlinghurst Road and was also seen walking on the footpath on Bayswater Road. He was captured on CCTV footage walking around the Kings Cross area between 10.05 pm and 10.50 pm. 

38At about 10.15 pm, David Nofoaluma and Brendon Newton arrived at The Club on Bayswater Road (where the Respondent had earlier been refused entry). Mr Nofoaluma knew the Respondent through a mutual friend. He approached the Respondent saying ""Hi"" and went to shake hands with him. The Respondent then started swinging his right and left elbows at Mr Nofoaluma's head. The Respondent had his head down and kept swinging his elbows until Mr Nofoaluma pushed the Respondent to the chest, creating some distance between the two men. The Respondent looked up and said ""Oh Nofo"" and then hugged him and said ""Sorry"". 

39The Respondent then said ""I swear I'm going to bash someone tonight"". The sentencing Judge found that this statement supported a finding that ""by reason of his drunkenness, the offender was either unable or unwilling to control his aggressive urges"": R v Loveridge at [19].

Count 3 - Assault of Matthew Serrao

40At about 10.50 pm, Matthew Serrao was walking and talking with friends on Roslyn Street, heading towards Darlinghurst Road, when he was suddenly punched by the Respondent without reason or warning to the left side of his face.

41Mr Serrao and the Respondent were complete strangers.

42Mr Serrao stumbled backwards and immediately felt dizzy and experienced pain to his face. The area around his eye became swollen and bruised. 

43Mr Serrao approached the Respondent, remonstrating with him, ""Mate what the hell, why did you punch me, I don't even know you, are you going to say sorry?"". 

44The Respondent stepped to the side and swung another punch at Mr Serrao with a closed fist, but missed. The Respondent was pulled away by another man.

45Another witness observed the Respondent attempt to elbow Mr Serrao to the chest, before the Respondent ran off along Darlinghurst Road. 

46The sentencing Judge described this attack as being ""entirely unprovoked and the victim had been innocently walking along"" the street: R v Loveridge at [19].

47A witness said that the Respondent was visibly intoxicated ""because his pupils appeared dilated, he was speaking very quickly and he could not understand what he was saying"", with the Respondent also ""stumbling while walking"".

Count 4 - Assault of Rhyse Saliba

48About 10 minutes later, at about 11.00 pm, Rhyse Saliba was walking along Darlinghurst Road towards Roslyn Street when he bumped shoulders with the Respondent. 

49He apologised to the Respondent, however, the Respondent punched him to the left side of the face, connecting with Mr Saliba's cheek and top lip.

50Mr Saliba and the Respondent were complete strangers.

Count 5 - Assault of Aden Gazi

51The assault of Mr Saliba (Count 4) was witnessed by the next victim, Aden Gazi, who approached the Respondent and said to him ""What the hell was that for? Why hit Rhyse on his birthday?"". 

52The Respondent then swung at Mr Gazi in what was described in the Statement of Agreed Facts as a ""haymaker punch"", striking him on the right cheek.

53Mr Gazi and the Respondent were complete strangers.

54Mr Gazi remonstrated further with the Respondent and there then occurred what was described as a ""push and shove"" between two groups - the victims and their friends and the Respondent and his friends - which was broken up by two police officers on patrol in the area. 

55One of the officers, Constable Foot, observed the Respondent leap forward and throw a single punch into the other group. Constable Foot observed that the Respondent was moderately affected by alcohol and seemed agitated and emotional, at times waving his arms in a very animated manner and yelling at his friends and Mr Saliba and, at other times, embracing Mr Saliba.

56Notwithstanding that Constable Foot had told the two groups of males to separate and move on, both police officers then observed the Respondent pass Mr Saliba's group again and throw another punch towards their group. Constable Foot separated them again and told them to go their separate ways.

Comments by the Respondent Over the Following Days

57On 8 July 2012, the Respondent was watching television with a companion at Seven Hills when a story was broadcast concerning Mr Kelly being in hospital in a critical condition after being assaulted in Kings Cross the previous night. The Respondent appeared to his companion to be very worried. The Respondent said ""Was that one of my fights, I don't know?"". The Respondent made comments querying whether he fitted the description given on the television.

58On 12 July 2012, the Respondent spoke with a companion concerning the night of 7 July 2012, saying ""I don't remember what happened that night, it could have been me. I was drunk. I remember getting into a few fights that night. One was at Fake [Club] where police fined me. I am scared"". Later, the Respondent was asked by others whether he remembered doing anything and each time he replied that he did not remember. 

Arrest of Respondent on 18 July 2012

59At 7.20 pm on 18 July 2012, the Respondent was arrested in the grandstand at Belmore Sportsground. He was taken to Campsie Police Station where he exercised his right to remain silent.

60The Respondent was charged and remained in custody continuously after his arrest on 18 July 2012. 

The Respondent's Subjective Circumstances

61In addition to the report of Mr Champion, a number of documents were tendered in the Respondent's case on sentence, including a statement by his mother and a number of references. 

62The Respondent's criminal history included a number of appearances before the Children's Court. These included offences of taking and driving a conveyance and being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner, for which probation and a bond were granted in 2009 and 2010.

63The Respondent's criminal history included offences of violence. On 1 September 2009, he appeared before the Parramatta Children's Court on charges of assaulting an officer in the execution of duty and affray and, for each offence, he was ordered to undertake 12 months' probation under the supervision of the Department of Juvenile Justice. 

An Offence of Violence Resulting in Conditional Liberty in June 2012

64On 7 June 2012, a month before the present offences, the Respondent appeared again before the Parramatta Children's Court upon a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He was ordered to undertake probation for 18 months on condition that he be of good behaviour, accept the supervision and guidance of the Department of Juvenile Justice for as long as was deemed necessary and, in particular, that he attend all counselling as directed for the purpose of family counselling, grief, loss and anger management. 

65As a result of this order, the Respondent was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the present offences on 7 July 2012. 

66The facts of the offence giving rise to the Respondent's appearance before the Parramatta Children's Court on 7 June 2012 were before the sentencing Judge. It is appropriate to refer to them, in particular, given the conditional liberty allowed just one month before commission of the present offences.

67The Respondent was one of about 10-15 males who gatecrashed a large party organised by the victim at his parents' home at Blacktown on the evening of 28 January 2011. The Respondent and other males mixed with the invited guests. Most people at the party were consuming alcohol, including beer and mixer drinks. Fights broke out in the backyard and glass was thrown around. 

68The victim, who had not drunk any alcohol, asked the guests to leave at about 11.45 pm by walking around and making a general announcement saying ""Look everyone, can you please leave now, the police are on their way"". 

69At this point, the Respondent said to the victim ""Who the fuck do you think you are, a hero or something?"". The victim replied ""Calm down mate, what's your problem?"". The Respondent said ""What are you looking at?"". The Respondent then picked up two bottles from a bin that he had kicked over a short time before. 

70The victim was fearful that the Respondent was going to throw the bottles at him or damage the house. The victim then ran down the side of the house to the front area. The Respondent chased the victim on to the driveway adjacent to the house. The victim stopped running and turned to face the Respondent on the driveway. 

71The Respondent threw one of the bottles towards the victim but missed, with the bottle smashing on the fence behind the victim. The Respondent then threw the other bottle down on the driveway and ran towards the victim, punching him in the face with his fists. A melee ensued in which others joined in. During that time, the Respondent continued to punch the victim causing him pain and bruising to his face and eye. 

72Police arrived whilst this was happening and saw the Respondent punching the victim. The Respondent was pulled off the victim by two of his friends and began to walk away. At this point, a large number of people were in the front yard and driveway area of the house, some leaving the party and some fighting. The Respondent was arrested by the police as he attempted to leave the premises. Police released the Respondent a short time after. 

73After the victim had identified the Respondent as the person responsible for punching him, police arrested the Respondent at a nearby McDonalds at about 12.30 am on Saturday, 29 January 2011.

74The Respondent participated in an electronically recorded interview in company with his mother and made full admissions to the police. On the following day, the Respondent wrote an apology message to the victim on his Facebook page. 

75The Statement of Facts presented to the Parramatta Children's Court on 7 June 2012 noted that the Respondent had shown remorse for his actions on the night in question and, at all times, maintained full and frank admissions to punching the victim with his fists.

76On 11 October 2013, the Respondent was called up in the Parramatta Children's Court for breach of the probation order made on 7 June 2012. He was sentenced to a control order for two months commencing on 18 July 2012 and concluding on 17 September 2012.

Mr Champion's Psychological Report

77Mr Champion's report dated 28 August 2013 contained the Respondent's personal history. The Respondent is of Aboriginal descent and his parents had separated when he was a young age. He felt alienated from his father and felt disconcerted when his mother commenced a relationship with another man. He laid the blame for his parents' dysfunctional relationship at the feet of his father, and also said that he had been subjected to corporal punishment by both parents, and particularly by his father.

78The Respondent had displayed rebellious behaviour at school and had attended various schools. His high school education had been dislocated, partly due to expulsion for his involvement in juvenile criminal activities. The Respondent had some skill as a rugby league player. By late 2011, he was playing rugby league at a promising level. He reported attending school and undertaking a traineeship at the time of the present offences.

79Psychological testing showed that the Respondent's intelligence was in the lower half of the average range and he was literate to an adequate degree. There was no indication that the Respondent was suffering from an intellectual disability or a global limitation in intelligence. Justice Health records (which were available to Mr Champion) did not make any particular reference to any psychological or psychiatric issues. 

80Mr Champion concluded that the Respondent's ""judgment through adolescence appears to have been fairly regularly flawed given the history of offending and non-compliance and sub-cultural associations; though I balance against this the reported educational and employment history; and in the end would not tend to see him being unusually immature for his age"". Mr Champion described the Respondent as a ""not very thoughtful young man"". 

81The Respondent explained to Mr Champion that the manslaughter was an ""accident"", in that he had not intended to kill Mr Kelly. He could not account at all for two of the other offences and the remaining two assaults he described as ""personal stupidity"".

82In relation to his earlier experience of drinking alcohol, the Respondent reported that he had not drunk alcohol prior to the age of 17 years because of his involvement with rugby league. He admitted, however, to drinking some alcohol on the night of the Blacktown offence on 28 January 2011 (when aged 16 years and 10 months), but denied being intoxicated on that occasion. The Respondent explained that offence to Mr Champion upon the basis that the host of the party was ""after his girlfriend and mocking him"".

83The Respondent indicated to Mr Champion that he was not generally a big drinker and that, since turning 18 years old, he had consumed alcohol on a small number of occasions in bars and clubs, but not to an excessive level. He also admitted to consuming what he thought was ecstasy on three occasions at about the time he turned 18 years old.

84Mr Champion concluded that the Respondent had demonstrated some insight into the offending behaviour and the impact of it on others (particularly Thomas Kelly and his family) and could articulate remorse primarily directed towards the victims.

85In terms of his prospects of rehabilitation, Mr Champion was guarded. He said that this was contingent on the Respondent's ability to see through his sentence without his attitudes and values becoming too distorted, noting the potential for deterioration in his mental health if, for example, his mother or sister suffered from ill health whilst he was in custody or if any other issue arose whilst he was in custody. He also noted that the Respondent's presentation suggested that he was still in the process of maturation and ""his personality was not fixed"".

86Mr Champion addressed the Respondent's alcohol and aggression issues in the following way:

""[21] In terms of the question of AOD treatment/rehabilitation, assuming the accuracy of his report there does not appear to be a chronic or identifiably regular pattern of AOD abuse present, as opposed to episodic misuse; though extreme intoxication, as is suggested at the time of the present offences appears to have brought with it a significant level of anger and aggression; and hence there is a need to address both the alcohol issue and the aggression issue.""

87The Crown observed in this Court that it did not appear to have been brought to Mr Champion's attention that, when the Respondent was in custody on the present matters, he committed an assault on 25 April 2013 at the Cessnock Correctional Centre for which he was confined to cells for three days. The Crown noted that Mr Champion did not appear to have factored this custodial incident into his assessment of the Respondent's risk of violence, this being relevant to an assessment of an offender's prospects of rehabilitation: R v Fahda [2013] NSWCCA 86 at [100].

88An email dated 24 October 2013 from Ms Donna Shepherd, alcohol and other drug counsellor at Long Bay Correctional Centre, stated that the Respondent had commenced the Getting Smart program at his own request, and had been referred for assessment for a violent offender's program.

Victim Impact Statements Before the Sentencing Court

89Victim impact statements were made to the sentencing court by members of the family of Thomas Kelly and a number of his close friends. Family members included Mr Kelly's mother, father, sister, grandfather and grandmother. 

90These statements reflect the profound grief experienced by members of Mr Kelly's family as a result of his sudden and unexpected death at an early age following from the Respondent's criminal conduct. It is entirely apparent that the consequences of the loss of Mr Kelly, in these tragic circumstances, will be not just long lasting but permanent.

Grounds of Appeal

91The grounds of appeal advanced by the Crown contend that the sentencing Judge fell into patent error in a number of respects in the sentencing process concerning the Respondent. In the course of considering these grounds of appeal, reference will be made to a number of specific findings of the sentencing Judge, which are under challenge on this appeal.

92The Crown's final ground of appeal contends that the individual and total sentences imposed upon the Respondent were manifestly inadequate. The Crown submitted that the asserted patent errors contained in earlier grounds served to explain how manifestly inadequate sentences came to be imposed. However, even if earlier grounds of appeal were not made out, the Crown submitted that latent error was demonstrated in the form of manifestly inadequate sentences.

93It is appropriate to consider each ground of appeal in turn.

Ground 1 - His Honour Erred by Failing to Take Into Account the Additional Need for General Deterrence Due to the Prevalence of Alcohol-Fuelled Offences of Violence

Submissions of the Crown

94The Crown noted the finding of the sentencing Judge that the Respondent's offending constituted an episode of ""alcohol-fuelled violence"" (R v Loveridge at [3]) and ""that these were drunken assaults in public brings into play the considerations of protection of society, the need for denunciation, retribution and general deterrence"" (at [59]). 

95The Crown submitted, however, that his Honour did not refer to the prevalence of alcohol-fuelled violence and did not cite authorities to which his attention had been drawn by the Crown, in particular the decisions of this Court in Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 and R v Carroll [2010] NSWCCA 55; 77 NSWLR 45.

96The Crown submitted that the principles emerging from these decisions, and also Pattalis v R [2013] NSWCCA 171, required application of these principles in the sentencing outcome, something which the Crown submitted had not occurred in this case. 

The Respondent's Submissions

97Mr Boulten SC, for the Respondent, acknowledged that general deterrence and retribution are elements that must assume greater importance when the contemporary relevance of a particular crime is the cause of community disquiet. In this case, he accepted that the existence of wide-spread community concern about alcohol-related violence in Kings Cross is irrefutable. 

98Mr Boulten SC submitted that the sentencing Judge had regard to the relevant principles on sentence for alcohol-fuelled violent crimes, including the need for denunciation, retribution and general deterrence. He submitted that this ground of appeal argued essentially that the sentencing Judge had given insufficient weight to general deterrence. 

99It was submitted that the authority of this Court to substitute a sentence for that imposed at first instance was not enlivened by its view that it would have given greater weight to deterrence, and less weight to the offender's subjective case: Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALJR 1022 at 1028-1029 [24]. It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had had regard to the relevant principles emerging from cases such as Hopley v R and R v Carroll, and that no error had been demonstrated in the manner complained of in this ground of appeal.

Decision

100The decisions of this Court in Hopley v R and R v Carroll were both important and highly relevant to the sentencing of the Respondent. Although relied upon by the Crown, the decisions were not mentioned in his Honour's sentencing remarks.

101In R v Carroll, with the concurrence of Spigelman CJ and Kirby and Howie JJ, Allsop P and Johnson J said at 59 [60]-[61]:

""60 This Court observed in Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 at [46] that, regrettably, 'single-blow manslaughter cases (by unlawful and dangerous act) are not rare in this State.' It was said in Hopley v R at [47]: 

'As the learned sentencing judge correctly observed (by reference to R v Grenenger), this case is a further example of the disastrous consequences which can flow from a public affray in a place of lawful public resort. The violence of the Applicant was perpetrated in a public street where persons were present and where it constitutes a particular affront to civil peace to have a man killed in this way: R v Inzitari (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 28 March 1985). It was necessary for the Applicant to be punished for his crime and for an element of general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence.'

61 The sentencing decision with respect to the present offender required the element of general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence. Although the learned sentencing judge referred to general deterrence, we are satisfied that the sentence actually imposed at first instance in this case made no proper allowance for this significant sentencing principle. Mr Carroll was 20 years old, a young adult, at the time of the offence. The principles which apply directly to the sentencing of juvenile offenders, and the approach to general deterrence and rehabilitation, were not applicable to his case. Of course, his relative youth and his prospects of rehabilitation remained significant factors on sentence. However, alcohol-fuelled offences of violence of this type are frequently committed by young men of his age, and general deterrence has particular application for this reason.""

102In the context of a case of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, in which the drunken offender punched the victim in the face without warning or reason when the victim was standing outside a city nightclub in 2010, Hoeben CJ at CL (McCallum and Schmidt JJ agreeing) said in Pattalis v R at [23]:

""Over recent years, the incidence of such offences, particularly when associated with the excessive consumption of alcohol, have been all too frequent. Such offences are a cause for grave disquiet and the community is understandably angry and frustrated at their occurrence. Regrettably, it is now notorious (as his Honour recognised) that a single punch can not only cause catastrophic injuries but also death. For offences of this kind, the community has the rightful expectation that judicial officers will impose meaningful penalties.""

103Other decisions of this Court have emphasised that violence on the streets, especially by young men in company and under the influence of alcohol and drugs, is all too common and needs to be addressed by sentences that carry a very significant degree of general deterrence: R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at 101 [29]. Even in the case of juvenile offenders (which the Respondent is not), this Court has emphasised that, in relation to crimes of violence committed in the streets by groups of young persons, general deterrence should be given substantial weight notwithstanding the youth of the offenders: AI v R [2011] NSWCCA 95 at [69]; MB v R [2013] NSWCCA 254 at [27].

104This Court has emphasised that the principles of general deterrence and denunciation of crimes serve as a means of protection of the public: R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [92]. 

105The use of lethal force against a vulnerable, unsuspecting and innocent victim on a public street in the course of alcohol-fuelled aggression accompanied, as it was, by other non-fatal attacks by the Respondent upon vulnerable, unsuspecting and innocent citizens in the crowded streets of King Cross on a Saturday evening, called for the express and demonstrable application of the element of general deterrence as a powerful factor on sentence in this case.

106It is the case that the sentencing Judge referred to general deterrence as being a matter to be taken into account on sentence. However, two observations should be made. 

107Firstly, submissions had been made by the Crown by reference to decisions of this Court which emphasised the need for substantial weight to be given to general deterrence in passing sentence for offences involving alcohol-fuelled violence in public places and, in this context, where the offence of manslaughter was committed. The absence of any reference in the remarks on sentence to the decisions of this Court in Hopley v R and R v Carroll is noteworthy. 

108Secondly, this was a case where it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to emphasise the substantial role of general deterrence on sentence, and then to give effect to that important sentencing principle in the sentences actually imposed.

109We are satisfied that the same error has been demonstrated here as occurred in R v Carroll at 59 [61] (see [101] above). A passing reference to general deterrence did not meet the requirements of sentencing principles in this case. Nor did the sentences actually imposed reflect that general deterrence had been taken into account in accordance with the law.

110We are satisfied that the first ground of appeal has been made out. The consequences of this finding will be addressed later in this judgment.

Ground 2 - His Honour Erred by Failing to Take Into Account the Need for Specific Deterrence of the Respondent

Submissions of the Crown

111The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge made no reference at all to the need for specific deterrence to be taken into account in sentencing the Respondent.

112It was submitted that the Respondent's aggression issue, considered by Mr Champion (see [86] above), raised a clear need for specific deterrence in this case. Further, the Crown submitted that the Respondent had a prior criminal history including offences of violence, as to which he was subject to conditional liberty at the time of these offences. 

113The Crown pointed to findings of the sentencing Judge that the Respondent had aggressive urges that he was unable or unwilling to control on 7 July 2012 (R v Loveridge at [12], [19]). It was submitted that the present offences were not an uncharacteristic aberration in light of the Respondent's criminal history. The Crown referred to Bugmy v The Queen at 1032 [44] where the majority observed that the inability of an offender ""to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender"", applying the words in s.3A(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

114The Crown pointed, as well, to a level of tension between the finding of the sentencing Judge that the Respondent ""is very unlikely to re-offend"" because ""he has well and truly learnt his lesson"", and the qualification which followed immediately - ""however, he will need to muster his fortitude and resolve to maintain that determination"" during his term of imprisonment: R v Loveridge at [68].

115It was submitted that the need for specific deterrence to be taken into account on sentence was clear in this case, and that his Honour had erred in failing to take it into account. 

Submissions of the Respondent

116It was submitted for the Respondent that the Crown at first instance had not referred expressly to the need for specific deterrence to be taken into account on sentence. In any case, it was submitted that his Honour had adverted, in general terms, to specific deterrence as one of the various factors to be taken into account (R v Loveridge at [58]) and that his Honour took into account the Respondent's prior criminal history, which demonstrated a pattern of disregard for the law which elevated the seriousness of the individual instances of offending (at [59]). In this way, it was submitted that regard had been had to specific deterrence.

117It was submitted for the Respondent that his youth and his continuing exposure to a family background marked by violence, dysfunction and dislocation required the Court to give greater consideration to rehabilitation and less to specific and general deterrence: Bugmy v The Queen at 1032 [44].

118Mr Boulten SC submitted that the sentencing Judge's findings that the Respondent was very unlikely to reoffend, and had good prospects of rehabilitation, militated against any further weight being attached to specific deterrence in this case. 

119In any event, as with the first ground of appeal, it was submitted that the Crown's complaint here concerned the weight to be given to specific deterrence with this being a matter which ought not attract the attention of this Court.
 
Decision

120The Respondent in this case was not a first offender. Despite his relative youth, he had prior offences of violence. He was subject to conditional liberty for an alcohol-fuelled offence of violence, with that sentence having been passed by a court just one month prior to 7 July 2012. 

121It may be inferred readily that the Respondent's stated remorse and contrition (see [75] above) was taken into account, in a significant respect, in the imposition of a non-custodial sentence on 7 June 2012 for a significant offence of violence committed by him. The context of that offence was, of course, entirely antisocial, involving as it did, gatecrashing of a party by the Respondent and others with the Respondent initiating violent conduct thereafter on the private property of the victim. 

122Yet one month later, the Respondent embarked upon a course of conduct which saw himself and a number of his companions consuming a very significant amount of alcohol, before attending Darling Harbour and then Kings Cross. Both the Respondent's acts and his words indicated an expectation on his part that trouble would result. Far from exercising restraint in accordance with the terms of his conditional liberty, and utilising such assistance and support in the community as was available as a condition of his probation, the Respondent embarked upon a course of violent conduct which culminated in the death of a young man and the assaulting of others selected randomly in a public street.

123The recital of these considerations points to a very significant need for specific deterrence in this case. The Respondent's youth was clearly relevant on sentence. An assessment of the likelihood of him reoffending, and his prospects of rehabilitation, involved an evidence-based decision made against the background of the Respondent's grave breach of conditional liberty granted just one month before the commission of these offences.

124The Respondent did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. In these circumstances, this Court has emphasised that a sentencing Judge ought give very limited weight to statements made by an offender to a psychiatrist or psychologist reproduced in reports: R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 [58]-[59], 380 [79]; R v Palu [2002] NSWCCA 381; 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185 [39]-[41]. 

125Although the Respondent had expressed remorse to Mr Champion, there was no direct evidence from the Respondent to this effect before the sentencing Judge. A guarded approach to expressions of remorse in these circumstances is warranted: s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This is particularly so when expressions of remorse were made just one month before these offences to the Children's Court, which proceeded to sentence by way of a probation order for an offence of violence. This was an objective feature of the case which emphasised the need for specific deterrence to be factored into the sentencing exercise, and for additional caution to be exercised before acting upon an unsworn and untested claim of remorse. It should not be overlooked, as well, that the Respondent described the death of Mr Kelly as being an ""accident"" (see [81] above) and continued to demonstrate an attitude of self-justification towards the gatecrashing offence (see [82] above).

126A fair reading of Mr Champion's balanced and objective report indicated that a guarded approach ought be taken in assessing the Respondent's risk of reoffending and prospects of rehabilitation, given what were described as the Respondent's unresolved alcohol and aggression issues. 

127With respect, no foundation existed for a finding that it was very unlikely that the Respondent would reoffend. 

128In all of these circumstances, the proper exercise of sentencing discretion required substantial weight to be given to specific deterrence in this case. 

129It is difficult to see, in the approach of the sentencing Judge, any real allowance for specific deterrence in circumstances where flawed findings were made, favourable to the Respondent, by reference to his risk of reoffending and prospects of rehabilitation. 

130We are satisfied that the complaint by the Crown under this ground goes beyond a matter of weight. Error has been demonstrated in this regard in accordance with the principles in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. 

131We uphold the second ground of appeal.

Ground 3 - His Honour Erred by Double Counting Subjective Features When Making a Finding of Special Circumstances

Submissions of the Crown

132The Crown submitted that the sentencing Judge had regard to the Respondent's remorse and his prospects of rehabilitation, together with his youth, in fixing the individual sentences (R v Loveridge at [64], [66], [68]), but proceeded then to double count these factors in making a finding of special circumstances for the purposes of s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (at [70]). 

133The Crown submitted that this was a clear error of double counting. 

The Respondent's Submissions

134Mr Boulten SC noted that the prosecutor at first instance accepted that there were special circumstances for the purpose of sentence. Further, it was submitted that after partial accumulation, only a minor amelioration of the statutory ratio was made in favour of the Respondent with the non-parole period constituting 72% of the head sentence. 

135The Respondent submitted that factors may be taken into account differently in having regard to the various purposes of sentencing, so that error had not been demonstrated in this case which, in any event, involved a modest adjustment only. 

Decision

136This Court has emphasised that double counting for matters already taken into account in reducing the head sentence, and therefore already reflected in the non-parole period, must be avoided: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]. This is not to say that factors considered for the purpose of setting the full term of imprisonment must be entirely disregarded when the time comes to set the non-parole period, there being some prospect of overlap upon a proper basis: R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [102]. 

137A finding of special circumstances is a statutory precondition to departure from the 75% ratio and the reduction of the non-parole period must be purposeful. The purpose must be something other than to simply relieve the offender of the burden of serving a minimum sentence as required by s.44: R v GWM at [114].

138The sentencing Judge did not acknowledge the need to guard against impermissible double counting in this case. The impression was left that the factors taken into account in fixing individual sentences were taken into account again, without qualification, in making a finding of special circumstances. 

139That said, the variation in the ratio between the total effective non-parole period and the total effective head sentence is a minor one only, reducing the proportion from 75% to 72%. In these circumstances, we are not persuaded that patent error is demonstrated as contended for in this ground of appeal. 

140However, if the Court moves to resentence the Respondent, it will be necessary to take into account the appropriate principles in calculating individual sentences, and in addressing the issue of special circumstances.

Ground 4 - His Honour Erred in Failing to Take Into Account Material Considerations in Relation to Intent and Risk

Submissions of the Crown

141The Crown submitted that the Respondent hit the first victim, Mr Compagnoni (Count 2), with such force to the face as to cause a cut and then struck Mr Kelly (Count 1) with considerable force to the face, causing him to fall to the ground and strike his head. Soon after, the Respondent commented ""I swear I am going to bash someone tonight"". The Crown submitted that a finding ought to have been made, at first instance, that the Respondent intended to harm or injure, and that he carried that intention into the following three assaults as well.

142Although intention to injure or harm was not an element for the offence of manslaughter, the Crown submitted that a finding to that effect ought to have been made with respect to the various offences committed by the Respondent on this night, having regard to all the evidence. Had this finding been made, the Crown submitted that it bore upon an assessment of the seriousness of each of the offences and the Respondent's moral culpability. 

143The Crown submitted that his Honour erred by not finding that the assaults in Counts 3, 4 and 5 were of a higher level of seriousness, and warranted longer sentences, because he did not take into account that they came after the Respondent had punched Mr Kelly, looked at him and then sprinted away, acts which the sentencing Judge found to reflect consciousness of guilt. Thereafter, the Respondent engaged in similar violent behaviour in assaulting three more men to the head, thereby demonstrating a higher degree of callousness in continuing the conduct.

144Whilst acknowledging the discretionary nature of a sentencing Judge's findings concerning the seriousness of an offence, the Crown submitted that it was not open on the facts to treat the last three assaults in Counts 3, 4 and 5 as being effectively of the same seriousness as Count 2. 

The Respondent's Submissions

145Mr Boulten SC submitted that the factors relied upon by the Crown point to deliberateness, but cannot be elevated to the height of evidence of an intention to injure. The deliberateness of the Respondent's actions was a necessary component of his plea and was not in dispute.

146It was submitted that the Respondent's flight after punching Mr Kelly did not necessarily evidence any greater appreciation of risk of injury. The Respondent had not remained on the scene for very long, he was affected by alcohol, with his comments made the next day reflecting limited awareness of the harm he had caused until he saw the news report.

147It was submitted that the Respondent's comment ""I swear I'm going to bash someone"" was addressed not necessarily to outcomes, but to actions.

148It was submitted for the Respondent that no error had been made in the manner contended for by the Crown in this ground of appeal. 

Decision

149In approaching this ground of appeal, it is necessary to bear in mind that the Respondent did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Fact finding for the purpose of sentence was to be undertaken by reference to the Agreed Statement of Facts and inferences to be drawn from those facts, together with the report of Mr Champion, after making due allowance for its unsworn and hearsay source of the Respondent's account. 

150The Respondent struck a powerful blow to Mr Compagnoni, and soon after struck an even more powerful blow to Mr Kelly, causing him to fall to the ground. 

151The Respondent comprehended the force of the blow to Mr Kelly, in observing him lying prone on the ground with the Respondent then running away down the street. The finding of consciousness of guilt made by the sentencing Judge was well open, and reflected an awareness on the part of the Respondent, even in his intoxicated state, that the powerful blow he had struck to Mr Kelly had caused him to fall to the ground and remain there. 

152The statement of the Respondent made soon after concerning his desire ""to bash someone"" was to be viewed cumulatively upon his actions in striking two men and then running away. Thereafter, the Respondent assaulted three more randomly selected victims in the street, in circumstances where a finding was more than appropriate that he intended, to some extent, to injure or harm each of them. The Respondent was acting upon his stated intention ""to bash someone"", against the background of already having ""bashed"" two other persons for no good reason.

153It may be taken that the Respondent experienced a degree of clouded consciousness as a result of his alcohol intake. However, he was able to move about the street (including running away after striking Mr Kelly) and strike blows to persons in a random fashion.

154The appropriate factual findings to be made, in the context of this case, called for an assessment of the ongoing cumulative acts and words of the Respondent as he proceeded with his violent course of conduct.

155In our view, these matters do bear upon, and magnify, the objective seriousness of (at least) the attack upon Mr Kelly (Count 1) and the three assaults (Counts 3, 4 and 5) which followed thereafter. 

156The objective seriousness and moral culpability to be attached to these offences grew incrementally as the Respondent moved from one act of intentional and random violence to another on the streets of Kings Cross that night. 

157We uphold this ground of appeal which, in any event, will inform a determination of the final ground of appeal, and the sentences to be passed if the Court moves to resentence the Respondent.

Ground 5 - His Honour Erred in Classifying Each Offence as Spontaneous

Submissions of the Crown

158The Crown contended that the sentencing Judge erred in classifying each offence as spontaneous, in the manner set out hereunder (R v Loveridge at [62]):

""It needs to be borne in mind, in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, that the attacks were on the whole spontaneous, in the sense of being unpremeditated, even if because of his drunkenness the offender was unable to control his aggression. That he may have in his drunken state decided to give vent to it does not detract significantly from this consideration.""

159Whilst accepting that the first offence in time may have had a component of spontaneity, the Crown submitted that this did not extend to the subsequent offending. Each victim was chosen somewhat at random and each was attacked to the face or head region. Given the Respondent's expressed state of mind on the night, which informs the earlier assaults as well as the subsequent ones, the Crown submitted that it was evident that the Respondent was intoxicated and unable or unwilling to control his aggression. For a period of close to an hour, he continued to exhibit aggression towards a number of persons in addition to those reflected in the charges. The Crown submitted that the evidence clearly confirmed that the Respondent was out of control for a period of time, attacking persons for no apparent reasons as part of his express desire to assault.

160The sentencing Judge referred to the Respondent's inability to control his aggression, and observed that succumbing and giving vent to this aggression did not detract significantly from the conclusion of spontaneity (at [62]). The Crown submitted that this analysis failed to have regard to the offences being committed in close temporal proximity, and each being part of an ongoing course of conduct.

161The Crown pointed to the fact that his Honour had earlier accepted that the offending was part of a pattern of behaviour (at [59]). It was submitted this earlier recognition of the nature of the offending did not extend to his Honour's consideration of spontaneity. 

162It was submitted that this classification was inconsistent with the evidence and served to diminish the gravity of the offences, certainly those committed after the first offence. 

The Respondent's Submissions

163Mr Boulten SC submitted that there was no special or extra meaning intended to attach to the word ""spontaneous"" over and above his Honour's explanation (at [158] above). It was submitted that his Honour was correct to describe the events as ""on the whole spontaneous"". The Respondent was very drunk and acting in ways which suggested that he was acting randomly and without a formulated plan. 

164Reference was made to his Honour's description of the events as ""incidents of drunken violence in a public place ... carried out randomly on unsuspecting strangers by an intoxicated young offender"" (at [3]) as demonstrating that the sentencing Judge did not undervalue the objective seriousness of the Respondent's conduct. 

165Though the behaviour in each of the offences was similar and occurred close in time, it was submitted that there were separate victims and separate outcomes and that, contrary to the Crown's submission, his Honour actually concluded (at [59]) that this served to increase the assessment of the objective criminality of each offence.

166It was submitted for the Respondent that, if anything, rather than aggravating the objective seriousness of the individual offences, the fact that five such similar results occurred in a single drunken evening, so close in time, operated so as to disentitle the Respondent to extra leniency and to give greater emphasis for the need for specific and general deterrence.

Decision

167It is understandable that the term ""spontaneous"" may be used to characterise the first offence committed against Mr Compagnoni. However, it is difficult to see how the term has correct application to any or all of the separate attacks which followed the first offence.

168The conduct of the Respondent may be characterised fairly as the repeated and random selection of victims whom he attacked to the head in a public street for no reason. It might be said, in one sense, that each explosive act of violence came ""out of the blue"" with respect to each unsuspecting victim. However, this does not permit the comfortable characterisation of the attacks as being ""on the whole spontaneous"". The use of the term tends to downgrade the criminality reflected in the accumulating series of attacks which the Respondent was making against different victims, over the period of about an hour, at different points in the streets of Kings Cross.

169We are satisfied that his Honour's characterisation of the offences in this way operated to reduce the true degree of their seriousness, in such a way as to impact upon the objective gravity of the second and subsequent offences committed by the Respondent.

170We uphold this ground of appeal which, in any event, will require appropriate assessment if the Court reaches the point of resentencing the Respondent.

Ground 6 - His Honour Failed to Accumulate the Sentences Sufficiently 

Submissions of the Crown

171The Crown submitted that each of the individual sentences was manifestly inadequate, and that the extent of the partial accumulation of sentences then exacerbated the manifest inadequacy of the total sentence.

172Although some partial accumulation was open in the exercise of the discretion in accordance with the principle of totality, the Crown submitted that where there are multiple victims, there is a special need to consider the separate criminality involved for each offence. 

173The Crown submitted that the Respondent had adequate opportunity to reflect upon his conduct and to desist, yet he continued to attack strangers for no reason and without notice. Each act was cowardly and part of a course of conduct that required an appropriate and meaningful overall sentence. 

The Respondent's Submissions

174Mr Boulten SC submitted that the sentencing Judge correctly stated the relevant principles to be applied in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610. It was submitted that his Honour's decision to structure the sentences, using partial accumulation, was a correct exercise of discretion open to the sentencing Judge. 

175The Respondent submitted that the Crown had not demonstrated that the sentencing Judge's discretion had miscarried in his approach to accumulation. Further, it was submitted that his Honour's reference to the avoidance of a ""crushing"" sentence indicated that regard had been given to the principle of totality, so as to preserve encouragement for rehabilitation and reform. 

Decision

176The sentencing Judge did accumulate the sentence on the manslaughter count entirely upon the sentences for the other offences. A measure of accumulation was applied with respect to the other sentences as well.

177It may be said that the sentencing Judge applied the relevant principles in approaching the accumulation of sentences in this case. However, the real difficulty relates to the length of the sentences themselves, and the corresponding relative brevity of the periods of accumulation. These features will be addressed directly in the context of Ground 7, the claim of manifest inadequacy.

178We do not uphold this ground of appeal.

Ground 7 - The Sentences, Individually and in Total, are Manifestly Inadequate

Submissions of the Crown

179The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed in this case were unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had imposed sentences that were below those that could be justly imposed for the offences, consistent with sentencing standards: Bugmy v The Queen at 1028 [24].

180The Crown pointed to a series of factors in support of a submission that, individually and in total, the sentences failed to punish the Respondent adequately for very serious and highly morally blameworthy conduct. The Crown submitted:

(a) the offences were committed in public places as part of repeat offending, whilst on conditional liberty imposed only one month before for a similar offence;

(b) the offences were wanton, unprovoked and committed against unsuspecting victims who were complete strangers to the Respondent;

(c) there was no explanation for the Respondent's behaviour;

(d) the offences were part of a course of conduct involving multiple assaults and therefore did not involve a momentary aberration;

(e) the Respondent approached Mr Kelly in a deliberate way and punched him forcefully when he was not expecting it;

(f) the Respondent attacked the heads of people, an inherently more dangerous form of attack than to other parts of the body, given the vulnerability of people's heads and the extent of the injuries which can be caused if they are knocked down on a hard surface;

(g) even towards the end of the conduct, the Respondent was forcibly attacking strangers in the vicinity of police;

(h) the Respondent showed no concern for any of his victims - he ran away from the scene after he punched Mr Kelly, revealing his consciousness of guilt, yet he continued to offend - the Respondent's conduct and words indicated that he had no regard whatsoever for numerous members of the public whom he brutally attacked without warning or explanation;

(i) the Respondent's criminal behaviour in these offences showed a sharp escalation from his prior convictions, which had begun with offences relating to stolen vehicles, then assault of a police officer in the execution of duty and affray and then the Blacktown assault occasioning actual bodily harm;

(j) the Respondent's continuing attitude of disobedience for the law, his moral blameworthiness and the need for specific deterrence and protection of society, required more severe sentences to be imposed.

181For the offence of manslaughter, the Crown submitted that a starting point of eight years' imprisonment against the maximum penalty of 25 years was manifestly inadequate.

182Similarly, it was submitted that the starting point for assault occasioning actual bodily harm of 12 months against a maximum penalty of five years was manifestly inadequate.

183Further, the sentencing Judge's incorrect approach in treating the last three assaults as being of the same seriousness as Count 2 resulted in those sentences also being manifestly inadequate.

184It was submitted that his Honour's failure to have appropriate regard to general deterrence due to the prevalence of alcohol-fuelled offences of violence contributed to the manifest inadequacy of the sentences, as did the failure to take into account the specific deterrence of the Respondent.

185The Crown submitted that, on a number of occasions, this Court has stated that the public must be protected by the criminal law when going about its lawful business on public streets and other public locations: R v AEM at [94]; R v McKenna [2007] NSWCCA 113 at [2], [35].

186The Crown referred again in this context to Hopley v R and R v Carroll, together with Donaczy v R [2010] NSWCCA 143 at [53], where the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for offences of violence perpetrated in a public place, after consumption of alcohol, was emphasised.

187With respect to a number of single-blow manslaughter sentencing decisions to which his Honour's attention had been drawn, the Crown noted that the sentencing Judge stated the correct approach - that what was required was consistency of principle, not numerical equivalence: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at 535 [48]-[49]. The Crown submitted that previous sentencing decisions of this type pointed to a range of sentences actually imposed, but did not establish the correctness of that range: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at 70-71 [303]-[305]. 

188Despite acknowledging the correct approach, the Crown submitted that his Honour had been influenced inappropriately by the sentences imposed in these other cases. His Honour stated (R v Loveridge at [76]):

""These cases, which both the Crown and the defence drew to my attention, suggest most commonly for broadly similar offending for relatively young offenders a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months is regarded as appropriate. A head sentence of between 5 and 6 years, depending on whether special circumstances are found, is commonly imposed. Occasionally higher or lesser sentences are imposed according to the particular circumstances of the case. I acknowledge that these cases provide some guidance.""

189However, the Crown submits that the present offence of manslaughter was not broadly similar to these other cases. During the sentencing proceedings, the Crown pointed out that there were multiple victims in this matter and that the present case is not comparable to the other cases.

190The Crown pointed to the observation of McClellan CJ at CL in KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51; 182 A Crim R 571 at 583 [41] that the range of penalty specified in so-called one-punch manslaughter cases failed to adequately reflect the need for general deterrence and retribution, and that this Court should in future accept that more significant penalties may be required when sentencing offenders for this type of offence.

191It was submitted, both at first instance and in this Court, that a number of the other sentencing cases involved some kind of interaction between the victim and offender prior to the offence. The Crown submitted that not only was the present case not of that type, but none of the other sentencing decisions involved a factual scenario of two attacks, a manifestation of consciousness of guilt and then three further attacks.

192The Crown pointed to other distinctions in the objective circumstances of other sentencing decisions and/or the subjective circumstances of the offender in those cases.

193Reference was made to the frequently cited statement by Gleeson CJ (Grove and Ireland JJ agreeing) in R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA, unreported, 12 December 1995, at page 3) to the following effect:

""It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases.""

194In these circumstances, the Crown submitted (as it did at first instance) that very limited assistance only could be provided by reference to sentences imposed in other manslaughter cases, which were much less morally blameworthy than the present case. 

195The Crown submitted that manifest inadequacy of sentences flowed as well from a failure on the part of the sentencing Judge to have sufficient regard to the Respondent's breach of conditional liberty in committing these offences.

196It was submitted that error had been demonstrated and that this Court should intervene to resentence the Respondent.

The Respondent's Submissions

197Mr Boulten SC submitted that the sentencing Judge had appropriate regard to the maximum penalties for each of the offences. Further, it was submitted that the manslaughter sentencing cases referred to at the sentencing hearing demonstrated an effective range of sentence for this class of manslaughter, and that the sentence imposed upon the Respondent lay within that range. 

198It was submitted that the sentencing Judge had taken into account all the matters upon which the Crown sought to rely in this Court. Emphasis was placed upon the drunken state of the Respondent, his youth and disadvantaged upbringing, all of which were taken into account by the sentencing Judge in the exercise of sentencing discretion.

199It was submitted for the Respondent that a starting point of eight years' imprisonment for the manslaughter sentence was well open to the sentencing Judge. Further, a starting point of 12 months' imprisonment for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence was, it was submitted, also well open to the sentencing court.

200Reference was made to sentencing statistics for offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault, the great bulk of which were prosecuted in the Local Court. It was submitted that the sentences imposed upon the Respondent in this case were not inadequate. 

Decision

201The Respondent stood to be sentenced for five separate crimes, extending from manslaughter (with a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment) to assault occasioning actual bodily harm (maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment) and three offences of common assault (each with a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment).

202As discussed earlier under Grounds 4 and 5, there was an interrelationship between these offences which served to magnify their seriousness in a number of respects. This was an unusual and highly aggravating feature of the Respondent's offences. 

203A further highly aggravating feature of the offences was that all were committed whilst the Respondent was subject to conditional liberty, granted just one month before by a sentencing court for another act of serious and indiscriminate violence. 

204Despite the Respondent's claimed remorse and the leniency extended to him by that sentencing court, he set out on the late afternoon of Saturday, 7 July 2012, with a number of companions, to become highly intoxicated and to venture into busy nightspots in the city of Sydney at Darling Harbour and Kings Cross. 

205The Respondent was well aware of his anger management issues, which had led to a condition upon the probation order granted to him on 7 June 2012. 

206As the evening of 7 July 2012 wore on, it was apparent that the Respondent intended to act in a repeated violent fashion towards persons in the street, with one attack followed by another and yet others, even following his consciousness that Mr Kelly lay prone on the ground after he had struck him.

207No other sentencing decision in this State for so-called one-punch manslaughter involves this combination of factors. Nearly all involve violent incidents (usually with some initiating event between the participants) culminating in a blow being struck giving rise to an offence of manslaughter. Far more is involved in the present case than that.

United Kingdom Cases Involving Manslaughter Arising from Violence in Public Places

208Courts in the United Kingdom have considered some of the issues arising on this appeal. In Reference By the Attorney General Under Section 36 Criminal Justice Act 1988 [2005] EWCA Crim 812, Judge LJ (Hallett J and Sir Charles Mantell agreeing) observed, at [10], that ""It is in truth not realistic to treat what is described as one punch manslaughter as comprising a single identical set of circumstances"", with cases involving death resulting from a single blow varying greatly in their seriousness. Judge LJ observed at [15] that ""This kind of unnecessary violence, in residential areas, creates great, and justified, and increasing public concern"" with people expecting ""their streets to be safe"".

209The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) returned to this issue in Attorney General's Reference No. 60 of 2009 (Appleby and Ors) [2009] EWCA Crim 2693; [2010] 2 Cr App R(S) 46, where Lord Judge CJ (Thomas and Hughes LJJ and Simon and Royce JJ agreeing) again addressed the topic of single-punch manslaughter cases. Lord Judge CJ observed, at [12], that ""... an additional feature of manslaughter cases which has come to be seen as a significant aggravating feature of any such case is the public impact of violence on the streets, whether in city centres, or residential areas ... Specific attention should be paid to the problem of gratuitous violence in city centres and the streets"". 

210Lord Judge CJ continued at [12]:

""... the manslaughter cases with which we are concerned involved gratuitous, unprovoked violence in the streets of the kind which seriously discourages law-abiding citizens from walking their streets, particularly at night, and gives the city and town centres over to the kind of drunken yobbery with which we have become familiar, and a worried perception among decent citizens that it is not safe to walk the streets at night"".

This statement echoes loudly in the context of the present appeal.

211In R v Folkes [2011] EWCA Crim 325; [2011] 2 Cr App R(s) 76, Lindblom J (Laws LJ and Simon J agreeing) said at [15]:

""Every case of so-called ""one punch manslaughter"" is unique in its facts and in the circumstances lying behind it. This was described by the Lord Chief Justice in Appleby as a 'truism' (at [4]). The one common denominator is that a life is needlessly lost, unintended though that outcome has been. In our judgment the appellant can gain little, if any, support from the cases on which reliance is placed on his behalf. Each of those cases is quite different from his.""

212Lindblom J stated at [19]:

""We recognise, as did the judge below, that there can be a real and important distinction between the crime of manslaughter when committed in public and the same offence committed in private. As was remarked by the Court in Appleby (at [12]) 'an additional feature of manslaughter cases which has come to be seen as a significant aggravating feature of any such case is the public impact of violence on the streets'.""

213In R v Duckworth [2012] EWCA Crim 1712; [2013] 1 Cr App R(S) 83, Cox J (Rafferty LJ and Bevan QC agreeing) said at [12]-[14]:

""12 Both parties have drawn our attention to decisions of this Court in a number of cases involving facts where death had resulted from a single blow with a bare hand or fist. These cases include, on Miss Pinkus' part, the case of Furby [2005] EWCA Crim 3147; [2006] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 8 (p.64), Attorney General's Reference (Nos 60, 62 and 63 of 2009) (Declan Appleby) [2009] EWCA Crim 2693; [2010] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 46 (p.3110) and Attorney General's Reference (No. 64 of 2008) (Wyatt) [2009] EWCA Crim 88; [2009] 2 Cr. App. R. (S.) 59 (p.424). 

13 As the judgments in these cases make clear, the category of offences subsumed under the general heading of 'one-punch manslaughter' will invariably include cases where the level of force used and the circumstances surrounding the blow render them particularly serious cases of their kind, even though the consequences must be treated as if they were unintentional and unintended.

14 This, in our judgment, is such a case. Although this incident was one of short duration, it was not a spontaneous incident. This was, as the sentencing judge observed, a case involving gratuitous violence used in the street and an attack of considerable ferocity against a wholly innocent victim. The offence was aggravated by the appellant's previous convictions for offences of violence and for public disorder. This was, therefore, a most serious offence of its kind.""

Offending of This Type in New South Wales

214Two particular points emphasised in the United Kingdom cases have currency in this State as well. 

215Firstly, it is not meaningful to speak of one-punch or single-punch manslaughter cases as constituting a single class of offences. The circumstances of these cases vary widely and attention must be given to the particular case before the sentencing court. 

216Secondly, the commission of offences of violence, including manslaughter, in the context of alcohol-fuelled conduct in a public street or public place is of great concern to the community, and calls for an emphatic sentencing response to give particular effect to the need for denunciation, punishment and general deterrence. The United Kingdom decisions involve statements of serious concern by the courts of the type expressed in this State in Hopley v R, R v Carroll and Pattalis v R concerning a similar form of violent offending.

217General deterrence and retribution are elements that must assume greater importance when the crime in question is a serious one, has been committed in a particularly grave form and its contemporary prevalence is the cause of considerable community disquiet: R v Williscroft [1975] VR 292 at 299.

218Additional considerations arise where an offender has a history of alcohol-fuelled violence, and where further offences of this type are committed whilst the offender is subject to conditional liberty. In such circumstances, specific deterrence is magnified as a factor to be taken into account on sentence. 

219Although the youth or relative youth of offenders who commit offences of this type remains a relevant factor on sentence, particular significance is to be given to general deterrence in sentencing young offenders who commit serious crimes of violence on a public street or in a public place. So much is clear from existing decisions of this Court, including AI v R and R v Carroll. 

220The Respondent's intoxication did not assist him at all on sentence. Of course, the Respondent was sentenced before the commencement of s.21A(5AA) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on 31 January 2014. That section now excludes by statute self-induced intoxication being taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentence. However, the law at the time when the Respondent was sentenced was to a similar effect. Although an offender's intoxication, whether by alcohol or drugs, could explain an offence, it ordinarily did not mitigate the penalty: Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38 at 44 [26]. Courts around Australia have consistently rejected the proposition that intoxication can mitigate the seriousness of an offence or reduce an offender's culpability. Although an ""out of character"" exception has been acknowledged to exist, it has almost never been applied: R v GWM at [82]; ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83 at [110]. The Respondent could not have called in aid the ""out of character"" exception. In truth, the Respondent's awareness of his aggression issues, in the context of alcohol use, meant that his intoxication was capable of operating adversely to him on sentence.

The Role of Other Sentencing Decisions on Sentence

221This Court has observed on a number of occasions that, when other sentencing decisions are provided to a sentencing court, it is important that the purpose for which the information was provided be kept in mind: Van Haltren v R [2008] NSWCCA 274; 191 A Crim R 53 at [76]; R v Dinh [2010] NSWCCA 74; 199 A Crim R 573 at [60]; RR v R [2011] NSWCCA 235; 216 A Crim R 489 at [135]. 

222In the present case, the bundle of sentencing decisions provided to the sentencing Judge represented nothing more than sentencing decisions in cases depending upon their particular facts and the circumstances of the offender in question. The sentencing decisions referred to at first instance did not demonstrate a range of sentences for so-called one-punch manslaughter cases. Contrary to the Crown submission at first instance, it appears that the sentencing Judge treated the other sentencing decisions as if they were comparable cases giving rise to a range (see [188] above). Not only were they not demonstrative of a range of sentences, but the circumstances of those cases were substantially different to those of the present case. 

223Although the decision of the High Court of Australia in Barbaro v The Queen [2014] HCA 2; 88 ALJR 372 restricts the capacity of the Crown to propose to a sentencing Judge a numerical range of penalty in a particular case (at 376-380 [20]-[43]), there is no impediment to the provision of other sentencing decisions which may bear upon the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The decision in Barbaro v The Queen narrows the long-standing ethical rule which permitted a prosecutor to inform the court of an appropriate range of penalty, including a period of imprisonment, by reference to relevant decisions: Clause 93(e), New South Wales Barristers' Rules (which commenced on 6 January 2014). However, a prosecutor or defence counsel may hand up to a sentencing Judge other sentencing decisions, where it is clear that those decisions are relevant to the exercise of sentencing discretion in the case at hand. So much is clear from Hili v The Queen at 536-537 [53]-[54] and Barbaro v The Queen at 379 [41]. 

224It must be emphasised, however, that the sentencing decisions handed to his Honour in the present case were not said by the prosecutor to reveal a range of sentences, nor did his Honour appear, initially at least, to approach them on this basis. However, his Honour's use of the decisions appeared to become somewhat clouded. As the extract from the remarks on sentence set out at [188] above indicates, his Honour had regard to these other sentencing decisions as if they did disclose a range of sentences applicable to the present case. 

225For the reasons emphasised in the United Kingdom cases, and in what has been said already in this judgment, the sentencing decisions provided to his Honour in this case did not provide a range of sentences for so-called one-punch manslaughter cases. 

226There is, in truth, no range of sentences for offences of manslaughter which may be said to have a single common component relating to the mechanism of death (such as the victim's head striking the ground after a blow to the head). To the same effect, there is no range of sentences for manslaughter offences said to have been committed by use of a knife or a rock or some other implement. 

227The myriad circumstances of manslaughter offences render it unhelpful to speak in terms of a range of sentences, or tariff, for a particular form of manslaughter. Gleeson CJ made this clear in R v Blacklidge (see [193] above), in a passage cited regularly in cases such as R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520 at 530 [40]. 
 
The Respondent's Offences

228There were particular features of the present case which rendered the Respondent's crimes grave examples of offences under the provisions for which he was prosecuted.

229When sentencing for manslaughter, a court must always have regard to the full context in which death was caused: R v Hoerler at 531 [44]. The surrounding circumstances may bear upon the objective gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender: R v Hoerler at 531 [44]; R v Wilkinson (No. 5) [2009] NSWSC 432 at [61].

230Taking into account the context and surrounding circumstances in which the offence was committed, this was a grave offence of manslaughter committed by an offender with a history of violent offences, who was subject to conditional liberty at the time of the offence. 

231The branch of the criminal law encompassing involuntary manslaughter reflects the value placed by the law upon human life: The Queen v Lavender [2005] HCA 37; 222 CLR 67 at 87 [60].

232The Respondent's attack upon Mr Kelly was cowardly and unprovoked. Despite it being inflicted by a single punch, the Respondent's killing of Mr Kelly was a serious example of unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter which deserved substantial punishment: Heitanen v R [2012] VSCA 173 at [14].

233We are well satisfied that the sentence imposed for the manslaughter of Mr Kelly was manifestly inadequate.

234The offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed against Mr Compagnoni occurred first in time. The maximum penalty for an offence under s.59(1) Crimes Act 1900 is imprisonment for five years. The context and surrounding circumstances in which that offence of violence was committed rendered it a serious example of a s.59(1) offence, committed by an offender with a history of violence who was subject to conditional liberty at the time. 

235The assault upon Mr Compagnoni caused a cut above his eye. This was a clear example of actual bodily harm. It must be kept in mind that an assessment of the seriousness of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm cannot take into account that the extent of harm inflicted was of a type that did not include more serious injury which could constitute grievous bodily harm: McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305; 198 A Crim R 549 at 558 [44]. 

236Each of the three offences of assault contrary to s.61 Crimes Act 1900, committed against Mr Serrao, Mr Saliba and Mr Gazi, carried a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment. In assessing the seriousness of those offences, it is not permissible to take into account the absence of any injury to those persons, as the infliction of actual bodily harm would render the offences different and more serious offences: McIntyre v R at 558-559 [45]. 

237In the context and surrounding circumstances of these offences, including the preceding events, awareness and stated intent of the Respondent (considered in the context of Grounds 4 and 5 above), these were grave examples of s.61 offences. 

238We do not think that sentencing statistics in the District Court or the Local Court for offences under s.59(1) or s.61 were of any assistance to the sentencing court when determining sentences for the Respondent arising out of the events on the evening of 7 July 2012. 

239The sentencing Judge considered, in the context of totality, the avoidance of a sentence which would be crushing for the Respondent. Courts are not unfamiliar with descriptions of sentences as ""crushing"", but that does not articulate some applicable test: Ta'ala v R [2008] NSWCCA 132 at [42] (Grove J, Campbell JA and Johnson J agreeing). 

240In Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242; 219 A Crim R 104 at 132 [215], with the concurrence of Tobias AJA and Hall J, Johnson J said:

""An assessment whether a particular sentence is a 'crushing sentence' must have regard to the offence or offences committed by the offender, the maximum penalties and standard non-parole periods relevant to those offences, and all objective and subjective factors which should be appropriately brought into account on sentence, together with principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality. As Grove J observed in Ta'ala v R at [42], 'justice is individual and each offence and each offender requires assessment'.""

241We are satisfied that each of the sentences imposed upon the Respondent, and the total effective sentence imposed, were manifestly inadequate. Consideration of the objective circumstances of the offences, and the subjective circumstances of the Respondent, and proper application of principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality ought to have resulted in the imposition of substantially greater sentences than those actually imposed. 

242This conclusion is not based merely upon the view that, if any one of us had been the sentencing Judge at first instance, we would have exercised our discretion differently to that of the sentencing Judge in this case: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at 671-672. Rather, we have concluded that patent and latent errors have been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge, so that a number of individual grounds of appeal and, in particular, the final ground have been made good. 

243In R v Carroll, Allsop P and Johnson J said at 59-60 [62]:

""In R v MD [2005] NSWCCA 342; 156 A Crim R 372 at 387 [65], this Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Simpson and Howie JJ) said: 

'In many cases where an offender is convicted of manslaughter there will be exculpatory matters and personal circumstances that can lead the court to significantly ameliorate the sentence which might otherwise be imposed. However, as this Court pointed out in R v Troja (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 606394 of 1990, 16 July 1991) it is important for the court to ensure that the subjective circumstances of an individual offender do not divert the court from imposing a sentence which adequately reflects the part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and in punishing those who take it.'

We are satisfied that the sentencing judge was diverted in this case by Mr Carroll's undoubtedly strong subjective circumstances so as to impose a sentence which did not reflect the serious objective circumstances of the offence: R v Dodd at 354. We find that ground 2 is made good, and serves to explain how an unreasonable or plainly unjust sentence was imposed at first instance.""

244We are satisfied that the sentencing Judge in the present case was diverted from imposing appropriately adequate sentences by reference to the Respondent's subjective circumstances. It should be said, however, that unlike R v Carroll, the present Respondent's subjective circumstances were not especially helpful to him. He was a young man with a deprived upbringing. However, he had prior convictions, including for offences of violence, and was subject to conditional liberty at the time of these offences. The evidence concerning his risk of reoffending and prospects of rehabilitation was problematic, although (as stated earlier) the sentencing Judge made findings in this respect which were unduly favourable to the Respondent and not supported by the limited evidence before the Court.

245We uphold the final ground of appeal.

The Residual Discretion and Resentencing 

246If error was demonstrated, two affidavits of the Respondent's solicitor, Claire O'Neill, affirmed 24 April 2014 and 5 May 2014 were read on the appeal. We will return to the contents of these affidavits shortly. 

247In determining a Crown appeal under s.5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court has a residual discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient: Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at 465-466 [1]-[2]. This discretion may be exercised for reasons other than double jeopardy: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49; 77 NSWLR 7 at 24-25 [92], [95] and at 33 [150].

248The Crown submitted that the onus lies upon the Respondent to establish that the discretion not to intervene ought be exercised in his favour: R v Smith [2007] NSWCCA 100 at [60]; R v CMB [2014] NSWCCA 5 at [110]; R v Gavel [2014] NSWCCA 56 at [125]. It was submitted for the Respondent that it was for the Crown to negate any reason why the residual discretion of this Court not to interfere should be exercised: R v Hernando [2002] NSWCCA 489; 136 A Crim R 451 at 458 [12]. 

249The outcome of the present appeal is not to be determined by application of the concept of onus. The Court should determine whether the residual discretion to dismiss the appeal ought be exercised, in all the circumstances of the case, and by reference to the material placed before this Court which bears upon the exercise of that discretion.

Submissions and Evidence

250Mr Boulten SC submitted that, if error was established, it would nevertheless be appropriate for the Court to decline to intervene in the exercise of residual discretion for reasons including the following:

(a) the conduct of the Crown in the matter had caused greater delay and anxiety for the Respondent than would usually occur because of the Crown's original application for a guideline judgment;

(b) the appeal had affected the Respondent's classification in custody so that he has not been able to access education and programs whilst awaiting the hearing of the appeal.

251With respect to the first submission, it was noted that the Respondent had been in custody since 18 July 2012 and that the length of the delay is a relevant feature to be taken into account. 

252With respect to the second submission, and generally, it was submitted that the Respondent's sentence is significant and lengthy, particularly for a young man in the process of maturation, and that his compelling subjective circumstances and the delay militate against intervention: R v Huang [2010] NSWCCA 68; 200 A Crim R 419 at 430-431 [78]-[81]. 

253The Respondent relied, as well, upon the affidavits of Ms O'Neill. Those affidavits included a further report of Mr Champion dated 15 April 2014, together with updated information concerning the Respondent's progress in custody. The Respondent has completed the Getting Smart program and is employed in the furniture business unit at the South Coast Correctional Centre. The Respondent has not been able to access any ""compendium programs"" (rehabilitation programs) since being transferred to the South Coast Correctional Centre. The Respondent had indicated a willingness to enter custodial programs designed to reduce the risk of reoffending. 

254Mr Champion was asked to comment upon a number of issues in his supplementary report. Firstly, he was asked how the appeal had impacted on the Respondent's mental state. The Respondent informed Mr Champion that he felt down when he heard of the appeal, but that he had been ""sort of expecting it"", in part because of the publicity. Mr Champion concluded that it was not obvious that the lodging of the appeal had resulted in a major deterioration in the Respondent's mental state, in the sense of him developing overt signs of mental illness, though it did appear to have impacted in a general sense.

255Mr Champion was asked whether the appeal had impacted on the Respondent's experience of custody. The Respondent informed Mr Champion of a number of features, including the freezing of his classification, and the fact that the Crown appeal had ""placed him back in limbo as it were"". The Respondent informed Mr Champion that he had been barred from attending the funeral of his maternal grandfather because of his ""high media profile"". 

256Mr Champion was asked whether the ongoing media coverage of the Respondent's matter had impacted on him since the day of sentencing. The Respondent informed Mr Champion of a number of features of the publicity surrounding the case which had attracted some negative experiences in custody.

257Mr Boulten SC relied upon all these matters in support of the exercise of the residual discretion to dismiss the Crown appeal. If the Court moved to resentence the Respondent, the Court was asked to take the additional evidence into account on sentence.

258The Crown submitted that clear error having been demonstrated, including the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences, the Court should not exercise its residual discretion, but should proceed to resentence the Respondent.

Decision

259In considering the exercise of the residual discretion, the starting point is that clear error has been demonstrated in a number of respects, including the imposition of manifestly inadequate sentences. 

260We do not consider that any conduct on behalf of the Crown operates in the Respondent's favour with respect to the residual discretion. The Crown did not provide the sentencing decisions in other cases to the sentencing Judge to indicate a range of sentences applicable to this case. Nor did the Crown's initial indication, in late 2013, that an application for a guideline judgment was to be made, operate in any material way to assist the Respondent in the exercise of the residual discretion. 

261A Crown appeal against sentence was lodged promptly and the Respondent was notified of it. As the evidence indicates, the Respondent was not surprised that a Crown appeal had been lodged. Any delay in the hearing of the Crown appeal because of the Crown's indication, subsequently withdrawn, that a guideline judgment was to be sought did not give rise to any relevant delay.

262The Respondent has made some progress in custody, and the existence of the Crown appeal has had some impact upon him in ways which may be taken into account by this Court, other than by reference to double jeopardy. We have regard to the affidavits of Ms O'Neill in considering this question. 

263We are satisfied that the residual discretion should not be exercised in favour of the Respondent. This Court should proceed to resentence him for these offences. The additional evidence will be taken into account on sentence.

264The interests of justice require the imposition of appropriate sentences for these serious crimes: R v Dinh at 587 [79]; R v Gavel at [126]. The Respondent's offences are patently serious and there is a corresponding propriety in imposing sentences upon him that reflect this: R v CMB at [109]; R v Gavel at [126].

265The objective circumstances of the Respondent's offences, and his subjective circumstances, have been outlined in some detail earlier in this judgment. It is not necessary to embark upon a further detailed examination of these matters in the context of determining appropriate sentences to be passed on this appeal. 

266The sentencing Judge allowed a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the Respondent's pleas of guilty. It is appropriate to apply the same discount on sentence in this Court. 

267This was a very grave example of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. Without applying any element of double punishment, it is appropriate to have regard to the surrounding circumstances in which the offence was committed. These circumstances involved the commission of other random acts of violence directed at innocent victims both before and after the fatal attack upon Mr Kelly.

268The Respondent had a criminal history for offences of violence, including a very recently imposed court order involving conditional liberty which was breached by his actions on 7 July 2012. 

269The offences were committed in a location where many young persons had gathered on a Saturday evening for peaceful and lawful social activity. The Respondent effectively ran amok in Kings Cross attacking strangers for no reason. The potential for grave injury to occur translated into reality when the Respondent criminally took the life of Mr Kelly.

270Regard should be had to the Respondent's youth, his deprived upbringing and the fact that this is his first time in custody. General deterrence and specific deterrence are most significant factors on sentence for reasons outlined earlier in this judgment. The Respondent's risk of reoffending and prospects of rehabilitation remain somewhat problematic, although there has been some progress in custody. A finding cannot be made that he is unlikely to reoffend.

271Having regard to all objective and subjective factors, before application of the 25% discount for his plea of guilty, a head sentence of 14 years' imprisonment is appropriate for the offence of manslaughter. 

272By reference to all objective factors and subjective factors, before application of the 25% discount, a head sentence of two years and six months' imprisonment is appropriate for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 

273Having regard to all objective and subjective factors, before application of the 25% discount for his pleas of guilty, the following sentences are appropriate for the three offences of assault:

(a) Count 3 - assault of Mr Serrao - imprisonment for 12 months;

(b) Count 4 - assault of Mr Saliba - imprisonment for 15 months;

(c) Count 5 - assault of Mr Gazi - imprisonment for 18 months.

274After application of the 25% discount (and with some rounding), the head sentences to be imposed for the five offences are as follows:

(a) manslaughter of Mr Kelly - imprisonment for 10 years and six months;

(b) assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Mr Compagnoni - 22 months' imprisonment;

(c) assault upon Mr Serrao - nine months' imprisonment;

(d) assault upon Mr Saliba - 11 months' imprisonment;

(e) assault upon Mr Gazi - 13 months' imprisonment.

275We are satisfied that application of the principles of accumulation, concurrency and totality should see a significant level of accumulation as between the various sentences. There are five different victims of these offences. Five separate attacks were made against strangers in the street with different levels of outcome for the victims. All were frightening experiences, at the least, with tragic consequences arising from the attack upon Mr Kelly whereby the Respondent took a human life by his criminal act.

276In approaching the issue of totality, it must be kept in mind that the total effective sentence is to be passed upon a young offender. At the same time, regard must be had to all the purposes of sentencing, which attracts all features of the Respondent's criminal conduct and his background which have been addressed earlier in this judgment.

277In circumstances where the Respondent's subjective circumstances, including his youth and difficult background and the fact that it is his first time in custody have been taken into account in fixing the head sentences, we are not persuaded that special circumstances ought be found to adjust the statutory ratio for reasons other than the process of accumulation which is to be undertaken. An adjustment will be made to the statutory ratio on the manslaughter count to give effect to this conclusion. 

278It is appropriate to fix non-parole periods for the offences of manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. However, the sentences for the assault offences will involve fixed terms of imprisonment. It is appropriate to proceed in this way given the process of accumulation, and the avoidance of short and unnecessarily complicating non-parole periods for the assault offences.

279The sentencing Judge took the approach that the sentences should date from 18 September 2012, and a similar approach ought be taken in this Court.

280The total sentence will be one of 13 years and eight months commencing on 18 September 2012 with a non-parole period of 10 years and two months expiring on 17 November 2022.

281As the Respondent is to be resentenced, it is appropriate to consider the victim impact statements and to comment upon their contents: s.28(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. For the family of Thomas Kelly, the sudden loss of a young man of great promise in any circumstances, let alone those present here, must be a cause of overwhelming grief. He was doing no more than socialising peacefully with friends in a public street when this terrible event occurred. Although words can only provide limited assistance in circumstances such as this, it is appropriate that the Court expresses condolences, on behalf of the community, to the family for their loss.

282We make the following orders:

(a) Crown appeal allowed;

(b) sentences imposed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 8 November 2013 are quashed;

(c) in their place, the Respondent is sentenced as follows:

(i) for the offence of assault upon Matthew Serrao (Count 3) - sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months commencing on 18 September 2012 and expiring on 17 June 2013;

(ii) for the offence of assault upon Rhyse Saliba (Count 4) - sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 11 months commencing on 18 March 2013 and expiring on 17 February 2014;

(iii) for the offence of assault upon Aden Gazi (Count 5) - sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 13 months commencing on 18 October 2013 and expiring on 17 November 2014;

(iv) for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Marco Compagnoni (Count 2) - sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 16 months commencing on 18 July 2014 and expiring on 17 November 2015, with a balance of term of six months commencing on 18 November 2015 and expiring on 17 May 2016;

(v) for the manslaughter of Thomas Kelly (Count 1) - sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of seven years commencing on 18 November 2015 and expiring on 17 November 2022 with a balance of term of three years and six months commencing on 18 November 2022 and expiring on 17 May 2026.

283The earliest date upon which the Respondent will be eligible for release on parole is 18 November 2022.

2704840,Stanizzo v Sassu [2014] NSWDC 90,"Judgment
1This is an application by the first to fourth defendants for summary dismissal of the statement of claim filed on 14 April 2014. 
2The matters complained of are an unspecified number of conversations and/or documents published by these defendants to each other and/or the solicitor acting for the first and second defendants in Supreme Court proceedings. These individual publications are not identified in terms of which defendant  published them, to whom, when, or where, or what they contained, beyond a single set of 15 imputations, pleaded as arising from all these publications, over a period from 17 February to 27 June 2013. 
3The initial particulars of publication set out only that each of the defendants ""conversed by telephone and otherwise communicated with each other"" and unknown third parties in April/May 2013, details of which would be provided following discovery, interrogatories and the issue of subpoenae. On the first return date in the Defamation List (16 May 2014), the first to fourth defendants foreshadowed an application to strike out the statement of claim as deficiently pleaded. The plaintiff sought, and was granted, leave by Bozic SC DCJ to file an amended statement of claim, and did not seek early discovery or interrogatories for particulars of the conversations in question.
4The amended pleadings provided no further detail of the contents of the publications made ""by telephone and otherwise"", but did set out specific particulars as to how these publications, and any imputations they may convey, have been identified by the plaintiff. The possibility that there were such conversations by or between one or more of the defendants has been gleaned by the drafter of this pleading by analysing the contents of the affidavits the first to fourth defendants filed in Supreme Court proceedings 2013/100460 and working backwards, from the information provided by each deponent in their respective affidavits. The imputations pleaded are similarly drawn from this material. (The amended pleading also added a new claim against the solicitor who had appeared for the first and second defendants in the Supreme Court proceedings, but that is unrelated to the claim against the first to fourth defendants.) 
5When the proceedings came before Elkaim SC DCJ on 13 June 2014, the defendants renewed their application for summary dismissal. The fifth defendant, who was joined in the amended statement of claim without leave, sought a separate hearing of the claim against her. Elkaim SC DCJ set these issues down for hearing on 4 July 2014 and gave the parties leave to serve affidavits. This was the application I heard on 4 July 2014.
6The leave granted by Elkaim SC DCJ would have permitted the bringing of an application for discovery or interrogatories, if that was how the plaintiff proposed to proceed. This was the course taken in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1101. (In those proceedings, the plaintiff never took the steps of administering the interrogatories for which leave was granted, with the result that those proceedings were later dismissed: Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1850.) The plaintiff in these proceedings has not brought any such application, but contends that, if necessary, he is entitled to do so in the future, and that it is unnecessary to do so now.
The applications before the court
7The first to fourth defendants put forward three submissions. Firstly, the plaintiff's failure to seek some form of early discovery (Dank v Cronulla Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd (No 3), supra) or discovery before suit (r 5.3 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"")) warrants these proceedings being summarily dismissed for failure to comply with r 15.19 UCPR. Secondly, if any such orders were sought, they would never be made, as the plaintiff would be on a ""fishing expedition"", and the appropriate course is thus to dismiss these proceedings summarily. Thirdly, the conversations are protected by absolute privilege at common law and under s 27(2) Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) (""the Act""), as the plaintiff has ""worked backwards"" from the affidavits filed in the Supreme Court proceedings in which the plaintiff and the first and second defendants were parties, in order to bring a claim for the conversations the defendants had with their legal advisers and each other. Additionally, these conversations were protected by legal professional privilege, and many would have taken place outside the twelve-month period prior to the filing of the statement of claim (16 April 2014). The proceedings should be dismissed summarily on this basis.
8The plaintiff's submission is that all he has to do is to plead a cause of action sufficiently particularised for the defendants to know the case they have to meet, which he has done. Interrogatories concerning publication can be sought at any time. The first to fourth defendants have already filed defences, and the matter can proceed on the basis that at some time in the future, discovery and interrogatories can clarify issues of publication. The admissions made in the defence make it clear the defendants made communications of the kind set out in the statement of claim. Those conversations, notwithstanding having led to the drafting of affidavits, are not privileged, as absolute privilege cannot extend retrospectively to conversations witnesses have with each other or with their solicitor merely because such a conversation is later set out in an affidavit: Watson v M'Ewan [1905] AC 480. Furthermore, these affidavits were never read in court, as the matter settled. Alternatively, absolute privilege protects the affidavits and may extend to conversations in the solicitor's office, but does not protect the defendants' conversations outside the solicitor's office or between themselves. 
The factual background
9The will of Mr Constantino Sini, who died on 17 February 2013, was one of the client documents in the possession of a solicitor, Mr Glenn Henniker, who had purchased the plaintiff's law practice after the plaintiff ceased practising as a solicitor. That will, made in 2002, named the plaintiff as executor. The plaintiff asked Mr Henniker to give him the original will for the purpose of attending to his executorial obligations. The beneficiaries gave instructions to the effect that they opposed the plaintiff being appointed as the executor, and the will was not handed over. The plaintiff commenced proceedings 2013/100460 in the Supreme Court seeking an order that Mr Henniker produce the will in his possession.
10The beneficiaries, who resided in Italy, instructed a solicitor (Ms Garrett, the fifth defendant) to cross-claim against the plaintiff, seeking orders that either the first and second defendants, their Australian relatives, be appointed as executors, or alternatively that the NSW Trustee and Guardian be appointed. All four defendants (who are all cousins, and related to the beneficiaries living in Italy) swore affidavits in those proceedings.
11On 2 October 2013 Lindsay J made interim orders appointing the NSW Trustee and Guardian pending the hearing: In the Estate of Sini: Stanizzo v Henniker [2013] NSWSC 1459. The parties have informed me that on 3 March 2014 the Supreme Court made orders to the effect that the NSW Trustee and Guardian be appointed administrator of the estate of the late Mr Sini without the matter proceeding to a final hearing.
The issues for determination
12In those circumstances, the issues are: 
(a)Whether the plaintiff's failure to seek early discovery and/or interrogatories about publication warrants the striking out of these proceedings, 
(b)Whether any future application for discovery or interrogatories by the plaintiff will be a fishing expedition, and 
(c)Whether the publications in question are protected under s 27(2) or at common law, in circumstances where the matters complained of are agreed to consist of conversations the defendants had with their solicitors and/or each other in relation to the material contained in their affidavits in the probate proceedings before the Supreme Court Equity Division. The first issue: Should the plaintiff have sought these orders before now?
13The form of the statement of claim, the contents of which are set out in the schedule to this judgment, somewhat resembles the pleading which was the subject of consideration by McCallum J in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd, supra. The plaintiff in those proceedings pleaded a collection of disparate remarks made to one or more persons on one or more occasions in different forms, as if they were one publication. The source for those remarks was a newspaper article. McCallum J granted leave to administer interrogatories as to those conversations.
14The plaintiff asserts a right to rely upon the pleadings in their present form until such time as interrogatories can be administered, relying upon Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd [1982] 1 NSWLR 294, where Hunt J  granted relief of the sort that the plaintiff proposes at some stage to seek in these proceedings. While it is the case that Hunt J warns (at 295) that the plaintiff's right to identify unknown defamatory publications by this method ""is limited to supporting a definite case set up, and does not extend to fishing out a case from his opponent"", the plaintiff submits that such a warning is unnecessary in these proceedings. This is because the first to fourth defendants have already filed a defence, a step not taken by the defendant in Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd, supra. By taking such a step the defendants have waived any right to complain about the plaintiff not having proceeded to interrogate or seek preliminary discovery concerning publication issues.
15It is correct for the plaintiff to say that a party may seek such interrogatories at any time. In Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 11, Nicholas J identified the relevant rule as r 21.2(1)(a) UCPR, which entitles a plaintiff to seek limited discovery in relation to issues of this narrow kind at any stage of the proceedings, subject to ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW), the longstanding recognition of the court's power to permit discovery and interrogatories (Cumming v 2KY Broadcasters Pty Ltd [1981] 1 NSWLR 246) and, most importantly, provided that the application was not a fishing expedition (at [10]).
16However, Nicholas J considered such an application could be made at any stage of the proceedings where fundamental issues such as the nature of the publication and imputations distilled therefrom are clear. This does not entitle a plaintiff to commence proceedings without identifying the matter complained of with sufficient clarity for the proceedings to be able to proceed. This was the problem in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd, supra, where a series of statements to different persons on different occasions, distilled from quotes in a newspaper article, were pleaded in this fashion. McCallum J was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence of some publication for leave to administer interrogatories (Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd, supra). However, the plaintiff did not do so, and instead filed a statement of claim that was ""if anything, worse than in the original statement of claim"" (Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club Ltd (No 3), supra, at [10]). The plaintiff's failure to take this step resulted in dismissal of this part of the claim. In other words, where the issue the subject of such interrogatories is such a fundamental issue as what was said, by whom and when, delay in carrying out such a step, if ordered (which is not the case in these proceedings), may be fatal.
17Mr Rollinson submits that I can disregard this problem in these proceedings, because the first to fourth defendants have elected to file a defence and are clearly able to go to trial on the issues as currently pleaded. I note the first to fourth defendants did not seek orders that the plaintiff take this step before proceeding further, unlike the defendants in Dank, supra. Instead, they filed a defence.
18This requires a consideration of their defence. This poorly drafted document (for which Mr Lawson was not responsible) refers briefly (in paragraph 4) to unparticularised defences of absolute privilege (s 27(2)(b)) and to a defence of statutory and qualified privilege at common law. Paragraph 5 consists of a series of factual challenges ""in answer"" to the imputations pleaded. A second paragraph 5 (due to a numbering error) identifies unparticularised defences under ss 25, 26, 27, 30 and 31 of the Act ""in addition to the common law defences"", but goes on to say that ""the defendants are unable to specify which defence applies to which alleged publication because the Statement of Claim does not specify the alleged publications"".
19This final sentence is important. It makes clear is that this is a ""holding defence"", of the kind that is filed in proceedings where summary judgment is threatened, in circumstances in which the nature of the cause of action is unclear (Astral Land Pty Ltd v Golden Commercial Pty Ltd [2012] WASC 274) or time about to expire (Cristovao v Butcher Paull and Calder and Ors [2006] WASCA 235). It should not be necessary to file a ""holding defence"" in defamation proceedings, where default judgment is not available, but where a claim of absolute privilege is relied upon, a ""holding defence"" may be required to file a defence outlining the nature of absolute privilege claimed: Vescio v Guardianship Tribunal of New South Wales [2009] NSWDC 341; Vescio v Guardianship Tribunal of New South Wales [2010] NSWCA 227. 
20There was no need to file a defence. The first to fourth defendants were not ordered to do so; Elkaim SC DCJ's orders excused them even from filing a notice of motion. It may be advisable to file a defence where summary judgment is sought (especially if on the basis of a defence that a publication was made on an occasion of absolute privilege). However, the cursory manner in which the s 27(2) defence is referred to is hardly satisfactory, and the unparticularised references to other defences are unhelpful. Nevertheless, the issue of a s 27(2) defence has clearly been raised. 
21Much of the argument before me on this first issue centred on whether (despite filing a defence or not) the first to fourth defendants could now say it was too late for the plaintiff to bring any such application. The submission that such an application had to be brought before proceedings, as only discovery before suit was available, is misconceived. The plaintiff is entitled to commence proceedings and to seek such orders at a later time, provided that the application is not a fishing expedition. 
22The second basis upon which Mr Lawson submitted that the claim against his clients should be struck out is that such an application, if brought, would amount to a fishing expedition and would never be permitted. In other words, the orders for discovery and interrogatories made in the cases discussed above could never be made, no matter when these orders were sought, because what the plaintiff was asking the defendants to do was to draft the statement of claim. 
The second issue: Is this a fishing expedition?
23Mr Rollinson submits that the plaintiff has a basis for inferring these conversations took place by looking at the contents of the first to fourth defendants' affidavits, just as the plaintiff in Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd, supra had a basis, from credit report documents, upon which to infer that the defendant had told third parties that the plaintiff was bankrupt. The plaintiff in Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd had given the best particulars he could of these publications to unidentified third parties, and successfully sought orders for discovery and interrogatories only to rectify this deficiency, as Hunt J considered that the request for this information did not amount to a fishing expedition. 
24Mr Rollinson submitted that the present case was much stronger than Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd, supra. This was principally because the defendants in those proceedings had not yet filed a defence, and had submitted that they could not know the case they were to meet, neither of which was applicable here. Any future application for particulars of the publications would not be a fishing expedition, as the precise conversations in these proceedings be identified with reference to the affidavit material, as appears to have been acknowledged by the contents of the defence. The defence demonstrates that the first to fourth defendants comprehend, and join issue with, the plaintiff's case, in that they deny that there were conversations other than for the purpose of these proceedings. The plaintiff should be entitled to explore that assertion at an appropriate state of the litigation in the future.
25In State of South Australia v Milisits [2013] SASC 189 at [21], Stanley J defined a ""fishing expedition"" as an application seeking ""disclosure of documents in the hope that something will turn up of assistance to the party seeking disclosure in the documents themselves"". In Dank, supra, McCallum J noted that the court will only assist a plaintiff with such interrogatories where the plaintiff can demonstrate a good cause of action but is ""unable to find out the precise form in which to frame it"" (at [31]. Her Honour was satisfied that the plaintiff had a good cause of action, and the question was whether it was spoken orally or published on Twitter:
""[34] I confess that I have found it difficult to decide this issue. I acknowledge that authority cautions against requiring a party to answer interrogatories unless that is ""necessary"". The use of that term in the rules must of course be understood in the context of the Court's obligation to ac in accordance with the dictates of justice and the difficulties faced in this litigation: see s 58 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005. Whilst I would accept that the plaintiff could have approached Mr Rothfield with a view to ascertaining his version of events, one can understand that there may be difficulties in taking that course in circumstances where Mr Rothfield is a defendant in the proceedings...
[35] In my view, the plaintiff can demonstrate by reference to [the Sunday Telegraph article] that he has a good cause of action but is unable to find out the precise form in which to frame it. The transcript establishes the making of a slanderous imputation of a particular character, but a question has arisen as to its accuracy particularly given that part of it purports to be words spoken by Mr Irvine whereas the television broadcast has characterised those words as having been published not orally but in a tweet.""

26The first prerequisite is that the plaintiff has a good cause of action. The plaintiff's submissions appear to concede that at least some of the conversations leading to the matters in the affidavits will be protected by absolute privilege and/or legal professional privilege, and that at least some of these conversations (namely most of the conversations involving the first and second defendant leading up to the affidavit which was sworn on 18 April 2013) fall outside the 12-month limitation period. How many of these conversations can be rescued from this hostile undergrowth of privileges and limitation defences is uncertain.
27However, the second prerequisite - the precise nature and extent of these many conversations - is an even greater problem. Mr Lawson submits that what the plaintiff will have to do is to ask his clients to outline all their conversations in the hope that he can pick and choose some of them which may be actionable. All conversations between the defendants are sought, whether amounting to publication to a third party or not (see the conflicting decisions on this issue discussed by Tobias JA in Trantum v McDowell [2007] NSWCA 138), whether  protected by common interest privilege or legal professional privilege or not (Network Ten Limited v Capital Holdings Limited (1995) 36 NSWLR 275 at 279 per Giles JA), whether protected by spousal immunity or not (Roberts-Smith v Crawshaw [2014] WASC 12), and whether within the limitation period or not. 28In Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd, supra, all the defendant had to do was to identify those persons who had sought their professional advice (the defendant being a credit agency that provided such information). In Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club, supra, all the defendants had to do was to identify the dates and times of the conversations referred to in the matter complained of. 
29Here, however, I am satisfied not only that any such task would be impossible to perform, but that the plaintiff is endeavouring ""to see if he can find a case...of which at present he knows nothing"" (Russell v Stubbs Ltd [1913] 2 KB 200 at 204). Each of the four defendants would have to set out each conversation he or she had with anyone about any aspect of the court proceedings capable of giving rise to the matter complained of over the period of time referred to in the statement of claim. All these conversations, telephone calls, emails and/or letters would then have to be examined to determine if they were to be the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege, or absolute privilege, or falling outside the limitation period, or all of the above, or whether the plaintiff wants to bring proceedings in relation to each of them. What would happen if there were different versions of events from each of the defendants is hard to imagine. The plaintiff would no doubt wish to be heard on issues in relation to each such publication. The plaintiff is effectively asking the first to fourth defendants to draft his statement of claim. 
30If the plaintiff cannot establish either of these elements then, although the plaintiff may in theory be at liberty to bring a Kaiser v George Laurens (NSW) Pty Ltd application ""at any time"" (Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd, supra), I am satisfied that no such order would ever be made, having regard to the pleadings in these proceedings, as it would be a fishing expedition of the clearest kind.
31Additionally, as Nicholas J and McCallum J both noted, the entitlement of a plaintiff to bring such an application ""at any time"" is subject to the provisions of ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Mr Lawson submitted that the onerous obligations placed on his clients, in relation to the very limited publications which were essentially made either to each other or to their solicitors, was the opposite of ""just, cheap and quick"" and involved costs disproportionate to issues (s 60). 
32I am satisfied that any application by the plaintiff to compel the first to fourth defendants to identify and set out the text of the conversations and/or documents identified in the statement of claim would be an impermissible fishing expedition. The pleadings in their present state fail to comply with r 15.19 UCPR. In their current state, those pleadings are embarrassing and, conformably with the reasoning of McCallum J in Dank v Cronulla-Sutherland District Rugby League Football Club (No 3), supra, the pleadings in the amended statement of claim set out in relation to the first to fourth defendants should be struck out and dismissed on this basis. 
33This brings me to the third basis for the application for summary dismissal raised by Mr Lawson, namely that the plaintiff has ""worked backwards"" from the affidavits filed in the Supreme Court proceedings to bring a claim for defamation in relation to matter that is protected by absolute privilege under s 27(2) of the Act, as is set out in his clients' defence.  
The third issue: Are the publications by the defendants giving rise to the imputations immune from suit?
34Mr Lawson explained his description of ""working backwards"" as arising from the particulars of publication provided by the plaintiff in the statement of claim. Although those affidavits have not been provided to me, it is clear from the statement of claim that the plaintiff's claim arises only from conversations between the first to fourth defendants and with the solicitor who acted for the first and second defendant and drafted the affidavits for all defendants. 
35Immunity from suit for witnesses extends to all civil proceedings except malicious prosecution: Cumberland v Clark (1996) 39 NSWLR 514 at 520, citing R v Beydoun (1990) 22 NSWLR 256 at 259 - 260. The rationale is that there should be no collateral attack upon litigation. Although Mr Rollinson referred to Martin v Watson [1996] AC 74, the narrowly defined circumstances in which a claim for malicious prosecution may be brought against an individual as opposed to the prosecuting authority are not relevant here, and remain controversial in Australia.
36A party's private communications with his lawyer, or with other witnesses or potential witnesses in the proceedings, for the purpose of preparation of affidavits forms part of the protection afforded by the absolute privilege afforded to that affidavit (Brown on Defamation (2nd Ed., Carswell), [12.4.5(j)]). In Lincoln v Daniels [1962] 1 QB 237 at 260 Devlin LJ, referring to the absolute immunity afforded to pleadings, stated: ""A plaintiff in a libel action could not be allowed to say, ""I do not bring the action against you for what was said in the statement of claim but for what you instructed your solicitor and counsel to put into the statement of claim."" 
37Mr Rollinson's submission is that the House of Lords in Watson v M'Ewan, supra, held that this privilege did not extend to conversations between parties, their legal representatives and their witnesses for the purpose of preparing their affidavits or otherwise seeking instructions. The Lord Chancellor, with Lord James and Lord Robertson agreeing, noted the absolute immunity of the evidence contained in a witness statement or affidavit used in court as ""too plain for argument"", and went on to note that this extended to the conferences with the solicitor for the preparation of the evidence:
""But then comes the question which, so far as I know, has been raised for the first time in this case. The ingenious suggestion has been made that although it is true that a witness is protected from an action in respect of evidence actually given in a Court of justice, yet no such protection exists in respect of his attendance before the solicitor at what is called apparently in Scottish law his precognition - what we call the interview between the intended witness and the solicitor who takes from him what we call the proof - that is to say, reduces to writing the evidence which the witness is about to give. One very serious element of difficulty which those who insist upon such a liability have to meet is manifest - namely, that in the whole course of the diligent inquiry that the learned counsel on both sides have made into this matter they have not found that any such liability has ever been sought to be established before. So far as I know personally in my experience no such question has ever arisen. The learned Judges who have allowed these issues have done so apparently for the first time in this case.
It appears to me that the privilege which surrounds the evidence actually given in a Court of justice necessarily involves the same privilege in the case of making a statement to a solicitor and other persons who are engaged in the conduct of proceedings in Courts of justice when what is intended to be stated in a Court of justice is narrated to them - that is, to the solicitor or Writer to the Signet. If it were otherwise, I think what one of the learned counsel has with great cogency pointed out would apply - that from time to time in these various efforts which have been made to make actual witnesses responsible in the shape of an action against them for the evidence they have given, the difficulty in the way of those who were bringing the action would have been removed at once by saying, ""I do not bring the action against you for what you said in the witness-box, but I bring the action against you for what you told the solicitor you were about to say in the witness-box."" If that could be done the object for which the privilege exists is gone, because then no witness could be called; no one would know whether what he was going to say was relevant to the question in debate between the parties. A witness would only have to say, ""I shall not tell you anything; I may have an action brought against me to-morrow if I do; therefore I shall not give you any information at all."" It is very obvious that the public policy which renders the protection of witnesses necessary for the administration of justice must as a necessary consequence involve that which is a step towards and is part of the administration of justice, namely, the preliminary examination of witnesses to find out what they can prove. It may be that to some extent it seems to impose a hardship, but after all the hardship is not to be compared with that which would arise if it were impossible to administer justice, because people would be afraid to give their testimony.
38The House of Lords then appeared to leave open whether the privilege extends to the witness whose affidavit is not tendered, and does not take an oath in court to be cross-examined on his affidavit:
The hardship to which I refer is this: That although when a witness does give evidence which is wilfully false you can indict him for perjury; on the other hand, if he makes the same statement, not upon oath, to a person taking down the evidence he is prepared to give, it seems to be very difficult to devise anything that would bring him to justice for that false statement. The answer, of course, dealing with it as a matter of convenience and indeed of necessity for the administration of justice, I suppose, is this: Unless he does give evidence in a Court of justice, in which case he can be indicted for perjury if his evidence is wilfully false, nobody knows anything about it - it slumbers, I suppose, in the office of the solicitor, and nobody hears or cares anything about it. Practically, I think that would be the answer. But whether that be a good answer or not, what seems to me to be an overwhelming consideration in the determination of this case is that a witness must be protected for his preliminary statement or he has no protection at all, and that there is that protection established is, as I have already said, beyond all possibility of doubt.""
39While the House of Lords was uncertain about the extent of this immunity in 1905, it is now settled law that immunity from suit extends to persons interviewed as witnesses even if the testimony is never given, or not presented in court. In Lincoln v Daniels, supra, at 258, Devlin LJ, noting the reference in Watson v M'Ewen to this  category of absolute privilege as ""the most difficult"" to define, went on to say it was ""immaterial whether the proof is or is not taken in the course of proceedings""; see also Page v McGovern [2008] TasSC 13 at [30]; Paterson v Hesse [1914] 34 NZLR 177 at 181 per Hosking J; McCabe v Joynt [1901] 2 Ir R 115 at 127 (QBD). This has even been held to extend to the usual solicitors' inter partes correspondence, and as not being confined to documents required for use in court: Wong Shui Kee v Chu [2003] 1 HKC 125 (considered in Cunliffe v Woods [2012] VSC 254). The fact that there are others present when the testimony is discussed will not defeat that privilege if those persons are not otherwise strangers to the action: Thompson v Turbott [1963] NZLR 71, such as another witness: Ascherman v Natanson 23 Cal App 3d 861, 100 Cal Rptr 656 (1972). 
40A potential additional requirement in More v Weaver [1928] 2 KB 520 (a decision which, while doubted, has never been overruled: see Clark v Davey [2002] EWHC 2342), namely that the remarks would need to be relevant to the pleadings or subject matter of the proceedings, is not an issue here, as the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff are a agreed to be a compilation of the allegations made in the affidavits sworn by each of the defendants.  
41As Mr Lawson noted, a further problem is that the conversations the defendants had with their solicitor and with each other in relation to the preparation of these proceedings would be protected by legal professional privilege: Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2002) 213 CLR 543 at [11]; Re Neenan [2011] AATA 372. Conversations between a solicitor and client are themselves the subject of absolute privilege at common law: Brown on Defamation (2nd Ed., Carswell), at [12.4(4)(c) ff]. This is the corollary of the submission that the defendants' statements to their legal representatives and each other for the purpose of preparing the probate proceedings were made on a protected occasion. Even if they were not, they were made on an occasion of solicitor/client or common interest privilege and as such the plaintiff cannot compel their production. That includes conversations and communications between the cross-claimants (the first and second defendants) in the Supreme Court proceedings with each other and their witnesses, which would be protected by the common interest legal professional privilege explained by Giles JA, as well as by the immunity from suit to which witnesses are entitled. 
42Further, as Mr Lawson noted in his submissions, any publications made prior to 16 April 2013 fall outside the one year limitation period for defamation proceedings. This is of particular significance to the publications asserted to have been made by the first and second defendants, which more than likely were made prior to that date.
43Finally, the defendants submit that the claim is an abuse of process. This argument was not developed by the defendants, or responded to by the plaintiff, but I note that the issues raised here reflect some of the court's concerns in Moevao v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 4 and Higgins J in Emanuele v Headley (Supreme Court of the ACT, Higgins J, 7 March 1997). (See also Calabro v Zappia [2010] NSWDC 127, where the matter complained of was a potential witness's statutory declaration, surreptitously removed by one of the plaintiffs from a bundle of papers in the courtroom foyer.)  44Accordingly, the proceedings against the first to fourth defendants should also be dismissed on the basis that the publications identified in the statement of claim are protected by absolute privilege under s 27(2) of the Act. 
The fifth defendant
45The fifth defendant is a legal practitioner and the author of the letter which is annexed to the statement of claim. The parties agreed that I should determine the summary dismissal proceedings brought by the first to fourth defendants and defer the future conduct of this litigation by the fifth defendant, including any applications by either party for rulings, will be a matter for the parties to determine. Any such timetable should commence with any challenge to the form and capacity of the sole imputation pleaded. Neither the complexities of defamation proceedings nor the dangers of inadequate or precipitate pleadings should be overlooked by either party in the future conduct of these proceedings.
46In the course of making interim orders in In the Estate of Sini: Stanizzo v Henniker, supra, Lindsay J made observations which I am sure were of assistance to the parties in subsequently resolving the matter. Those observations are just as pertinent here. With his Honour's observations in mind, I have reserved the issue of costs of the proceedings against the first to fourth defendants, with liberty to apply.
Orders
(1)Plaintiff's claim against the first to fourth defendants dismissed.
(2)Costs of the proceedings against the first to fourth defendants reserved, with liberty to apply.
(3)The plaintiff and fifth defendant have leave to bring in short minutes of order for a timetable.

Karen GarrettFrom: ""Karen Garrett"" [Email of Ms Karen Garrett]Date: Monday, 30 December 2013 4:01 PMTo: [Email of NSW Trustee & Guardian Special Projects]; ""Mark Lawson"" [Email of Mr Mark Lawson]Subject: Estate of Constantino Sini G59
Dear Sir/Madam
Thank you for your time on the telephone on 23 December 2013.
Per our discussion, I confirm that on 2 October 2013, his Honour Lindsay J made orders granting special letters of administration to the NSW Trustee which included 8(d) to publish notices. We believe that it was his Honour's intention that this step take place. We note you advised that the view of your ""legal people"" is that you should not publish notices until a final grant is applied for and/or granted.
Please note that our clients' (i.e. the beneficiaries) Cross-claim to have the named executor found to be not a fit and proper person, also seeks an order that two relatives be appointed as executors, or in the alternative:
""an order that administration of the estate, with the will of the late Constantino Sini dated 16 August 2002 annexed, be granted to such other person, or persons, as the Court considers appropriate to hold such office""
The above order obviously contemplates the appointment of the NSW Trustee.
In other words, our clients have already made application to the Court for the appointment of the NSW Trustee.
If there is any other impediment to the notices being published, we would be grateful if you would have your legal people advise us of the basis for same so that we can seek appropriate orders from the Court.
The matter is listed for directions on 3 February 2014. We note your advice that you will provide us with a report of the progress of the matter prior to that date. We confirm it is our intention to seek an order that you have power to sell the real estate of the deceased as you do not believe the current orders make it clear that you may do so.
Yours faithfullyCOYNE LEGALperKaren GarrettPhone [redacted]Mobile [redacted]Fax [redacted]

2704844,R v Hunter (No 5) [2014] NSWSC 1148,"ex tempore Judgment
1An application has been made by the Crown Prosecutor to adjourn the pre-trial application until next Monday, and to empanel the jury shortly after that. 2Defence counsel does not oppose the application, though he does submit that matters will need to be resolved shortly.  3The succinct background is that the trial was listed to commence on Monday of this week.  Two attempts were made to empanel a jury, without success.  Thereafter, I stood the empanelment over until Wednesday and embarked upon a discussion of legal matters with the parties on Tuesday.  On Tuesday, on the application of both parties, I adjourned the legal argument to today and the empanelment until tomorrow.  I delivered a short separate judgment giving reasons for that course.  4To state things succinctly, an important legal argument is whether the judgment of Johnson J, permitting the reception into evidence of a previous representation of Mr Wade Hunter, should be revisited.  That question, in turn, depends to some degree on whether Mr Gary Hunter will be available to give evidence.  5Mr Gary Hunter did not answer a subpoena to attend and give evidence on the first day of the trial, and I have issued a bench warrant.  6Today, Crown voir dire exhibit U was received into evidence.  In short, it suggests that Mr Gary Hunter is in contact with other members of the family of the accused.  It also suggests that the romantic partner of the accused is in contact with Mr Gary Hunter, and arguably seeking to tell him what to say in the witness box.  7Earlier this week the learned Crown Prosecutor indicated that she would not seek, in the absence of Mr Gary Hunter, to place his previous representations before the jury.  However, in light of the contents of voir dire exhibit U, she has explained today that she wishes to have time to reflect further on that question.  8Both parties have submitted that that question - namely, whether the previous representations of Mr Gary Hunter are admissible - could be an important consideration in determining whether, and, if so to what effect, the judgment of Johnson J with regard to the evidence of Mr Wade Hunter should be revisited.  In particular, defence counsel submitted that the more witnesses whose evidence is admitted without the possibility of cross-examination, the greater will be the prejudice discussed in such cases as R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; 56 NSWLR 182. 9The Crown Prosecutor has also submitted that, in light of the situation with regard to Mr Gary Hunter which, in her submission, is developing day by day, it would not be inappropriate to stand over the legal argument that is founded (at least to some degree) on whether or not he is to be at Court to a date merely one week after the date upon which the trial was listed to commence.  10The matter has a highly regrettable history.  In particular, the accused was charged well over three years ago, and I understand that he has been in custody all of that time.  No doubt those who loved the deceased seek resolution of the matter as soon as possible.  And the processes of the Court have already been disrupted once by a trial date having to be vacated on the application of defence counsel.  A large number of hearing days have already been lost this week.  11Having said all that, I consider that the question of the admissibility of the previous representations of Mr Wade Hunter, and possibly Mr Gary Hunter, are very important in the trial.  They should not be determined, to my mind, without the parties having had a chance to reflect calmly on the way forward.  12The situation with regard to Mr Gary Hunter is, I accept, developing fluidly.   13Some time can be spent this week determining other legal questions, in order to permit the running of the trial before the jury without any interruption.  14As the Crown Prosecutor submitted, in the scheme of things, if her application is accepted the trial will have been delayed a little over a week by the time the jury is empanelled.  15Despite my reluctance to adjourn the trial yet again this week, I consider that it is in the interests of justice to adjourn all of the legal discussions about the admissibility of previous representations of Mr Wade Hunter, and potentially Mr Gary Hunter, until Monday at 10 AM.  Unless truly exceptional circumstances arise, I would not be open to further adjournments in that regard.  
16My intention is that the jury would be empanelled at 10 AM on Tuesday.

		21 August 2014",2014-07-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2704846,R v Hunter (No 4) [2014] NSWSC 1147,"EX TEMPORE Judgment1An application has been made to adjourn the trial for some days by defence counsel.  2Stated succinctly, a Mr Gary Hunter who appeared on the Crown list of proposed witnesses did not attend court in answer to a subpoena yesterday.  As a result, a bench warrant was issued for his arrest by me.  3As the documentary evidence tendered on the voir dire shows, he has made a number of equivocal statements and given some equivocal evidence.  Basically it could be said that his last-given evidence inculpated the accused.  Indeed he gave evidence at the committal that he saw the accused strike a man to the head with a metal pole.  
4Yesterday, two efforts were made to empanel a jury.  On the first occasion duplication in jury cards became apparent, and I was not comfortable proceeding further in those circumstances.  5On the second occasion, the jury was successfully empanelled but subsequently discharged when a juror indicated in writing that he or she was emotionally incapable of proceeding. 6In the circumstances, I stood the empanelment over for two days until tomorrow at 10 AM.  That was to permit various disputes about the admissibility of evidence to be resolved or at least explored; and, in particular, to discuss an application by defence counsel to revisit a ruling of Johnson J of 6 December 2013, which ruling related to the admissibility of a statement of the late Mr Wade Hunter, in light of the possible unavailability of Mr Gary Hunter. 7Mr Carroll's contention is that the judgment of his Honour should be revisited because, contrary to what was thought at the time of the judgment, at least as at today Mr Gary Hunter will not be available for cross-examination.
8Mr Carroll submitted that that availability played a role in his Honour's determination, at least with regard to ""discretionary"" exclusion of the evidence of Mr Wade Hunter. 9Today, Mr Carroll has sought to adjourn the matter for no more than a number of days.  
10He submitted, first, that the bench warrant has been in force for less than 24 hours.  
11Secondly, it is possible in light of the equivocal statements that he has made in the past that Mr Gary Hunter, if able to be located, could provide evidence favourable to the defence case.  
12Thirdly, in any event, the pre-trial issue that has been identified relates to the presence or otherwise of Mr Gary Hunter and there should be some margin for determination of that initial question; namely, whether Mr Gary Hunter will or will not be available for cross-examination. 13The Crown Prosecutor joined in the application.  She submitted, in particular, that from the Crown's perspective things have reached a point where it is really not clear precisely what Mr Gary Hunter would say if he became available to give evidence in the witness box.  She submitted that there would be a necessity, if he were available, for evidence to be taken on the voir dire, so that she could discharge her function of determining whether he should be called at all, and, if so, whether s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) should be relied upon.  She also accepted that the accused is facing an exceptionally serious offence.  As I understand her position, she accepts there should not be an inappropriate degree of inflexibility in terms of seeing whether Mr Gary Hunter can be located and become a witness in the witness box. 14The fact is that this matter has been subject of a great many delays.  A number of aspects of its forensic history are noteworthy. 15First, the offence was allegedly committed over three years ago. 
16Secondly, the trial was vacated at a very late stage late last year so that certain matters could be explored by the solicitor for the accused.  17Thirdly, an earlier application to vacate the trial date in October 2013 had been refused.  18Fourthly, the matter first came before the Supreme Court 16 months ago.
19On the other hand, it is true that one could not be sure that Mr Gary Hunter would not answer his subpoena until a little over 24 hours ago.  
20Furthermore, no doubt the bench warrant did not reach the police immediately upon my issuing it.  21In those circumstances it could be said that it would be appropriate for there to be given a little more time to see whether or not Mr Gary Hunter can be located.  22Secondly, the position of a very experienced Crown Prosecutor is significant, though not of course determinative.  23Thirdly, I accept that there may be a degree of interrelationship between the question of the admissibility of the statements of Mr Wade Hunter and the presence or absence of Mr Gary Hunter.  It could be worthwhile to take a day or two to see whether that latter question can be clarified, rather than simply seeking to proceed on the basis of certain assumptions. 24In the circumstances, and in light of the joint position of the parties, I think it appropriate that the empanelment of the jury be adjourned from tomorrow for two days until Friday, 4 July 2014 at 10 AM.  On that day the Court will sit until 3 PM. 25Furthermore, I think it appropriate that all of the pre-trial applications proceed at 10am on Thursday, 3 July 2014.  My proposal and expectation is that by the time the Court rises on that day, all determinations necessary for the Crown to open on the following morning will have been determined by me.  26In short, I make the following orders:(1)The trial is adjourned until 10 AM on Thursday, 3 July 2014. (2)A jury panel, or panels, will be required for empanelment at 10 AM on Friday, 4 July 2014.

2704849,"DUNCAN, Paul Parepano - Application pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 847","Judgment
1This is an application pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the Act"") for the referral of a conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  The application has been made on behalf of Paul Parepano Duncan (""the applicant""). The key legislative provisions are as follows:  
78 Applications to Supreme Court
(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.
...
79 Consideration of applications
(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:
(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or
(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:
 (a) it appears that the matter:
(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or
(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under previous review provisions, or 
(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or
(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and
(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.
...

2The basis of the application is the proposition that the conduct of the trial judge resulted in the applicant not receiving a fair trial, that a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result, and that that would give rise to a ""doubt or question"" on my part as to the applicant's guilt.  In summary it is submitted that the trial judge was asleep or dozing at various times during the trial; that that conduct distracted the jury and led to them not fulfilling their role properly in the proceedings; and finally that the lawyers representing the applicant at the trial failed to address the situation adequately, with the result that it is now impossible to assess its consequences properly.
3The application consists of written submissions, prepared by Queen's Counsel for the applicant, which attach a number of annexures that seek to substantiate the asserted facts.  I did not receive a transcript of the trial in question. 4I have also received written submissions from counsel for the respondent opposing the referral.  
Chronological background
5The following is derived from the material with which I have been provided.
6On 24 March 2003 the applicant and a co-offender, Adam John Perre, were found guilty of two offences after a trial before Judge Dodd and a jury in the District Court of New South Wales. 
7The first offence was maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The applicable maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 25 years.
8The second offence was affray, contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act.  The applicable maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 5 years.
9The applicant was acquitted of two property offences.
10To state the facts of the Crown case very simply, the applicant and the co-offender were involved in a fight that erupted between two groups of young men in the vicinity of Stuart Park in Wollongong.  During the fight, a number of assailants, armed with poles, a machete, and a wheel brace attacked the victim, Christopher Wilson, resulting in his permanent disability.
11His Honour sentenced the applicant and the co-offender on 19 August 2003.  With regard to the first offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent, the applicant was sentenced to a head sentence of imprisonment for 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years, each to commence on 30 November 2002.  The head sentence was to expire on 29 November 2018, and the non-parole period was to expire on 29 November 2014.  A concurrent fixed term of 2 years was imposed for the affray.
12Both the applicant and the co-offender appealed against their convictions to the Court of Criminal Appeal, and also sought leave to appeal against sentence.  It is not necessary to canvas comprehensively the grounds of appeal against conviction relied upon by the applicant; it suffices to say that the issue of the trial judge falling asleep during the trial was not raised at all.  
13On 8 December 2004 that Court delivered its judgment: see R v Duncan and Perre [2004] NSWCCA 431.  The applicant's appeal against his convictions was dismissed.  Leave to appeal against sentence with regard to the affray was refused.  Leave to appeal against sentence with regard to the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent was granted, and the appeal was allowed.  The Court of Criminal Appeal resentenced the applicant to a head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of 9 years, each to commence on 30 November 2002.  The head sentence expires on 29 November 2015, and the non-parole period expired on 29 November 2011, on which day I understand that the applicant was released from custody.
14On 11 March 2005, a Deputy Senior Public Defender wrote to the applicant's solicitors at trial, Muggenthaler & Associates, advising that there were no reasonable prospects of success in an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia without more information about whether ""there was any adverse impact upon the fair trial of the accused"" as a result of the trial judge falling asleep.
15On an indeterminate day in April 2005, Ms Linda Machan, the mother of the applicant, made a complaint on his behalf to the Judicial Commission of New South Wales about the trial judge's conduct.  The complaint stated:
Judge Ian Dodd was appointed to preside over the trial of Paul Duncan and Adam Perre. However as Judge Dodd was [sic] constantly dozing off while the prosecution was able to influence the jury. Along with key evidence being ignored for the defence, while Paul's complaint and mine being shrugged off even though the panel of jurors were shaking the [sic] heads in disbelief at judge asleep and snoring. This was happening every day. The first time I noticed Judge Dodd asleep he had his hands clasped together on his chest and his head drooped down and I could hear him snoring so I mentioned it to Paul's barrister Linda McSpedden and solicitor Heidi Muggenthaler and Linda McSpedden said to me ""Oh yes my dear he the judge has sleep apnoea and does this all the time"", so you could imagine how I felt. The people present at court during that trial were Linda McSpedden, Heidi Muggenthaler, Leone Miller, Sheree Machan, John Perre, Renae Perre. What concerned me a great deal that when Judge Dodd was summing up, he left out any curcial [sic] evidence for the defence and when he was directing the jury he completely confused them and when the jury asked for the transcript so they could make a decision he Judge Dodd refused it to them and when he sentenced the two young men was grossley [sic] excessive.  I think every Australian is entitled to a fair trial as we are talking about peoples lives and because of Judge Dodd, this trial was never going to be fair or just therefore a miscarriage of justice. [Emphasis added]
16In April 2005, John Perre, the father of the co-offender, made a statement as part of a complaint to the Judicial Commission in which he said that he ""observed that Judge Dodd each day of the trial fell asleep for periods of time"".  Mr Perre did not say anything about the effect of that conduct upon the jury in his statement.
17On 11 May 2005, two solicitors for the co-offender at trial made statements as part of a complaint to the Judicial Commission on behalf of the co-offender.  Both solicitors noted that during the trial their attention was focused on taking note of the evidence given by witnesses.  One solicitor observed that throughout the trial ""from time to time"" the trial judge had his eyes shut, and ""his head lulled forward such that his chin was almost touching his head"".  Similarly, the other solicitor observed that the trial judge would at times close his eyes, and that on some occasions ""his head would fall forward or even to the side and rest on his shoulder"".  Neither solicitor made any observations in her statement about the effect of that conduct upon the jury.  
18On 16 May 2005, the applicant's solicitor at trial wrote to the Judicial Commission with regard to Ms Machan's complaint.  The applicant's solicitor at trial said that she ""heard, rather than observed who [she] thought to be the judge making noises that were a mixture of a snort or half choke on a couple of occasions"".  She noted that ""during trials [her] focus is mostly on the jury"", but did not record in the statement any observations regarding the jury's reaction to the conduct of the trial judge.
19Following a preliminary examination, the complaint to the Judicial Commission was classified as ""serious"" and referred to the Conduct Division for further investigation.  The Judicial Commission ceased its investigation when his Honour retired in August 2005.
20On 7 August 2006, the solicitor who had acted for the co-offender in the Court of Criminal Appeal wrote to the solicitor then acting for the applicant and the co-offender with regard to a possible appeal to the High Court.  
21The solicitor who had acted for the co-offender in the Court of Criminal Appeal explained that the issue of the judge being asleep throughout the trial did not found a ground of appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal on counsel's advice.  
22She also stated that the issue of the judge being asleep had been raised with her by both the co-offender and his father, including in writing by the latter on 1 September 2003.  That document from the father of the co-offender of 1 September 2003 did not form part of the material before me.  She went on to state that the solicitor for the applicant had told her on or about 28 August 2003 that the trial judge ""was asleep throughout much of the trial"". 
23On 11 August 2006, the solicitor then acting for the applicant and the co-offender sent a letter to senior counsel seeking advice with regard to the preparation of a petition under the Part.  The solicitor indicated that he was in possession of statements of the two solicitors, the father of the co-offender, and the mother of the applicant, as well as letters from the solicitor who had acted for the co-offender in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the solicitor who had acted for the applicant at trial.  All of the statements and letters referred to in that letter of 11 August 2006 are contained in the material before me, and have been referred to earlier in this chronological review.
24On 6 November 2008, the decision of the High Court in Cesan v The Queen; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358 was handed down.  That case concerned an appeal from a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal that dismissed an appeal against conviction founded in part on the conduct of Dodd DCJ during a different trial in June 2004.  In short, the High Court acknowledged that his Honour had been asleep from time to time during the trial, due to sleep apnoea.   The High Court also found that as a result the jury had been distracted from attending to the evidence given, thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice that necessitated the ordering of new trials.  I will return to discuss the decision of Cesan v The Queen in more detail below.
25After that decision was handed down, a number of petitions to the Governor of New South Wales for a review of the applicant's convictions were lodged on behalf of the applicant pursuant to the Act.  The key legislative provisions, which are analogous to the provisions extracted above concerning applications to the Supreme Court for an inquiry, are as follows:
76   Petitions to Governor
A petition for a review of a conviction or sentence or the exercise of the Governor's pardoning power may be made to the Governor by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.77   Consideration of petitions
(1)  After the consideration of a petition:
(a) the Governor may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or
(b) the Minister may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, or
(c) the Minister may request the Court of Criminal Appeal to give an opinion on any point arising in the case.
(2)  Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
...

26The petitions lodged on behalf of the applicant were based on the complaint that the trial judge had been asleep at various times during the applicant's trial.  They included some material to suggest that that conduct had adversely affected the juror's ability to fulfil their role.  The petitions sought to have the applicant's case referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, pursuant to s 77(1)(b) of the Act.
27On 30 November 2008 the applicant swore an affidavit.  He deposed that over the course of the trial he observed the trial judge sleeping on a number of occasions.  He also said:
""It was clear to me that the members of the jury were very much aware of these incidents as I saw them smiling, nudging each other and rolling their eyes as if it were a matter of some amusement to them.""
28On 6 February 2009 Linda Machan swore an affidavit.  Ms Machan said that she observed the trial judge sleeping on a number of occasions.  She provided two examples of times when ""the jury were distracted by the judge sleeping"", including the following:
""I distinctly remember when Detective Kelly was giving evidence, the Judge was asleep and the jury were laughing and looking at each other and shrugging their shoulders at the judge being asleep.""
She went on to say that:
""It was clear to me that the members of the jury were very much aware of These [sic] incidents as I saw them smiling, nudging each other and rolling their eyes as if it were quite funny that the judge was having a sleep.  The jury were distracted and did not pay attention to the evidence presented by witnesses ...""
29On 30 November 2009 the initial petition was lodged with the Governor.  The affidavit of the applicant of 30 November 2008 and the affidavit of Linda Machan of 6 February 2009 were lodged in support of the application.  
30In response to this petition, Michael Stollery, solicitor for the Crown at trial, provided a report dated 23 March 2010 to the Director of Public Prosecutions.   This report relevantly stated:
Having perused the trial transcript, I am unable to locate anything in the transcript, which would suggest that the trial judge was asleep during the trial.  From my recollection, I am able to say that on the number of occasions I notice [sic] the trial judge with his head down, he appeared to be dozing.  I recall making similar observations of some members of the jury and other persons in the courtroom.  At no stage during the trial did I form the view that the trial judge was asleep and not listening to the evidence.  I did not at any stage feel any sense of ""unease"" nor any ""sense of disquiet"" in relation to how the trial was conducted.
...
The weather conditions in Sydney in February are often quite oppressive - that was the case during this trial.  I recall that on a few occasions during the trial people in court occasionally 'nodded off', momentarily.  I recall the Trial judge appearing to ""nod off"" on a few occasions, some jurors, the court staff and people in the public gallery.
At no stage did I feel concerned that the trail [sic] judge was not giving the matter proper attention.
...
To the best of my recollection, the trial was well supervised by HH and was in all respects a fair trial.  I specifically recall the jury being very responsive and very attentive throughout the trial. [Emphasis added]
31The applicant was informed by letter from the Governor of 17 June 2010 that the Attorney General had recommended to her Excellency that his application for ""clemency"" be declined.   The letter advised that ""the material provided by way of support for the [application] did not justify the exercise by [the Governor] of the Royal prerogative"".
32Ms Machan responded on behalf of the applicant, and in reply received a letter from the Director General of the Department of Justice and Attorney General of 2 November 2010.  The Director General invited the applicant to provide ""additional comments"" that would be ""treated as a fresh petition to the NSW Governor"".
33On 2 November 2010, Queen's Counsel for the applicant provided additional submissions and material to the Director General of the Department of Justice and Attorney General.  The correspondence contained no further direct evidence of what occurred at the trial.  The petition was again based on the conduct of the trial judge.  
34The applicant was advised by letter of 25 March 2011 that the Attorney General had declined to refer the applicant's case to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The position was confirmed by a further letter, seemingly of 15 June 2011, responding to a request by Queen's Counsel for the applicant that the newly appointed Attorney General reconsider the petition.  The further and final letter stated:
""The Attorney General was satisfied that the consequences of the judge's sleeping must be clear before the matter could be referred back to the Court.  The fact of the sleeping was not sufficient to raise the necessary doubts about the conviction which must be present if the Attorney General is to intervene.""
35On 18 June 2012 the applicant sought special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of 8 December 2004 to the High Court.  The application for special leave was based on the allegation that the trial judge was asleep from time to time during the trial.  The application was dismissed on the papers on 12 December 2012.  The High Court accepted the submission of the Crown that there was no evidence before the Court to support the allegation that the trial judge was asleep: Duncan v The Queen [2012] HCASL 195.
Applicant's submissions
36Queen's Counsel for the applicant submitted that the conduct of the trial judge, the distraction this conduct created for the jury, and the failings of the lawyers involved in both the trial and the appeal, meant that the applicant did not receive a fair trial.  Having already appealed his convictions to the Court of Criminal Appeal on other grounds, and made an unsuccessful application for special leave to the High Court, the applicant has exhausted his avenues of appeal.  And yet, Queen's Counsel submitted, in light of the potential deficiencies in the applicant's trial, there is a real question about the soundness of the convictions recorded against him.
37The written submissions of Queen's Counsel for the applicant made a number of allegations of fact in support of the application for an inquiry.  These allegations are said to be substantiated by specific evidentiary material, including the:
(a)correspondence relating to the complaint made to the Judicial Commission in 2005;
(b)correspondence and other materials relating to the petitions made to the Governor between 2009 and 2011;
(c)affidavits, statements and reports of persons involved in the trial before his Honour;
(d)medical reports and articles about sleep apnoea; and
(e)the summaries of argument relied upon by both parties in the application for special leave to appeal to the High Court.
38He submitted that, in light of the fact that the applicant's appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was on different, unrelated grounds, and the application for special leave to the High Court was refused on the basis of there being no evidence of the matters that founded the application, no court has previously considered the evidentiary material that supports this application.  
39The submissions on behalf of the applicant emphasised that it is the failings of the lawyers involved in the trial process, rather than the conduct of the trial judge, that form the basis of this application.  Queen's Counsel for the applicant conceded that, following the decision of the High Court in Cesan v The Queen, the consequences of the trial judge sleeping must be tolerably clear.  He submitted that it follows that when the propriety of a trial is compromised by the inattention of the trial judge, the lawyers involved have an obligation or duty to ensure that any consequences of that inattention are appropriately addressed. He drew attention to discussion of that obligation or duty by French CJ in Cesan v The Queen at [93].  He submitted that, at the very least, this duty required that the lawyers involved in the trial make a note or some other record of the trial judge's conduct.  
40Queen's Counsel for the applicant submitted that the failure of the lawyers involved in the trial process to record adequately the consequences of the trial judge's conduct means that those consequences cannot now be properly assessed.  He submitted that the fact that there is no reference in the transcript to the trial judge sleeping, nor any contemporaneous evidence from the lawyers involved in the trial process regarding the trial judge sleeping, supports his submission that the applicant did not receive a fair trial.  
41He similarly submitted that the lawyers involved in the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal failed in their duty and obligation to the court by not raising the trial judge's conduct and its effect on the attention of the jury as a ground of appeal.  He submitted that, as a result, the appeal court was deprived of relevant information concerning the conduct of the trial judge and its consequences, and that the applicant was therefore deprived of a fair appeal hearing.
42In short, Queen's Counsel for the applicant submitted that I would experience a doubt or question as to the applicant's guilt, founded upon the proposition that the failings of the lawyers involved in the trial and appeal process mean that the consequences of the trial judge sleeping during the trial cannot be adequately assessed, and the applicant's trial therefore constituted a miscarriage of justice.
Respondent's submissions
43Counsel for the respondent submitted that there was insufficient evidence to support the factual allegations made.  He submitted that I would not be satisfied that the trial judge was asleep, except for fleeting periods.  He also submitted that there is no reliable evidence that any such conduct affected the jury adversely; as a result, I would not experience a ""doubt or question"" about the guilt of the applicant.  
44He drew my attention to the emphasis that the High Court placed on evidence of the jury being distracted in Cesan v The Queen.  He also referred to this Court's consideration of Part 7 of the Act in Application of Peter James Holland [2008] NSWSC 251 at [8], where Johnson J noted that:
""There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet.""
45In support of this submission, counsel for the respondent noted that the petitions previously lodged on behalf of the applicant and the application for special leave to appeal to the High Court were rejected because there was insufficient or no evidence to support the submissions made on behalf of the applicant.  He submitted that no additional evidence has been presented in support of this application.  He placed particular emphasis on the fact that there was no evidence from counsel or solicitors who appeared for the applicant at trial as to the timing, extent, and frequency of the trial judge sleeping.
46Further, counsel for the respondent submitted that the bulk of the evidence post-dates the decision in Cesan v The Queen, thereby sharply calling into question its probative value.   In other words, he submitted that one would reflect upon the possibility that the evidence filed after 6 November 2008 has been tailored in an attempt to bring the matter within the principles enunciated in that decision.
47Counsel for the respondent acknowledged that the emphasis of this application is different from that of the previous two petitions, in that it focuses on the alleged incompetence of the lawyers involved in the trial and appeal, rather than the conduct of the trial judge. However, he submitted that, as there is no sufficient evidentiary basis for acceptance of the proposition that the trial judge was asleep, submissions with regard to whether the lawyers in the trial and appeal failed to act appropriately are not to the point.
48Finally, counsel for the respondent submitted that I may exercise my discretion pursuant to s 79(3)(a)(ii) to dismiss the application, as two petitions have previously been rejected pursuant to Part 7 of the Act.
Determination 
49The first question is whether an application founded upon alleged failings in the process leading to conviction, as opposed to upon a question of guilt itself, can be made pursuant to s 78 of the Act.  
50The recent decision of Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales   [2013] NSWCA 383 establishes that, in the context of an application such as this, ""any [...] matter upon which a finding of guilt is dependent"" can properly form the basis of a ""doubt or question as to the convicted persons guilt"": at [27] and [30] - [31].  The requisite ""doubt or question"" can arise from any aspect of the process of finding guilt: see also Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [135] and [138].  Accordingly, I consider that a question as to whether an applicant's trial was a miscarriage of justice (as opposed to a question of the actual guilt or innocence of the applicant) can properly form the basis of a referral.    51The second question is the approach I should adopt to the test in Part 7 of the Act.  
52The Court of Appeal discussed the test to be applied in determining inquiries made to the Supreme Court in Varley v Attorney General (NSW)(1987) 8 NSWLR 30.  In that decision it was said at 48:
""To initiate an inquiry in the present case, a doubt must arise as to the guilt of the plaintiff. This doubt need not be shown to the satisfaction of the Governor or the Court to be well-founded; that is a matter for the inquiry.""
53The requisite ""doubt or question"" was described as a feeling of ""unease"": at 48.
54The principles applicable to an application under s 79 of the Act were discussed more recently by Johnson J in Application of Peter James Holland at [6]-[9].  These passages were referred to with approval by RA Hulme J in Application by Robert Roberti pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2014] NSWSC 683.  Johnson J said:
""[6] The test is whether it appears that there is a doubt or question as to guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case: s.79(2). With respect to repealed s.475 Crimes Act 1900 (which used similar words), it was said that this view may be formed where the material causes the person considering the matter unease or a sense of disquiet in allowing the conviction or sentence to stand: Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48; Application of Rendell (1987) 32 A Crim R 243 at 245. This formula has been applied since the repeal of s.475 and its replacement by the provisions now contained in s.79(2): Application of Pedrana (2000) 117 A Crim R 45 at 463 [28]; Application of Suey [2001] NSWSC 543 at [18].
[7] Where it is contended that a doubt or question exists concerning part of the evidence in the case, it is appropriate to consider whether any doubt or question about that part of the evidence produces a doubt or question as to guilt: Application of Moore [2000] NSWSC 364; (2000) 112 A Crim R 331 at 332 [6]. The section is to apply to a part of the evidence which has some real material substance as effecting the conclusion of guilt: Application of Suey at [19]
[8] There has to be available material which, as a matter of practical reality, gives rise to a relevant sense of unease or disquiet: Application of Esposito (Hunt J, 14 July 1988, unreported at page 2); Application of Visser (Newman J, 27 June 1994, BC9402667 at page 3); Application of Dunn [2005] NSWSC 857 at 
Some Other Features of the Jurisdiction
[9] The procedure under s.78 is not intended to provide a convicted person with yet another avenue of appeal after the usual avenues have been exhausted: Application of Dunn at [9]; Application of Milat [2005] NSWSC 920; (2005) 157 A Crim R 565 at 574 [26]. Nor is it an opportunity, in a sense, to run the trial again on paper, with the ultimate submission that acquittal should result.""
55I approach the question in accordance with the principles contained in these passages.
56The third question is what is the precise subject matter about which the evidence and submissions need to establish a feeling of unease on my part.  In order to answer that question, it is necessary to discuss the legal principles in more detail.
57The High Court in Cesan v The Queen considered an appeal based on the allegation that a trial judge slept intermittently throughout a trial by jury.  French CJ considered whether inattention by the trial judge could constitute a miscarriage of justice for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  His Honour said at [93]:
If, by reason of sleep episodes or serious inattention, the reality or the appearance exists that a trial judge has substantially failed to discharge his or her duty of supervision and control of the trial process in a trial by jury, then enough has been made out to establish a miscarriage of justice. The question whether there has been the reality or appearance of a substantial failure by the judge to perform his or her duty will require assessment of a number of factors including: 1. Whether the conduct of the judge can be said to have affected the outcome of the trial. 2. Whether the conduct of the judge has created a risk that the outcome of the trial may have been affected. 3. Whether counsel raised the question of the trial judge's conduct at the trial. 4. Whether the jury appeared to have noticed or to have been distracted or otherwise affected by the judge's conduct. None of these factors, taken by itself, is determinative. There is an overall assessment to be made in deciding whether a failure or apparent failure by the judge for whatever reason to attend to the dutyof supervising and controlling the trial process amounts to a miscarriage of justice. In so saying it should be emphasised that the duty of counsel in a case of non-trivial inattention or sleep episodes is to draw these issues to the attention of the judge in the absence of the jury. The failure of counsel to do so may support an inference that the judge's conduct did not amount to a substantial failure in the judicial process at trial. However, it will not always be determinative.
58French CJ went on to consider whether it could be said that ""no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred"" for the purposes of applying the proviso to s 6(1), drawing attention to the fact that the ""judge's conduct had a discernible distracting effect on the jury"": at [67].  
59The reasons of Gummow J, and those of Hayne, Krennan and Kiefel JJ, similarly emphasise that it was the ""consequences of the trial judge falling asleep"" - namely the fact that it distracted the jurors and thereby detracted from their ability to properly discharge their function - that meant that it was not possible to conclude that no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred: Gummow J at [105]; Hayne, Krennan and Kiefel JJ at [112], [119]-[120] and [127].
60In short, I consider that, in order to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal, I would need to experience a feeling of unease not only about whether the trial judge was asleep during substantial portions of the trial, but also about whether that distracted the jury from proper fulfilment of its role, thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice.  
61The fourth question is whether the evidence and submissions have that effect upon me.
62On all of the evidence placed before me, I experience a real doubt about whether the trial judge was asleep during extended periods of the trial.  Quite apart from anything else, there is evidence that comment and complaint about that topic was made by a number of persons years before the decision in Cesan v The Queen was handed down.  As my chronological review shows, those persons include the mother of the applicant, the father of the co-offender, and three solicitors.  As for the countervailing material, it is not a matter of me rejecting the report of the solicitor for the Crown at trial; it is merely a matter of me experiencing a sense of unease.  
63As for the question of effect on the trial in general and the jury in particular, I respectfully reject the submission of the applicant that the fact that his lawyers did not take steps at trial or on appeal to remedy the effects of the trial judge sleeping on the trial as a whole itself establishes that the trial miscarried in a way that should lead to referral.  To my mind, that reasoning presupposes that any such sleeping had the effect for which the applicant contends; and yet whether it did or not is the question under consideration.  I respectfully consider that this submission of the applicant reveals circular reasoning.
64I turn now to the question of whether my doubt about whether the trial judge was asleep for substantial portions of the trial leads me also to experience a feeling of unease about whether that could have adversely affected the jury sufficiently to constitute a miscarriage of justice.  In doing so, I appreciate that that was not the main thrust of the submissions of the applicant.  Nonetheless, I consider that the question arises from the totality of the material placed before me.
65It is true that the evidence of the sleeping of the trial judge having an adverse effect upon the jury and the trial as a whole is relatively sparse.  Nevertheless, I have come to experience a feeling of unease about whether, in this trial, that occurred.  That is so for a number of reasons. 
66First, both the applicant and his mother have sworn affidavits to that effect.  True it is that that occurred in the months after the decision in Cesan v The Queen was handed down.  That leads me to accord them less weight; in the absence of cross-examination, I do not discount them entirely.
67Secondly, it is true that many of the statements of persons who attended at the trial focus on the behaviour of the trial judge and not its effects on the jury.  But that is hardly surprising.  The phenomenon of a sleeping judge is liable to make an immediate impression on an interested observer; its effects, less so.  Furthermore, until the crucial judgment was handed down by the High Court, few would have had the perspicacity to appreciate that it is not the sleeping of the judge that could undermine the trial, but rather its effects upon the jury.
68Thirdly, the fact that the transcript apparently reveals neither the conduct of the judge nor any effects on the jury is hardly surprising.  One can understand the reticence of counsel in raising such a matter; the fact that it was not done tells against the application but it is not determinative.  As for distraction or worse on the part of the jury, to my mind it is quite possible for those phenomena not to be reflected in the transcript, especially if the judge was asleep during them. 
69Fourthly, it is not the case that there is no evidence of the effects on the jury and on the trial resulting from sleeping on the part of the trial judge.  In that respect, this application can be sharply contrasted to the application considered in the recent refusal to refer a matter in Application by Robert Roberti at [49]-[51] and [55].  In contrast to that case, in which the only affidavit evidence for the proposition that the jury was adversely affected was contained in an affidavit of the applicant sworn years after the judgement in Cesan v the Queen was handed down, here, as I have demonstrated, the mother of the applicant complained to the Judicial Commission of that very phenomenon years before the delivery of that judgment.  And the subsequent material from the solicitor for the Crown at trial, whilst in general speaking against the application, provides some support for it, in that it speaks of jurors appearing to be ""dozing"" during the trial.
70Fifthly, I know from experience as both counsel and judge the importance in any proceedings of the tone set and atmosphere created by the trial judge in the courtroom.  That is especially the case in trial by jury, which involves the sudden and intense exposure of a group of laypersons to the criminal justice system.  Relying on that general experience, and experiencing as I do a doubt about the possibility that the trial judge was sleeping on a significant number of occasions throughout the trial, I experience a feeling of unease about the fact that it could very well have affected the jury's concentration upon and commitment to its task. 
71In short, I have a feeling of unease not only about whether the trial judge was sleeping.  I also have a feeling of unease about whether that affected the trial in a way that could constitute a miscarriage of justice.  Accordingly, save for any discretionary considerations, the statute requires me to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
72That fifth and final question calls for a consideration of the factors contained in s 79(3) of the Act, and discretionary matters generally.
73As for s 79(3)(a) of the Act, it is true that the matter has been dealt with repeatedly under Part 7 of the Act, by way of the various petitions that have been rejected: see s 79(3)(a)(ii).  
74In light of the chequered forensic history of the matter, it cannot be said that the matter giving rise to the application has been ""fully dealt with"" either at first instance, in the Court of Criminal Appeal, or in the High Court: see s 79(3)(a)(i).  Nor can it be said that no appeal founded on the ""matter"" has been made, or that any appeal has been withdrawn or allowed to lapse: see ss 79(3)(a)(iii) and (iv) of the Act.  To the contrary, once special leave was refused the applicant had exhausted all of his rights of appeal.
75As for s 79(3)(b), I consider that it could be said that there are special facts and circumstances that justify the taking of further action.  I have a doubt about whether the trial judge was asleep during significant portions of a trial by jury for a very grave criminal offence.  The conviction led to the applicant spending years of his life in gaol, and bearing a permanent stain on his character.  It could be that the lawyers for the applicant felt that nothing could or should be done at first instance.  Nor, it seems, was it truly appreciated by all of the lawyers involved, before Cesan v The Queen, that a sleeping judge and its effect could found a ground of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The foundation of the special leave application was, as one would expect in light of the circumscription of foregoing proceedings, unsupported by evidence: see Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259 at 265-271, 297-299; Eastman v The Queen [2000] HCA 29; 203 CLR 1.  The net result is that the crucial question has never been placed before a court.  Finally, I consider that the phenomenon of a judge sleeping in a trial by jury is thankfully sufficiently rare for it to be regarded as ""special"".
76But in any event, the combined operation of s 79(3)(a)(ii) and (b) does not require deep analysis.  That is because whether the application should be refused remains a matter for my discretion, as can be seen from the use of the word ""may"" in the chapeaux of s 79(3).  
77I have come to a different view of the evidence from those who assessed it previously pursuant to Part 7 of the Act.  I experience a sense of unease as to whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice in the trial of an extremely serious crime that lead to the applicant spending years in gaol.  In those circumstances, even if I were satisfied of the matters contained in s 79(3)(a)(iii) and (b), I would be very loath to refuse to consider or otherwise deal with the matter.  I do not propose to exercise my discretion, pursuant to the s 79(3), to decline to refer the matter.  Nor do I consider that there is any other discretionary basis on which I should decline the relief sought.
78The statute therefore calls upon me to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
Conclusion
79I emphasise that, of course, I have not come to any view as to whether the appeal against conviction will or even may succeed in the Court of Criminal Appeal: see Varley v Attorney General (NSW) at 48, extracted above at [52].  No doubt the reconstruction of precisely what occurred in the trial many years after the event will be very difficult indeed.  However, all the statute calls upon me to determine is whether I experience a sense of unease with regard to the guilt of the applicant, in the sense of whether the proceedings that led to the conviction of the applicant may have constituted a miscarriage of justice.  For the reasons that I have explained, I have come to possess that state of mind.
Order
(1)Pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal And Review) Act 2001, the whole case is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal against conviction under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

Count 2 - Supply a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely cocaine (1000.8 grams), contrary to s25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life and which carries a standard non-parole period of 15 years.
2There was a Form 1 matter of supplying an indictable quantity of a prohibited drug, namely Methorphan, taken into account on sentence for count 2.
3The sentences imposed by Blackmore SC DCJ were:
Count 1 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years, commencing 17 February 2002 and expiring 16 February 2013 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 16 February 2017.
Count 2 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing 17 February 2013 and expiring 16 February 2020 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 16 February 2024.
4The total effective sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years and a balance of term of 4 years, such sentence to commence 17 February 2012 and expire 16 February 2024.
Factual Background
5Strike Force Bootleg was established by the Regional Enforcement Squad Surry Hills to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs by Le Vuong and her associates, Huy Thanh, Fong Dang and Thanh Li.  A warrant was granted to authorise an undercover operative (UCO),  to be supplied with prohibited drugs by those offenders.  Five different telephone services used by Vuong were monitored.  The communications showed that Vuong was using coded conversations with the applicant to source and supply prohibited drugs, namely MDMA, on 2 February 2012.
6From 23 January 2012 the UCO established telephone contact with Vuong who advised that she had quantities of ecstasy tablets available for purchase.  On 31 January 2012 Vuong telephoned the applicant and discussed obtaining ""lollies"" (MDMA) for the UCO.  On 1 February 2012 Vuong telephoned the applicant to order 1000 ""eggs"" for the next day and asked about sourcing 500 eggs for the Friday.
7On 2 February 2012 Vuong telephoned the applicant to ask if he had prepared ""one"" egg.  The applicant advised Vuong that the source had to travel some distance and that overseas stock was too expensive.  In a later conversation the applicant and Vuong agreed on the price of $11 per tablet and they made arrangements for the supply to take place that day.
8Later that day, the UCO was supplied with 1,058 ecstasy tablets by Vuong, the applicant and Dang.  The price paid was $13,500.  The tablets were analysed to be 229.2 grams of MDMA with a purity of 4 - 17 percent.  The UCO was also given a small sample of cocaine by Vuong.
9These were the circumstances of the offence in count 1.
10On 7 February 2012 Vuong told the UCO by telephone that she could supply her with one kilogram of cocaine.  They met the following day and discussed the purchase of the one kilogram of cocaine and 1000 ecstasy tablets.  The UCO said that she could buy the drugs on Friday, 17 February 2012 if the price were right.  
11Between 8 February and 17 February 2012 there was considerable communication between Vuong and the applicant via telephone and SMS.  On 16 February 2012 the applicant told Vuong that he did not have ""the stuff"" because he was waiting for a telephone call.  Later that night, the applicant confirmed ""everything is good I have some - I have SMS you already both can be delivered"".  The applicant told Vuong that he could not promise that the supply could be organised by 8am ""but I will try my best"".  The price discussed for the kilogram of cocaine was between $235,000 and $245,000.
12On 17 February 2012 numerous calls and text messages were exchanged between Vuong and the applicant to arrange the supply of the ecstasy tablets and the one kilogram of cocaine.  At 11am Vuong got into the applicant's car in Bankstown and they drove to the Pyrmont area.  They entered the UCO's hotel room in Pyrmont.  After the UCO showed the applicant and Vuong $13,350 in cash, the applicant said to a person on the telephone ""I've checked the paperwork it's all there, yeah quickly all right"".  Vuong told the applicant to hurry up the supplier.  The applicant told the UCO ""I go get egg, I go get egg"" then left the hotel room.
13At 12.10pm the applicant returned to the hotel room with a large open bag of chips, containing a resealable bag of tablets.  He handed this bag to the UCO saying that there were 550 tablets inside.  The bag contained 483 tablets analysed to be 134.6 grams of Methorphan.  This is the offence on the Form 1.
14At 12.42pm Vuong and the applicant left the hotel room.  At 1.31am Vuong returned and told the UCO that there was a delay due to one of the supplier's car having a flat tyre.  The applicant met Dang and Li a short distance away from the hotel.  Dang carried a McDonalds bag as he walked to meet the applicant and Li.
15At 1.42pm the applicant, Dang and Li entered the hotel room.  The McDonalds bag was placed on a table in the lounge room.  Vuong unpacked the McDonalds bag and told Dang and Li to leave the room.  The McDonalds bag contained two heat-sealed plastic bags containing powder.  This powder was later analysed and found to be 1000.8 grams of cocaine with a purity of 63 percent.
16At 1.45pm police entered the hotel room and arrested Vuong and the applicant.  Dang and Li were also arrested.  These were the circumstances of the offence in count 2.
Sentence proceedings
17In relation to objective seriousness, his Honour said:
""The facts reveal a very serious case of drug dealing to a substantial extent.  The Courts have maintained a consistent approach providing condign sentences for such cases.  The seriousness of the offending can also be gauged by the maximum penalties attaching to their commission.  In relation to the offence of supplying a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs the penalty that attaches is the highest possible maximum penalty that the law provides.  When the facts of each of the cases are addressed individually in my view neither could be said to fall within the middle range of objective seriousness and standard non-parole period need not be applied.  In each case the offenders have pleaded guilty.  Having said that the standard non parole periods remain a guide to the sort of penalties that should be applied.""  (ROS 10.4)
18His Honour assessed the position of Vuong and Pham in the distribution hierarchy as being similar and significant, although their roles were different.  His Honour noted that while Pham might have been closer to the original supplier, he was not the supplier.  His Honour saw Vuong as the person who was obtaining the customers and in a sense, taking more direct risks.  He assessed the level of participation of both as being within the middle range.  His Honour said:
""Because Pham appears to be closer to the ultimate supplier he might be regarded as having a more significant role, but the differences in their roles are not very great.""  (ROS 11.1)
19In relation to the applicant's subjective case, his Honour noted that he had a relatively minor criminal record.  He was aged 39, came from Vietnam and was married with four children.  He and his family escaped Vietnam and were in a refugee camp in Thailand for a number of years before coming to Australia.  Two of his children suffered from autism, one quite seriously.
20The applicant had developed a serious drug addiction and was also abusing alcohol.  At the time of the offending, the applicant was living separately from his wife.  Despite this, the couple appeared to run a successful business at the Flemington Markets where they had a stall.  This business provided financially for the couple and their children.
21His Honour rejected the proposition that the applicant's family background demonstrated extraordinary hardship, thereby requiring a moderation in his sentence.  His Honour was prepared, however, to take the hardship into account but not on the basis that it was extraordinary.
22Despite some depression and his alcohol and drug dependency, his Honour formed the opinion that the applicant had been reasonably successful in that he had always worked, adequately provided for his family and maintained a successful business.  For those reasons, his Honour found that his prospects of rehabilitation were very good.  By reason of the hardship aspects of the applicant's subjective case, his Honour was prepared to find special circumstances.
23The applicant received a discount of 25 percent for his plea of guilty.  In relation to his Honour's start point for sentencing, his Honour said:
""Given the seriousness of the offending had these cases gone to trial and both the offenders been convicted then paying due regard to their respective roles and the subjective circumstances attaching to each a sentence of at least sixteen years of imprisonment would have applied in each case.""  (ROS 13.9)
24Before passing sentence, his Honour said:
""The offences in reality form part of one business of drug dealing.  In that regard the sentences to be imposed can be largely concurrent.  In as much as I have not referred to in detail to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the factors outlined therein, I note that I have taken those factors into account on sentence.  I have also taken the standard non-parole periods into account in setting a sentence.""  (ROS 14.3)
APPEAL
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in accepting as providing appropriate comparable sentences those the subject of two decisions of this Court given prior to the High Court decision in Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.
25The applicant submitted that because his Honour did not explain how he arrived at an ""overall"" sentence of 16 years as a start point, he must have relied upon two decision to which he was referred in argument which were Ly v R [2008] NSWCCA 262 and Efstathiadis v R [2009] NSWCCA 319.  The applicant submitted that the Crown had placed reliance on those cases in both written and oral submissions and that they were the only cases to which the Crown specifically referred.
26The applicant submitted that nowhere in submissions, either from the Crown or defence, was it pointed out that these cases were decided before the High Court decision in Muldrock and were therefore potentially infected by error.  The applicant submitted that an examination of Ly showed that the outcome was heavily influenced by an erroneous view of the application of the standard non-parole provisions.  The applicant submitted that there was the same erroneous emphasis in Efstathiadis.
27The applicant submitted that having regard to the erroneous reasoning in those cases, it was not appropriate to rely on their outcomes as providing an appropriate range for this case.  The applicant queried whether, in any event, it was appropriate to consider such a limited number of cases in this way when seeking to establish an appropriate range of sentencing.  The applicant referred to R v Ehrlich [2012] NSWCCA 38 where Adams J observed (at [50]) that because the cases he had reviewed were pre-Muldrock and therefore decided by reference to principles subsequently found to be erroneous, ""the resulting sentences must therefore be treated with more than usual caution"".  The applicant submitted that while Adams J was not supported in that expression of opinion by the other judges, his observation was plainly correct.
28The applicant submitted that the erroneous reliance upon Ly and Efstathiadis was sufficient to establish the first ground of appeal and accordingly this Court was able to re-sentence without the need for him to establish the second ground of appeal.
Consideration
29This ground of appeal is bold.  It seeks to argue that in some unspecified way, the exercise of the sentencing discretion by the primary judge was infected by Muldrock error.  It does so not by reference to what the primary judge said in his sentence judgment but because he may have had in mind the sentences imposed in Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R when sentencing in this case.  This ground of appeal is without foundation and should be rejected.
30At no stage in his judgment did the primary judge refer to the decisions in Efstathiadis v R or Ly v R.  The sentence proceedings were heard over a number of days.  On the first day, the primary judge raised with counsel that given the very serious series of offences, it was a possibility that his client could receive a non-parole period exceeding 10 years.  On 7 June 2013 when the matter was next before the court, the Crown provided brief written submissions to the primary judge which for the first time referred to the decisions in Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R.  In the course of an exchange with both counsel for the defence on that day, his Honour accepted that there were aspects which distinguished those cases from the case before him.
31The fact that there was no reference to either case in the sentence judgment is consistent with his Honour not finding either to be particularly persuasive or relevant.  In that regard, the observation by Spigelman CJ (with whom Grove J and Smart AJ agreed) in Regina v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348 is pertinent:
""47 This is a reference to some observations made by his Honour in the course of argument.  Those particular observations are not repeated in his remarks on sentence.  The particular matters do not appear to have been taken into account in any adverse way.  A trial judge is entitled to put propositions during the course of argument and to modify those propositions, either as a result of submissions or in the light of further consideration of the relevant material.""
32It has not been suggested, nor could it be, that the primary judge gave the standard non-parole period primary or determinative significance in the formulation of sentence nor did his Honour adopt a two stage approach.  
33In any event, simply demonstrating that a sentencing judge followed R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 before the decision in Muldrock will not of itself be sufficient to demonstrate error (Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30]; Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 at [26]).  The critical issue is whether, guided by the jurisprudence before Muldrock, the primary judge used the standard non-parole period as a mandatory starting point or gave it determinative significance.
34Finally, it is by no means clear that the decisions in Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R were affected by Muldrock error.  In Ly Hislop J (with whom Beazley JA and Harrison J agreed) when dismissing an applicant's appeal against sentence said:
""31 In the end result, the non parole period imposed was 8 years, reflecting a starting point before the discount for the plea of 25 percent of 10 years and 8 months compared to the 15 year standard non parole period.  The applicant also received a finding of special circumstances and the non parole period was 66.7 percent of the total term.  There was therefore a clear allowance made for the applicant's subjective features, including his plea.""
35The mere reference to the standard non parole period is not indicative of error, particularly as occurred in Ly, Hislop J was using it as a guidepost or reference point.
36In Efstathiadis v R, McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Howie and Fullerton JJ agreed) said:
""19 The applicant's submissions are not entirely clear. The written submissions are not entirely clear and it may be that there is confusion between the non-parole period and the total term. A submission was made that the starting point for the overall sentence which, having regard to the discount for the plea, must have been 15 years and 6 months, is greater than the standard non-parole period of 15 years. His Honour actually set a non-parole period of 10 years which is 66% of the standard period. Having regard to his Honour's finding as to the objective seriousness of the offence, the time of the guilty plea and the lack of positive matters in the applicant's subjective circumstances, the non-parole period which his Honour imposed was within the available range.""
37That review of factors in the case does not reveal Muldrock error.  There is a reference to the standard non parole period, but not in an impermissible way.
38It follows that even if his Honour had relied in whole or in part on Efstathiadis v R and Ly v R, that was not indicative of error.  It is a well known fact to which the High Court adverted in Muldrock, that after the commencement of standard non-parole periods, sentences generally were likely to increase.  The cautionary warning by Adams J in Ehrlich, given the purpose of his Honour's analysis in that case, does not mean that cases decided after Way but before Muldrock should not be taken into account in post Muldrock sentence proceedings.
Ground 2 - The sentences are manifestly excessive.
39The applicant noted that in terms of culpability there were two actual supply offences.  The first was 299.2 grams of MDMA, being a commercial quantity of that drug (.125 kgs is a commercial quantity).  The second offence was 1000.8 grams of cocaine being a large commercial quantity of that drug (1 kg is a large commercial quantity).  The applicant submitted that in terms of quantum the amount of the first offence was mid way between a commercial and large quantity and the amount in the second offence was just over the large commercial quantity threshold.  The applicant noted that the primary judge found that the offending did not fall within the midrange of objective seriousness, but below that level.
40The applicant relied upon what he said was a strong subjective case, i.e. a relatively minor criminal record, a serious drug and alcohol addiction, very good prospects of rehabilitation, four children of whom two were autistic, and that the needs of those children would have to be met by the applicant's wife while he was in prison.
41The applicant submitted that so far as a range could be ascertained from more recent decisions, those cases did not support the existence of a range which would allow the sentences here to be regarded as the product of a legitimate exercise of the sentencing discretion.  In support of that proposition, the applicant referred to the decisions of Wienand v R [2013] NSWCCA 202 and Hill v R [2012] NSWCCA 265.  In Wienand the drug was methylamphetamine and the amount was 1848 grams.  The starting point for the sentence was 10 years and 8 months with a non parole period of 7 years and 4 months.  After adjustment for the early plea of guilty, the sentence was 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.
42Hill was a co-offender of Wienand.  In the District Court the start point was 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.  After adjustment for the guilty plea (25 percent) and for past and future assistance (25 percent) the sentence became 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.  On appeal that sentence was reduced to 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.
43The applicant relied upon Ehrlich where the quantity of methylamphetamine was 1.615 kgs and where the offender was sentenced after a combined discount of 35 percent to an overall term of 6 years and 6 months with a non parole period of 4 years and 10 months.
44Other cases relied upon by the applicant were Lipton v R [2010] NSWCCA 175 and Parris v R [2013] NSWCCA 5.  Although Lipton came before the Court of Criminal Appeal on a different point, in the District Court the offender was sentenced for two offences, i.e. a large commercial quantity of cocaine (1.09 kgs) and a large commercial quantity of MDMA (.58 kgs).  There was a 25 percent discount for a plea of guilty and culpability was reduced by the activities of an undercover officer luring him into a bigger league than that in which he had previously been involved.  The sentences were a non parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 3 ½ years for the first count and a non parole period of 3 years on the second count, with a balance of term of 2 years.  The second sentence commenced 6 months before the first, making for an overall non parole period of 4 ½ years with a balance of term of 3 ½ years.
45The applicant submitted that those sentences suggested a range for this level of offender appreciably below that imposed in this case and substantiated the proposition that the sentence imposed here was manifestly excessive.
Consideration
46The decision in Wienand provides little assistance.  The focus in that case was on the issue of parity.  There were four separate acts of supply between 4 November 2010 and 2 December 2010 which were charged as a single count of supplying a large commercial quantity.  To the extent that the court turned its attention to the adequacy of the sentence imposed, it did no more than find that the sentence was not manifestly excessive.  It said nothing about the extent to which the sentence indicated a range.  The matter of Hill depended very much upon its own facts.  It was the element of coercion in his subjective case which led to the significant reduction in his sentence.  
47Having taken into account the reservation suggested by Adams J to the decisions in Ly v R and Efstathiadis v R (Muldrock error not having been identified in those cases), they are of some assistance.  In Ly the quantity of drug was 1101 grams of methylamphetamine with three offences of goods in custody being taken into account on a Form 1.  There was no evidence of the position occupied by Mr Ly in the supply organisation.  He pleaded guilty and the details of the sentence imposed on him have already been set out (see [34] hereof).
48In Efstathiadis v R the quantity of drug was 1.9 kgs of methylamphetamine with a plea of guilty that was not entered at the earliest opportunity.  While the offender was clearly a drug supplier, his position in the supply organisation could not be identified.  The sentence imposed has already been referred to (see [36] hereof).
49In both cases the sentences were within a range similar to that imposed on the applicant.  While the quantity of drug in each case was larger, each of Ly and Efstathiadis was involved in a single supply whereas the applicant was involved in two supplies.  Unlike Ly and Efstathiadis the applicant's position in the drug supply hierarchy was known in that he was dealing more directly with the ultimate supplier than was his co-offender Vuong.
50The Crown identified a number of cases involving the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug which had been decided by this Court after Muldrock.  It dealt with four cases in considerable detail and then provided a schedule of a further 10 cases which came within the same category.  The purpose of that analysis was to demonstrate that to the extent that there was a range of sentences, which could be imposed for this kind of offence, the sentence imposed on this applicant was not outside that range.
51A case considered in some detail was Paxton v R [2011] NSWCCA 242.  The applicant had a similar subjective case without the element of hardship.  He pleaded guilty to three counts of supply and one count of receiving stolen goods.  The quantity of drugs was significantly higher than the amount in this case, i.e. 8.467 kg of MDMA, 2.314 kg of methylamphetamine and 335.3 g of cocaine.  He was a dealer in a variety of drugs for financial gain.  
52His sentence for the supply of cocaine is of some assistance in that he was sentenced to imprisonment with a non parole period of 6 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 2 months.  Although his precise position in the drug supply hierarchy was not identified, he appears to have been a much larger supplier than was the applicant.  However, his sentence was also commensurately larger, i.e. 13 years non parole with a balance of term of 6 years for the MDMA supply and 12 years non parole with a balance of term of 4 years for the methylamphetamine supply.  His total effective sentence imposed following the appeal was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 21 years with a balance of term of 7 years.
53In Aoun v R [2011] NSWCCA 284 the applicant had a strong subjective case.  His offending was not isolated and he was involved in a commercial supply of drugs for profit.  In relation to the supply of a large commercial quantity of MDMA (3.36 kg) he was sentenced to imprisonment with a non parole period of 7 years with a balance of term of 5 years.  For the supply of not less than a commercial quantity of cocaine (989.6 g) he was sentenced to imprisonment with a 7 year non parole period and a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months.
54In Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 the offender had been supplying drugs to a drug network in northern NSW over a period of almost a year.  She was involved in what was described as a high level sophisticated criminal organisation.  Over that period, she had supplied in total over 1 kg of heroin and 1 kg of methylamphetamine.  In relation to the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of heroin, she was sentenced to a non parole period of 10 years 6 months with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months and for the supply not less than a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine she was sentenced to a non parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 3 years.
55In Hsu v R [2012] NSWCCA 248 the applicant had a very difficult upbringing and had been a drug addict since his teens.  He was supplying drugs to two suppliers over a period of just over 3 weeks.  He supplied 732.4 grams of MDMA.  His position was characterised as that of a facilitator or commission agent.  His offence was determined to be slightly below the middle range of objective seriousness.  For the count of supply not less than a large commercial quantity of MDMA, he received a sentence with a non-parole period of 10 years with a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months.
56What is clear from those cases and the cases on the schedule is that the factual circumstances, both of the offending and of the subjective background of each of the offenders, cover a wide spectrum.  None are the same.  The only common element is that they were all suppliers of substantial quantities of prohibited drugs.  By focusing only on the quantity of drugs supplied, some of the sentences were imposed for amounts similar to those for which the applicant was sentenced.  The position of the various offenders in drug supply hierarchy, however, could either not be identified with precision or in some cases, was higher and in other cases lower than that occupied by the applicant.  To the extent that those cases and the cases on the schedule are capable of indicating a range of sentences, the sentence imposed in this case is not outside that range.
57There are, however, considerable limitations in relying upon a series of individual cases to establish some kind of range of sentences.  In that regard, the observations recently made by Adamson J (with whom Simpson and Davies JJ agreed) in Dang v R [2014] NSWCCA 47 are apposite:
""55 Care must be taken in drawing direct comparisons between sentences passed, those to be passed and those which are, or have been, the subject of appeal: see generally, Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2005] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [53]- [56] per French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ. Sentencing requires the exercise of discretion. The factors that are germane to the exercise of the discretion include deterrence, both general and specific, rehabilitation and punishment. The exercise of the discretion requires consideration of objective circumstances (the seriousness of the offending conduct) as well as subjective circumstances pertinent to the offender. The number of factors to be taken into account as either mitigating or aggravating under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 provides an indication of the complexity of the exercise and the concomitant difficulty of identifying ""comparable cases"".  Although it is orthodox for such cases to be identified for the benefit of the sentencing judge, they can be no more than a guide.""

58Perhaps the most significant difficulty faced by the applicant in making out this ground of appeal are the principles conveniently set out in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 where Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said:
""5 ... Thus, as was accepted in argument in this Court, the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was based upon an allegation of manifest inadequacy rather than specific error. That is, the error assigned was of the third kind mentioned in House v The King. Only if this error was demonstrated was it open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to ""pass such other sentence warranted in law ... in substitution"" for the sentence passed at trial.
6 Manifest inadequacy of sentence, like manifest excess, is a conclusion. A sentence is, or is not, unreasonable or plainly unjust; inadequacy or excess is, or is not, plainly apparent. It is a conclusion which does not depend upon attribution of identified specific error in the reasoning of the sentencing judge and which frequently does not admit of amplification except by stating the respect in which the sentence is inadequate or excessive. It may be inadequate or excessive because the wrong type of sentence has been imposed (for example, custodial rather than non-custodial) or because the sentence imposed is manifestly too long or too short. But to identify the type of error amounts to no more than a statement of the conclusion that has been reached. ...""
59In the same case, Gaudron and Gummow JJ said:
""57 ...  In Lowndes v The Queen, this Court remarked that: 
""a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion. ... The discretion which the law commits to sentencing judges is of vital importance in the administration of our system of criminal justice.""
58 The necessity to show error in such a case is fully accepted by courts deciding appeals against sentence. Indeed, it is commonly referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia. Because the imposition of a sentence involves the exercise of judgment and evaluation upon which minds can differ, it bears close similarities to the making of a discretionary decision.  Like such a decision, if properly imposed, a sentence will not be disturbed on appeal merely because the appellate court would have reached a different result had the responsibility of sentencing belonged to it.  As in the case of appellate review of a discretionary decision, a brake is imposed upon undue appellate disturbance of primary decisions (and unwarranted appeals seeking that relief) by the necessity to identify an error that justifies and authorises appellate intervention. Such an error may involve the adoption by the primary judge of an incorrect principle, giving weight to some extraneous or irrelevant matter, failing to give weight to some material considerations, or a mistake as to the facts.
59 As on appeal from discretionary decisions, it will sometimes not be possible to identify, with exactness, an error of the foregoing kind; yet the result that is challenged may be so manifestly unreasonable or plainly wrong that the appellate court will be able to infer that, in some unidentified way, there has been a failure to exercise the power properly. In appellate review of sentencing, it will commonly be the case that the appellate court's authority to intervene will derive from a conclusion that the resulting order is so disproportionate to the matter to which it relates as to afford the foundation for concluding that, in some way, the exercise of the powers of the primary judge has miscarried.""
60It has not been shown that the primary judge erred in the exercise of his wide sentencing discretion.  His finding was of a very serious case of drug dealing and that the role of the applicant was significant.  His conclusion was:
""In my view both offenders fall within the middle range of participation.  Because Pham appears to be closer to the ultimate supplier he might be regarded as having a more significant role, but the differences in their roles are not very great.""  
61While his Honour did not emphasise them, the principles of general deterrence and denunciation of substantial drug supply loom large in this matter.  His Honour gave appropriate weight to the applicant's subjective circumstances with particular reference to the difficulties likely to be encountered by his wife.  No challenge has been made to his findings in that regard.
62For this ground of appeal to succeed, it had to be established by the applicant that the sentences imposed were ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  That has not occurred.  The primary judge correctly identified the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending and the resulting sentences are not out of step with that finding.  I do not consider the sentence imposed to be outside the range within which the sentencing judge's discretion could be properly exercised.
63The orders which I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
64ADAMS:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
65HALL J:  I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL and with his Honour's reasons.

2704856,R v Dawson [2014] NSWDC 117,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 7 July 2013 James Timothy Dawson, who had been released from custody only three months or so before, wanted to travel to visit his ex-partner. He had concerns about her welfare. He committed an offence of stealing a car in order to travel to see her. He then put petrol in the car and drove off without paying for it. They are serious enough offences, but they pale into insignificance in the light of what Mr Dawson then did. He was responsible for a sustained period of mayhem as he committed a number of very serious offences, which will see him going to gaol for a significant period of time. 

2He has pleaded guilty to four offences and asks when I sentence him for one of those, that a further four matters are taken into account on a Form 1.

3On the evening of 6-7 July, the offender took a blue Honda Prelude from outside the home of its owner in Munmorah. The stealing of that car appears on the Form 1.

4At about 11.52am on 7 July Mr Dawson filled the car up with petrol, but left without paying for it. The offence of obtaining property by deception also appears on the Form 1. 

5Mr Dawson's offending escalated. At about 3.35pm on 7 July a police officer was performing stationary speed enforcement duties in Jesmond, just north of Newcastle Road. The speed limit is 90 kilometres an hour. The officer's attention was drawn to the stolen car being driven by Mr Dawson. Initially it was travelling at 120 kilometres an hour, but accelerated until it reached 146 kilometres an hour. The officer, Senior Constable Edden, gave chase. He reached a position until he was about two seconds behind the vehicle driven by Mr Dawson. He activated his lights and sirens in an attempt to persuade Mr Dawson to stop. Mr Dawson would not stop, until eventually he pulled over to the side of the road. Senior Constable Edden, no doubt thinking that matters were over, and so they should have been, got out of his car. As he did so, Mr Dawson drove off again, causing the senior constable to get back into his car and once again resume the chase.

6At one stage Mr Dawson drove the stolen car over a median strip to perform a U-turn and so he passed by the officer travelling in the other direction. Mr Dawson displayed his contempt for what was happening, by raising his middle finger towards the officer and yelling something at him. The pursuit continued, eventually reaching Hexham. This is an area known for heavy traffic volume. There is a service station and a McDonalds nearby. Mr Dawson travelled at high speeds.

7The officer was able to catch up to get closer to Mr Dawson, about a hundred metres away. At one stage Mr Dawson swerved to the right, which caused him to lose control. His car, or at least the car he had stolen, collided with another car, driven by a Mr and Mrs Atkinson. That rendered the Atkinsons' car undriveable. It also caused injuries to Mr and Mrs Atkinson. Fortunately those injuries were only minor. They were taken to John Hunter Hospital, but released soon afterwards.

8Immediately after the collision Mr Dawson remained in the stolen car. Once again, Senior Constable Edden got out of his car and approached Mr Dawson and once again, Mr Dawson sped away. Mr Dawson's failure to stop after an impact which had caused injuries, is another offence appearing on the Form 1. His conduct in driving as he did, while police wanted to stop him, is the subject of count 1 on the indictment, an offence that Mr Dawson, knowing that police officers were in pursuit of him and knowing that he was required to stop, did not stop and drove the car he was in in a manner which was dangerous to the public. That carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment.

9As Mr Dawson drove away from the scene of collision he was seen by an off-duty police officer, Brett Hopkins, to do so. He decided to follow Mr Dawson. Eventually he came across the stolen car which had come to rest amongst trees in a swamp. It appeared that, once again, Mr Dawson has lost control of the car.

10The off-duty police officer, Mr Hopkins, approached. He saw Mr Dawson climb out of the vehicle and as Mr Dawson approached Mr Hopkins, the latter said, ""Mate, I'm a cop. Get on the ground"". He attempted to arrest Mr Dawson but Mr Dawson had armed himself with a knife, he says from a tackle box he found in the stolen car. Mr Dawson swung the knife at Mr Hopkins and continued to do so. Not surprisingly, Mr Hopkins had grave concerns for his welfare. Mr Dawson began advancing towards Mr Hopkins. In defence Mr Hopkins pushed out at Mr Dawson, who stumbled backwards. Nevertheless, he continued to walk towards Mr Hopkins with his right hand held out, holding the knife and pointing it at Mr Hopkins. Clearly, Mr Dawson was intending to get away and was prepared to threaten Mr Hopkins with a knife in order to do so. He said, ""Fuck it, I'll take your car then"". Mr Hopkins told him the keys were not in the car. Mr Dawson continued to walk towards Mr Hopkins, still pointing the knife at him and looking in Mr Hopkins' car. With that avenue of escape apparently being thwarted, Mr Dawson took to the water. He tried to swim across the Hunter River to a nearby island but gave up and returned to shore. Mr Hopkins was still there and once again Mr Dawson threatened him with a knife.

11The events I have just described form the basis of count 2 on the indictment, an offence of using an offensive weapon, namely a knife, to prevent his lawful apprehension.

12Mr Dawson obviously formed the intention to hijack a passing car. He walked onto the Pacific Highway into the path of oncoming vehicles. One vehicle stopped. Mr Dawson approached the passenger side of this vehicle and attempted to open it, but the car drove away. He faces no count in relation to that conduct.

13He continued to walk across the Pacific Highway, with a number of vehicles having to stop to avoid colliding with him. One of them was a Land Rover, driven by a man by the name of Grant Phillips. Mr Phillips stopped and performed the actions of a good Samaritan. He tried to assist Mr Dawson, thinking that Mr Dawson had been assaulted, because that is what Mr Dawson told him. Mr Phillips asked Mr Dawson if he needed medical treatment. Mr Dawson responded affirmatively and asked to be taken to Maitland. So Mr Phillips was doing what every kind citizen would do, responding to a man in distress, who said he needed medical help. Mr Dawson repaid that kindness by, as I will shortly describe, subjecting Mr Phillips to what must have been a terrifying experience, an experience so frightening that eventually Mr Phillips leapt out of a moving car to escape.

14As they were driving along, Mr Dawson produced the knife, held it towards Mr Phillips and told him to drive in a manner which would mean that the police officer, Mr Hopkins, could not follow them. He was continually saying to Mr Phillips, ""Drive, drive, drive. I don't want to hurt you"". The expression, ""I don't want to hurt you"", must have been cold comfort to Mr Phillips, having a knife pointed towards him and having been told that he needed to drive in a manner which would make it impossible for a following car to keep up. That conduct and conduct I will shortly describe, has led to two offences, one of detaining a person with intent to obtain an advantage, that appears on the Form 1 and also an offence on the indictment, that he whilst armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife, took for the purpose of driving Mr Phillips' Land Rover without his consent while Mr Phillips was in the motor vehicle. That offence has a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period. The maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period reflect how serious the community expects that such offences be treated.

15As Mr Phillips was driving along, he saw that there were marked police vehicles approaching. The offender, still armed with a knife of course, told Mr Phillips not to stop and lose the police that were following him. Mr Phillips was even told at one stage to drive onto the wrong side of the road. Mr Phillips fortunately did not do so. He managed to turn onto another road, where he was told by Mr Dawson to go faster.

16Mr Phillips was forced to take evasive action on a number of occasions to avoid colliding with other traffic. Eventually he was able to slow the vehicle he was driving to about 30 kilometres an hour, before he jumped out. 

17Still Mr Dawson continued to offend. He did not give up. He got into the driver's seat of Mr Phillips' vehicle, then commenced driving himself. He did a U-turn and went back towards the New England Highway. Whilst travelling in this direction he swerved to the wrong side of the road, driving towards both oncoming civilian and marked police vehicles. This dangerous behaviour not only forms the basis for count 4 on the indictment, another offence of not stopping in a police pursuit and driving dangerously, but this time it carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, because it is the second such offence.

18Eventually police were forced to terminate the chase because of the way Mr Dawson was driving. He did not get away with it though, of course. DNA found in the vehicle he stole in the first place identified him and Mr Phillips picked his photo out of a photographic line-up.

19The offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity to these offences. Thus the sentence I will impose upon him will be 25 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. As I mentioned, one of the offences carries a standard non-parole period. I have taken the maximum penalties and where appropriate the standard non-parole period into account in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon Mr Dawson. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

20Mr Dawson is the second of six children born to his mother and father . He has limited contact with his siblings, but retains the support of his parents, especially his mother. His father was involved in crime which, according to a psychological report tendered today, may have limited his ability to be an effective parent to Mr Dawson. To his credit, Mr Dawson Senior has apparently been out of trouble with police for the last 20 years.

21A particularly important aspect of Mr Dawson's upbringing is referred to in the psychological report. Consistent with what I said to Mr Dawson when he was giving evidence, I am not going to refer to it, but I have taken it into account.

22Mr Dawson's life has not really been a happy one. He described himself to the psychologist as a socially isolated individual, that matter being obvious even as a child. Those people he did associate with were involved in delinquent behaviour. They appear to have had a significant adverse effect on his behaviour, encouraging his misconduct and facilitating his delinquency.

23Mr Dawson did manage to secure one close friend. But what I am about to say is very poignant, given the offences for which Mr Dawson is to be sentenced. In 2009, while he and his friend were stealing a car, Mr Dawson crashed it and his friend suffered fatal injuries. Clearly, that was a matter of significant distress to Mr Dawson. Quite clearly also, he should have been well aware, more than most, of the horrible danger he presented to other road users on 7 July 2013. It is a matter of great good fortune that the only injuries which resulted from Mr Dawson's rampage of criminal behaviour were the minor ones suffered by Mr and Mrs Atkinson.

24Mr Dawson did form a relationship with a young woman when he was 17. That relationship lasted for about nine years and there are now three children of it. It was this woman, Mr Dawson's ex-partner, that he was anxious to see, which is why he stole the car in the first place.

25Mr Dawson was released from custody in March 2013. In April they had an argument and his ex-partner stabbed herself five times. Mr Dawson was distressed, not only by what his partner had done to herself, but also by the circumstance that, not surprisingly, he was investigated for possible involvement in the matter. It was apparently a threat from his ex-partner of further self-harm, which caused Mr Dawson to want to go and see her on 7 July.

26Mr Dawson has had a significant history of drug use. Starting, as is often the case, with cannabis, although he has only used that drug intermittently over the last few years. He does not use alcohol terribly much to excess any more either. His problem is with ice. He has been addicted to that drug for many years. On his release from custody in March, he was able to abstain for a relatively short period of time, but the argument with his ex-partner that I have mentioned, triggered a relapse and he started consuming the drug daily. Not surprisingly he was using the drug at the time of the offences for which I must now sentence him.

27I mentioned before that Mr Dawson's life had not been a terribly happy one. The psychologist describes him as characteristically depressed. He has struggled psychologically for many years. He is vulnerable to a melancholic mood and there is evidence of a post-traumatic stress response. He seems to have, so says the psychologist, little capacity to cope effectively with his mental state, choosing largely to respond with avoidance. That is consistent with what Mr Dawson told me in the witness box today, that he uses drugs to block things out.

28As the psychologist says, another way that Mr Dawson seeks freedom from the stresses he experiences in life is by driving. He has never had a driving licence, so not surprisingly, the majority of his prior offending has been driving related.

29Whilst in custody, Mr Dawson has taken steps to better himself. He has been doing courses, forklift driving, occupational health and safety certificates and the like. His opportunities for work and education have of course been limited, whilst on remand, but after sentence today, he will seek out such opportunities.

30Mr Dawson expressed, what I am satisfied was genuine remorse, in the witness box. He read out a letter which he had prepared in which he apologised to all the various victims of his offending. He was in tears as he read this letter. I am satisfied that he genuinely regrets what he did, not only because it will see him go to gaol for a long time, but because he realised he has harmed people, frightened them and indeed terrified them, in a significant way.

31I take into account that the more serious of Mr Dawson's offending was not really planned. On the other hand he did bring matters upon himself, not only by stealing the car, but then by travelling at high speed, which drew him to the attention of police. But what then followed was an escalating series of unplanned responses to the police wishing to arrest Mr Dawson. Police were no doubt concerned at the threat that Mr Dawson represented to innocent road users. It is a feature of Mr Dawson's criminality that he escalated matters as he did, caring it would seem little for the rights of anyone else apart from himself. He did not care that Mr Phillips must have been terrified. He did not care that he may have injured someone when he collided with the Atkinsons' car. He did not care that there was obviously a risk of injury when he was waving the knife around at the off-duty police officer and he did not care, that he might injure or even kill a large number of people, through his manner of driving. His criminality was grave indeed.

32No doubt, and this is stating the obvious, the fact that he was affected by ice had a significant detrimental impact on his ability to exercise judgment that day. But, after all, it was the offender's voluntary and criminal decision to consume the drug ice in the first place.

33The fact that Mr Dawson was released only a relatively short period of time before being re-arrested is of course significant as it demonstrates the difficulty that Mr Dawson will have leading a law abiding lifestyle on his release from custody. It is also more directly relevant to a finding of special circumstances. I will make a finding of special circumstances in this matter but, given the length of the sentence that I must necessarily impose to reflect the objective gravity of the offender's conduct, the variation from the statutory ratio is relatively modest.

34Attention was paid, during submissions, to the date on which I would commence sentence. Mr Dawson was serving a sentence, the non-parole period of which expired on 21 May 2014. Had he been dealt with for these offences and the Local Court matters at the same time, there would have been partial accumulation. Accordingly, I will date the sentences I am about to impose, from 7 January 2014.

35For the offence of count 1 on the indictment I impose a sentence of imprisonment, consisting of a non-parole period of nine months, commencing from 7 January 2014 and a head sentence of 18 months.

36For the offence in count 4 on the indictment I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 12 months, commencing from 7 July 2014 and a head sentence of 24 months.

37For the offence of count 2 I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of three years, commencing from 7 January 2015 and a head sentence of four years.

38Taking into account the matters on the Form 1, for the offence in count 3 I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of four years, commencing from 7 July 2016 and a head sentence of seven years.

39The overall effective sentence I impose consists of a non-parole period of six years six months, commencing from 7 January 2014 and a head sentence of nine years six months. Mr Dawson will become eligible to be released to parole on 6 July 2020.
