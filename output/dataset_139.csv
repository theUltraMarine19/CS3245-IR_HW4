The appellant was convicted in the trial court of a charge in the following terms: 
 
You, Mohammad Ali bin Mohd Noor, male, 23 years, NRIC No 7202135E are charged that you, on 11 July 1993 at or about 4am, along Nicoll Drive, Singapore, did ride motor cycle No FK 3529T, did take part in a competition of speed with two other motor cycles Nos FG 9668G and FK 7644S, without the written approval of the Minister, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 116(1) and punishable under s 116(3) of the Road Traffic Act Singapore.
 
 
 
He was sentenced to ten weeks` imprisonment, fined $1,500 with one month`s imprisonment in default and disqualified from holding or obtaining licences for all vehicle classes for a period of four years. He appealed against his conviction. That appeal was dismissed and reasons are now given.
 The prosecution`s case below 
The evidence of the prosecution witnesses was that the appellant had been seen racing along Nicoll Drive in the company of two other motorists. He was apprehended just after the race while he was still on his motorcycle.
One Sgt Aziz bin Osman, a corporal at the material time, testified that together with two other officers, VSSS Idris Yatim, at the time also a corporal, and VCPL Ishak Jalil, he had gone in plainclothes in an unmarked car to Nicoll Drive at about 2.50am. Nothing happened till about 4am, when three motorcycles came out of a carpark, number 3, heading towards Telok Paku. Near carpark 4, the riders made a U-turn and lined up abreast. The police officers split up observation of the riders amongst the three of them. Sgt Aziz chose to keep an eye on a rider near the kerb who was wearing a black jacket, grey pants and a full faced tinted visor helmet. One of the other riders was wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the number `88`.
The riders revved their engines, and then sped off, crouched forward on their patrol tanks. Each of the motorcyclists attempted to get ahead of the others. The riders then U-turned, and rode back to Telok Paku. There they once again lined up abreast, and started off again. The rider Sgt Aziz chose to observe was now in the middle. In the course of this lap, the riders came upon a van, and overtook it - Sgt Aziz`s rider doing so against the flow of traffic. The van itself had to brake when one of the riders swerved in front of it.
The riders then came into carpark 3. There the officers identified themselves and arrested them while the riders were still on their motorcycles. Throughout all this there were some spectators along the road, estimated to number between 150 to 200 persons.
The second witness, VSSS Idris Yatim, gave much the same evidence. He chose to concentrate on a rider wearing a white T-shirt with the number `88` on it. Cpl Ishak Jalil`s target was wearing a green jersey marked `8`. The investigating officer also gave evidence but nothing to assist either side came from it.
The prosecution`s case was thus that the elements of an offence under s 116 were made out.
 The defence case 
The defence was that the appellant did not in fact participate in any race. He was arrested by the officers with neither rhyme nor reason.
The appellant, who lived at the time at Bedok North, gave evidence that that morning he went down to Changi Beach and parked his motorcycle at carpark 3. He had gone to the beach from a restaurant in Bedok where he had had a meal. On his way back home, it struck him that he had forgotten to buy some food back, so he had gone by himself straight to Changi.
He was walking back to his motorcycle after a smoke when he was arrested by two police officers, VSSS Idris Yatim and CPL Ishak Jalil. These officers ordered him to sit by his motorcycle. Shortly another person, one Cubinar, was brought to the area as well. A third person, one Mohd Bustami, arrived later in a police car, with his motorcycle ridden by someone else.
The second defence witness was one Cubinar Leonard Alphonsus. He had gone to Changi Beach to seek his friends. He took a walk around Nicoll Drive. It was at this time, while he was walking back to his motorcycle, that someone tapped his head, and showed him a pair of handcuffs. He was then ordered to sit down by the appellant who was sitting at the carpark with another police officer. Shortly, a third person, Mohd Bustami, was brought to their location by car.
Cubinar gave evidence that he could not have been racing at the time as his motorcycle was still being run-in and could not have been used for a speed above 70km per hour. He used the vehicle to go to work, and at one point testified that he had only clocked up 153 km out of the required 200 km. Subsequently, he was recalled and gave evidence that the clocked up distance was really 1,530 km, while the running in mileage was 2000km.
The third witness was Mohd Bustami. On the morning in question, the appellant was arrested while he was with two other persons, Syed bin Jantan and one Sutarin. The three of them were just walking in the area when Cpl Ishak arrested him. Neither Syed nor Sutarin were arrested. Mohd Bustami was then taken by car to carpark 3, while Cpl Ishak rode his motorcycle there. At the carpark, Mohd Bustami met the appellant and Cubinar.
Both Mohd Bustami and Cubinar had pleaded guilty during an earlier trial. In the present trial they gave evidence that they did not want to plead guilty to the earlier charge but had done so after being called to chambers.
 The decision 
Though an attempt was made by the prosecution to impeach the credit of the appellant on the basis of a statement given by him, the magistrate found that there was no material inconsistency. It was also understandable that there would be some inconsistencies as the incident had taken place about two years before the trial.
Dealing first with the evidence given by Cubinar, the magistrate found that that evidence could not be accepted. Cubinar`s testimony that the running-in mileage was really 2,000 km and that the motorcycle had really been bought from the dealer whom he had supposedly called to confirm the mileage had to be treated with caution. The magistrate thought that it was highly unlikely that Cubinar would have been mistaken as to the running-in distance. The conclusion reached was that this was a fabrication. Of significance was that the witness had tried at first to justify his running up a mileage of only about 200 km, while it was only subsequently that he had given evidence that the distance as 2,000 km.
As for Mohd Bustami, the magistrate found that he could not believe the story given by the witness. To the magistrate, what was strange was that neither of the persons accompanying the witness was arrested as well. It was highly unlikely for pedestrians to have been selected by the police for arrest on trumped up charges when three riders could easily have been chosen instead. And the appellant`s version was particularly improbable when it was noted that there were between 80 to 150 other persons along the road that morning, according to the evidence of both defence and prosecution witnesses. Additionally, there was no evidence that the defence witnesses knew each other, nor that the police officers had anything against them.
The evidence of the police officers was accepted in preference. In doing so, the magistrate did not think it fatal that the prosecution did not obtain the particulars of the numerous spectators watching the race. As for the allegations by Cubinar and Mohd Bustami that their pleas of guilt were forced, the magistrate declined to deal with the point, but emphasised that he rejected their evidence based on their testimony of what had happened that morning.
The magistrate being satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had been committed convicted the appellant.
In mitigation, it was submitted that it ought to be taken into consideration that the appellant was married. It was further said that no distinction ought to be made with the sentences imposed on Cubinar and Mohd Bustami, who each had received on corresponding charges eight weeks` imprisonment and fined $1,400 with default of one month`s imprisonment, together with disqualification from all vehicle licences for four years. The magistrate apparently did not accept these points as material.
 The appeal 
The appellant in his petition raised five grounds. Firstly, it was said that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence, and was unreasonable. Next, there was insufficient evidence to show that it was the appellant who had committed the offence. Thirdly, the magistrate ought not have rejected the evidence for the defence. An adverse inference ought also have been drawn against the prosecution for failing to produce independent witnesses who would have corroborated the prosecution case. Finally, it was said that the magistrate ought to have given due consideration to the fact that statements had been taken from the persons said to have been accompanying Mohd Bustami that morning.
In his arguments before this court, counsel for the appellant made a number of other submissions. He contended that the magistrate had misdirected himself as the decision against the appellant was founded on the prior convictions of the two other motorcyclists, Mohd Bustami and Cubinar. The prosecution witnesses were also alleged to have contradicted themselves, particularly on their evidence as to the van which they alleged had been overtaken by the motorcyclists. And the magistrate below ought to have called as witnesses the persons who were said by Mohd Bustami to have been accompanying him at the time of his arrest.
 The respondent`s case 
The prosecution refuted the contentions that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence, that there was no evidence that the appellant had committed the offence and the magistrate ought to have accepted the evidence of the defence witnesses. As for the contention that the prosecution ought to have called material and independent witnesses, the prosecution argued that the prosecution only has to adduce the evidence of witnesses which will be sufficient to prove its case. Finally, it was said that it lay upon the defence, and not the prosecution, to call Mohd Bustami`s friends as witnesses if it thought fit.
 The issues arising 
The following issues arose in this appeal:
 
 
- The findings of fact 
 
- The effect of the prior pleas of guilt and the evidence given earlier by the defence witnesses 
 
- Adverse inferences against the prosecution 
 
- The elements of the offence
  
 
 
 
 
 Findings of fact 
 
 
 
The magistrate accepted the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and rejected that of the defence. He stated: 
 
... I found the evidence of the three officers clear and unequivocal. There is nothing to suggest that the entire incident was fabricated. I accepted their evidence as being the truth as to what had really happened that morning.
 
 
 
No serious challenge was made to their evidence. In the course of cross-examination, Sgt Aziz was questioned as to why he had not taken down the number of the motorcycle ridden by the appellant while the race was on. The answer given was that he was concentrating primarily on observing the motorcycle. In the circumstances of the race, that was an understandable omission on his part.
The appellant contended that there was insufficient identification of him. The evidence of the police officers was that the riders had been arrested shortly after the race had finished while they were still on the motorcycles. Sgt Aziz said: 
 
Distance they raced less than 1 km, approximately 1 km. We could see the place where they made U turn. Everything was in my sight. No other motorcycles were on that stretch of road. They were still seated on their motor cycles. I could not have been mistaken. This is the motor cycle I was concentrating on (P2-P3). After traffic police I lodged a report of illegal racing against motor cyclist of FA 3529T. The rider is Mohd Ali bin Mohd Noor. I confirm that this is the report.
 
 
 
In these circumstances, there was no mis-identification, either during the race, during the arrest, or during trial.
In support of the magistrate`s findings was that there were no material inconsistencies between the testimonies of the three officers. The appellant had indeed pointed to supposed inconsistencies relating to the van which was said to have been overtaken by the competitors in the race. It was said that the police officers were contradictory in whether there was in fact such a van, and failed to obtain the licence number of the van, or of the pedestrians who had to get out of the way of the motorcycles after the van was overtaken.
But in the view of this court, these submissions were without merit. The last two points will be dealt with in the section on inferences against the prosecution. For the moment, counsel`s point may be dealt with shortly. Two of the witnesses, Sgt Aziz and CPL Ishak Jalil were clear that they saw a van being overtaken. The other witness, VSSS Idris Yatim, did say at first that there were no other vehicles during the race, but he corrected himself shortly when asked by counsel for the appellant. Given that these events took place about two years before the trial, and the van was but a minor part of the evidence, VSSS Idris` mistake was understandable. In these circumstances, there was no material inconsistency in the prosecution evidence.
In contrast, the evidence of the defence witnesses and of the appellant was not satisfactory. Taking Cubinar`s evidence first, he had said that he had been picked up with no reason while he was walking back to his motorcycle. He gave evidence that he would not have raced for his motorcycle was on his evidence was still being run in. The evidence given was that the motorcycle should not be used to go beyond 70 km per hour and that the witness was careful not to exceed that limit.
A few points may be noted. Firstly, the witness may yet have chosen to exceed the running-in limit. Secondly, a race may still be run at speeds below 70 km per hour. Thirdly, no other evidence was given of the speed limit during this running-in period. In light of these, not too much weight could be placed on the significance that the motorcycle was still being run-in.
It was noted as well that no direct evidence was given as to the actual mileage required, even after Cubinar was recalled by defence counsel. Cubinar was inconsistent about the distance travelled by him during the running in period, saying at first that it was 153 km, and later 1,530 km. A similar mistake was supposedly made as regards the running-in requirement. The excuse given by the witness was that he had omitted the last digit. However, given that the witness was concerned about the running in mileage, it would seem incredible that he would have made a mistake about the requirements. On his version of events, he ought to have paid particular attention to the distance for which he had up to that point used the motorcycle - there is a world of difference between having travelled 153 km, with another 47 km more to go, and travelling 1,530 km, with another 470 km to go. The magistrate was of the view that the change in evidence was to account for the mileage run up if as the witness testified the motorcycle had been used to go to work. In the context of the incredulity of such an error in distance having been made, such a conclusion would seem warranted, and the magistrate was entitled to reject the evidence of Cubinar.
Next, the evidence of Mohd Bustami will have to be examined. The magistrate was unable to accept Mohd Bustami`s evidence for he noted that the two other persons with him were not arrested. Given that on the witness`s version of events a random targeting of innocent persons was being conducted, it did seem incredible that his companions were not arrested at all.
The appellant`s own evidence was correctly rejected for his reason for being at Changi was incredible. He had ostensibly gone to the restaurant at Bedok for a meal and was supposed to buy something home. On the way back when he realised that he had forgotten to buy food home, he chose to go out of his way to Changi, just for a smoke. His evidence did not raise a reasonable doubt that the appellant was not involved in that or any offence.
In the course of the proceedings, the prosecution attempted to impeach the credit of the appellant using a s 122(6) statement which had been given by him. The alleged inconsistencies related to whether the appellant was arrested by one or two officers and whether the arrest was made in carpark 2 or 3. The magistrate chose not to impeach his credit for some time had passed since the incident and that the portions were not really material. The magistrate was correct in so finding.
In the end then, the magistrate was left to choose between the evidence of the appellant and that of the police officers. He was entitled to find that the evidence of the appellant did not raise a reasonable doubt.
 The convictions of the defence witnesses 
The appellant argued that the magistrate had erred by finding him guilty on the basis of the convictions earlier of his two witnesses. He pointed to a passage in the magistrate`s grounds of decision: 
 
In the instant case, I was satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt in respect of the remaining two charges. I accordingly found the accused guilty and convicted him on that one charge.
 
 
 
Since the appellant was only facing one charge, he argued that this indicated that the magistrate was referring to the charges against Cubinar and Mohd Bustami.
It is eminently clear though that the magistrate did not proceed on the reasoning that because Cubinar and Mohd Bustami were guilty, so was the appellant. The magistrate noted: 
 
In view of the findings of fact above where I had rejected their evidence as to what had occurred on the aid [sic] night and have, in fact, accepted the evidence of the three police officers, I see no necessity to deal with [the arguments about Cubinar`s and Mohd Bustami`s pleas of guilt]. In any event, I should emphasise that I did not reject their evidence in court because of their earlier plea of guilty but solely on the fact that I found their evidence in court today unbelievable.
 
 
 
Having rejected their evidence not because of the their pleas, but wholly on the evidence given in court, the magistrate could not then have gone on to consider their convictions as the basis of finding the appellant guilty. What he said about `the remaining two charges` was then nothing more than a slip.
 Adverse inferences against the prosecution 
The appellant contends that adverse inferences operated against the prosecution for failing to produce independent witnesses, presumably the spectators and the driver of the overtaken van, as well as for not producing the statements taken from the friends of Mohd Bustami.
Dealing with the failure to produce witnesses, as noted by the prosecution, no other witnesses were necessary to prove the prosecution`s case. The only obligation for the prosecution as regards witnesses is to ensure that the witnesses called to give evidence are able to show that the elements of the offence have been made out. The calling of further witnesses may assist the prosecution in proving a case beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether or not any such witnesses ought to be called is strictly a matter for the prosecution.
In 
Chua Keem Long v PP
 
 
[1996] 1 SLR 510
  , it was said by this court: 
 
Any criminal transaction may be observed by a number of witnesses. It is not necessary for the prosecution to produce every single one of those witnesses. All the prosecution need do is to produce witnesses whose evidence can be believed so as to establish the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Out of a number of witnesses, it may then only be necessary to bring in one or two; as long as those witnesses actually produced are able to give evidence of the transaction, there is no reason why all of the rest should be called, nor why any presumption should be drawn that the evidence of those witnesses not produced would have been against the prosecution.
 
 
 
Turning next to the point that an adverse inference should be drawn against the prosecution for failing to produce the statements of the two friends of Mohd Bustami, it must be noted that this characterisation of the issue is what is presumed to be the argument that is put forward by the appellant. What the appellant has actually contended is that the magistrate ought to have taken into account the admission by the prosecuting officer that the two friends had given statements. There is some difficulty with this characterisation of the issue.
Firstly, the prosecuting officer was not giving evidence. It is difficult then to see how such a statement could amount to an admission. Secondly, there is no other basis than that which is suggested for the magistrate to have taken that admission, if such it was, into account.
On the presumed characterisation suggested here, no presumption against the prosecution should operate. These friends were witnesses for the defence. They ought to have been called by the appellant. The prosecution could not, even if it had wanted to, have adduced their statements as evidence in their absence for such statements are hearsay. None of the hearsay exceptions apply to those statements.
It was further said by the appellant that these statements ought to have been disclosed in the earlier trial. But that is an irrelevant matter in these proceedings. What might or might not have been done in that other trial did not concern the magistrate here, except in so far as the conviction or testimony could amount to an admission. Whether or not some evidence could or should have been adduced in that other trial was for determination by an appeal to that decision and not in the instant appeal here.
The appellant also contended that the magistrate ought to have called these witnesses even though they were not called by the defence. Section 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) reads: 
 
Any court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summon any person as a witness or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned, as a witness or recall and re-examine any person already examined and the court shall summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person, if his evidence appears to it essential to the just decision of the case.
 
 
 
The section is both permissive and mandatory. Most of the cases dealing with the provision have been concerned with whether a judge has exercised his discretion correctly in calling a particular witness, usually for the prosecution. In 
 Re Adam Aman; Hoesin bin Ghani v PP 
 
 
[1958] MLJ 229
 , Rigby J said: 
 
The sole test as to whether [the judge] has properly exercised his discretion lies in the answer to those last few words, namely, was such evidence essential to the just decision of the case or put in another way, did the calling of such evidence occasion a miscarriage of justice? It seems to me that the answer to that question must logically be that every case must be considered on its own merits and in relation to its own facts.
 
 
 
However, with respect, this conflated the two limbs of s 399; the discretionary and the mandatory. A similar approach was adopted by the Supreme Court of Malaysia in 
 Phon Nam v PP 
 
 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 550
 , where Hashim Yeop A Sani CJ (Malaya) said at p 551: 
 
When the discretion under [the equivalent section] should be exercised has been amply explained by this court in the earlier judgment [
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 415
 ] involving the same appellant as also explained in 
 Ramli bin Kechik v PP
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 33
 . The discretion is to be exercised depending on the facts of each case, the main consideration being the essentiality of the additional evidence for the purpose of arriving at a just decision of the case.
 
 
 
The requirement of essentiality to the justice of the case strictly speaking applies only to the mandatory limb.
The discretion that does exist is broad, but bearing in mind the adversarial nature of the prosecutorial process, should be exercised sparingly. It can only be said that in some situations where the evidence of the witness is not essential to the justice of the case, the discretion of the court may still be exercised in calling such a witness and examining him.
In 
 Balfour v PP 
 [1949] MLJ Supp 8, Taylor J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Federation, said at p 9: 
 
It is correct that [the equivalent section] of the Criminal Procedure Code authorises the court to call an additional witness at any stage and that the court may, in special circumstances of its own motion, but where a case is conducted by counsel and more especially, as here, a preliminary enquiry has been held before a committing magistrate, this power should be exercised only in rare cases as, for instance where one side has raised at the trial a point which the other side could not have foreseen: 
 R v Day
[1940] 1 ALL ER 402.
 
 
 
It must be noted that little guidance exists as to the circumstances in which the failure by the court to call a witness would amount to a contravention of s 399. It is the view of this court though that generally no attack may be made on the failure of a court to call a witness notwithstanding that the judge may not have actually considered s 399 in his decision. For any failure to consider the exercise of the discretion would only be material where it is shown that the discretion ought to have been exercised in favour of the calling of such witnesses. But in that case, given the contention that the calling of that witness is obliged, what is really in question is the mandatory exercise of the power, under the second limb of s 399, that is that the evidence appears to the court to be essential for the just determination of the case. Thus the sole issue in this appeal is then whether the evidence of the two companions of Mohd Bustami can be described as being essential to a just decision.
What is essential to the just decision of the case cannot be defined categorically and has been said to be really a question of the particular facts of a case. Nothing further can be added, but the question may be clarified by asking whether a conviction in the absence of such evidence would be safe, or that an acquittal in such circumstances would amount to an injustice. Here there was ample evidence before the magistrate to support the conviction of the appellant, and it was not shown that such conviction was unsafe for the absence of the evidence of the two companions of Mohd Bustami. For that reason, this court came to the conclusion that the court below had not failed in calling those persons.
 The elements of the offence 
Section 116 reads, in its relevant portions: 
 
No competition of speed or trial of speed involving the use of vehicles shall take place on a road without the written approval of the Minister. Any such written approval may be subject to such conditions to be specified therein as the Minister may think fit to impose.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Any person who promotes or takes part in any competition or trial of speed without the written approval of the Minister and any driver or person in charge of any vehicle used in or taking part in any such competition or trial of speed shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and shall also be punished with a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $2,000 and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months and with a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $3,000.
 
 
 
No proof any such order has been given. Given that, whether or not permission was granted lay especially within the knowledge of the appellant. Section 108 of the Evidence Act reads: 
 
when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.
 
 
 
This has been taken to mean that where the prosecution would have inordinate difficulties in proving something while it would be relatively easy for the accused to do so, the burden lay upon the accused (
 PP v Lim Kwai Thean 
 
 
 
[1959] MLJ 179
 ). Of course, this cannot be taken so far as to impose the burden of disproving the elements of the offence on the accused (
 Mary Ng v R 
[1958] AC 173
).
In this appeal, the appellant then ought to show whether he was given such permission. It was relatively easy for him to do so, and did not require him to disprove the elements of the offence.
The sole point remaining was whether this was a competition or trial of speed. No local cases have yet dealt with this point but the words of the section are clear enough: there must be some form of rivalry or contention between the drivers or riders alleged to be involved for it is not sufficient that there were three disparate individuals who happened to be speeding at the same time and place.
On the evidence accepted, the riders had lined up abreast, they had a common turning point, and a common ending point. They were also trying to beat each other to the end point. The riders were undoubtedly in competition. In these circumstances, it could not be doubted that the elements of the charge were fulfilled.
The conviction was thus upheld.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was tried together with one Ganesan s/o Krishnan (Ganesan) for offences under the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213) (the Act). The appellant was charged with and convicted on six counts. He was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 in default one month`s imprisonment on each charge, making a total fine of $12,000 or in default six months` imprisonment.
The first charge against the appellant was as follows: 
 
You,
 
 
 
Bridges Christopher ... are charged that you, on a day between July and August 1993, in Singapore, received from one Ganesan s/o Krishnan, a staff sergeant of the Singapore Police Force attached to the Field Intelligence Team, Criminal Investigation Department, information relating to the change of address of one Mariati bte Tarmuchi and one Kumess bin Hashim, having reasonable ground to believe, at the time you received the said information, that such information was communicated to you in contravention of the Official Secrets Act, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(2) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213) and punishable under s 17(2) of the said Act.
 
 
 
The second and third charges were similar to the first, save that the information related to the change of address of one Sharon Tan Jee Pin and one Lee Tian Peng respectively. These two offences were alleged to have been committed between 17 September 1993 and 19 October 1993, and 29 December 1993 and 18 April 1994 respectively.
The fourth charge alleged that: 
 
You,
 
 
 
Bridges, Christopher ... are charged that you, on a day between July and August 1993, in Singapore, having in your possession information relating to the change of address of one Mariati bte Tarmuchi and one Kumess bin Hashim, which had been obtained in contravention of the Official Secrets Act, did communicate such information to one Tan Siah Yong, to whom you had not been authorised to communicate such information, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(1)(c)(i) of the Official Secrets Act (Cap 213) and punishable under s 17(2) of the said Act.
 
 
 
Charges five and six related to the change of address of Sharon Tan Jee Pin and Lee Tian Peng respectively, with the alleged dates of offences being those stated in charges two and three. It can thus be seen that charges one to three related to the receipt of information relating to the changes of addresses of these persons, while charges four to six related to communicating the same information to an unauthorised person.
 The prosecution`s evidence
Tan Siah Yong (Tan), an advocate and solicitor and a relative of the appellant, testified that, in the course of social gatherings, he shared with the appellant his practical problem of serving court documents on defendants because the latest addresses of the defendants were often not known to lawyers. The appellant told him that he could try to obtain the latest addresses for him.
Sometime in August 1993, Tan telephoned the appellant and said that he needed the address of Mariati bte Tarmuchi and Kumess bin Hashim. Tan gave the appellant their names and identity card numbers. Sometime later, the appellant gave the couple`s latest addresses to Tan, who wrote this information on a piece of paper which was admitted and marked as `P11`. The information included the date of Kumess bin Hashim`s change of address. For this, the appellant asked for, and Tan paid, $300. Tan recorded this as a disbursement for search fees.
Between 17 September and 19 October 1993, Tan obtained from the appellant the latest address of Sharon Tan Jee Pin. The appellant gave this address as Block 161 Bukit Batok Street 11, #07-78, Singapore 2365. This was written down by Tan on another piece of paper, P12. The date of change of address was stated as 6 April 1993. Tan paid the appellant $150.
On the third occasion, Tan called the appellant and asked him for the address of Lee Tian Peng. The appellant subsequently gave this to Tan. The address was Block 15, Teban Gardens Road #01-106, Singapore 2260. The date of change of address was 4 April 1993. This was recorded by Tan on P13. He also paid $150 to the appellant.
Tan was not told by the appellant how these addresses were obtained. Tan`s evidence was not disputed by the appellant. It was also not disputed that the appellant obtained the information from Ganesan. Additionally, it was agreed that addresses of persons may be obtained from sources such as private search agencies, the register of electors, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and the Registry of Companies and Businesses (RCB).
The prosecution called witnesses to explain the on-line screening facilities available in the Intelligence Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in which Ganesan was a Field Intelligence Officer. At the material time, Ganesan was served by Analyst Team 8. The analyst team assisted field intelligence officers in screening information requested by them. The analysts were given individual confidential identification codes to gain access into the computer system.
The National Registration Office`s (NRO) on-line screening facilities were available to the Intelligence Division of the CID. These facilities allowed officers to discover the latest address of any person and the date of change of address. Field intelligence officers did not have direct access into the NRO facilities and must channel their requests through the analysts.
The analyst and assistant analysts all gave evidence that information obtained from the on-line screening facilities was classified as `Secret`. They were not allowed to divulge any information derived from the system to unauthorised persons. Ganesan`s OC, ASP Karthigesu Paranjothi, testified that current addresses obtained from the on-line system was classified as `Confidential`. PW6 Ng Peng Kee from the NRO gave evidence that information about current addresses and the dates of their changes were confidential.
The prosecution also relied on a confession by Ganesan that he had obtained the addresses with the assistance of the analysts. Upon receiving the addresses, he gave them to the appellant.
 Was the information `secret official` information?
The first question is whether information regarding the relevant changes of addresses were, or had been proved to be, `secret official` information for the purpose of the Act. At this stage, it may be assumed that the information given to the appellant by Ganesan was obtained from the CID`s system.
The relevant parts of s 5 of the Act states: 
 
 
(1) If any person having in his possession or control any secret official code word, countersign or password, or any photograph, drawing, plan, model, article, note, document or information which - 
 
(a) relates to or is used in a prohibited place or anything in such a place; 
 
(b) relates to munitions of war; 
 
(c) has been made or obtained in contravention of this Act; 
 
(d) has been entrusted in confidence to him by any person holding office under the Government; or 
 
(e) he has obtained, or to which he has had access, owing to his position as a person who holds or has held office under the Government, or as a person who holds, or has held a contract made on behalf of the Government, or as a person who is or has been employed under a person who holds or has held such an office or contract, 
 
does any of the following: 
 
(i) communicates directly or indirectly any such information or thing as aforesaid to any foreign Power other than a foreign power to whom he is duly authorised to communicate it, or to any person other than a person to whom he is authorised to communicate it or to whom it is his duty to communicate it; 
 
(ii) uses any such information or thing as aforesaid for the benefit of any foreign Power other than a foreign Power for whose benefit he is authorised to use it, or in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interests of Singapore; 
 
(iii) retains in his possession or control any such thing as aforesaid when he has no right to retain it, or when it is contrary to his duty to retain it, or when it is contrary to his duty to retain it, or fails to comply with all lawful directions issued by lawful authority with regard to the return or disposal thereof; or 
 
(iv) fails to take reasonable care of, or so conducts himself as to endanger the safety or secrecy of, any such information or thing as aforesaid, 
 
that person shall be guilty of an offence.
  
 
 
 
(2) If any person receives any secret official code word, countersign, password, or any photograph, drawing, plan, model, article, note, document or information knowing, or having reasonable ground to believe, at the time when he receives it, that the code word, countersign, password, photograph, drawing, plan, model, article, note, document or information is communicated to him in contravention of this Act, he shall be guilty of an offence unless he proves that the communication to him of the code word, countersign, password, photograph, drawing, plan, model, article, note, document or information was contrary to his desire.
  
 
 
The prosecution contended that, until any information is published or released by persons authorised, whether expressly or impliedly, to do so, the information is secret official information covered by the Act. In other words, it was conceded that once that information is published or released by persons authorised to do so, it ceases to be secret official information.
 The public domain argument
The first argument by Mr Khoo for the appellant, and one which can easily be disposed of, was that information of a person`s address belongs to the person concerned, and not the government. Hence it is not protected by the Act. There is no merit in this argument. The Act does not draw any distinction between information `owned` by the government or by private persons. The ownership of information is irrelevant. It is often precisely because such information is private that they must be protected by the government. In any event, even if information of a person`s address belongs to that person, it does not follow that it is thereby in the public domain.
There is also authority that the mere fact the information is already in the public domain does not mean that it ceases to be protected information. Reference may be made to 
 Datuk Haji Dzulkifli v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 112
  . It is clear law that if the information reached the public domain as a result of unauthorised disclosure, that information does not cease to be secret official information. In such circumstances, it would be no excuse to say that the information is already in the public domain.
On the other hand, it seems to me absurd to say that the fact that the information is in the public domain is totally irrelevant. A good test of a proposition couched in absolute terms is to test it against extreme examples. It is ludicrous to suggest that information such as `the sun rises in the east` is secret official information even if it is classified as `Top Secret` by a government department. Common sense dictates that a line must be drawn somewhere.
In this respect, I must reiterate that I am referring to the information per se. One must be careful to identify what one is referring to when one refers to `information` in this area, lest one falls into a conceptual trap. The fact that an innocuous piece of information is contained in a document or discussed in a meeting may be secret official information even though that particular piece of information itself is not. Thus, the contents of an examination paper may be secret official information until the examination. `1 + 1 = 2` is not secret official information, but the fact that that question is asked, and the answer expected, in the paper is.
For this same reason, a reserved judgment is secret official information until it is released even though the facts referred to in it are a matter of public record, and the law referred to and applied in it can be found in the case books. However, it is a fallacy to suggest that the contents of the report of 
 In the Goods of Lao Leong An 
 (1867) Wood`s Or Cas 35 is secret official information merely because that case is referred to in a judgment that has yet been delivered, just as it is a fallacy to say that the contents of s 2 of the District Grand Master of the Eastern Archipelago Ordinance (Cap 360) is official secret information just because it may have been referred to in a yet to be delivered judgment.
Turning back to the absurd example, the absurdity is not alleviated by falling back on the often cited implied authority to disclose the information. In the example given, there can hardly be an implied authority to disclose something expressly classified as `Top Secret`. It is thus clear that there is a boundary somewhere, at least in relation to information, such that information falling on the wrong side of the line cannot be secret official information within the meaning of the Act no matter how the government chooses to treat it.
Nor can the question be solved by falling back on the Attorney General`s consent for prosecution. Whether something is an offence or not is a question of law, not the Attorney General`s discretion, or anybody else`s for that matter. It would be quite wrong to interpret a penal provision so widely that innocent persons` liberty depends on the exercise of discretion.
The same may extend even to other things mentioned in s 5, such as a photograph. A poster advertising beer with a photograph of a swimsuit clad model is used as decoration in the mess of an army camp. A soldier steals it and keeps it in his possession. It would be stretching common sense to say that the soldier contravened s 5(1)(a)(iii) of the Act.
The present case is not so extreme. Addresses, like many other types of information, may or may not be secret official information. Much may depend on the circumstances of each case.
For example, there may be information which is supplied to the government by private persons which the government may have a duty to protect from indiscriminate disclosure. In such cases, I am prepared to accept the deputy public prosecutor`s argument that whether it is in fact secret official information must depend on how the government chooses to treat it. This will be subject to the proviso that the private person may have an overriding right to disclose the same information to whomever he pleases, and thus a correlating right on the recipient to receive it.
Where determination of the issue turns on how the government chooses to treat a particular piece of information, it is not open to the prosecution to argue that the availability of the information from other government sources does not detract from its status as an official secret. That would be an inherently inconsistent position to adopt.
If other government departments, organs or officers are authorised or required by law to publish, release or make available the same information to the public, then once this is done, such information must, by definition, cease to be secret official information. 
 Such information has been published or released to the public by a person authorised to do so. 
Even if the information has not been physically published or communicated to the public, but is made available to any member of the public who wishes to have access to it, it is arguable whether such information ceases to be protected by the Act. Thus, the mukim and lot number of a particular plot of land which can be obtained from the Survey Department may not be (I am not here saying it cannot be) secret official information merely because nobody has yet bothered to look it up. It is a nice question whether such information can ever be made secret again.
For this reason, the very wide statements in 
 Datuk Haji Dzulkifli 
 must be treated with some caution. In that case, it was said that whether information is protected depends on the manner the government treats that information. But there is only one government. Information is an official secret, or it is not. It would be absurd to say that exactly the same information obtained from Department A is an official secret, but if it was obtained from Department B, it is not. I reiterate that this is a different question from that of authorisation.
It should also be noted that 
 Datuk Haji Dzulkifli 
 dealt with official documents, and not merely information. In that context, it can be seen why the fact that the information contained in the documents is in the public domain is considered to be irrelevant. This is because, regardless of what information is contained in the document, the document itself had not been released or made available by any arm of the government to the public.
There is yet another class of information, and that is information that had not been formally released to the public but is of so innocuous a nature that nobody thought it necessary to do so formally. In this type of situation, whether the information is secret official information will depend on the manner the government chooses to treat it. In the absence of any express instruction or directive, it would be safe to assume that it is not secret official informaton.
Nevertheless, for the reasons I have stated, I accept that addresses of persons can, in principle, be secret official information if they are so treated. Whether the particular addresses mentioned have been proven to be such is an altogether different question. The prosecution rightly did not dispute that the burden of proving that the information is protected by the Act lay on them. The question in the present case is whether it had discharged this burden.
The prosecution called officers from the LTA and the RCB to testify that the relevant addresses here could not have been obtained from these departments. None of the persons mentioned owned any vehicles, and the address of one of them which could be found in the RCB database was obsolete. It was also agreed that the Housing and Development Board and Central Provident Fund do not release such information to members of the public.
However, the prosecution had not called the registration officer responsible for maintaining the electoral registers to give evidence. Under s 10(3) of the Parliamentary Elections Act (Cap 218) (PEA), the registers are required by law to be made available to the public after the publication of a notice by the minister in the 
 Gazette 
 under s 8. It is also apparent from s 10(1) that much of this information is from the NRO as the Commissioner of National Registration is statutorily obliged to assist the registration officer in the preparation of the registers.
Under s 14, the minister must, not later than three years from the last general election, require the registration officer to revise the registers of electors. Section 15(2) stipulates that upon the completion of the revision, the registration officer is required to pubish a notice in the 
 Gazette 
 and open the registers to inspection by members of the public. It can thus be seen that the registers of electors, by law, must be made available to the public at regular intervals.
In this respect, it is necessary to deal with the argument that the entries in registers of electors are not arranged by name or identity card numbers, but by constituency and street names. In my view, this is irrelevant. The mere fact that it is cumbersome to locate the information does not alter the fact that the information has been made available to the public through an authorised source. It may be difficult to look up a particular piece of information in the 
 Gazette 
, but there is no doubt that information already published in the 
 Gazette 
 is not an official secret protected by the Act. There is nothing to prevent someone from buying the complete collection of registers and scanning the information into a computer database. And even if there is, there is nothing to prevent someone stumbling on the address from publishing it in whatever manner he pleases.
At the material time in this case, the latest registers of electors appear to be for 1992. It was not disputed that the 1996 registers are now available for inspection by the public. It was also common ground that the registers of electors may be purchased by any member of the public. In the circumstances, it is a very nice question whether any change of address between 1992 and 1996 is information protected by the Act until the publication of the 1996 register, assuming that the registration officer does not make the information freely available during this period.
It may well be that in such situations, if a department treats that information as `confidential` or `secret` or in any other way which makes it clear that it should not be released or made available to the public, the information is secret official information under the Act. It is, after all, not the function of the courts to second-guess the government. It may also be the case that if, however, some other department, which is authorised to release this information or make it available to the public, does not expressly treat it as confidential or secret, and someone from that department releases the information or makes it available to the public, the release of this information could be treated as impliedly authorised. The information would thenceforth cease to be secret official information, regardless of how the first department chooses to treat it.
It is not necessary in this case to answer this question. The difficulty here is that the prosecution had not called any evidence to show that the addresses in question here were not available from the registration officer. There was therefore a real possibility that the information in this case was information that was made available to the public from an authorised source, namely, the registration officer. The registration officer`s evidence may be formal evidence, but the failure to call him left a gap in the prosecution`s case.
In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the prosecution had established even a prima facie case that the information forming the subject matter of these charges was official information protected by the Act. This would have been sufficient to dispose of the appeal. However, in view of the careful submissions made by both counsel for the appellant and the deputy public prosecutor, I should deal with some of the other pertinent issues raised.
 Dates of changes of addresses
The evidence led by the prosecution was that this information could not be obtained from other government departments. Mr Khoo for the appellant, however, showed the court that the latest returns from the RCB do provide the dates of changes. I have not been addressed on the issue whether this is adducing fresh evidence, but in the absence of any objection by the prosecution (quite properly), I take it that it is either admitted by consent or something the court may take judicial notice of.
There was, as was said earlier, no evidence led from the registration officer, but it was common ground that the registers of electors do not provide the dates of changes, though they can be estimated if one compares two different editions of the registers. It is therefore unlikely that the same information can be obtained from the registration officer. However, this is indulging in speculation, the danger of which was amply illustrated by the new returns from the RCB tendered by Mr Khoo. Again, I am of the view that a prima facie case has not been established as a result of the prosecution`s omission.
 Mens rea
This case also raises two questions about the issue of mens rea. The first is what mens rea is required for an offence under s 5(2). The second is what, if any, mens rea is required for an offence under s 5(1).
 Mens rea of a s 5(2) offence
In 
 PP v Phua Keng Tong 
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 279
  ; 
 
 
[1986] SLR 168
  , LP Thean J (as he then was) held that mens rea must be proven by the prosecution. The prosecution had no quarrel with this, save that it was contended before me that this does not apply to an offence under s 5(1). I shall deal with this argument later. First, I shall deal with the application of 
 Phua Keng Tong 
 in relation to an offence under s 5(2).
It was held in 
 Phua Keng Tong 
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 279
  at p 286; 
 
 
[1986] SLR 168
  at p 178 that: 
 
I agree that knowledge or reasonable ground of belief on the part of [the accused] must be actual knowledge and belief ...
 
 
 
The prosecution submitted that 
 Phua Keng Tong 
 was not binding on the district judge as the charges in the present case alleged that the appellant had reasonable ground for believing that the information was communicated to him in breach of the provisions of the Act. In 
 Phua Keng Tong 
, actual knowledge was alleged. This argument was accepted by the district judge.
In my view, the district judge was right. For the reasons argued by the prosecution, what was said in relation to reasonable ground for belief in 
 Phua Keng Tong 
 was obiter.
The district judge was also correct in his conclusion that a person has reasonable ground to believe a thing if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing, but not otherwise. The words `reasonable ground to believe` would be otiose if it meant the same thing as actual knowledge or belief.
 Prima facie case of mens rea?
Only two pieces of evidence were adduced by the prosecution to show that the appellant had reasonable ground to believe that the information was communicated to him in breach of the Act. The first was that the appellant knew that Ganesan was a field intelligence officer with the CID.
The second was an admission by the appellant in a statement P19 made on 14 and 21 July 1994 to the CPIB. At para 4, he said that: 
 
Ganesan told me that he could locate new or current addresses according to identity card numbers.
 
 
 
And at para 18, he added: 
 
... Ganesan did not tell me or describe to me how he went about tracing the latest addresses and date of change of addresses. I presume that as a police officer, he would have direct access to such information.
 
 
 
The district judge held that the mere fact that the appellant was aware that Ganesan was a field intelligence officer in the Intelligence Division of the CID was sufficient prima facie evidence of the appellant having reasonable ground to believe that the said information was given to him without authorization. 
 R v Crisp and Homewood 
 (1919) 83 JP 121 was relied on.
In that case, it was held that: 
 
In my opinion, the fact that he knew Crisp to be a person employed in a government office - in the War Office - is sufficient prima facie evidence on which the case must be left to the jury as showing that Homewood had reasonable grounds to believe at the time he received the information that it was being communicated to him in contravention of this Act. He must have known from the nature of the document itself that it was being produced either by being taken out of the War Office or by being copied from documents in the War Office.
 
 
 
In my view, the district judge erred. That case did not hold that the mere fact that Crisp was employed in a government office was sufficient prima facie evidence of reasonable ground on the part of Homewood to believe that the information was communicated to him in contravention of the UK Act. There was the additional consideration in that case that the nature of the document or information itself made it obvious that they were from the War Office. It must also not be forgotten that at the relevant time, which was 1915, the United Kingdom was in the midst of the First World War. The information related to contracts for the supply of officers` uniforms, including the names of the contractors, the numbers of articles supplied and the prices at which they were supplied. It was obvious at the time that such information was protected by the UK Official Secrets Act.
A very relevant consideration is the nature of the information received. This is not controversial and was accepted by the prosecution. If it is obvious that the information is official secret information, then the mere fact that it was received from someone working in the government would raise the inference that the recipient knew or had reasonable ground to believe that it was communicated to him in contravention of the Act. It would then be on him to offer some explanation as to why he thought otherwise.
If, however, the information appears innocuous and is widely believed to be in the public domain, then the mere fact that the supplier of the information works for the government need not lead to the inference that the recipient had reasonable ground to believe that it was communicated to him in contravention of the Act.
Taking the example of government contracts, it is well-known that the results of many government tenders in Singapore are published in the 
 Gazette 
. The published information includes a list of contractors who tendered for the contract, their tender prices and the tender that was accepted by the relevant government department. That being so, the mere fact that similar information is communicated to a recipient by a government officer is not sufficient to infer that ground exists for believing that that information was communicated to him in contravention of the Act.
In order to show a prima facie case of reasonable ground to believe, the prosecution in such cases must produce more evidence. This could include evidence that the recipient knew that this particular piece of information was not made available to the public, even though other similar information were.
Where information of a particular class are generally made available to the public, the mere fact that information falling within this class, but was exceptionally not released to the public, is divulged by some person working in the government is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case that there is ground for believing that the information was revealed in contravention of the Act. This will be so unless the recipient knew or had reasonable ground to believe that the information fell within the exception.
A reasonable person would think that if the information is made available to the public by Department A, then someone in Department B would similarly be authorised to release the same information to him. If for some reason, a particular piece of information of the same class is regarded as confidential and is not made available to the public, the same reasonable person would expect the officer concerned to tell him so and refuse his request for information. The mere fact that the information came from someone working in a government department adds little.
In the present case, the appellant knew that information on addresses of persons is widely available to the public from various government agencies. It was also not disputed that the NRO previously provided the service of giving lawyers the latest addresses of persons. It would thus be a jump in logic to say that mere knowledge that Ganesan was a field intelligence officer is sufficient to raise an inference that addresses given by him must have been given in contravention of the Act. I do not see how it can. It presupposes that the appellant had reason to suspect that these addresses, for whatever reasons, are secret official information though other addresses are not. There was no suggestion as to what was so special about the addresses of these persons that the appellant should realise that they might be secret official information.
No doubt, there was in this case the admitted difficulty in getting the latest addresses of defendants. However, `difficulty` is a vague concept. It only suggests that it was more convenient for the appellant to obtain the information from Ganesan, whom he knew. Unlike private search agencies, Ganesan did not ask to be paid, and it was no part of the prosecution`s case that the appellant paid Ganesan anything. Similarly, unlike going through the registers of electors manually, or going to a number of different government agencies, the appellant only had to make a telephone call to Ganesan.
The most natural belief in the circumstances would be that the difficulty arose out of inconvenience: that the information was `out there somewhere`, but finding it manually was tedious or expensive, but not illegal. I have already dealt with the `finding a needle in a haystack` type of difficulty. Sheer volume of information released with authority does not turn any part of the released information into secret official information.
In my view, difficulty per se is not a sufficient basis in the present case to say that the appellant had reasonable ground for belief. There was no reason to suppose that it was difficult to obtain the latest addresses because these were information protected by the Act.
In any event, it is more probable than not that it was truly the appellant`s belief, at least when he obtained the information from Ganesan, that the information was not protected by the Act. That was why he candidly remarked in his first statement to the CPIB that Ganesan had told him that he could obtain this information and that he had presumed that, as a police officer, Ganesan had access to this information.
The appellant was an experienced lawyer. If he had even suspected that addresses could possibly be secret official information, he would not have said what he did. This suggests that it did not even cross his mind that the information could be secret official information. Information on addresses is widely available, though perhaps not the latest ones. There was no reason for him, or anyone, to suppose that these particular addresses could be protected under the Act. The statement, the contents of which the district judge had held represented the truth, is the clearest evidence that it never crossed the appellant`s mind that addresses could be secret official information. With respect to the district judge, this defence could not possibly have been an afterthought.
As for the dates of changes of addresses, I do not see how a reasonable person would realise the significance of this seemingly innocuous piece of information. It would have taken considerable insight to link this information, even if useful, to secret official information. If there was no reason to suppose that the latest address is protected information, there was no reason to suppose that the date of change of address is.
 Mens rea of an offence under s 5(1)(c)
The deputy public prosecutor submitted that an offence under s 5(1) is a strict liability offence. This was despite LP Thean J`s judgment in 
 Phua Keng Tong 
 that it is a well-established general rule that mens rea is presumed to be a necessary ingredient of an offence in the absence of clear words to the contrary and that this rule applies to an offence under s 5(1). The crux of the deputy public prosecutor`s submission was that the mischief aimed at is the unauthorised disclosure of State secrets. The argument was that the object of protecting State secrets will be promoted if strict liability is imposed on all government servants not to disclose such information.
I do not find this argument persuasive, and I agree with LP Thean J that mens reas is a necessary ingredient for an offence under s 5(1). According to the deputy public prosecutor`s submissions, LP Thean J in 
 Phua Keng Tong 
 had difficulty in stating what the requisite mens rea is. Whatever may have been the case there, I have no difficulty at all in stating what the requisite mens rea is for an offence under s 5(1)(c)(i).
First, I agree with Lord Reid in 
 Chandler v DPP 
 
[1964] AC 763
 at p 793 that `the wrongful communication of official information ... is an offence ... whatever the purpose of the communicator.` Purpose and motive, be it to prejudice the interests of the State, money or misguided idealism is quite irrelevant. The same was held in 
 R v Fell 
 [1963] Crim LR 207. However, that is very far from saying that the offence is one of strict liability, for in many, if not most, offences, motive is not an ingredient of the requisite mens rea.
In my view, the mens rea required for an offence under s 5(1)(c)(i) is, first, an intention to communicate the information or thing. The word communication by itself connotes intention. One does not `communicate` unintentionally. An intention to commit the actusreus of communicating is therefore necessary. This was stated by McCowan J in 
 R v Ponting 
 [1986] Crim LR 318, and I do not see how the prosecution can rely on that case as authority for the proposition that the offence is one of strict liability. There is no need to stretch the words of sub-para (i) to include negligence or recklessness, as that is amply dealt with under sub-para (iv).
Secondly, there must be knowledge that the information is secret official information. The same applies to the other things mentioned in s 5(1). I do not see how removing the requirement of knowledge will be workable. It must not be forgotten that officers of government departments often have to provide information to members of the public or even to foreign powers. The government does not work in a vacuum. It is a fact of life that the actual duty of communication is often delegated to subordinates. A minister does not always personally release the official information to the public. He may delegate that task to his minister of state, who may in turn delegate it to the permanent secretary and so on down the chain. The person actually doing the communication may well turn out to be a very junior officer.
Likewise, such communication may include information that may or may not be secret official information. It is no part of the duty of the junior officer to question each and every order from his superiors to communicate the information to whomever he is directed to. Adopting a strict liability approach would mean that the junior officer would have committed an offence under this Act if, unknown to him, his superior or someone higher up actually has no authority to order the release of the information or has wrongly (or wrongfully) classified certain information as not being secret official information. Likewise, a secretary may be liable if his or her superior mistakenly addresses a secret document to the wrong addressee or classifies a document as `open` and she sends the document.
An officer or government servant is entitled to rely on his or her superior`s representation that any particular piece of information is not secret official information. This extends to situations where it is not the duty of the officer or government servant concerned to communicate information. The entire civil service cannot operate like the secret police. In any event, the deputy public prosecutor has not explained how imposing strict liability on a member of the public can further the objective of protecting government secrets.
It follows from the above that a third element required of the mens rea is that the communicator must know that he, in fact, did not have the authority to communicate the information to the person concerned, or that it was not his duty to do so.
Lastly, in the case of an offence under the second limb of para (c), the communicator must know or have reasonable grounds to believe that the information or thing was obtained in contravention of the Act. It must be stressed that the words used in para (c) are `obtained in contravention of this Act` and not `communicated to him in contravention of this Act`. The two are not the same, though they may lead to the same conclusion.
It follows therefore that in the present case, as the appellant did not know and had no reasonable ground for believing that the addresses were secret official information, the charges under s 5(1)(c)(i) had also not been proven.
 The defence
In view of my decision above, I do not need to deal with the appellant`s defence in any detail. It only remains for me to mention a couple of points.
 Rebuttal evidence
The appellant, naturally, could give no useful evidence in relation to the source of Ganesan`s information as he did not have first hand knowledge. However, it is still open to him to challenge the prosecution`s proof. After all, the burden was on the prosecution to prove that information of the addresses was communicated to him in contravention of the Act.
Mr Khoo submitted that the prosecution ought not to have been allowed to call PW12 as a rebuttal witness. PW12 was the managing director of Creditnet Pte Ltd. Ganesan`s witness, one Krishna (DW4) had testified that he had supplied Ganesan with the information forming the subject-matter of the present charges. Ganesan`s evidence was that this information was obtained from Creditnet, specifically through one Sheila, who worked there. PW12 was called to rebut this by proving that the information could not have come from Creditnet because Creditnet was not in possession of some of the information communicated by Ganesan.
The district judge held that the court had to examine all the circumstances to determine whether it would be unfair to the accused and result in an injustice to him if PW12 was allowed to be called. PW12`s evidence was essential to the just and truthful determination of the case. In any event, even if the stricter test that the prosecution cannot have reasonably foreseen that a particular piece of evidence is necessary was applied, PW12`s evidence could still be called in rebuttal. In the district judge`s view, the prosecution did not require PW12`s evidence to fill any gap in the prosecution`s case. Its case has already been established. Furthermore, the defence had been very secretive of the `mystical` source of Ganesan`s information.
The law in relation to the calling of rebuttal evidence was recently dealt with by the Court of Appeal in 
 Zainal bin Kuning & Ors v Chan Sin Mian Michael 
 
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 121
  . In that case, LP Thean JA said at p 132: 
 
It is true that a discretion lies with the trial judge to allow the plaintiff to call evidence to rebut evidence of the defence: 
 Williams v Davies
 1 Cr & M 464; 149 ER 481. This is so even where the defence was disclosed in the cross-examination of the plaintiff and his witnesses: 
 Shaw v Beck
 (1853) 8 Exch 392. Generally, leave will be granted where the party has been misled or taken by surprise: 
 Bigsby v Dickinson
 (1876) 4 Ch D 24. The same principles were enunciated in 
 Rafiq Jumabhoy v Alrich
 
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 1
  . There, Chao Hick Tin J said, at p 32:
 
 
 
`It seems to me settled law that evidence in rebuttal should only be permitted to a plaintiff (i) if a matter or development has quite unexpectedly arisen during trial which the plaintiff could not reasonably anticipate or (ii) in answer to evidence of the defendant in support of an issue, the proof of which lay upon the defendant: see 
 Supreme Court Practice
 Vol 1, para 38/17. Evidence in rebuttal is not allowed to merely confirm the plaintiffs` case: see 
 Jacobs v Tarleton
 (1848) 11 QB 421.`
 
 
 
In this case, for the reason we have given it certainly cannot be said that Mr Raj Kumar`s evidence was not sought to be admitted earlier because the appellants were either misled or taken by surprise or that `a matter of development` quite unexpectedly arose which they, the appellants, could not have reasonably anticipated.
 
 
 
I am bound by 
 Zainal bin Kuning 
. I do not think that that case can be distinguished on the ground that it was a criminal case. If anything, this rule ought to be more strictly applied in a criminal case. I made no such distinction in 
 Jusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP 
 
 
 
[1996] 3 SLR 29

 Osman bin Ali v PP 
 
 
 
[1972] 2 MLJ 178
  ; 
 
 [1972-1974] SLR 106 
 , which was relied on by the district judge, was a case dealing with the defence of diminished responsibility. In such a case, the burden of establishing the defence was on the defendant. It is of no assistance. For this reason, the wider test used by the district judge cannot be supported.
There is no question here of the burden of proof on any issue falling on the defence. The question is simply whether the prosecution was misled or taken by surprise, or that a matter had arisen quite unexpectedly in the trial which the prosecution could not reasonably have anticipated. With respect to the district judge, I think the prosecution ought reasonably to have realised that PW12`s evidence was necessary.
It was not disputed in this case that the investigating officer, PW10, interviewed DW4. This was a direct consequence of Ganesan saying that the information was supplied by DW4. It was also admitted that DW4 subsequently sent two faxes to the CPIB, one on 20 July and the second on 21 July 1994. The first was sent to PW10. The second was sent to the Director, CPIB. In both faxes, it was alleged that PW10 had not recorded down answers given by DW4 in relation to Creditnet. The second fax was in fact a complaint to the Director CPIB. It was common ground that the complaint was treated seriously enough for an investigation to be carried out on PW10. It was also common ground that PW10 had interviewed PW12 and Sheila.
In the circumstances, I do not see how it could be said that the prosecution could not reasonably have anticipated that the defence would call evidence that the information was obtained from DW4 and that DW4 would in turn say that he got the information from Creditnet. DW4, who was merely a witness, had made serious allegations against the investigation officer alleging failure to record certain parts of his statement. Whether the allegations were true or not, it would have been obvious that there was a real likelihood that the defence would wish to call this evidence. The allegations were a shot fired across the bow that DW4 was likely to give evidence.
The district judge held that PW12`s evidence was not necessary for the prosecution to establish its case. The prosecution had already established its case. With respect, PW12`s evidence was indeed called to bolster the prosecution`s case that the information was obtained from the CID on-line system. It was the prosecution`s burden to prove this. The prosecution cannot call rebuttal evidence to merely confirm its case. I do not agree with the district judge, for, in all cases where the defence is called, the prosecution has established a case against the accused. If there had been a gap or a defect in the prosecution`s case, the defence should not be called at all, and there will be no question of calling rebuttal evidence.
It is open to the defence to call evidence to poke holes in the prosecution`s evidence. The prosecution is not allowed to call rebuttal evidence merely because the defence appears to have succeeded in doing so. It is unfair to the defence. There will be no end to proceedings.
I must therefore reluctantly hold that the district judge should not have allowed the prosecution to call PW12. PW12 should have been called as part of the prosecution`s case. The omission is unfortunate, but it was made, and it does not appear that the defect can be cured, for the district judge assessed DW4`s credibility by relying on PW12`s testimony. In the circumstances, I cannot say that, even without PW12`s evidence, the district judge would inevitably have come to the conclusion that the information could not have come from Sheila.
The deputy public prosecutor submitted that there was also the confession of Ganesan that he obtained the information from the CID on-line system. I only need to point out that this confession is not admissible against the appellant at all in relation to the last three charges. Section 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) allows the confession of an accused to be admissible against the co-accused in a joint trial only when they are charged with the 
 same 
 offence. Ganesan`s charges had nothing to do with any unauthorised communication to PW1 by the appellant. They are not the same offences. If this appears confusing, the prosecution should bear this in mind when drafting charges and applying for joinder. Confusion can lead to misjoinder.
 Whether the appellant had reasonable ground to believe that the information came from the CID
Lastly, it remains for me to deal with the appellant`s defence that he did not know that the information came from the CID. In my view, this defence has no merit. The question is not whether the appellant knew whether Ganesan obtained the information from his office. The question is whether there is reasonable ground to believe that that was the case, which incidentally is also an altogether different question from whether it was in fact so obtained. The appellant knew that Ganesan was a field intelligence officer. It was obvious that Ganesan would probably use the facilities in the CID to obtain these addresses. It is hard to see how the appellant`s state of mind in relation to the source of the information could be said to be anything less than shutting his eye to the obvious.
 Conclusion
Nevertheless, for the reasons I have stated, I am of the view that the convictions cannot stand. I will allow the appeal and acquit the appellant. The fines which he has paid will be repaid to him.

The defendant, being dissatisfied against an award of damages for defamation in the sum of $45,000 now appeals against the said award of damages only he having admitted liability.
The plaintiff is a registered architect with the Board of Architects practising under the name and style of Au & Associates. The defendant is a businessman. The plaintiff was appointed by the defendant sometime in 1987 as his architect to design and supervise the construction of a two-storey house for him at 69 Jalan Lim Tai See. The building contract was awarded to Seng Leong Construction Pte Ltd (`Seng Leong`) for a sum of $1m. The consultant engineers were Ms Building Engineering Consultants (BEC).
The plaintiff brought proceedings for libel against the defendant . At the hearing, the defendant `s solicitors having informed the plaintiff`s solicitors the previous day of the defendant`s intention not to contest the libel action, did not accordingly contest the same. The defendant had through his solicitors in the previous day`s letter also made an open offer to pay the plaintiff $25,000 damages in full and final settlement in respect of the defamatory statement he made. The plaintiff did not accept the offer. The defamatory statement was contained in a letter dated 20 November 1996 addressed to the plaintiff and copied to Building Control Division (`BCD`) of the Public Works Division (`PWD`), to their own solicitors Michael Khoo & BB Ong and their contractors, Seng Leong. Seng Leong`s director, Andrew Lim Khim Song, in his affidavit said he had read the letter. It was also read by the plaintiff`s secretary who opened the mail. The defendant had also sent unknown to the plaintiff then, an earlier letter dated 16 November 1991 containing the same defamatory statement to the Building Control Division and copied to Seng Leong and Ms Michael Khoo & BB Ong. The defendant did not dispute sending the two letters and copies as stated.
Briefly, according to the plaintiff, sometime in May 1991, whilst the construction of the house was in progress, the plaintiff at a site meeting, informed the defendant that he had a friend who was interested to buy the defendant`s house for $2.5m. The plaintiff when asked by the defendant if he knew the value of the property, did not answer him. Although queried by the defendant, the plaintiff did not disclose the name of his friend who was interested in purchasing the said house.
On 8 October 1991, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant, copied to Seng Leong and BEC informing him that his house was nearing completion noting at the same time that some furniture had been moved in. The plaintiff advised the defendant that it was an offence to occupy the premises as the application for temporary occupation permit (TOP) was then underway. This advice was repeated in a letter again by the plaintiff to the defendant on 14 October 1991 as the plaintiff observed at a site meeting on that day, the premises showed signs of occupation. The advice was again rendered to the defendant by letter on 4 November 1991 and that he refrain from occupation. These letters were copied to the BCD. The letter of the 14 October was copied to Seng Leong, BEC and BCD whilst the letter of 4 November 1991 was copied again to the same parties and additionally to M/s Michael Khoo & BB Ong the relevant parties.
By letter on 12 November 1991, BCD referred to the plaintiff`s letter dated 14 October 1991 and 4 November 1991 and cautioned the defendant of the contravention which was referred to by the plaintiff and further requested the defendant to vacate the premises. By letter dated 13 November 1991 the plaintiff pointed out to the defendant that the plaintiff would not be responsible if the applications were to be rejected in respect of the TOP or Certificate of Statutory Compliance (CSC).
The plaintiff thereafter received a letter from the defendant addressed to him dated 20 November 1991. The letter complained about his conduct concerning the supervision of the construction of the house and other matters. But in para 6 of the letter, the defendant stated: 
 
You had attempted to con me by informing me that you had a friend who is interested in the said property and that the same is worth only $2.5m, when you are fully aware that the property is worth more than $3.5m. When queried further you were unable to disclose the buyer. I take a very serious view of the matter.
 
 
 
As for the earlier letter dated 16 November 1991 to BCD, the defendant whilst admitting storing some furniture in the premises, cleaning of the premises by a maid everyday, occasionally using the swimming pool, keeping a dog there and leaving the lights on at night for security reasons denied at the same time that he was in occupation of the premises. He also alleged that the plaintiff had certain grievance against him. He then made under para 3 of his letter, the same offending remarks as repeated in para 6 of the letter of 20 November addressed to the plaintiff. In his defence, the defendant had pleaded justification and fair comment - that he had not written the words falsely or maliciously and had written them in response to the remarks made by the plaintiff at a site meeting sometime in October 1991. He had asserted in the defence that it was true the plaintiff had said his house was worth $2.5m. He said the plaintiff ought to have known it was worth more than $2.5m and had thus attempted to use his influence to sell the house at below the market price and further or in the alternative that what he said in the letters of 20 November and 16 November was in any case fair comment. He also alleged that the plaintiff had been suspended once before from practice for a short period. plaintiff`s Counsel admitted the suspension which he said was for six months and that it was for failure to inform the relevant authority that a contractor had carried out unauthorised works although he had written to the contractors warning them of the same. Defence counsel did not take issue with this explanation.
The defendant by his counsel having admitted liability in respect of the libel contained in the offending paragraph of the letter dated 20 November 1996 which was a re-statement of the libel in an earlier letter dated 16 November 1996 to the BCD and having abandoned his defences, the plaintiff submitted that the defendant was actuated by malice in making the libellous statements and that aggravated damages be awarded to the plaintiff which in the plaintiff`s solicitors assessment should be in the region of $80,000.
Counsel for the defendant submitted that damages payable should be $25,000 and that an open offer to that extent had been made and as such that aggravated damages should not be awarded. It was submitted that there had been no malice on the part of the defendant; that the publication was restrictive being by letter and it was sent to explain his position; that the plaintiff had been suspended previously by the Architects Board and that the defendant had additionally shown remorse by admitting liability.
On the facts, I was satisfied that the offending passage was defamatory of the plaintiff as was the passage in the earlier letter dated 16 November 1991. The said passage may be divided into the following assertions of fact of which facts (i) and (iv) were undisputed: 
(i) the plaintiff informed the defendant that he had a friend who was interested to purchase the property; 
(ii) the plaintiff had informed the defendant that the property was worth $2.5m; 
(iii) the plaintiff was fully aware that the property was worth more than $3.5m; 
(iv) when the defendant queried the plaintiff further he was unable to disclose the name of the interested buyer.
The defendant having admitted liability he was also deemed thereby to have admitted that the assertions of fact by him in paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above were untrue and /or that he had no basis for any belief that they were true and that on the other hand the plaintiff`s assertion that he was merely conveying an offer to the defendant of a friend to purchase the house at $2.5m was the true version of the events and further that there was nothing to suggest that the plaintiff said or knew or was aware that the property was worth $3.5m then.
As such, I accepted the plaintiff`s submission and found that the natural and ordinary meaning of the word `con` in the offending statement in paragraph 3 of the letter dated 20 November 1991 meant naturally and ordinarily according to the dictionary meaning, to deceive, to trick, an instance of cheating, a confidence trickster and that an ordinary person reading the defendant`s statement would conclude of the plaintiff: 
(a) that the plaintiff is a dishonest and deceitful architect who had attempted to swindle and/or cheat the defendant; 
(b) that the plaintiff is a confidence trickster who had tried to trick and/or deceive the defendant; 
(c) that the plaintiff had adopted dishonest means in an attempt to defraud the defendant; 
(d) that the plaintiff had made improper use of his postiion as the defendant`s architect in order to deceive and/or cheat the defendant; 
(e) that the plaintiff is guilty of dishonourable and discreditable conduct and motive and is an unfit person to associate with;
and that based upon the above natural and ordinary meaning of the defendant`s said statement, the plaintiff`s estimation and reputation would be lowered in the eyes of right thinking members of society generally.
As to the determination of the quantum of damages, I was satisfied that the plaintiff was entitled to aggravaged damages having regard to the defendant`s conduct which I hold was actuated by express malice and to cause injury to the plaintiff`s feelings. As to the factors in the assessment of damages concerning the effect of a libel on the plaintiff`s feelings, Pearson LJ in 
 McCarey v Associated Newspapers Ltd (No 2) 
 
[1965] 2 QB 86
 at p 104 stated: 
 
Compensory damages, in a case in which they are at large, may include several different kinds of compensation to the injured plaintiff. They may include note only actual pecuniary loss and anticipated pecuniary loss or any social disadvantages which result, or may be thought likely to result, from the wrong which has been done. They may also include the natural injury to his feelings - the natural grief and distress which he may have felt at having been spoken of in defamatory terms, and if there has been any kind of high-handed, oppressive, insulting or contumelious behaviour by the defendant which increases the mental pain and suffering caused by the defamation and may constitute injury to the plaintiff`s pride and self-confidence, those are proper elements to be taken into account in a case where the damages are at large.
 
 
 
Apart from the above elements, failure to apologise and an unsucessful plea of justification are factors likely to increase the quantum of damages.
The submissions of the defence counsel may now be considered. One was that the defendant by his letter of 16 November 1991 was merely replying to the plaintiff`s letters to him and copied to BCD concerning his occupation of the property. That to my mind may well be so but the defendant went the uncalled for extra length to defame the plaintiff by the libellous paragraph I have referred to and then to repeat it. The paragraphs in both the letters of 16 November to BCD and on 20 November to the plaintiff and copied to others had nothing to do with the question of his occupation of the property or otherwise. Indeed, the incident referred to in the paragraphs had occurred some six months earlier and the inescapable inference is that he deliberately twisted what the plaintiff said to hurt and damage the standing of the plaintiff in the eyes of BCD officers upon whose goodwill the plaintiff`s professional career depended. It was calculated to destroy the plaintiff`s credit and reputation with the BCD. The ill-will of the defendant is manifest when he had also stated in the letter of 20 November 1991 that he found the plaintiff`s behaviour `unimaginable and disgusting` in relation to a site meeting and of his refusal to have any more meetings with him. He had also in that letter disparagingly recalled and referred to the plaintiff`s suspension as an architect for a period of time. The plaintiff`s solicitor had explained the suspension as I have set out which was not disputed by the defendant. Quite obviously the plaintiff was entitled to and had a duty to inform the BCD by copy letters sent to them addressed to the defendant that from his observation the defendant was in occupation of the premises and that he should not occupy the premises pending grant of the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) to preserve his own position with BCD. By copying the letter to the BCD it was obvious that the defendant`s express motive was to oppressively impugn the character of the plaintiff. I inferred that his intention by falsely narrating the incident referred to in the offending paragraph and using the word `con` and drawing the BCD`s attention to his previous suspension was his hope that BCD would investigate the matter perhaps leading to further disciplinary action and punishment of the plaintiff and thereby to cause him mental pain and distress. The offending communication by the letter of 16 November to BCD was also surreptitious. Whilst copies were sent to his own solicitors and Seng Leong, none was sent to the plaintiff. The defendant`s behaviour was therefore highhanded and aggravating and went beyond the confines of circumstances which would only attract simple general damages.
I further held that there was no substance to the defendant`s counsel`s submission that the defendant by admitting liability was showing his remorse. The admission of liability was at the eleventh hour - a day before the trial and no doubt brought about by the defendant`s inevitable realisation that his defence would not stand up scrutiny in court. I found the defendant`s offer of $25,000 damages at the very low end even without the aggravating factors I have taken into consideration. The case law quoted by defence counsel consisted mostly of older Malaysian cases awarding damages from RM5,000 to RM30,000 and are easily distinguishable apart from not reflecting current values in Singapore. Having regard to the aggravating factors including the failure to apologise and an unsuccessful plea of justification, ie insistence upon the truth of the statement until the hour of the hearing, I assessed damages and awarded the sum of $45,000 to the plaintiff with costs to be taxed. In awarding the above sum, I had moderated the damages recognising that the libel was not widespread as in the case of a journal or newspaper publication and that the plaintiff was not a community or public figure.

 The parties
This is an appeal by the defendants to judge-in-chambers from the decision of Senior Assistant Registrar Mr James Leong granting interlocutory judgment in a libel action brought by the plaintiffs. They are Mr S Jayakumar, Mr S Chandra Das, Mr Sushilan Vasoo, Mr K Shanmugam and Mr Sinnakaruppan s/o C Ramasamy. They are also members of the People`s Action Party, the ruling party. They are all members of Parliament. The first plaintiff is a member of the Cabinet and has been so since 1984. At present he is the only Tamil in the Cabinet.
The libel was said to be in an article in Tamil which appeared in the August 1995 issue of
 The Hammer 
, the organ of the Workers` Party, an opposition party.
The action is against 13 defendants. The first defendant, Mr JB Jeyaretnam, is the secretary general of the party. The next ten defendants are members of the executive council of the party. Mr JB Jeyaretnam is also a member of the executive council. The 12th defendant, Mr A Balakrishnan, was the author of the article and he is a member of the party but not of the executive council. The Workers` Party is the 13th defendant.
 The background
I shall first narrate the background facts leading up to the publication of the article. In April 1995, a series of events was organized to promote the use of the Tamil language among Tamils in Singapore. They extended over a period of one week and it was described as `The Tamil Language Week` (the Week). An organizing committee was formed to arrange the programmes for the week. None of the plaintiffs was a member of the organizing committee. The organizing committee received the support of 25 Tamil organizations in Singapore.
The plaintiffs participated in the Week by gracing or speaking at the various events of the Week. Some of the plaintiffs had assisted by advising or giving a hand to the organizing committee.
The article in question appeared in 
 The Hammer 
 after a lapse of three months after the Week. It was not a long article. The title in translation was: `The Tamil Language Week - A Drama Enacted to a Written Ruling`.
The plaintiffs felt that the article was defamatory of them. So they instructed Allen & Gledhill, Advocates and Solicitors, who on 25 September 1995 wrote to the Workers` Party as follows : 
 
We act for Professor S Jayakumar, Mr S Chandra Das, Dr S Vasoo, Mr K Shanmugam and Mr R Sinnakaruppan.
 
 
 
We refer to an article in Tamil published in the August 1995 issue of 
 The Hammer
 at p 9 under the title `The Tamil Language Week - A Drama Enacted to the Written Ruling`.
 
 
 
In the article, the following passages appeared (translations being set out below).
 
 
 
`Amidst the pack of vultures determined to keep a number of intellectuals from increasing, we take pride in seeing the white doves of 25 Tamil organisations join the national mainstream of Tamil Language Week.
 
 
 
Having begun at the Marina Mandarin in April, it ended at the Orchard Mandarin with the slogan, `Let us speak sweet Tamil everyday`. It should not stop with the bustle of Tamil Language Week. Although the Tamil Language Week was a drama enacted to the written ruling of the Government, it turned out to be a festival that shared the feelings of the Tamils. The feeling for the Tamil Language is inseparable from our lives. There are still plenty of service, tasks we have yet to do for Tamil. To those who are elated that they have conducted the Tamil Language Week in a manner to be proud of, we wish to narrate the beginnings.
 
 
 
The Westernised ministers and Members of Parliament who represent us, spoke at the function more in English only than in Tamil. Can those who are supposed to guide us behave so? We are now at a stage when we must judge those who kill and devour their own conscience.
 
 
 
Mr Shanmugam, Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC, who was part of a team visiting China, cut his trip short and returned to Singapore before the rest of the team did to participate in the closing ceremony of the ` Tamil Language Week` and proudly claimed that he had hurried back, without participating in many other functions, for the sake of Tamil. However, at the beginning of this year we saw in the newspapers that our Member of Parliament, Mr Sinnakaruppan had been invited to the Eighth World Tamil Conference, and that he would participate in it. But he issued a statement to say that he was not attending the Conference. We know that no one attended the Conference on behalf of the Government. Tamil is an official language of this country only in name.`
 
 
 
The natural and ordinary meaning of the passages set out above (especially read in the context of the article as a whole) are as follows. 
(1) The Tamil Language Week was staged at the direction of the Government to hoodwink Singaporeans (and in particular Singaporean Tamils) into believing that Tamil was being promoted in Singapore. Professor Jayakumar, Mr Chandra Das, Dr Vasoo, Mr Shanmugam and Mr Sinnakaruppan (who are all associated with the Government and who took part in the ceremonies held during the Tamil Language Week and/or were associated with organising the celebrations of the Tamil Language Week) are insincere and hypocritical political opportunists and Government stooges, in that they were parties to the staging of the Tamil Language Week in the foregoing manner, without any sincere wish to promote the Tamil Language. 
(2) Professor Jayakumar, Dr Vasoo, Mr Shanmugam and Mr Sinnakaruppan (all of whom spoke at the various functions organised as part of the Tamil Language Week Celebrations) spoke more in English than in Tamil during the said ceremonies and thereby were only paying lip service to the promotion of the Tamil language, and our clients are therefore insincere and hypocritical political opportunists. 
(3) Mr Shanmugam boasted about his sacrifice in cutting short his China trip to participate in the Closing Ceremony and thereby sought to obtain cheap political advantage, and that therefore he is (read in the context of the whole article) an insincere hypocrite. 
(4) Mr Sinnakaruppan failed to serve the interest of the Tamil language by not attending the Eighth World Tamil Conference (after it had been announced that he would be participating) but nevertheless attended the Singapore function for the purpose of promoting his political career, and that therefore he is an insincere hypocrite.
 
 
 
The facts are as follows. 
(1) Our clients participated in the said functions and gave support to the Tamil Language Week in the sincere wish to promote Tamil Language. At the Opening Ceremony held on 8 April 1995, Professor Jayakumar spoke longer in Tamil than in English. Mr Sinnakaruppan spoke at the SLF Auditorium on 10 April 1995 only in Tamil, and the length of Dr Vasoo`s speech in Tamil at the Anglo-Chinese School (Dover Road) on 15 April 1995 was comparable to that of his English speech. Although he did not participate in any of the public ceremonies, Mr Chandra Das devoted probably as much time as anyone towards making the Tamil Language Week a success and was, in effect, a principal adviser throughout. 
(2) Mr Shanmugam made no reference in any context (either in his speech at the Closing Ceremony or elsewhere) to cutting short his China trip. There can therefore be no basis for suggesting that Mr Shanmugam `boasted` about cutting short his China trip. 
(3) Mr Sinnakaruppan was invited over the telephone to attend the Eighth World Tamil Conference. He had to decline the invitation, and had never announced that he would be attending the Conference. 
(4) In the circumstances, there can be no valid suggestion or inference that any of our clients were insincere or hypocritical or that they took part in Tamil Language Week only for the purpose of seeking political gain.
 
 
 
Accordingly, the article published by you is clearly defamatory of our clients.
 
 
 
Our clients therefore require that you : 
(a) publish an apology in English and Tamil in the next issue of 
 The Hammer 
, an apology in Tamil in 
 Tamil Murasu 
 and an apology in English in 
 The Straits Times 
.
 
 
 
The terms of the apology in English and Tamil, and the mode of publication must have our clients` prior approval; 
(b) disclose the name of the author(s) of the article; 
(c) give an undertaking that you will not repeat or publish any of these defamatory allegations in the future; 
(d) pay damages to each of our clients, the quantum of which can be discussed after you admit liability; and 
(e) pay our clients` full legal costs.
 
 
 
If we do not hear from you within seven days from the date of this letter, we will proceed to issue a writ against you. If you intend to contest the proceedings, please advise us which solicitors will accept service of process on your behalf.
A similar letter was sent to Mr JB Jeyaretnam on the same day. To each of the other defendants Allen & Gledhill sent a letter on 10 October 1995, the text of which was as follows : 
 
We enclose a copy of a letter dated 25 September 1995 which we have written to the Workers` Party, the contents of which are self-explanatory.
 
 
 
As you are named as one of the members of the Executive Council of the Workers` Party, as well as editors or members of the Editorial Board of 
 The Hammer
, we put you on notice that our clients hold you responsible for the publication of this article and will look to you for satisfaction of the reliefs claimed in our letter.
 
 
 
Our clients require a reply from you by close of business on 12 October as to whether you will comply with the demands set out in our letter of 25 September.
 
 
 
Allen & Gledhill received a response to the further letter from G Krishnan & Co. The text of the letter dated 2 October 1995 was as follows: 
 
Your letter of 25 September 1995 addressed to the Workers` Party and Mr JB Jeyaretnam have been handed to us with instructions to reply thereto.
 
 
 
The Workers` Party is the publisher of 
 The Hammer
. The paper is published in four languages. Each language section has its own editor who is responsible for what is published in the section. Mr A Balakrishnan, a member of the party, is the editor of the Tamil section. You have asked for the name of the author of the article. Mr Balakrishnan is the author of the article. It was written by him and he takes full responsibility for whatever appeared in the article. He has instructed us to act for him in any proceedings over the article. Mr JB Jeyaretnam is the editor of the English section.
 
 
 
We are instructed, and this was also our own understanding, that the organisers of the Tamil language week were 25 Tamil associations or bodies. An organising committee was set up to organise all functions to mark the week. None of your clients is mentioned in the book that was published to mark the week as having anything to do with the organising of the functions or events.
 
 
 
Our clients have obtained a certified translation of the article into English and from the translation the following emerges. The article was critical of the 25 associations and the organisers who were responsible for all arrangements for the functions. The article lauded the 25 associations in coming together to organise the language week but asked what had been achieved by the event.
 
 
 
Your clients, with the exception of Mr Chandra Das, spoke at certain functions and the article question their prowess in the language and whether they had done enough to promote the language before taking part in the language week.
 
 
 
If you accept what we have said, the high-water mark of the criticism of your clients is that they have been found wanting in efforts to promote the Tamil language in Singapore.
 
 
 
The meaning `hypocrite` or `hypocritical` which your clients allege is contained in the article adds nothing more to the general allegation that the 25 organisations had not done enough to promote the cause of the Tamil language.
 
 
 
We have only said all this to try to convince your clients that the article is not a malicious attack on them. Except for Mr K Shanmugam and Mr R Sinnakaruppan, none of your other clients is mentioned by name.
 
 
 
However, the party does not wish to be seen as being insensitive to your clients` feelings. The Party is sorry for any embarrassment or anguish caused to your clients by the article.
 
 
 
The article only appeared in the Tamil section and was directed only to Tamil readers. Only a small proportion of those who bought the paper are Tamils. The major proportion - almost 90% - of the issue so far sold (about 8,500 copies) were bought by Chinese readers conversant in English and/or Chinese on whom the article would have been lost. The balance of 10% were bought by Malays and Indians.
 
 
 
If you will let us have the text of the apology your clients require from our clients, our clients will revert on your several demands. Our clients wish to be conciliatory and do whatever is reasonable to find a solution satisfactory to your clients and hope your clients will reciprocate.
 
 
 
The letter dated 12 October 1995 from G Krishnan drew a somewhat irate reply from Allen & Gledhill in the following terms : 
 
We refer to your letter of 2 October 1995. The tone and contents of your letter are highly offensive and add insult to injury. Our clients will rely on the contents of your letter as seriously aggravating the situation. You also have not stated clearly whether the demands in our letter will be met. Our clients` patience is running out.
 
 
 
The text of the proposed apology is enclosed. We want your response by close of business on 14 October 1995. If we do not hear from you by then, in terms accepting all demands contained in our letter of 25 September 1995 and confirming agreement to publish the apology as enclosed, then a writ will be issued.
 
 
 
The next material letter was from G Krishnan dated 19 October 1995 and addressed to Allen & Gledhill. Its contents were as follows : 
 
We have now taken our clients` instructions on your letter of 12 October 1995.
 
 
 
Our clients will publish the apology enclosed with your letter. However, our clients feel that some modifications are necessary, modifications that do not alter the substance of your apology but which attempt to inform the readers correctly of the facts as they are. Our clients feel this is necessary especially so since your apology does not set out the passages in the article which your clients say are defamatory. You appreciate that it is normal in any apology to set out the words complained of and the meaning that would be understood by the readers.
 
 
 
We accordingly enclose a revised apology of our clients.
 
 
 
The opening paragraph makes it clear that the article was written by a Party member and the Party, as publishers, accept responsibility for the article. Consequently, the Party has altered the opening words `We had alleged ...` in the paragraphs that follow to `The article alleged ...` This is correct on the facts. The governing body of the Party, the Executive Council, was not itself making the allegations.
 
 
 
Paragraph 2 - the Party, has deleted the last sentence. On our clients` own admission all the speakers spoke in English and Tamil with the exception of Mr Sinnakaruppan. The article was therefore not completely inaccurate when it said albeit that speakers spoke more in English than in Tamil.
 
 
 
Paragraph 4 - the article said Mr Sinnakaruppan had been invited to the Tamil Conference but did not attend. Your draft apology does not make clear he was invited, which we understand your clients accept. Consequently, the Party has deleted the words `... were and are false and baseless.` The Party`s addition makes quite clear that the Party withdraws any defamatory allegation arising from his failure to attend.
 
 
 
Finally, the Party is of the view that it is enough that the apology comes from the author and the Executive Council. The Party is the publisher, not the individual members of the Executive Council. Further, they are not all on the Editorial Board.
 
 
 
We note that your clients require the apology to be published in 
 The Straits Times
. Our clients have no objection but we think it right to point out that such publication will only serve to bring to the notice of hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans, who at present are blissfully ignorant of any allegation made of your clients.
 
 
 
Lastly our clients have no great objection to offering Mr Chandra Das an apology but again we should point out that the article makes no reference to him at all. The Members of Parliament in the article clearly referred to those who spoke. Mr Chandra Das never spoke.
 
 
 
The Party in demonstration of its good faith has withdrawn the article. The article has been `blacked out` in all issues sold after your letter was received. If your clients wish to see a copy with the article `blacked out` we will send you one.
 
 
 
We wait to hear from you.
 
 
 
It is unnecessary to reproduce the text of the revised apology because Allen & Gledhill on 31 October 1995 responded with another draft of apology. The letter read as follows : 
 
We refer to your letter of 19 October 1995 enclosing your clients` proposed draft apology.
 
 
 
Our clients have noted the statements in your letter though they do not agree with most of them. Enclosed is a draft apology that incorporates some of the amendments made by your clients.
 
 
 
Our clients are not prepared to consider any amendments. The apology should be published as enclosed.
 
 
 
The apology should be published in, inter alia, The Straits Times. We refer to our previous correspondence where we had indicated to you the other media in which the apology should also be published.
 
 
 
Our clients and in particular, Mr Chandra Das, are quite upset about your penultimate paragraph. There is no basis for what you say. Anyone involved in the organisation of the Tamil Language Week will know that Mr Chandra Das, together with the others, was the target of the malicious and totally false attack that has been made by your clients. These matters can be dealt with when we come to the issue of damages.
 
 
 
Please confirm by close of business by Thursday, 2 November 1995, that the apology will be published as enclosed.
 
 
 
Again it is unnecessary to reproduce here the terms of Allen & Gledhill`s draft letter of apology. Allen & Gledhill followed their earlier letter with another letter dated 2 November 1995 reading as follows: 
 
We refer to previous correspondence in the matter.
 
 
 
Our clients had, through us, told you that the apology has to be published in the next issue of 
 The Hammer
, and in 
 The Tamil Murasu
 and in 
 The Straits Times
. The apology in 
 Tamil Murasu
 should be in Tamil and the apology in 
 The Straits Times
 should be in English. The apology in 
 The Hammer
 should be in both English and Tamil. Please refer to our letter of 25 September 1995 to each of your clients.
 
 
 
The size of the apology should be 27cm x 20cm. Our clients require the apology to be published in the second page of each of the said papers.
 
 
 
Further, your clients should also give the undertaking that has been requested.
 
 
 
Please let us hear from you before close of business on Monday, 6 November 1995.
 
 
 
A reply in substance to the above letters was made by G Krishnan & Co on 8 November 1995 in the following terms : 
 
We refer to the above matter.
 
 
 
We have now taken our clients` instructions on your letters of the 31 October and 2 November 1995.
 
 
 
Our clients have only one comment to make. Your clients had added in para 4 that the announcement that Mr Sinnakaruppan would attend the Conference was made without his permission. We are instructed that the paper, 
 Tamil Murasu
, had published that Mr Sinnakaruppan had been invited and would attend. Two or three days later there appeared another report that Mr Sinnakaruppan was not attending the Conference.
 
 
 
The article correctly set out what appeared in the paper. The author was not to know and did not know that the report Mr Sinnakaruppan would attend was made without his permission or knowledge.
 
 
 
Would your clients like to check the reports in the 
 Tamil Murasu
.
 
 
 
On these facts our clients feel that the article has not misrepresented anything about Mr Sinnakaruppan`s failure to attend. They are therefore of the opinion that the words `we accept` at the beginning should be substituted with the words `We are now informed.` The addition should now read as follows : 
`We are now informed that that announcements that Mr Sinnakaruppan would be attending the Eighth World Tamil Conference was made without Mr Sinnakaruppan`s permission or even his knowledge and we accept that in fact Mr Sinnakaruppan declined the invitation which had been made with very short notice. 
We unreservedly accept that the allegations of political opportunism and insincere hypocrisy made against Mr Sinnakaruppan were and are completely false and baseless.`
 
 
 
Subject to the above, our clients will publish the apology enclosed by you with your letter of 31 October except with the addition of the words `written by a member of the party` at the end of the opening paragraph.
 
 
 
Our clients note your clients` requirements on the location and size of the apology in the 
 Straits Times, Tamil Murasu
 and the 
 Hammer
, although our clients feel that a quarter-page is unnecessary. But they will not cavil.
 
 
 
We shall be glad to hear from you.
 
 
 
The next day Allen & Gledhill responded as follows : 
 
We refer to your fax of 8 November 1995.
 
 
 
Your proposed amendments are not acceptable. The apology should be published as enclosed with our letter of 2 November 1995. The position as regards Mr Sinnakaruppan is as set out in our correspondence with you.
 
 
 
For your purposes, we will shortly forward you a Tamil translation of the apology. We will also let you know the date on which the apology should appear.
 
 
 
Please confirm by close of business today, that the apology will be published as enclosed with our letter of 2 November 1995.
 
 
 
The defendants agreed to publish the apology. The apology in English appeared in the 
 Straits Times 
 on 23 November 1995. It contents were as follows: 
 
The August 1995 issue of the Workers` Party newspaper 
 The Hammer
 contained an article in the Tamil language entitled `The Tamil Language Week - a Drama Enacted to the Written Ruling`.
 
 
 
The article alleged : 
(1) that Professor Jayakumar, Mr Chandra Das, Dr Vasoo, Mr Shanmugam and Mr Sinnakaruppan are insincere and hypocritical political opportunists and Government stooges We unreservedly accept that this allegation was and is completely false and baseless. 
(2) that Professor Jayakumar, Dr Vasoo, Mr Shanmugam and Mr Sinnakaruppan (all of whom spoke at the various functions organised as part of the Tamil Language Week Celebrations held between 8 April and 15 April 1995) were insincere and hypocritical political opportunists because they spoke more in English than in Tamil during the said ceremonies. We unreservedly accept that this allegation is completely false and baseless. We unreservedly accept that Professor Jayakumar spoke more in Tamil than in English and Mr Sinnakaruppan only spoke in Tamil. We also unreservedly accept that Dr Vasoo and Mr Shanmugam spoke substantively in Tamil and English. 
(3) that Mr Shanmugam `boasted` about his sacrifice in cutting short an overseas trip to participate in the closing ceremony and thereby sought to obtain cheap political advantage, and that therefore he is an insincere hypocrite. We unreservedly accept that Mr Shanmugam never said anything in any context (let alone boast) about cutting short any overseas trip in order to attend the Closing Ceremony. We also unreservedly accept that the allegations of cheap political opportunism and hypocrisy made against Mr Shanmugam were and are completely false and baseless. 
(4) that Mr Sinnakaruppan failed to serve the interests of the Tamil language when he declined an invitation to attend the Eighth World Tamil Conference (after it had been announced that he would be participating) but nevertheless attending the Singapore function for the purpose of promoting his political career, and that therefore he is an insincere hypocrite. We accept that that announcement that Mr Sinnakaruppan would be attending the Eighth World Tamil Conference was made without Mr. Sinnakaruppan`s permission or even his knowledge and we accept that in fact Mr Sinnakaruppan declined the invitation which had been made with very short notice. We unreservedly accept that the allegations of political opportunism and insincere hypocrisy made against Mr Sinnakaruppan were and are completely false and baseless. We also unreservedly withdraw the allegation that Mr Sinnakaruppan attended the Singapore function to promote his political career.
 
 
 
We, being respectively the Author, Editor and the Executive Council of the Workers` Party, hereby do unreservedly apologise to each of Professor S Jayakumar, Mr S Chandra Das, Dr S Vasoo, Mr K Shanmugam and Mr R Sinnakaruppan for the distress caused to them by the said false and baseless allegations. We undertake not to make further allegations to the same or similar effect.
 
 
 
We also wish to state that we have agreed to pay costs and damages.

 Consequences of the apology
 
 
 
An apology by a defamer plays an important role in the law and practice of libel and slander. 
 Gatley On Libel And Slander 
 (8th Ed), in para 888 says :Letter before action. Although it is not essential, it is usually advisable to give the defendant an opportunity before writ to withdraw and apologise. Such a letter will help to show that the plaintiff`s real object is to vindicate his character and not merely to make money out of the attack. Moreover, a refusal to withdraw and express regret for statements that are without foundation is a matter which the jury may take into consideration in assessing damages. And, if the reply to the demand for an apology be a letter of abuse or reiteration of the charge, such letter will materially strengthen the plaintiff`s case if malice is an issue in the action. The letter will usually ask for indemnity costs, and may ask for damages, although care should be taken in drafting the latter demand not to forfeit the appearance of reasonableness and moderation which the letter itself is designed to foster. In an appropriate case, whether the plaintiff wishes to appear reasonable and yet to mark the seriousness of the complaint, he may ask for damages and state his intention of donating them to charity. 
 
In a proper case the defendant should be asked for an undertaking not to publish the same or any similar libel in future.
 
 
 
The purpose of an action for defamation was succinctly stated by Lord Reading CJ: `Actions for libel in a civil court are not brought to punish the libeller, but to vindicate the character of the person libelled.` 
 Reeves v Associated Newspapers, The Times 
, October 31 1919 (The quotation is taken from 
 Gatley On Libel And Slander 
). It must be taken that it was in that spirit that the plaintiffs demanded the apology and the defendants eventually published the apology. The plaintiffs` honour and reputation, in other words, had been substantially restored by the publication of the apology.
 Apology and admission constitute a contract
 
 
 Atkin`s Court Forms 
 
 (Second Ed), Vol 25 (1994 Issue), in a footnote at p 88 explaining why the letter giving the proposed defendant an opportunity to withdraw and apologise should not be marked `without prejudice` says this : 
 
Such a letter should not be marked `without prejudice`, since the proposed plaintiff will wish to refer to it at trial if the terms that he proposes are not accepted; see for example 
 Walker v Wilsher
 
(1889) 23 QBD 335
 at 337, CA, per Lord Esher MR. 
 If the terms proposed are accepted, there will be a binding contract
. If, however, the proposed defendant seeks to negotiate a settlement (eg on the issue of damages), the letter in reply will presumably be ` without prejudice`, and it is arguable that all the correspondence, including the letter before action, will be inadmissible in evidence at the trial, although, in practice, the letter before action is usually admitted in evidence without objection.` [Emphasis here and throughout supplied.]
 
 
 
In consequence, the defendants, as a matter of contract, have admitted that the publication contained matters defamatory of the plaintiffs and by implication have conceded that they cannot raise any defence to the proposed action. Further, they have agreed under the terms of the compromise to pay damages and costs and are bound by the negative covenant not to repeat the libel.
The defendants were precluded from retracting their admission even if they later felt that they could have raised a defence to the claim provided that the plaintiffs bona fide believed that they had reasonable ground for suing and that there was a fair chance of succeeding in their claim. That is the nature of a contract of compromise. See
 Callisher v Bischoffsheim 
 (1870) LR 5 QB 449,
 Miles v New Zealand Alford Estate Co 
 (1886) 32 Ch D 266 and 
 Pitt v PHH Asset Management Ltd 
 
[1994] 1 WLR 327
.
Additionally, the plaintiffs, for their part, impliedly agreed not to ask for the full damages they would otherwise be entitled to. Their honour and reputation were restored effectively. The damages they were entitled to were therefore reduced substantially. Indeed their foregoing full damages was the real consideration for the contract of compromise.
 The action and summons for judgment
After the publication of the apology the plaintiffs took up the question of damages. The defendants made their proposals, which were not accepted by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs responded by making their own proposals and stating in a peremptory tone that, `If we do not hear from you by close of business the next day a writ would be issued.` The defendants rejected the plaintiffs` terms. A writ accordingly was issued on 1 February 1996.
The proper form of action for the plaintiffs was to enforce the compromise by seeking a declaration that there was a compromise and an order for assessment of damages. Instead of following that course the plaintiffs` claim was formulated as though it was a fresh claim. The statement of claim described the defendants` proposal of damages as `derisory and contemptuous` and stated that the defendants thereby aggravated the damage caused by the original libel. The plaintiffs claimed damages including aggravated damages for libel and an injunction.
An appearance was filed on 8 February 1996. Following this on 23 February 1996, the plaintiffs filed a summons seeking judgment pursuant to O 14 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (the RSC). In the alternative they sought judgment pursuant to O 27 r 3 of the RSC. They also asked for damages including aggravated damages to be assessed and sought directions for assessment of damages. In their summons they did not seek an injunction, a relief included in the statement of claim.
The application was supported by an affidavit by each of the plaintiffs. Mr S Jayakumar filed the leading affidavit. In their affidavits, the other plaintiffs confirmed and adopted the matters stated in the affidavit of Mr S Jayakumar as true and correct and affirmed that they believed that because of the matters stated in it the defendants had no defence to the plaintiffs` claim.
The defendants filed a defence after the plaintiffs` summons for judgment and an affidavit by Mr A Balakrishnan, the twelfth defendant.
 The orders on the summons
Senior Assistant Registrar Mr James Leong heard the application and at the conclusion of the hearing granted an order in terms of prayers 2, 3, 4 and 5. His minutes said nothing about prayer 1 by which judgment was sought under O 14 of the RSC. Prayer 2 sought judgment under O 27 r 3 of the RSC. Prayer 3 sought an order for assessment of damages. Prayer 4 sought specific directions in relation to the assessment of damages. Prayer 5 sought an order for the defendants to pay the costs of the action and the summons. The costs of the application were fixed at $3,000.
Counsel for the plaintiffs asked for the damages to be assessed by a judge. The defendants` counsel agreed. The assessment of damages is yet to take place.
 The appeal
The defendants appealed against the decision of the senior assistant registrar. When the appeal came for hearing before me, counsel for the defendants Mr JB Jeyaretnam, who also happened to be the first defendant, said that there was no appeal against the the decision of not granting judgment pursuant to O 14 of the RSC but only against the order for interlocutory judgment under O 27 r 3. I pointed out that the appeal was a rehearing and therefore the case should be argued in full - that is the prayers for judgment pursuant to O 14 as well as O 27 r 3 of the RSC should be argued. As he was not prepared for this, I granted an adjournment to enable him to fully prepare his submissions on both prayers.
At the resumed hearing Mr JB Jeyaretnam submitted that as prayer 1 was not allowed there was no appeal against it and as the defendants had not appealed it should not be argued before me. It was not an accurate statement because the application for judgment under O 14 was not dismissed. There was merely no order on it in the sense that it was not considered by the court. In any event I made the ruling that an appeal against a decision of the registrar is different from an appeal to the Court of Appeal. The former is in effect a fresh hearing at which the matter is argued afresh. As a matter of convenience counsel may not present full arguments but that does not detract from the true nature of such appeals. This ruling is supported by what Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) said in 
 Herbs and Spices Trading Post Pte Ltd v Deo Silver (Pte) Ltd 
 
[1991] 2 MLJ 311
 at p 313; 
[1990] SLR 1234
 at p 1238: ` ... an appeal from the registrar of the High Court to the judge-in-chambers is by way of an actual rehearing of the application and the judge treats the matter afresh as though it came before him the first time.` This view was affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 
 Augustine & Anor v Goh Siam Yong 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 767
.
The practice is the same in England. The 
 Supreme Court Practice 
 (The White Book) 1995 Part I at p 909, para 58/1/2 says this : 
 
Nature of appeal from Master or District Judge to Judge in Chambers - An appeal from the Master or District Judge to the Judge in Chambers is dealt with by way of an actual rehearing of the application which led to the order under appeal, and the Judge treats the matters as though it came before him for the first time, save that the party appealing, even though the original application was not by him but against him, has the right as well as the obligation to open the appeal. The Judge `will of course give the weight it deserves to the previous decision of the Master; but he is in no way bound by it` (per Lord Atkin in 
 Evans v Bartlam
 
[1937] AC 473
, p 478).
 
 
 
I, therefore, heard counsel on both prayers and in this judgment I will consider them afresh.
 Judgment under O 27 r 3 of the RSC 
Order 27 r 3 of the RSC provides as follows: 
 
Where admissions of fact are made by a party to a cause or matter either by his pleadings or otherwise, any other party to the cause or matter may apply to the Court for such judgment or order as upon those admissions he may be entitled to, without waiting for the determination of any other question between the parties, and the Court may give such judgment, or make such order, on the application as it thinks just. An application for an order under this Rule may be made by summons.
 
 
 
It is important to note that the discretionary power of the court to give a judgment under the above provision can be exercised only where a defendant has made admissions of fact. It means that the defendant must have made such admissions that it is unnecessary for the Court to make findings of fact - it having been admitted by the defendant they are no longer in issue. If the matter involves question of law, admissions of fact alone cannot decide the matter. The rule therefore excludes admissions of non-factual matters - such as comments, opinions and admissions of law or mixed facts and law.
Seen in the above light, defamation cases of the present kind are unsuitable for an application under O 27 r 3. The reason is that such cases involve matters of law, questions of mixed law and fact and opinions. `It is well settled`, said Lord Morris in 
 Jones v Skelton 
 
[1963] 1 WLR 1362
 at p 1376, `that the question whether words which are complained of are capable of conveying a defamatory meaning is a question of law and is therefore one calling for decision by the court. If the words are so capable then it is a question for the jury to decide whether the words do in fact convey a defamatory meaning. In deciding whether words are capable of conveying a defamatory meaning the court will reject those meanings which can only emerge as the product of some strained or forced or utterly unreasonable interpretation.` In deciding defamation actions where the defence of `fair comment on a matter of public interest` may be or is raised and malice is raised to counter such a defence, complicated question of law or law and fact are likely to be involved. In such cases, if the admissions extend beyond pure facts the case does not come within the words of O 27 r 3.
In my view this is a case where the admissions are not confined to matters of pure fact only. They involve questions of law and mixed law and fact. I therefore decline to give judgment under O 27 r 3.
 Withdrawal of admissions
In his arguments before me, counsel for the defendants urged me to discharge the order made by the senior assistant registrar and let the matter proceed to trial. In effect he asked for leave to retract the admissions made by the defendants since a judgment under O 27 r 3 is a matter of discretion. Reliance was placed on s 31of the Evidence Act which provides that admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted, but they may operate as estoppels. He heavily relied on a case decided by the English Court of Appeal this year: 
 Gale v Superdrug Stores plc 
 
[1996] 1 WLR 1089
 . It was a personal injury case. The insurers of the defendants admitted liability and made an interim payment. Quantum of damages had not been agreed. Proceedings were commenced in the County Court the rules of which had no equivalent to O 27 r 3 of the RSC. The proceedings, of course, were filed for to have the quantum of damages assessed. A defence was filed denying liability on the ground that the accident was due to the sole negligence of a third party on whom a third party notice had been served. Contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff was also alleged. The plaintiff applied to have the defence struck off. The application was dismissed at County Court level. The defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal. On appeal counsel for both sides agreed that the matter should be argued and decided as though it was a matter governed by O 27 r 3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal by a majority decided that the defendants should be allowed to withdraw the admission of liability and defend the action.
The Court of Appeal were of the view that an application to withdraw an admission was analogous to amending a defence - that is withdrawing an admission in the defence and taking a new defence by way of an amendment. Millett LJ was of the view that `the court should ordinarily allow an admission to be withdrawn if it can be done without injustice to the other party and if no question of bad faith or overreaching is involved. ... Leave should normally be granted if the application is made in good faith, raises a triable issue with a reasonable prospect of success, and will not prejudice the plaintiffs in a manner which cannot be adequately compensated.` The majority held that when a defendant sought to withdraw or amend an admission the judge had to balance the prejudice which the defendant would suffer if he was deprived of his prima facie right to resile from his admission against any prejudice which the plaintiff stood to suffer if the admission was withdrawn. Prejudice had to be established specifically. The lack of a good reason for the defendants` change of position was merely one factor to be considered, and the direction of the judge was a general one in which all the circumstances had to be taken into account. On the facts there was insufficient evidence of prejudice to persuade the court to restrain the privilege and freedom the defendants had to change their mind. The fact that the admission had stood for a long time and its withdrawal would disappoint the plaintiff did not constitute a cogent reason to deny the defendants the opportunity to withdraw the admission.
I am not persuaded by 
 Gale`s 
 case or s 31 of the Evidence Act to permit the defendants to withdraw their admission of liability. This is so notwithstanding my conclusion that the defendants` admission of liability involved questions of law or raised questions of law and facts. My reasons are as follows. 
 Gale`s 
 case has no application where the admission of liability forms an integral part of a contract. This is not a case of an admission simplicitor. The admission, as I have demonstrated, was as a matter of law and fact part of a contract of compromise and as such was analogous to a consent judgment in that it is a compromise of the parties. A court has no power to undo a contract which has been voluntarily entered into by the parties unless there is a vitiating factor. None of the factors which vitiate a contract was raised by the defendants. It is a settlement reached out of court, save on the question of damages and costs, and is binding on the defendants in the same way it is binding on the plaintiffs. If one side does not abide by the terms of the settlement, the remedy open to the other side is to sue on it and not ignore it and revert to the position before the compromise was reached. The plaintiffs have sought to enforce the compromise and they are entitled to do so.
An apology made and published by the defendant in defamation action is a strong mitigating factor on the issue of quantum of damages. The court is mandated to treat it as such by s 10 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75). It is especially so where the plaintiffs ask for such an apology and stipulate the terms of the apology as was done in this case. The apology and the undertaking given by the plaintiffs has reduced the amount of damages the plaintiffs would get without an apology. A court cannot ignore such effect. Apart from this, a demand for an apology and withdrawal of the libel and an undertaking not to repeat it and the defendants` agreement to it are looked on with favour by the courts. Thus a defendant who makes an admission and apology and gives an undertaking, far from being prejudiced, benefits by it. On the other hand as far as damages are concerned the plaintiffs have mitigated part of the damages by accepting admission, apology and undertaking not to republish. The admission therefore had gone beyond recall.
The reason given by the defendants in the present case as to why they sought to retract the admission was that the plaintiffs repudiated the contract of compromise by demanding astronomical damages. After reading the statement of claim, the correspondence (including a letter from the plaintiffs` solicitors marked `without prejudice` I was given sight of without any objection at the time it was tendered) and the affidavits in support of the application for judgment I formed the view the plaintiffs did not repudiate the compromise agreement but failed to fully appreciate the effect of compromise. They appeared to think that they were entitled to full damages including aggravated damages notwithstanding the admission, apology and undertaking. But counsel for the plaintiffs confirmed to me that the plaintiffs stood by the contract of compromise and that the damages they were entitled to were substantially reduced. Counsel also confirmed that the purpose of the action in effect was to enforce the contract of compromise.
I cannot accept the contention of counsel for the defendants that the defendants could revert to the position before the compromise, that is rescind the contract because they considered the plaintiffs` demand for damages to be exorbitant. If the parties cannot agree on the damages the same can be assessed by the court. In any event I have held that the plaintiffs did not in any way repudiate the contract. Further, as the contract had been performed substantially by the defendants` admission and publication of the apology and undertaking it can no longer be treated as if it never existed.
I further hold that the defendants cannot be allowed to resile from the admission, apology, the negative covenant not to republish the article and the undertaking to pay damages and costs.
 Application for judgment under O 14
I shall now consider the application for summary judgment under O 14.
On this Mr Jeyaretnam took a preliminary point - that there is no proper applications under O 14. `It is not an O 14 application`, he said, `There is no affidavit under O 14. The affidavit is defective.` He stressed that the word `verify` did not appear in the affidavit of Mr S Jayakumar. I cannot accept this contention. The requirement that `an application for judgment under O 14 should be supported by an affidavit verifying the facts on which the claim is based and stating that in the deponent`s belief there is no defence to the claim or no defence except as to the amount of any damages claimed` was a requirement under the old rules which no longer obtain. The requirements under the new rules are that (i) the application must be supported by an affidavit or affidavits; and (ii) the affidavit must contain all necessary evidence in support of the claim.
I hold that the requirements were adequately complied with. Mr S Jayakumar made an affidavit. It contained the necessary evidence in support of the claim. All the relevant correspondence was exhibited to the affidavit. The apology and undertaking agreed to and published by all the defendants was included. The affidavit asserted in terms that `the defendants have admitted the libel` and that they have no defence. Each of the other plaintiffs filed an affidavit affirming the truth of the contents of the affidavit of Mr S Jayakumar and that there is no defence to the claim. The preliminary objection must therefore fail.
The RSC suspends the filing of a defence where a plaintiff has taken out an application for judgment. A defendant may do so only if he is given leave to file a defence. See O 18 r 2(2). Notwithstanding this, the defendants filed a defence which is not permitted by the rules. There is, however, no objection to a defendant placing before the court a draft defence to demonstrate that there is a triable issue or question and that the matter should be allowed to proceed to trial. I shall therefore treat the defence as a draft. The filing of the defence, therefore, does not stand in the way of the hearing of the application.
In addition to the defence, Mr A Balakrishnan, the twelfth defendant, filed an affidavit. His affidavit referred to the defence that had been filed and stated as follows : 
 
 
4 The defence raises the following question of law: 
 
(i) whether paras (1) and (2) in the article do refer to the plaintiffs and even if they do whether they are defamatory of the plaintiffs. 
 
(ii) whether the defence of fair comment is available to the defendants. 
 
5 I am informed by the first defendant in his capacity as secretary-general of the thirteenth defendant that the executive council in a spirit of conciliation agreed to give the apology after it was advised that paras (5) and (8) may be considered defamatory. 
 
6 In the circumstances, as there are substantial issues of law and fact raised by the defendants, the application of the plaintiffs herein is misconceived and ought to be dismissed with costs.`
  
 
 
Paragraph 4 of the affidavit of Mr A Balakrishnan summarised neatly the defence. Even if the alleged defences were available to them, which in my judgment they are not, the defendants by the contract of compromise precluded themselves from raising such defences. Once the compromise was concluded the defendants impliedly waived all defences and contentions they could have raised. In other words neither party may eat the cake and have it as well.
One principle of law of compromise is well settled and it is this: `Since recourse to law is the remedy for redress provided by the law itself, it is obvious that prima facie a threat to enforce one`s legal rights by instituting civil proceedings cannot be an unlawful or wrongful threat. Consequently a contract which is obtained by means of such a threat must prima facie be valid, and cannot be impeached on grounds of duress. So an ordinary bona fide compromise is clearly a valid contract even though exacted under threats to bring (or defend) legal proceedings, or to appeal from a judgment already given. Even a threat to bring proceedings where there is no ground of action in law is prima facie not an unlawful threat, at least where the threat is made bona fide, and is not manifestly frivolous or vexatious`. See 
 Chitty On Contracts 
 (27th Ed) Vol 1 p 412 para 7-016, 
 Miles v New Zealand Alford Estate Co 
 (1886) 32 Ch D 266 and 
 Jayawickreme v Amarsuriya 
 
[1918] AC 869
. There was no allegation of mala fides against the plaintiffs or that the claim was manifestly frivolous or vexatious.
The practice of asking for an admission and apology in defamation actions is so deeply ensconsed that it would be a grave error to upset the practice by ignoring a compromise reached pursuant to that practice. Striking down a compromise on a ground that the compromise ended in a disappointment to one party will mean that questions of liability will have to go to trial and all the evidence will have to be rehearsed, which is what both parties intended to avoid.
It must be added that the law is well settled that parties may make admissions on a question of law and compromise a question of law and such admissions may be received in evidence at the trial of a case. See 
 Phipson On Evidence 
 (14th Ed) para 24-16. Trials and O 14 proceedings, which are a form of trial, therefore are not circumscribed by the limitation in O 27 r 3 which is confined to admissions of fact. Besides, the rules of court governing summary judgment that obtain now have greatly improved the scope and efficacy of the procedure and it is now possible to adopt a robust approach and speedily dispose of cases where it is clearly established that there is no defence to liability.
In this case Mr S Jayakumar set out in his affidavit all the material facts and exhibited the relevant correspondence leading up not only to the conclusion of the contract of compromise but also the performance of it. It was clearly established that the defendants have no defence except as to the amount of damages. The action was in fact and in effect to enforce the contract of compromise and admission of liability. 
 Dummer v Brown 
 
[1953] 1 QB 710
 is clear authority which supports the plaintiffs` application for judgment based on admission of liability. That was a personal injuries claim in which the plaintiff`s husband had been killed in a road accident. The plaintiff brought an action against two defendants - the owner and driver of a motor-coach. The driver having been convicted of dangerous driving on a plea of guilty, the plaintiff applied for interlocutory judgment under O 14 of the English Rules of Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal adopting a robust approach held that it was a proper case for summary judgment based on the admission of the defendants in the criminal proceedings. Interlocutory judgment was given even though the affidavit leading the application was defective in that it turned on matters which were not within the plaintiff`s own knowledge and failed to state the deponents` means of knowledge. Interlocutory judgment was given because the defendants failed to give an indication of any real defence.
The present case is much stronger in that the defendants made a comprehensive and unequivocal admission of liability. The defendants in this case by their defence and affidavit of Mr A Balakrishnan have not in any way dispelled the basis of the plaintiffs` claim as regards liability. Mr A Balakrishnan has confirmed in his affidavit that he was informed by Mr JB Jeyaretnam as secretary general of the Workers` Party that the executive council in a spirit of conciliation decided to give the apology after it was advised that paras (5) and (8) of the article may be defamatory. Thus the defendants not only received legal advice but also were represented by solicitors in concluding the compromise. The first defendant is a well experienced senior lawyer. The defendants therefore fully appreciated the consequences of their acts. The apology is comprehensive enough to include an admission of liability and a negative covenant not to repeat the libel and an irrefragable undertaking to pay damages. There can be no liability to pay damages without an admission of liability.
There is, of course, the hotly contested issue of damages. Mr JB Jeyaretnam as counsel for the defendants stated that liability was disputed because the plaintiffs asked for one million dollars as damages. ` The Workers` Party` he said ` does not have $10,000 let alone $1,000,000.` The plaintiffs are not entitled to get $1,000,000 merely because they have asked for it. The defendants have rejected the demand. `What if the plaintiffs ask for $10,000,000 as damages?` asked Mr JB Jeyaretnam. `Are we liable for that amount?` The answer is that if damages cannot be agreed the process of the courts will decide what the plaintiffs are legitimately entitled to. That, however, cannot preclude a judgment on liability.
 Guard your tongue if nothing else
It is not out of context to make this observation: Mr A Balakrishnan, the writer of the article in question, inter alia, says this. `Tamil language is inseparable from our lives . We have created history. Let us act with the firm belief that Tamil will not perish in Singapore as long as the last single Tamil lives.` Mr Balakrishnan`s pride in his mother tongue is fully justified for that language has produced moral codes hard to find in any other language. One of them, the Kural by Thiruvalluvar, has been the pride and joy of the Tamils. It contains aphorisms, pithy two-liners, on every aspect of human life. One of them is this : 
 
Guard your tongue if nothing else;For words unguarded cause distress.[ast ](Verse 127, Penguin Classics p 31.Translation from Tamil by PS Sundaram)
 
 
 
The world today is more familiar with the English version of the advice: `A man shall not speak evil falsely of his neighbour`, namely, the ninth commandment. As Lord Diplock pointed out in 
 Horrocks v Lowe 
 
[1975] AC 135
 at p 149, as a general rule the English law gives practical effect to the ninth commandment by supplying temporal sanction to it. If Mr Balakrishnan, therefore, paid heed to the simple advice in the Kural or the ninth commandment he would have saved himself and his comrades the distress and embarrassment.
In the result, there will be interlocutory judgment for the plaintiffs under O 14 of the RSC and there shall be an order for assessment of damages. The directions given by the senior assistant registrar for assessment proceedings shall stand. Parties have liberty to apply for further directions if necessary.
I shall hear counsel on costs.

s 18 (b) Workmen's compensation Act (Cap 354)
 
 
 The facts 
 
(i) an indemnity under s 18(b) of the Act against the defendant in respect of the same (the s 18(b) claim); and 
(ii) a declaration (the additional claim) that it is entitled to be indemnified by the defendant in respect of the three common law claims.
By an order of court the three common law claims were ordered to be heard together with this suit or immediately thereafter.
When this suit came up for hearing, no statement of claim had been filed in MC Suit No 2262 of 1995. In Suit No 808 of 1995 the plaintiff herein as sole defendant therein had allowed interlocutory judgment to be entered. As no pleadings had been filed in MC Suit No 2262 of 1995 and it was not ready for trial I released counsel for the plaintiff there from further attendance. To obviate the need to recall witnesses at the hearing of Suit No 808/95 and Suit No 255/95 at a later date, I gave leave to counsel for the plaintiffs in those two suits to cross-examine witnesses testifying in this suit. I also ordered that the evidence adduced in this suit would form part of the evidence in those two suits.
At the end of the hearing I allowed the s 18(b) claim but I made no order on the additional claim. The plaintiff was accordingly awarded two thirds costs. The plaintiff thereupon appealed against my decision. The defendant then cross appealed. I now give my reasons.
 The law
Section 18 of the Act reads: 
Where any injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof - 
(a) the workman may take proceedings against that person to recover damages and may claim against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act, but he shall not be entitled to recover both damages and compensation; and 
(b) if the workman has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid, shall be entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay damages as aforesaid.
By s 2, `
 any reference to a workman who has been injured shall where the workman is dead, include a reference to his legal personal representative or to his dependants or any of them 
.`
Section 18 of the Act is in pari materia with s 6 of the English Workmen`s Compensation Act 1906 (the English Act) which read: 
Where the injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof - (1) the workman may take proceedings both against that person to recover damages and against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act for such compensation, but shall not be entitled to recover both damages and compensation; and (2) if the workman has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid, shall be entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay damages as aforesaid,
Section 6 of the English Act came up for construction in 
 Cory & Son Ltd v France, Fenwick & Co Ltd 
 
[1911] 1 KB 114
. There a steamer belonging to the plaintiff was approaching a staith which was being used by the defendant for the purpose of taking a cargo of coal from the defendant. Two workmen employed by the plaintiff were in attendance on the steamer in a boat. As a result of the plaintiff`s servants in charge of the steamer complying with the direction given by the staith-master employed by the defendant the propeller was set in motion. This upset the boat and one of the workmen was drowned and the other injured. The plaintiff having been compelled to pay compensation under the English Act brought an action for indemnity against the defendant under s 6 thereof. The claim was dismissed by the commissioner of assize on the ground that it was caused by the combined negligence of the staith-master and those in charge of the ship, the former in giving the direction that he did and the latter in complying with it without ascertaining if it was safe to do so. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. In dismissing the appeal, Buckley LJ said at pp 125-128: 
For the purpose of the first part of my judgment, I will assume that the facts shew that both the plaintiffs and the defendants were guilty of negligence, so as to create in them a legal liability to pay damages in respect of the accident. On that hypothesis, I propose, in the first instance, to consider whether s 6 of the Act of 1906 applies or not: in my opinion it does not. The section uses the words `
 some person other than the employer
`. For brevity, I will call that person `
 a stranger
`. The first question for consideration, I think, is whether the section is to be read as if it were `
 circumstances creating a legal liability in a stranger
,` or as if it were `
 circumstances creating a legal liability in a stranger, or in the employer and a stranger
.` The true construction, in my opinion, is that the latter case is not included. My reasons are as follows. The section goes on in sub-s.1 to provide that, in the state of facts mentioned in the preliminary words, 
 `the workman may take proceedings both against that person
,` that is the person whom I have called `
 a stranger
,` `
 to recover damages, and against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act for such compensation
.` If the preliminary words bore the meaning which I think they do not bear, you would expect to find there `
 the workman may take proceedings both against that person or against that person and the employer to recover damages and against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act for such compensation
`; but you do not find those words. All that appears to be contemplated as the result which is to be dealt with, if the preliminary words apply, is that there is to reside in the workman a right to take proceedings for damages against the stranger and a right to take proceedings for compensation against the person liable under the Act to pay compensation. This will of course be or include the employer.
 
Thesecond reason why I think that this case is not within the section is as follows. If the preliminary words of the section are satisfied, then the person by whom the compensation was paid is to be entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay damages as aforesaid. Therefore, if a case where there is a legal liability for damages in the employer and a stranger does come within the section, the effect of the Act is that, as between those two parties, both of whom are to blame, the one shall bear the whole of the onus to the indemnity of the other. That is a construction which I think highly improbable. Upon these grounds I think the section is confined to a case where there is a legal liability to pay damages in a stranger to the exclusion of a case where there is a legal liability to pay damages in a stranger and the employer himself.
 
For these reason therefore, upon the construction of the section, I arrive at the conclusion that, even if there was legal liability in both the parties, the shipowners cannot sue the staith owners for an indemnity under any statutory right to indemnity.
At p 136, Kennedy LJ agreeing with Buckley LJ said: 
I think on the whole that the section should be treated as applying only to cases in which the employer is liable only for compensation under the Act, and not as applying to cases where the employer himself is, through his own or his servants` negligence, responsible outside the Act jointly with the person from whom he claims indemnity, as having to some extent contributed to the injury to the workman who has been compensated.
 Cory 
`s case was followed by the full bench of the Australian High Court in 
 Public Transport Commission of New South Wales v J Murray-More (NSW) Pty Ltd 
 (1975) 6 ALR 271. There the respondent`s employee sustained his compensable injury by reason of the negligent acts of both the respondent and the Commissioner for Railways. The respondent paid the compensation and sued the appellant for an indemnity under s 64 of the Workers` Compensation Act 1926-1967 (NSW) (the NSW Act). Section 64 of the NSW Act reads: 
(1) Where the injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof - 
(a) the worker may take proceedings both against that person to recover damages and against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act for such compensation, but shall not be entitled to retain both damages and compensation. 
If the worker recovers firstly compensation and secondly such damages he shall be liable to repay to his employer out of such damages the amount of compensation which the employer has paid in respect of the worker`s injury under this Act, and the worker shall not be entitled to any further compensation. 
If the worker firstly recovers such damages he shall not be entitled to recover compensation under this Act; 
(b) if the worker has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid shall be entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay damages as aforesaid; 
(c) if the worker subsequently obtains judgment for damages against the person who has paid under such indemnity, such payment under the indemnity shall be, to the extent of the amount of such payment, a satisfaction of the judgment for damages; 
The Supreme Court of New South Wales found for the respondent. The appellant`s appeal to the Court of Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales was dismissed. But its appeal to the High Court of Australia was allowed. In allowing the appeal Barwick CJ stated at pp 274-275: 
These words [`a legal liability in some person other than the employer`] in the evident scheme of Pt VIII, are adequate to indicate that the employer for whom s 64 is making provision is not one of the persons who has produced the circumstances out of which the liability to pay compensation has arisen. The language contemplates, and on its proper construction provides for, the case where a stranger, or strangers, so far as employer and workman are concerned has or have caused the compensable injury. The person who is to indemnify the employer under s 64(1)(b) is that person, that is to say, a person other than the employer, who in the circumstances caused the injury in respect of which the compensation has been paid.
 
the indemnity under s 64(1)(b) is of the full amount paid as compensation. If an employer who was a tortfeasor in relation to the compensable injury could recover the compensation paid by him under s 64(1)(b), perhaps after contribution proceedings between the tortfeasors which involved an apportionment of responsibility, that apportionment would be distorted.
 
In my opinion, the proper construction of s 64(1) would preclude the respondent, as an employer whose negligence has contributed to the occurrence out of which the right of compensation arose, from recovering an indemnity under par (b) of the subsection. The right to an indemnity under s 64(1)(b) is only given to an employer who has no other liability to the worker in relation to the compensable injury than the statutory liability to pay workers` compensation.
In so holding Barwick CJ agreed with 
 Cory 
`s case. At p 275 supra he said: 
The reasons of the members of the court [in 
 Cory
`s case] are diverse. But Buckley LJ ([1911] 1 KB at 125) places a construction of the opening words of the section which I would respectfully adopt. In my opinion, 
 Cory
`s case was well decided and supports the conclusion to which I have come.
 Cory 
`s case and 
 Public Transport Commission of New South Wales 
` case were followed by Judith Prakash JC (as she then was) in 
 Chen Hsin Hsiong v Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance plc 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 92
. There a workman of the respondent`s insured in the course of his employment was fatally injured when he was knocked down by a car driven by the appellant. By an order of the Commissioner for Labour, the dependants were awarded the sum of $21,192 as compensation under the Act. The respondent as insurer of the deceased`s employer paid the said sum of $21,192. It then sought indemnity from the appellant under s 18(b) of the Act. Although as insurer it had a statutory liability under s 32 of the Act to satisfy the award, the respondent in seeking indemnity in its own name stood in the shoes of its insured in terms of its rights and limitations under the Act. When the claim came up for hearing in the subordinate courts, by agreement liability for the accident was apportioned as to 35% on the part of the deceased and 65% on the part of the appellant. The trial judge accordingly awarded the respondent 65% of $21,198. The appellant appealed. The appeal was dismissed by Judith Prakash JC who held that the contributory negligence on the part of the deceased did not translate into any wrongdoing on the part of his employer that would give the deceased a claim against the latter at law except for compensation under the Act. In dismissing the appeal Judith Prakash JC stated that the indemnity should have been for the full sum of $21,192 and not for 65% of the same. But in the absence of a cross-appeal, she could not vary the trial judge`s award. In applying 
 Cory 
`s case and the 
 Public Transport Commission of New South Wales 
` case, the learned judge said: 
Thus it can be seen that, in both authorities relied on, the courts involved were dealing with the situation in which the employer was a tortfeasor. I respectfully agree with the construction which they have placed upon the legislation in the specific situation of an employer who is himself in breach of duty.
In the light of these authorities with which I respectfully agree, the plaintiff would only be entitled to an indemnity under s 18(b) of the Act if it was not under any liability to its workmen who died or were injured in the explosion other than the liability to pay compensation under the Act. This turns on whether the plaintiff was guilty of any wrongdoing that caused or contributed to the explosion. According to Captain Sangameswar then of the Marine Department, Ministry of Communications, Singapore, for the explosion to occur in No 5 centre tank, the tank should have petroleum vapour within the explosive range and a spark or naked flame in the tank to light the vapour. In short there was inadequate gas freeing. Due to inadequate gas freeing, flammable vapour from No 5 centre tank escaped onto the deck through most probably the ullage pipe which was not properly secured. This was ignited by sparks from the hot work being carried out on deck. The flash back into the tank resulted in the explosion.
 My decision
The Lotus M was at the material time outside port limits and therefore the Port of Singapore Authority (Dangerous Goods, Petroleum and Explosives) Regulations regulating doing of hot work on board any vessel had no application. But there is a manual prepared by the International Chamber of Shipping, Oil Companies, International Marine Forum and the International Association of Ports and Harbours for the use of ship`s personnel and terminal operators. It is called the International Safety Guide for Oil Tankers and Terminals (ISGOTT). The edition current at the time was the third edition. ISGOTT is internationally accepted in the maritime and oil industry as the safety manual for tankers and terminal operators. Captain Sangameswar was of the opinion that the inadequate gas freeing was due to the procedures laid down in ISGOTT not having been followed. In his report he stated: 
5.2 In my opinion, the chief officer had not closely followed the procedures laid down in the guide for gas-freeing operations and preparations for doing hot work. He had failed to observe the following general safety procedures: 
(a) Take gas readings from various sections of the tanks. Due to the structure of the tanks, there could be pockets of hydro-carbon gas in certain areas of the tank. As the chief officer had taken only one sample from each tank, he was not aware of the status of the complete tank; 
(b) Check the gas reading periodically. The condition of vapours in a tank could vary from time to time. Gas can be generated by various means, for example leakage from cargo pipelines. 
(c) Ensure that entrances to the tanks and tank covers are properly battened down. 
(d) Prohibit gas cutting of bolts to remove valves from the heating coils. Hot work on pipelines and valves should only be permitted when the appropriate section has been detached from the system by cold work and open ended sections of the remaining system have been sealed off. 
5.3 The repair works were commenced after the chief officer verbally told the shore workshop foreman to commence work. According to the ISGOTT, before starting repair works, the master or a responsible officer should issue a written `Hot work permit`. The permit is valid for 12 hours (unless conditions have changed), and is issued only after checking all safety items listed on the permit. The safety permit is required to be signed jointly by the master and a representative from the workshop. 
5.4 The master had left the entire operations to the chief officer and had not supervised them. As the vessel was carrying out extensive repairs involving hot works which were not routine operations, the master should have known or ought to have known the potential dangers of doing hot work. Therefore the master should have taken a more active interest in the affairs and ensured that proper safety procedures were being followed.
Captain Sangameswar`s view that there was inadequate gas freeing was supported by Dr GP Bound testifying as a expert for the plaintiff. In his affidavit of evidence in chief Dr GP Bound stated: 
Measurements taken by a port chemist after the explosion (and reported to the police) showed that there was up to 20% LEL in one of the cargo tanks and 100% LEL (ie an explosive mixture) in cargo manifolds. This suggests that the `gas freeing` operation was inadequate and the gas measuring (to give values of nil in the tanks etc) was incorrect. We believe that the gas freeing should have been carried out by blowing air through a hose either to or near the bottom of the tank to displace the naphtha vapour which is heavier than air. This was particularly the case in tank 5 centre which had a swash bulkhead to act as a baffle, creating dead volumes and reducing the effectiveness of the ventilation.
The defendant through its expert Dr Eric Mullen did not dispute the inadequacy of the gas freeing carried out by the Chief Officer. But it contended that notwithstanding the verbal assurances given on behalf of the defendant by Nagase the Master and the Chief Officer that it was safe to commence hot work the plaintiff should still have insisted that the Master issue a hot work certificate and should have satisfied itself beyond reasonable doubt that the Lotus M was gas free before commencement of hot work. This was what Dr Eric Mullen stated in his affidavit of evidence in chief: 
At present, hot work certificates are issued for fixed, limited periods. This underlines the temporary nature of gas freeing. When hot work was commenced on board the vessel, off port limits, no hot work certificate was in place. Hence any prudent ship repairer should have at least demanded a hot work certificate and/ or employed their own chemist or qualified servant or agent to determine that the work area was gas free.
Dr Eric Mullen then reiterated this on re-examination by counsel for the defendant: 
Q: Given the fact of the situation, bearing in mind the assurances given by the three officers that hot work could commence, you have said it was not sufficient for the contractors to rely on these verbal assurances, what would you expect the contractors to do if they were to commence work? 
A: Nobody operated on a verbal system in Singapore. The whole permit system is you don`t rely on verbal assurance. Ideally they should say we want hot work certificate. If ship is outside [port limits], they should insist on a certificate given by an independent person. This is the ideal situation As part of that certification system for hot work, the contractor should insist on a permit to work like Appendix F. If they followed the system that operated in Singapore they should have the hot work certificate and hot work permit. If outside Singapore [port limits], the same safety system should apply. At the minimum they should check it for themselves, issue their own certificates. They must take an active role.
Appendix F is the format for a hot work permit to be issued under para 4.12.5 of ISGOTT which states: 
Approval for Hot Work On Board Ship
 
Hot work on board ship must be prohibited until all applicable regulations and safety requirements have been met and a permit to work has been issued. This may involve the master, terminal representative and port authority as appropriate.

Appendix F contains a check list which reads:

2.7 Is the equipment isolated electrically?

In the circumstances noted it is considered safe to proceed with the work.
 
The satisfactory answers to the check list would thus confirm that the Lotus M had been gas freed and that it was considered safe to proceed with hot work. But the answers to the items on the check list relating to gas freeing would have to come from the officers of the Lotus M. This was what Captain Sangameswar said: 
Q: The ISGOTT is a guideline for oil tankers? 
A: No, not only just for oil tankers but for oil terminals as well. 
Q: Is it directed to ship repairers? 
A: No. It is more relevant for tankers. 
Q: Would you expect ship repairers to be familiar with ISGOTT? 
A: In my opinion I don`t think so. 
Q: See the Hot Work Permit specimen at p 816 section - who shall be able to answer the question in section 1, 1.1? 
A: The person who actually checks if it is gas free, the tester. 
Q: See section 2, 2.1 p 816, the person who gives the information would be the tester? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Section 2, 2.2 and 2.3, the person who gives the information is the one who did the purging and blanking? 
A: Yes. 
Q: All these matters in section 2 involve the ship`s pipe equipment and tanks? 
A: Yes. 
Q: All these areas would be within the control of the master? 
A: Yes. 
Q: In the Hot Work Permit check list would you consider that the check list could only be provided by the master or his officer? 
A: I would say somebody who has the knowledge of these items. 
Q: Who has to comply with the check list? 
A: In the shipyard it would be the safety officer. 
Q: What about if the ship is in the high seas? Would the person to provide the check list be the master? 
A: Yes, the master or chief officer. 
Q: Would you say that before the master issues the work permit he would ensure that his officer had done the work listed in the check list? 
A: Yes.
Therefore even if a hot work permit had been issued by the Master in the form of Appendix F it would have added nothing to the verbal assurances given by Nagase, the Master and Chief Officer who were officers of a motor tanker, that the vessel had been gas freed and the workmen could commence hot work after the covers for all the manholes and hatches had been closed. The plaintiff`s foreman was entitled to rely on these assurances and begin hot work on the deck particularly when its engagement stipulated that the vessel had to be gas free for its workmen to carry out the repairs.
Accordingly on the evidence adduced in this suit I held that the defendant was solely to blame for the explosion. Therefore I allowed the s 18(b) claim. As the payments were made at various dates I awarded interest at the suggestion of counsel for both parties from date of service of the writ to avoid laborious calculation.
I now address the additional claim. Such a claim could only arise if the plaintiff is liable as a tortfeasor to the plaintiffs in the three common law claims. Tortfeasors causing the same damage may be joint or several. On joint tortfeasors, 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
(4th Ed) para 1234 states: 
The following are joint tortfeasors:
 
(1) employer and employee where the employer is vicariously liable for the tort of the employee; 
(2) principal and agent where the principal is liable for the tort of the agent; 
(3) employer and independent contractor where the employer is liable for the tort of his independent contractor; 
(4) a person who instigates another to commit a tort and the person who then commits the tort; 
(5) persons who take concerted action to a common end and in the course of executing that joint purpose commit a tort.
The plaintiff and defendant, not acting in concert, were not joint tortfeasors but they would be several tortfeasors causing the same damage if the plaintiff could also be blamed for the explosion. See 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) at para 1235 which states: 
If each of several persons, not acting in concert, commits a tort against another person substantially contemporaneously and causing the same or indivisible damage, each several tortfeasor is liable for the whole damage.
Be it joint or several tortfeasors a claimant for indemnity or contribution must be under a liability at law as a tortfeasor to the victim for the damage suffered by the victim as a result of the tort. See s 11(1)(c) and (2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 354) which states: 
(1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) - 
(c) 
 any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage 
 may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise, so however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought. [Emphasis added.] 
(2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person`s responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity.
The plaintiff would therefore be entitled to an indemnity or contribution in respect of the additional claim only if it had a liability at law as a joint or several tortfeasor for damages sustained by the plaintiffs in the three common law claims as a result of the explosion. The additional claim is therefore inconsistent with the plaintiff`s entitlement to the s 18(b) claim. The two were mutually exclusive. If the plaintiff succeeded in one it must fail in the other. As I found the explosion to have been caused under circumstances which did not create such liability on the part of the plaintiff, I made no order on the additional claim. Consequently I awarded the plaintiff two-thirds costs.

Where owner of goods damaged on board a vessel proved that damage was caused by sea water, whether burden of proof shifted to ship owner to prove that damage was not caused by its negligence
 
The plaintiffs in this action claimed from the defendant damages for breach of contract or duty and/or for negligence in and about the carriage of three cases of pistons on board the defendant company`s vessel the Clytoneus.
Under a bill of lading dated 18 August 1965 there were shipped at Liverpool in apparent good order and condition on board the Clytoneus three cases of pistons for carriage to an delivery at Singapore.
The plaintiffs were at all material times the owners of the goods comprised in the three cases or the indorsees of the bill of lading to whom the property in the goods passed upon or by reason of the indorsement, alternatively, the plaintiffs presented the bill of lading at Singapore and took delivery thereunder.
On 12 September 1965 the vessel arrived at Singapore and the three cases of pistons were discharged into godowns one and two on 13 and 14 September 1965. The plaintiffs took delivery of the goods on 17 September 1965. On the morning of 18 September 1965 one of the cases was opened and it was found that the contents were wet and the pistons were rusted and pitted by, so it was alleged, coming into contact with salt water. The contents of the remaining two cases were not damaged in any way.
The plaintiffs alleged that it was the duty of the defendant or that the defendant by the bill of lading expressly or impliedly contracted to deliver the goods in the same good order and condition in which they were shipped. Further or alternatively it was the duty of the defendant or the defendant impliedly contracted to exercise reasonable care of the goods during the lading, carriage and discharge thereof. In breach of the said duty or contract the defendant, its servants or agents, failed to take reasonable care of the goods during the loading or carriage thereof by allowing the goods to come into contact with sea water.
The defendant denied that in breach of its duty or contract it delivered the goods damaged by sea water or that it was its duty or that it impliedly contracted to exercise reasonable care of the goods during the loading, carriage and discharge thereof. The defendant further denied that in breach of its duty or contract the defendant, its servants or agents, failed to take reasonable care of the goods during the loading or carriage thereof by allowing the goods to come into contact with sea water.
That there was damage to the goods was not in dispute. It was also not in dispute that they were shipped in apparent good order and condition. Not only does the bill of lading say so but Mr Matthews on behalf of the defendant company admitted it. Furthermore Mr Keenan a master mariner and surveyor stated that the case containing the pistons was generally dry stained externally and had been in contract with water. When he examined the case some seven or eight days after its discharge from the ship at Singapore he found the interior condition of the case very wet to touch - this condition he said certainly was not recent and that it was possible it could have been present for some three weeks prior to his examination when it would have been very much wetter then than when he carried out his inspection.
Mr Matthews said that if this case had shown any signs of staining prior to shipment the stevedores at Birkenhead would have noticed it as to his personal knowledge they were experience men.
It seems to me that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from this evidence is that the goods were damaged after shipment and before discharge.
The plaintiffs` case on these facts was that all they had to prove was that the goods were shipped in good order and condition and on discharge were found to be damaged and the burden of proof then shifted to the defendant to show that it was not responsible.
I consider that to be a correct statement of the law as it stands at present. See 
 Gosse Millard 
 v 
 Canadian Government Merchant 
 
[1927] 2 KB 432
 and 
 Albacora SRL 
 v 
 Westcott & Laurence Line 
[1965] 2 Lloyd`s Rep 37.
The defendant`s case on the other hand was that the plaintiffs must prove not only damage to the goods but that the damage was caused by sea water as specifically pleaded and that unless it can do so its claim fails.
The analytical chemist called by the plaintiffs gave evidence to the effect that a sample of the goods taken from the case was examined and tested by him and that its condition was consistent with having come into contact with sea water. There was evidence that on taking one of the cartons out of the case it smelt of salt water and there was the fact that the goods, as I have found as a fact, were damaged while on board the ship.
Dr Rintoul an analytical chemist called by the defendant gave us his version of how to test for the presence of sea water and stated that in his opinion the evidence of the plaintiff`s expert Mr Subramanian was inconclusive. Dr Rintoul never examined or tested any of the goods and his evidence merely amounted to a short lecture on the best method of testing for sea water contact and he admitted that he was not aware how Mr Subramanian carried out his experiments.
On this issue therefore on the probabilities of the matter I find as a fact that the goods were damaged by sea water as alleged.
If, however, I am wrong in this I am, nevertheless, of the opinion that all the plaintiffs need prove is damage and it is not fatal to their case if the damage was caused other than by sea water. To hold otherwise so it seems to me would be to flout the application of the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924 and the rules comprised in the schedule thereto to which of course the bill of lading was subject. Under art III r 2 it is enough if the owner of the goods proves either that the goods have not been delivered or have been delivered damaged.
The plaintiffs however having established, in my judgment, that the goods were damaged by sea water while on board the ship the onus shifts to the defendant to show how the damage occurred and that it occurred without negligence on its part. This, in my view, it has failed to do.
For some reason best known to the defendant company no attempt was made to call any officer or member of the crew of the Clytoneus and the only evidence as to the loading, handling, stowage and carriage of the goods was supplied by Mr Matthews an employee of Mansfield & Co Ltd the Singapore agents of the defendant and a tally clerk who operated on the wharf checking the Singapore cargo as it was discharged.
Mr Matthews was not present either at the loading or the discharging of the goods and the defendant had to rely on a stowage plan the tally clerk`s records to show how the case containing the goods in question was stowed, carried and discharged from which I was asked to infer that the goods could not have been damaged during the voyage by sea water or any other cause.
The goods were damaged and the defendant does not discharge the onus of proof which lies upon him simply by saying that it would not have occurred by reference to a stowage plan and tally sheets. It was urged upon me that although over 2,000 tons of cargo was shipped on the Clytoneus yet only the contents of one little case got wet. The defendant is unable to give any explanation as to how the damage occurred nor does it claim that the damage falls within one of the immunities specified in art IV r 2.
For these reasons, in my view, the defendant has failed to discharge the onus or burden of proof which lies upon it of showing that the was not negligent and in the result there will be judgment for the plaintiffs with costs.

Sections 177(b) and 177(e) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Rev Ed)
 
This is an application to transfer three arrest cases and five summons cases from the First District Court to the High Court. The application is made on two grounds. The first ground is that questions of law of unusual difficulty are likely to arise in those proceedings before the First District Court. This ground is based on the provisions of s 177(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed). When the Criminal Procedure Code was first enacted in 1873, magistrates` courts which were then known as police courts were presided over by officers who had no legal training nor any legal qualifications. Paragraph (b) of s 177(1) was in those days of considerable importance as it could be invoked by a party to the proceedings before a police court when some question of law of unusual difficulty was likely to arise. The position today is quite different. All subordinate courts in Singapore are presided over by officers who are legally qualified and in consequence para (b) has lost its importance. For example, the officer who is now presiding over the First District Court is not only a barrister-at-law but also an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of some 15 years` standing.
Counsel for the applicants has made much of the fact that questions of law of unusual difficulty are likely to arise in the trial before the First District Court and that for that reason it is desirable that the trial should take place before the High Court. Since our Criminal Procedure Code allows an appeal and also a revision application in respect of any conviction by a district court the High Court should in my opinion be loathe to transfer a case from a subordinate court to itself on the ground that difficult questions of law are likely to arise in the case. In the present case there appears to be some apprehension in the minds of the applicants that the First District Court may take an erroneous view of the law. Such apprehension is not supported by any evidence and is therefore groundless. Furthermore, the applicants can rest assured that if the First District Court errs on any point of law or makes some other mistake whether of law or of fact such mistake can be and will be put right by this court on appeal or revision.
Reference has been made to the case of 
 TT Rajah v R 
 
 
 [1963] MLJ 231 
, which in my opinion is of no help to the applicants because in that case the application was made on a number of grounds and at the hearing of the application for the transfer of the case to the High Court, the learned Solicitor-General who appeared for the respondent intimated to the court that the Crown would not oppose the application on the ground that a fair and impartial trial could not be had in any of the criminal district courts. In the present case the application is strongly opposed by the Solicitor-General.
There is also the decision in Criminal Motion No 10 of 1966 which is unreported. I am grateful to the learned Solicitor-General for bringing it to my notice. In that matter, the application for the transfer the case from the district court to the High Court was made by the Public Prosecutor on the ground that questions of law of unusual difficulty were likely to arise at the trial. Suffice it to say that the application was refused by the High Court.
The second ground on which the application is made is based on para (e) of s 177(1) which provides that whenever it is made to appear to the High Court that an order for the transfer of the case to the High Court is expedient for the ends of justice it may order the case to be so transferred. The expression `expedient for the ends of justice` is very wide and may embrace grounds, outside the other clauses of s 177(1), which may indicate the necessity of a transfer to secure justice and a fair trial but no other such ground has been advanced by the applicants.
It is the duty of the High Court to create and maintain confidence in the administration of justice. Special facilities for a trial or trial by a special judge or a special court is apt or at least is capable of being used to destroy that confidence and except where the supreme needs of justice require it, the ordinary course of justice is best left untouched. On the other hand no person should be allowed to undergo a trial by a district judge or magistrate of whom he has reasonable apprehension of being biased but not because the judicial officer is in his opinion incompetent or incapable of properly performing his duty.
The High Court will not hesitate to transfer a criminal case from a lower court to itself where there are good grounds for so doing. In this application, I can find no compelling ground for making the order which the applicants seek and the application is therefore dismissed.

Section 351 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Rev Ed)
 
This is an application to the High Court under s 351 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113) for the applicant to be admitted to bail pending his appeal against his conviction on four charges of corruption and one charge of criminal breach of trust in respect of $102,784.96 for which he was sentenced to two years imprisonment in all.
It is undisputed that both the district court and the High Court have a discretion in the matter to admit him to bail. It is stated both in the affidavit in support of the application and from the Bar by Mr Harry Lee Wee, counsel for the applicant, that the learned senior district judge brushed aside the application for bail after conviction and sentence with the remark that he never granted bail unless there were very special reasons and that, by refusing to grant bail, he failed or refused to exercise his discretion in the matter,
For the purposes of this application to the High Court under s 351, I am not really concerned with this matter in an appellate capacity as to his refusal to grant bail. I therefore propose to deal with the matter in the light of the relevant consideration advanced by his wife in the affidavit filed in support of the application with a view to deciding whether I should exercise my discretion in his favour.
I have carefully considered the trend of judicial opinion relating to the relevant factors to be weighed in the balance before the discretion to grant bail is exercised. At one stage, in 1907 and, later, in 1911 Fisher J expressed an opinion, which appears to have been acted upon for many years, to the effect that execution should be stayed pending appeal on the finding of reasonable security by a person convicted before the subordinate courts (see 
 Johore v R 
 (1907) 11 SSLR 36 and 
 R v Lim Soh Chwee 
 BCGH 178).
In 1954, in the case of 
 Doraisamy v PP 
 (KL Crim App 2/54) (unreported), Wilson J observed that a stay of execution should not be granted (under a provision similar to our s 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code) unless there are special reasons for doing so. He was also of the view that the mere fact that the applicant had been advised and verily believed that he had good grounds for appeal did not constitute sufficient grounds for releasing the applicant pending his appeal.
Later in the same year, Spenser Wilkinson J in 
 Re Kwan Wah Yip 
 
 
 
[1954] MLJ 146
  found himself in substantial agreement with the views expressed by Wilson J. He also said: 
 
When a lower court has refused bail then I agree that the High Court should not interfere with the discretion of the lower court unless there are good reasons for so doing and as the High Court has not heard the case such reasons must be set out in the affidavit in support of the application for bail. There may be cases in which a magistrate has made an error in law that is obvious on the face of the record and there may also be cases where it is plain that a magistrate has seriously misinterpreted the facts. Circumstances such as these might be reasons if properly set out in the affidavit which would induce the High Court to grant bail where the lower court has refused it.
 
 
 
It seems to me, however, that the granting of bail pending appeal by the lower court being a matter of discretion a magistrate may, apart from the accused`s statement that he intends to appeal, find in the circumstances of the case before him reasons which would justify the granting of bail. The considerations which I suggest should guide the subordinate courts in granting or refusing bail pending appeal in cases where a term of imprisonment has been imposed are the gravity or otherwise of the offence; the length of the term of imprisonment in comparison with the length of time which is likely to take for the appeal to be heard; whether there are difficult points of law involved; whether the accused is a first offender or has previous convictions; the possibility of his becoming again involved in similar or other offences whilst at liberty; and whether the security imposed will ensure the attendance of the appellant before the appellate court.
In 1956, Whyatt CJ in 
 Goh Bheow Yam v R 
 
 
[1956] MLJ 251
  agreed with the views expressed by Spenser Wilkinson J but added that the considerations set out by the latter should not be regarded as an exhaustive list. The learned Chief Justice then dealt with the application before him on the basis of a consideration not included in the list set out by Spenser Wilkinson J and dismissed the application on the ground that the magistrate concerned was fully justified in refusing bail where a person, after pleading guilty and being convicted and sentenced therefor, changed his mind and sought to withdraw his plea on the ground that he had not understood the charge. The learned magistrate was quite satisfied that he fully understood the charge before pleading guilty and was unimpressed by his desire to withdraw his plea. Whyatt CJ held that the magistrate had, in effect, not acted on some wrong principle.
On the facts spelt out in the affidavit in support of the application before me under s 351 I am satisfied that the senior district judge at the trial, by his use of the expression `special reasons`, when he refused bail, must have been aware of 
 Doraisamy`s 
case supra, where this expression was first used and 
 Kwan Wah Yip`s 
 case where Spenser Wilkinson J listed the considerations to which I have already referred.
The affidavit before me refers to the length of the term of imprisonment in comparison with the length of time which is likely to elapse before the appeal is heard which the deponent thinks will take from six months to two years, that this is his first conviction and that he is of good character and so on. She has not said anything about the gravity or otherwise of the offences of which he has been convicted.
In my view, most of these considerations must already have been known to the learned senior district judge by the conclusion of the trial and he could not have failed to take them into account at the time when he was required to impose sentence, which he did in about three days after he had convicted the appellant. I cannot say that it has been shown that he exercised an arbitrary discretion in the matter.
There are no new or compelling reasons set out in the affidavit which require me now to exercise my discretion in the matter in favour of the applicant. As Whyatt CJ said, Fisher J took the somewhat extreme view that bail should be granted in almost every case unless there was strong reason to suppose the appellant would abscond. I am aware that in the earlier part of this century it appears to have been the practice for magistrates to allow bail to convicted persons unless they had reasons for not allowing it. The usual reason was the expectation that the appellant would abscond. See 
 R v Tan Tee 
 
 
 
[1948] MLJ 153
 . Subsequent decisions to which I have referred earlier in this judgment make it clear that this is not the only reason for refusing bail.
The applicant`s guilt of a serious offence involving dishonesty has been proved to the satisfaction of a competent court after a lengthy trial. Every opportunity to vindicate himself has been afforded to him with the attendant glare of publicity sufficient to ensure the application of the best legal skills in the land not only on his behalf but in the interests of society as well. I am satisfied from what I know and have been informed as to the length of time it will take for the appeal to be heard that it is unlikely that it will not be heard within the next three to four months and I would exhort those responsible for the preparation of the record to be as expeditious as they can in order to ensure that it will be so heard.
In comparison with another lengthy record recently which took only a little over four months to be heard notwithstanding the fact that grounds of decision were not delivered until sometime after conviction, I understand that in the present case grounds of judgment were in fact delivered on the date of conviction itself and are already available.
Although they are now ready, no sufficient ground has been advanced in the affidavit to satisfy me that there are serious defects or demerits in that judgment which necessitate my intervention to the extent of granting bail on the ground that his chances of success are so good as to warrant his release from incarceration now.
The other reasons pleaded such as the effect of imprisonment on his wife and family at the present time, his good character and so on are reasons which, whilst they may arouse sympathy, many other convicted persons can also advance. As I have already said, they are not however the only considerations to be borne in mind.
The application is dismissed.

On 23 December 1969 Mrs Watanabe, a Japanese woman, arrived in Singapore with her three children, the eldest an eight-year-old daughter Chieko Watanabe, to join her husband, Mr Hiroshi Watanabe, a mechanical engineer, employed by a Japanese corporation undertaking reclamation work along the eastern seafront. Mr Watanabe had come to Singapore alone in January 1966. In October 1966 he met Mimi Wong, the first appellant, who was then working as a waitress, and started dating her. About eight months after they first met they became intimate and a few months later they lived together at her home.
On 6 January 1970, two weeks after her arrival, Mrs Watanabe was killed at No 55 Jalan Sea View where she was living with her husband and children. The killing took place in the evening around 9.30pm when her husband was away from home doing late work. She was stabbed twice in the neck and once in the abdomen and she had three other knife injuries in the right hand. One of the two neck wounds cut the external jugular vein and the abdominal wound cut the aorta and nicked the lumbar vertebra. She died as a result of shock and haemorrhage from these two stab wounds, death occurring within ten minutes.
At the time of the killing the first appellant and her husband, Sim Woh Kum, the second appellant, who had lived apart from her since 1963, were in Mrs Watanabe`s home. Her husband returning home at about 10.30pm found her dead lying in a pool of blood on the floor of the bathroom on the first floor of the premises and his three children huddled together crying outside the bathroom door. He asked his eldest child, Chieko, who was responsible and she told him it was the first appellant and a man.
The appellants were charged and convicted by the High Court of the murder of Mrs Watanabe after a trial lasting over four weeks. They now appeal against their convictions.
The main prosecution witness was Chieko. During the fortnight she was in Singapore before her mother`s death she had been with the first appellant on several occasions. Her evidence was believed and accepted by the trial judges. She said that she was in bed, but not asleep that evening when she heard footsteps coming upstairs and heard voices, one a man`s voice, in the corridor outside her bedroom. Then the first appellant entered her bedroom, walked round the room and then walked out. After that she heard voices coming from the adjacent bathroom and then she heard her mother scream in pain. She got out of bed and went to the bathroom. She saw her mother sitting on the bathroom floor just in front of the toilet bowl. A man, whom she subsequently identified as the second appellant at an identification parade, was pulling her mother`s left hand and the first appellant was holding her mother`s right hand. She cried when she saw blood on her mother`s chest but when the first appellant covered her mouth with her hand she stopped crying whereupon the first appellant released her. She then went back to her bedroom and tried but failed to awaken her brother. She then returned to the bathroom and saw the appellants rushing down the stairs. She saw her mother standing in the bathroom, staggering a few steps and falling down. She cried `mother, mother` but there was no response. Subsequently she managed to wake her brother and sister and all three of them stood outside the bathroom crying until their father on his return home found them there.
The next day, 7 January 1970, at an identification parade the second appellant was identified by Chieko as the man she saw struggling with her mother in the bathroom on the night of 6 January 1970. The second appellant was then arrested and charged with the murder of Mrs Watanabe. Later that same evening the first appellant was arrested and also charged with the murder of Mrs Watanabe. After the charge had been read out to her and the usual caution given to her she made a statement to Inspector Tan Kim Hai which was recorded by him and which recorded statement she signed.
Her statement was admitted in evidence at the trial and in it she said she went with a man to Mrs Watanabe`s house in a taxi and went upstairs where she did the stabbing.
On 8 January 1970 the second appellant made a statement before a magistrate and this statement was also admitted in evidence at the trial. In his statement he said that he met the first appellant, at her request, on 2 January when she asked him to assist her in killing `a certain person` and she would give him money in return for his assistance. He said that he advised her against doing this and told her he was not greedy for money. On 6 January at about 9pm the first appellant brought his youngest son to his house and at her request he accompanied her to her place of work and eventually to Mrs Watanabe`s house. Mrs Watanabe let them in and the first appellant told Mrs Watanabe that he was a plumber who had come to repair the broken wash basin. He said that after the first appellant had taken out a knife from her handbag, he threw some toilet cleansing liquid which was in a Glucolin tin on to the eyes of Mrs Watanabe who was then stabbed by the first appellant. Later they ran out of the house, boarded a passing taxi to the house of a friend where the first appellant stayed for the night whilst he returned to his home.
Going back to the evening of 6 January 1970, Mr Watanabe after finding his wife was dead went to the Joo Chiat Police Station with his three children and reported the fact of his wife`s death. Inspector Tan Kim Hai went to Mr Watanabe`s home and in the bathroom saw the deceased lying face upwards dead and a knife lying between her thighs. He also saw an empty Glucolin tin on the bathroom floor and noticed the wash basin was broken.
In January 1970 the first appellant was living at No 135A Rose Garden and employed a female house servant, Tan Sin Tse, who besides doing the cooking also looked after the first appellant`s daughter. Tan Sin Tse said that on the evening of 6 January 1970 the first appellant and Mr Watanabe, after he had dinner there, left the house together. Shortly after 10pm the first appellant returned home and again left the house taking her daughter with her. Tan Sin Tse carried a leather bag and put it in a taxi into which the first appellant entered with her daughter. Tan Sin Tse saw a man seated at the rear seat of the taxi.
The appellants went in the taxi to the house of Lee Cheng Swee a friend of the second appellant where she and her daughter stayed the night and left the following morning sometime between 8am and 9am. Later that afternoon she went to her stepmother`s house and confessed to having stabbed a Japanese woman with a small knife while she was intoxicated. Her stepmother then took her to the home of her natural mother.
At the trial the first appellant retracted her confession to her stepmother and her statement to the police that she stabbed the Japanese woman. She testified that she was angry with the deceased and slapped her and a fight ensued in the bathroom. While they were fighting she said the second appellant threw some liquid from a Glucolin tin at the deceased causing the deceased to scream. During the fighting the deceased bit her on her right ring finger and she pushed the deceased who fell - backwards hitting her head against a wall. She fell on top of the deceased but managed to free herself and ran downstairs and out of the deceased`s house while the second appellant was still upstairs. She stopped a passing taxi and got into it and then the second appellant also got into the taxi and they proceeded to her house from where after fetching her daughter they proceeded to the house of a friend of the second appellant.
At the trial the second appellant also retracted his statement to the magistrate that he had been asked by the first appellant to assist in killing a person with a promise of money for his assistance as well as his statement that after she took out a knife and a pair of gloves he threw the contents of a Glucolin tin which was half filled with towel cleansing liquid on to the eyes of the deceased who fell down and was then stabbed by the first appellant. His testimony at the trial was that he was taken to the deceased`s house to have a look at a broken wash basin in a bathroom; that while he waited outside the first appellant and the deceased entered the bathroom to tidy it up; that a little later he heard a commotion coming from the bathroom and a scream; that he rushed into the bathroom and saw the first appellant stabbing the deceased with a knife in the region of the neck; that he separated them and pushed the first appellant out of the bathroom and in so doing was bitten on the right index finger by the deceased who fell down sitting on the bathroom floor; that the first appellant rushed back into the bathroom but he prevented her from further assaulting the deceased by pushing her away from the deceased who was seated on the floor of the bathroom and that thereafter the first appellant ran away. He himself got frightened on seeing blood on the deceased`s chest and followed the first appellant downstairs and out of the house. They boarded a passing taxi which took them to the first appellant`s house and subsequently to the house of his friend, Lee Cheng Swee, where he arranged for her to stay the night.
The trial judges rejected the evidence of the second appellant. They found that the idea of throwing the detergent came from him; that he brought the Glucolin tin containing the detergent; that he requested the first appellant to lure the deceased to the bathroom on the pretext of inspecting the broken wash basin; that he mixed water with the detergent; that he wrapped a towel round the Glucolin tin to prevent his leaving finger prints on it; that he threw the detergent into the eyes of the deceased after he saw the first appellant had taken a knife and was ready to stab the deceased and that he was clearly a party to the stabbing of the deceased.
On the facts we have outlined the trial judges found that it was the first appellant who inflicted the fatal injuries and that she inflicted them deliberately, not accidentally, with great force on vital parts of the body. They also said that it was a fair inference that the fatal injuries were inflicted either with the intention of causing the death of the deceased or with the intention of causing bodily injury to the deceased and came to the conclusion that `as the injuries actually inflicted were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death` the person who inflicted those injuries would be guilty of murder. They also found that the appellants had either of two common intentions namely (a) a common intention to cause deceased`s death, or (b) a common intention to inflict bodily injury on the deceased with a knife and that in furtherance of `that common intention the first appellant inflicted with a knife serious injuries on the deceased which resulted in her death`.
Several arguments have been raised on behalf of both appellants to the effect that the trial judges have misdirected themselves on the meaning of the third limb of s 300 and of s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 119, 1955 Ed).
One argument is that a person cannot be found guilty of murder by the application of the third limb of s 300 unless it is proved that the fatal injury found to be present was the injury intended to be inflicted and as the trial judges merely found, by inference, that the first appellant inflicted the fatal injuries with the intention of causing bodily injury to the deceased with a knife the offence committed by the first appellant could not amount to the offence of murder as defined in s 300.
We are in no doubt that the law as regards the third limb of s 300 is as so argued and we are in full agreement with the Supreme Court of India In 
 Virsa Singh v State of Punjab 
 [1958] CLJ 818 where the correct legal position as regards the third limb of s 300 of the Indian Penal Code (which is in identical terms with our s 300) has been set out in the judgment of Bose J.
Although we agree that there has been a misdirection of law on the part of the trial judges we have to consider the Deputy Public Prosecutor`s submission to us to apply the proviso contained in s 54 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed) which provides that this court: 
 
may, notwithstanding that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.
 
 
 
He relies on the trial judges` findings that the fatal injuries were knife injuries deliberately, not accidentally, inflicted by the first appellant with great force on vital parts of the deceased`s body. He submits that on the whole of the evidence and where the first appellant`s defence at the trial that she did not inflict the knife injuries was rejected, the conclusion is inescapable, and the only inference possible on the facts, was that she intended to inflict the two fatal injuries found on the neck and abdomen of the deceased and that those two injuries were not accidental nor otherwise unintentional. The point raised is a novel one and a difficult one to resolve having regard to the circumstances of the present case. On the evidence before them the trial judges, having arrived at the findings of fact we have just outlined, apparently omitted to consider whether or not the first appellant had the intention to inflict the fatal injuries present. We are of the opinion, based purely on the trial judges` other findings of fact and their rejection of the first appellant`s defence, that any reasonable jury, had there been a jury, on those proved facts, and particularly the finding that she deliberately, not accidentally, inflicted the fatal injuries with great force on vital parts of the body, would undoubtedly have gone on to draw the inference that the first appellant intended to inflict the fatal injuries found on the deceased. Indeed, the inference that she intended those injuries is irresistible. The difficulty to be resolved is whether this court, the Court of Criminal Appeal, should in the circumstances apply the proviso to s 54 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act where the trial judges in giving their reasons for convicting the first appellant of murder under the third limb of s 300 of the Penal Code disclosed they had failed to draw the irresistible inference that the first appellant had the intention required under the third limb but where the other proved facts would undoubtedly support the conviction.
We do not consider that the many English authorities which deal with a similar proviso in England ought to guide us because of the fundamental difference that in England the system is trial by jury whereas our system is trial without a jury. In the light of our own system we are of the opinion that on the true construction of the proviso this court, if it is satisfied on the facts as found proved by the trial court and if it is also satisfied on those proved facts that other irresistible inferences of fact ought to be drawn which, if drawn, would support the verdict of guilty arrived at by the trial court, ought to give full effect to the proviso. We would accordingly apply the proviso as against the first appellant in the circumstances of the present case.
The next argument advanced depends on the interpretation of s 34. It is argued this section can only be applied if the common intention of the persons accused of an offence is to commit the offence with which they are charged. In other words it is argued that the second appellant will not be guilty of the offence under s 302 of the Penal Code unless the common intention of the appellants was to cause the death of Mrs Watanabe, or was such other intention as is mentioned in s 300 of the Penal Code. Section 34 is in these words: 
 
When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.
 
 
 
There is no doubt that for this section to apply there must be in existence a common intention between all the persons who committed the criminal act, and that a criminal act be done in furtherance of that common intention. When these two requirements are proved, each of such persons would be liable for the entire criminal act in the same manner as if he had done it alone. The Privy Council in 
 Mahbub Shah v Emperor 
AIR 1945 PC 118 said this of s 34: 
 
Section 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section does not say `the common intentions of all` nor does it say `an intention common to all`. Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke the aid of s 34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all. If this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone.
 
 
 
In an earlier case, 
 Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor 
AIR 1925 PC 1 the Privy Council said: 
 
Section 34 deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or diverse, by several persons; if all are done in furtherance of a common intention, each person is liable for the result of them all, as if he had done them himself, for `that act` and `the act` in the latter part of the section must include the whole action covered by `a criminal act` in the first part, because they refer to it:
 
 
 
...
In other words, `a criminal act` means that unity of criminal behaviour, which results in something for which an individual would be punishable if it were done by himself alone, that is a criminal offence.
It is clear from the Privy Council`s interpretation of the words `criminal act` that it is the result of a criminal act which is a criminal offence. It then remains, in any particular case, to find out the actual offence constituted by the `criminal act`. If the nature of the offence depends on a particular intention the intention of the actual doer of the criminal act has to be considered. What this intention is will decide the offence committed by him and then s 34 applies to make the others vicariously or collectively liable for the same offence. The intention that is an ingredient of the offence constituted by the criminal act is the intention of the actual doer and must be distinguished from the common intention of the doer and his confederates. It may be identical with the common intention or it may not. Where it is not identical with the common intention, it must nevertheless be consistent with the carrying out of the common intention, otherwise the criminal act done by the actual doer would not be in furtherance of the common intention. Thus if 
 A 
and 
 B 
form a common intention to cause injury to 
 C 
with a knife and 
 A 
holds 
 C 
while 
 B 
stabs 
 C 
deliberately in the region of the heart and the stab wound is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, 
 B 
is clearly guilty of murder. Applying s 34 it is also clear that B`s act in stabbing 
 C 
is in furtherance of the common intention to cause injury to 
 C 
with a knife because 
 B` 
s act is clearly consistent with the carrying out of that common intention and as their `criminal act`, ie that unity of criminal behaviour, resulted in the criminal offence of murder punishable under s 302. 
 A 
is also guilty of murder.
On the facts of the present case, we are accordingly of the opinion that s 34 has been properly applied with regard to the charge against the second appellant. On his behalf it is also argued that his statement before the magistrate was wrongly admitted in evidence at the trial because an inducement had been held out by the magistrate. This argument is totally unsupported by any evidence and we reject it. It is also argued that the evidence before the trial court was insufficient to prove that he shared a common intention with the first appellant to cause bodily injury to Mrs Watanabe with a knife. We also reject this argument as there was ample evidence to support the trial court`s finding on common intention.
On behalf of the first appellant it is also contended that the trial judges erred in law in holding that the statement made by the first appellant to Inspector Tan Kim Hai was a voluntary statement and ought to have exercised their discretion in her favour by refusing to admit it in evidence. This ground is without substance as s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code expressly enacts that such a statement shall be admissible in evidence at the trial. The proviso to s 121(5) gives the trial court a discretion to refuse to admit such statement: 
 
(a) if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him; or
 
 
 
 
(b) in the case of a statement made by such person after his arrest if it appears to the court that the statement was not made and recorded substantially in compliance with the provisions of the rules set out in Sch E to this Code.
  
 
 
In the present case on the evidence the proviso is clearly inapplicable.
Another contention is that the trial judges erred in law in refusing to allow Dr Wong Yip Cheong, an expert whom the first appellant desired to call to testify to her state of mind at the time when she made her statement that her statement was not voluntary. Under our criminal law the test of admissibility is not the common law test of voluntariness but is governed by s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code read with the proviso we have earlier set out. Section 121(5) reads as follows: 
 
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of inspector shall be admissible at his trial in evidence ...
 
 
 
A more substantial ground of appeal is that the trial judges were wrong in holding that at the time of the commission of the offence the first appellant was not suffering from any abnormality of the mind and in holding that even if she were so suffering it had not caused impairment of her brain function so as to have substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts in causing the death of Mrs Watanabe.
One of the defences relied on by the first appellant was the defence of diminished responsibility. By exception 7 of s 300 of the Penal Code: 
 
Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.
 
 
 
A great deal of medical evidence was tendered at the trial by both the prosecution and the defence on this issue and it is clear from their grounds of decision that the trial judges considered all the material evidence on this issue and were aware that the evidential burden which lay on the first appellant was `merely to show that the existence of circumstances bringing her case within the said exception was more probable than not`.
The defence case was that at the time of the commission of the offence she was suffering from encephalitis which had reached the stage when there would be impairment of the brain function to an extent as to have substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts. This defence was based primarily on the evidence of Dr Tan Bok Yang, consultant physician attached to the General Hospital and on the evidence of Dr Wong Yip Chong, a private consultant psychiatrist. Dr Tan first examined the first appellant on 14 January 1970 eight days after the commission of the offence and provisionally diagnosed her as suffering from meningitis which is also a viral infection of the brain primarily affecting the brain covering or meninges. Dr Tan saw her again the next day after having advised a lumbar puncture and he diagnosed her as suffering from meningitis because of the presence of Globulin in the cerebral spinal fluid and a marked increase in the protein content of the cerebral spinal fluid. The physical symptoms found on or complained of by her were that she fainted on the way to the toilet; she had headache and giddiness; she was rather slow; she had a slight temperature of 99.6F and had stiffness of the neck. During her stay in hospital her temperature subsided after 15 January but she complained of a poor appetite, poor memory and inability to sleep. The signs that were observed from day to day during her stay in hospital included a depressed state, an emotional instability, crying and on one particular day she threw things about. She was therefore referred to the hospital psychiatrist who found her depressed and crying and prescribed sedative and anti-depressive drugs. Another lumbar puncture was carried out on 20 January which showed Globulin still present but the protein content in the cerebral spinal fluid had decreased indicating that the patient was showing recovery. A white corpuscle count showed a total of 11,000 as against a normal average of from 5,000 to 8,000. Her blood sedimentation rate was f ound to be raised to 20 millimetres per hour for the first hour as against a normal of zero to seven millimetres. A skull X-ray and a urine examination showed no abnormality. Dr Tan`s opinion and diagnosis made at the time when she was in hospital was that taking the overall picture she was suffering from a viral infection of the brain of the nature of benign lymphocytic meningitis.
Subsequently, many months later on 31 October 1970, at the request of Dr Wong Yip Chong, a Private consultant psychiatrist, Dr Tan reviewed the first appellant`s medical case and closely analysed the clinical history, the symptoms and the signs and as a result of this review he told the trial court that he was: 
 
able to say and give an opinion now that she could have had an infection of the brain by a virus of another variety or strain other than benign lymphocytic meningitis, and most probably of the strain or variety of the Japanese 
 `B`
encephalitis which affects primarily the brain substance or cells but may secondarily affect the brain covering or the meninges.
 
 
 
Dr Tan said that: 
 
the differentiation between meningitis and encephalitis could sometimes be very difficult but in this particular case there were several factors which made the possibility of encephalitis likely.
 
 
 
According to him the factors which made the possibility of encephalitis likely were, first, the predominance of mental complaints such as crying, being emotional and throwing things about. The second factor was that her neck rigidity was very variable during her stay in hospital. The third factor was she had a poor memory and complained of lethargy and an inability to sleep which symptoms are more common in encephalitis than in meningitis. The fourth and last factor was that the report given for cells in the cerebral spinal fluid was nil which is indicative of encephalitis rather than meningitis because the cerebral spinal fluid is in more direct contact with the brain covering rather than with the brain so that if a person has meningitis which involves primarily the brain covering then the infection will produce cells in the cerebral spinal fluid.
Dr Tan however admitted that he could not positively say she was suffering from encephalitis or a viral infection of the brain on 6 January and assuming she had a viral infection probably of the encephalitis strain on 6 January she would be very likely in the incubation or prodromal stage of her illness. He also said her actions on that day do not suggest to him that there was impairment of the function of her brain. It was common ground that in encephalitis there are three definite stages beginning with the incubation stage, then the prodromal stage and finally the frank stage but the period when one stage merges into the next is variable. It was also common ground that a person suffering from encephalitis may have that illness in a mild or moderate or severe form.
Dr Wong Yip Chong, a private consultant psychiatrist, called as an expert witness for the first appellant said that upon the basis that she was suffering from encephalitis on 14 January and upon projection backwards he was of the opinion that she would still be suffering from encephalitis which was likely to be in a more severe form, on 6 January. On that basis he was of the opinion that in the context of the circumstances governing the alleged offence, her mind had, by reason of this illness of the brain, been abnormally affected to such a substantial degree that her mental responsibility could be reasonably considered to be significantly diminished.
Dr Ngui a psychiatrist and the Deputy Superintendent of Woodbridge Hospital said that assuming she was suffering from encephalitis on 6 January, the stage of development of the encephalitic illness is important from the point of her mental responsibility at the time of the offence. If it was during the frank stage that she committed the offence alleged, where symptoms of the brain dysfunction in the form of confusion, disorientation, stupor, sensory and speech disturbances are present then, depending on the severity of these symptoms, she is very likely to come under the purview of either the 
 McNaughton 
rules of insanity or of diminished responsibility. If it was during the prodromal stage again depending on the nature and severity of the prodromal symptoms she could come under the purview of diminished responsibility. If it was during the incubation stage, it is very unlikely that there would be impairment of the brain function and therefore it is very unlikely that she would come under the purview of diminished responsibility. Based on the facts presented by the prosecution Dr Ngui`s opinion was that it is improbable that she could have been suffering from the frank stage of encephalitis on 6 January and it is unlikely that she could have been suffering from the prodromal stage of encephalitis on that day and if she was suffering from encephalitis at the incubation stage, the fact that during this stage there were usually no symptoms would mean that the illness at that stage would not have adversely affected her mental responsibility at that time.
The trial judges, on the whole of the evidence, were not satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that at the time of the commission of the offence the first appellant was suffering from any abnormality of the mind. They then went on to find, even assuming she was at that time suffering from encephalitis, that they were not satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the illness had caused impairment of the brain function so as to have substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts in causing the death of Mrs Watanabe.
In our judgment there was ample evidence to support the trial judges` findings. Even Dr Tan, the consultant physician under whose care she was placed eight days after the commission of the offence, throughout the period she was under his care diagnosed her as suffering from meningitis. Although, when subsequently reviewing the case, he arrived at the opinion that she could have been suffering from encephalitis rather than meningitis, he could not say positively that she was so suffering at the time of the commission of the offence and, if she were, he was of the opinion that very likely the illness was at the incubation or prodromal stage. He also said that her actions on that day do not suggest to him that there was any impairment of the function of her brain.
For all these reasons the appeals of both appellants are dismissed.

The respondent, Sa`ad bin Ahmad, while travelling as a fare-paying passenger on a bus operated by the appellants, Keppel Bus Co, was struck on the left eye with a ticket punch by the bus conductor. He sued the appellants and the bus conductor for damages for personal injuries and consequent loss and expense caused by this assault and battery.
The bus conductor conducted his own defence and in his statement of defence claimed that the injury caused to the respondent was accidental and was caused while defending himself from a blow by the respondent. The appellants, while admitting they employed the bus conductor, denied liability on the ground that the assault was not within the scope of the bus conductor`s authority and was an independent act unconnected with his employment. Alternatively, the appellants pleaded volenti non fit injuria, alleging that the injury was caused by the bus conductor in the course of defending himself from a blow by the respondent.
At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge gave judgment for the respondent against the appellants and the bus conductor and awarded the respondent $20,290 damages and costs. The appellants now appeal and as one of the grounds of appeal is that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence it is necessary to set out the facts in some detail.
The respondent said that as the bus was travelling along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim towards Jurong he was seated nearer the rear portion on a seat next to the central aisle. A Malay woman who was seated two seats in front of him also next to the aisle wanted to alight and was told by the conductor in a harsh tone to wait near the door of the bus. On hearing this he told the conductor the woman might fall but the conductor resented this intrusion and abused him. By then the bus had stopped and the Malay woman had alighted. On being abused he got up from his seat, touched the conductor, who was standing in front of him, on the shoulder, and told the conductor not to abuse him. The conductor continued to abuse him with the same words of abuse and blows were exchanged. He was unable to remember who struck the first blow. Some of the passengers intervened and he sat down with the conductor still standing in front of him. When he was so seated something hard hit the sun glasses he was then wearing, breaking the glass over the left eye and a broken piece of the glass entered his left eye eventually causing him to lose the sight of that eye.
A passenger, Mohamed Daud, gave evidence for the respondent. Mohamed Daud said he was seated behind the respondent and heard a Malay woman telling the conductor she wanted to alight and the conductor telling her to go and wait by the door of the bus. He then heard the respondent, who was seated, telling the conductor, who was standing in front of the respondent, that it was dangerous to tell the woman passenger to wait by the door of the bus. The conductor asked the respondent what he wanted and the respondent replied he would report the conductor to his employers. Then, while the Malay woman was still seated the conductor threw a punch at the respondent which missed. Soon after, the bus stopped at a bus stop and the Malay woman alighted from the bus. After she had alighted Mohamed Daud heard the conductor abusing the respondent and saw them standing facing each other. Nothing happened between them and the respondent sat down. Then Mohamed Daud saw the conductor holding the ticket punch in his left hand and with his left hand hit the respondent on the left eye. In cross-examination Mohamed Daud said that when the conductor threw the first punch, using the right hand, the respondent retaliated and some blows were then exchanged which ended when some passengers intervened.
The bus conductor elected not to give evidence on his own behalf but was called as a witness for the appellants. He said that at the material time the bus was full and there were about ten standing passengers. The Malay woman was seated in the first row immediately behind the driver. He saw her raised hand, went up to her and told her if she wanted to alight to walk to the side of the entrance cum exit door as the bus was crowded. As she did not get up, he pressed the bell for the driver to stop the bus for her to get down and then he moved to the middle of the bus. Then the respondent walked up to him, stood in front of him and asked why he was chasing the female passenger out of the bus. He told the respondent he was teaching her how to get down from the bus and the respondent said he would lodge a complaint to which he replied he could do so and to mind his own business. Then the respondent aimed a punch at his face which he avoided and he in turn threw a punch which also missed. At that stage the passengers intervened and the bus stopped and the Malay woman alighted. He then gave the signal for the bus to proceed and went about his job of collecting fares and punching tickets. While he was at the middle portion of the bus collecting fares the respondent who was standing in front of him suddenly punched him on the left cheek and he hit back. He had the ticket punch in his right hand and it accidentally touched the respondent`s spectacles. They struggled until the passengers again separated them. In cross-examination he admitted he shouted loudly at the female passenger because he was angry and because she had no ticket. He also admitted he was angry and rude to her and used bad language on the respondent who was seated near the female passenger.
In his grounds of decision the trial judge found the facts to be as follows: 
 
On the day in question I find that the conductor spoke to the elderly Malay lady in a loud and rude manner. The plaintiff clearly took exception to this and that is why he questioned the conductor regarding this request to the Malay lady in the manner he had narrated in his evidence. The conductor resented this intervention by the plaintiff and an altercation developed followed with some exchange of blows. The passengers in the bus promptly intervened and separated the two. The plaintiff went back to his seat and the conductor began collecting fares from his passengers standing near the plaintiff and facing him then. He was then uttering abusive words in Chinese probably at the plaintiff and evidently not having cooled off from the earlier incident.
 
 
 
The plaintiff stood up at this and asked him not to use abusive words and then sat down. It was as soon as the plaintiff sat down that the conductor hit him on his left eye with the ticket punch. Having seen and heard PW2 and his demonstration of how this punch was delivered I accept his evidence on this point. I find that this blow was delivered by the conductor when the plaintiff was seated. I find that there was only one scuffle between the two and only one intervention by the passengers as the plaintiff and PW2 say and not two of each as stated by the conductor. I do not accept the conductor`s version that he was struck by the plaintiff suddenly on his cheek and that it was after that that he got excited and hit back at the plaintiff and accidentally broke his glasses with the ticket punch. Any injury that the conductor received on his cheek was not caused in the manner suggested by the conductor. Having heard him give evidence I do not consider him to be a truthful witness. I do not accept his evidence that this ticket punch accidentally struck the plaintiff`s glasses. I find the conductor hit the plaintiff with the ticket punch and even though he may not have intended such an injury to his eye he should have been aware that it was likely that such an injury was likely to be caused. He clearly knew what he was doing when he struck the plaintiff with the ticket punch.
It is contended on behalf of the appellants that the trial judge ought to have found the following facts, namely:
 
 
(i) That it was the plaintiff who aimed the first blow in the incident which led to his injury; 
 
(ii) That the conductor received his injuries from a blow by the plaintiff; 
 
(iii) That there was a distinct break between the first incident prior to the Malay lady passenger alighting from the bus and the second incident which occurred after she had alighted, and the conductor had resumed his collection of fares; 
 
(iv) That the breaking of the plaintiffs spectacles was not deliberate but accidental and that the injuries sustained by him were not intentional but consequential upon the breaking of the spectacles.
  
 
 
The principles which an appellate tribunal ought to bear in mind when considering a complaint that the trial court has made wrong findings of primary facts have been stated by numerous authorities but it will be sufficient to cite a passage from Lord Sumner`s opinion in 
 Owners of Steamship Hontestroom v Owners of Steamship Sagaporack 
 
[1927] AC 37
 at p 40: 
 
Of course, there is jurisdiction to retry the case on the shorthand note, including in such retrial the appreciation of the relative values of the witnesses ... It is not, however, a mere matter of discretion to remember and take account of this fact; it is a matter of justice and of judicial obligation. None the less, not to have seen the witnesses puts appellate judges in a permanent position of disadvantage as against the trial judge, and, unless it can be shown that he has failed to use or has palpably misused his advantage, the higher court ought not to take the responsibility of reversing conclusions so arrived at, merely on the result of their own comparisons and criticisms of the witnesses and of their own view of the probabilities of the case.
 
 
 
Bearing these principles in mind we are of the opinion, with regard to (i) that the trial judge`s finding that the conductor struck the first blow ought not to be reversed and that it was amply supported by the evidence. With regard to (ii) it is immaterial whether or not the cheek injury suffered by the conductor was inflicted by the respondent. What is material is the finding that it was not caused in the manner suggested by the conductor and this is a finding of fact which is supported by the evidence. With regard to (iii) what is material is that after the break, the finding of the trial judge is that while the respondent was seated the conductor standing over him hit him on the eye with the left hand in which was the ticket punch. Finally, with regard to (iv) the trial judge was justified in rejecting the conductor`s evidence that the breaking of the respondent`s spectacles with the resultant eye injury was purely accidental.
Another ground of appeal argued before us is that on any view of the facts the trial judge ought to have held that the appellants were not vicariously liable because this was not a case of a servant doing something he was authorised to do albeit in a wrongful unauthorised manner but was a case of an assault outside the province of his duties perpetrated in the course of a private quarrel. The trial judge said the real question was whether the conductor when he hit the respondent was acting in the course of his employment and answered it in these words: 
 
I find that the conductor when he hit the plaintiff was acting in the course of his duties. He was then maintaining order amongst the passengers in the bus. He was in effect telling the plaintiff by his act not to interfere with him in his due performance of his duties. He may have acted in a very high handed manner but nonetheless I am of the opinion that he was acting in the due performance of his duties then.
 
 
 
A bus conductor`s lot is quite often a very harassing one especially in a busy metropolis and particularly during peak hours of traffic. He is often, in the proper discharge of his duties, called upon to show qualities of patience, tolerance, tact and forbearance. In the course of his duties he will have to deal with all kinds of passengers.
Apart from collecting the appropriate fares from the passengers and seeing that they get in and alight from the bus properly he is also responsible for the maintenance of order in the bus and the general welfare of all the passengers. Bus companies should take good care to see that people with the wrong temperament are not employed by them in this capacity. Otherwise they may run the risk of having to meet situations such as this.
It is argued for the appellants that as the trial judge found there was a distinct gap in the events between the conductor and the respondent being separated by the passengers after the exchange of blows and the second incident when the conductor hit the respondent, the conductor`s act which caused the eye injury was clearly outside the scope of his employment and not an unauthorised mode of doing an authorised act. It is conceded, however, that one of the duties of a bus conductor is the maintenance of order in the bus but it is submitted that the trial judge was wrong in holding that the conductor when he hit the respondent in the eye was then maintaining order in the bus.
The applicable law is not in dispute and is contained in a passage from 
 Salmond 
on Torts cited with approval by the Privy Council in 
 Canadian Pacific Railway Co v Lockhart 
 
[1942] AC 591
 at p 599: 
 
It is clear that the master is responsible for acts actually authorized by him: for liability would exist in this case, even if the relation between the parties was merely one of agency, and not one of service at all. But a master, as opposed to the employer of an independent contractor, is liable even for acts which he has not authorized, provided they are so connected with acts which he has authorized that they may rightly be regarded as modes - although improper modes - of doing them. In other words, a master is responsible not merely for what he authorizes his servant to do, but also for the way in which he does it. On the other hand, if the unauthorized and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorized act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible: for in such a case the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it.
 
 
 
Numerous authorities, English, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian were cited during the hearing of the appeal but it is plain from these that the law to be applied is as above stated. The difficult question in each of those cases is whether or not, on the facts, the act done by the servant, albeit an unauthorized and wrongful act, is an act done in the course of the servant`s employment. If it is done in the course of the employment the master is vicariously liable and, if it is not, the master is not liable.
On the evidence before him the trial judge found that although there was a distinct gap, as stated above, the lapse of time between the two incidents was so very short that for all intents and purposes the whole incident should be considered as one continuous event. This finding, which is a matter for the trial judge, disposes of the contention that the eye injury was caused by the conductor in the course of a private quarrel.
In our judgment there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to come to the conclusion that the conductor in hitting the respondent on the eye was acting in the course of his employment albeit acting in a very high-handed manner. In our opinion on the facts of the present case the appellants have been rightly held to be vicariously liable for the assault committed by the conductor and we would accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs.

Duty of driver of motor vehicle following another motor vehicle
 
This appeal arises from a claim for damages for personal injuries sustained by the respondent and said to have been caused by the negligence of the appellant in the driving of a motor vehicle along New Changi Road, Singapore on 23 April 1970. The trial of the action resulted in judgment being given for the respondent on 23 September 1971 in the sum of $76,624 and costs. The appellant now appeals against the said judgment. The appeal is a limited one and is only against the trial judge`s finding that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the respondent.
The facts according to the respondent`s version which was accepted by the learned Chief Justice who tried this action are these. The respondent, a young man not yet 21 at the date of the accident, was riding a motor scooter along New Changi Road towards the city. He was following a Morris Minor van driven by the appellant. Just before the accident the respondent was travelling at 30 miles per hour and was about 30 feet behind the appellant`s van when the appellant suddenly pulled up. The respondent applied his brakes and took evasive action by swerving to the right but without success. His scooter collided into the rear offside corner of the van. He did not fall off at the point of impact but went forward another ten feet before he fell from the scooter. His scooter finished up 58 feet from the point of impact. The respondent explained that this was due to the fact that he did not attempt to bring his scooter to a dead stop. He did not do that because he wanted to take evasive action and also because a dead stop might overturn his scooter.
The reason given by the appellant for pulling up was that he saw a tortoise on the road, about a foot from the grass verge. After passing the tortoise he slowed down, gave a hand signal that he was slowing down and came to a gradual stop about two or three feet from the left edge of the road. His intention was to get the tortoise off the road. He denied that he pulled up suddenly.
At the conclusion of the trial the learned Chief Justice delivered an oral judgment and made the following finding: 
 
I have no doubt whatsoever after hearing and seeing the witnesses before me whose evidence I accept based on credibility and demeanour. I must do not accept the defendant`s evidence at all. The probabilities of the case clearly also indicate that the plaintiff`s evidence as to how the accident happened is more probable but I base my judgment on the fact that I accept the plaintiff`s evidence and I disbelieve the defendant. So, clearly the accident happened because I find the defendant applied his brakes suddenly, gave no indication whatsoever that he was going to do this, as it turned out, not only a stupid act but a negligent act with serious consequences for the plaintiff, all because of a tortoise which he found crawling along the road in front of him.
 
 
 
There is no point in my repeating all the evidence. Finding as I do there can be no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff merely because he was travelling at a speed of 30 miles an hour following the defendant who was travelling at the same speed and staying at a distance of 30 feet behind the defendant on this particular stretch of the road at this particular time of the day and with the traffic as it was at the time of the collision ...
Before us, there is no complaint regarding the finding of negligence on the part of the appellant. The complaint is that on the respondent`s own version of the accident, which was accepted by the learned Chief Justice, there was evidence of contributory negligence on the part of the respondent. The submission is that the respondent was negligent in that he failed to carry out his duty as the driver of a motor vehicle following another motor vehicle and a number of authorities were cited in support of this submission.
Observations on the duty of the driver of a motor vehicle which is following another motor vehicle have been made in many reported cases. In 
 Brown & Lynn v Western SMT Co 
 1945 SC 31. Lord Justice-Clerk (Cooper) said, at p 35: 
 
... The distance which should separate two vehicles travelling one behind the other must depend upon many variable factors - their speed, the nature of the locality, the other traffic present or to be expected, the opportunity available to the following driver of commanding a view ahead of the leading vehicle, the distance within which the following vehicle can be pulled up, and many other things. The following driver is, in my view, bound, so far as reasonably possible, to take up such a position, and to drive in such a fashion, as will enable him to deal successfully with all traffic exigencies reasonably to be anticipated: but whether he has fulfilled this duty must in every case be a question of fact, just as it is a question of fact whether, on any emergency disclosing itself, the following driver acted with the alertness, skill and judgment reasonably to expected in the circumstances ...
 
 
 
And a little earlier, on the same page, the Lord Justice-Clerk had this to say: 
 
... The conduct of the leading driver will, of course, have an important bearing upon liability for an accident in every case in which the conduct of both drivers is put in issue, either by a plea of contributory negligence or by double allegations of fault. But the duty of the following driver is a continuous duty which persists independently of an actual emergency or of the leading driver`s reaction to such emergency, and the question whether the following driver has failed in his duty cannot depend upon whether the leading driver had fulfilled his.
 
 
 
The authorities show that negligence ordinarily means breach of a legal duty to take care, but when contributory negligence is set up as a defence, its existence does not depend on any duty owed by the injured party to the party sued and all that is necessary to establish such a defence is to prove that the injured party did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed, by this want of care, to his own injury. In 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea) 
[1949] 2 KB 291
 Bucknill LJ said at page 308: 
 
... When one is considering the question of contributory negligence, it is not necessary to show that the negligence constituted a breach of duty to the defendant. It is sufficient to show lack of reasonable care by the plaintiff for his own safety. That is set out clearly in the speech of Lord Atkin in 
 Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd
 
[1940] AC 152
, 164 as follows:
 
 
 
`But the injury may be the result of two causes operating at the same time, a breach of duty by the defendant and the omission on the part of the plaintiff to use the ordinary care for the protection of himself or the property that is used by the ordinary reasonable man in those circumstances ...`
 
 
 
The concept of contributory negligence was examined and clarified by the Privy Council in 
 Nance v British Columbia Electric Railway Co 
[1951] 2 All ER 448 where the decision in 
 Davies` 
 case was considered and applied but certain observations of Denning LJ were criticised. Dealing with the concept of contributory negligence, Viscount Simon, who delivered the judgment of the Board, said, at p 450: 
 
... The statement that, when negligence is alleged as the basis of an actionable wrong, a necessary ingredient in the conception is the existence of a duty owed by the defendants to the plaintiff to take due care, is, of course, indubitably correct. But when contributory negligence is set up as a defence, its existence does not depend on any duty owed by the injured party to the party sued and all that is necessary to establish such a defence is to prove to the satisfaction of the jury that the injured party did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed, by this want of care, to his own injury. For when contributory negligence is set up as a shield against the obligation to satisfy the whole of the plaintiff`s claim, the principle involved is that, where a man is part author of his own injury, he cannot call on the other party to compensate him in full. This view of the matter has recently been expounded, after full analysis of the legal concepts involved and careful examination of the authorities, by the English Court of Appeal in 
 Davies v Swan Motor Co (Swansea)
 [1949] 1 All ER 620, to which the Chief Justice referred. This, however, is not to say that in all cases the plaintiff who is guilty of contributory negligence owes to the defendant no duty to act carefully. Indeed, it would appear to their Lordships that in cases relating to running-down accidents like the present such a duty exists. The proposition can be put even more broadly. Generally speaking, when two parties are so moving in relation to one another as to involve risk of collision, each owes to the other a duty to move with due care, and this is true whether they are both in control of vehicles, or both proceeding on foot, or whether one is on foot and the other controlling a moving vehicle. If it were not so, the individual on foot could never be sued by the owner of the vehicle for damage caused by his want of care in crossing the road, for he would owe to the plaintiff no duty t o take care. Yet such instances may easily occur, eg if the individual`s rashness causes the vehicle to pull up so suddenly as to damage its mechanism, or as to result in following traffic running from behind, or, indeed, in physical damage to the vehicle itself by contact with the individual. When a man steps from the kerb into the roadway, he owes a duty to traffic which is approaching him with risk of collision to exercise due care ...
 
 
 
The observation by Denning LJ in 
 Davies 
` case, that 
 
When a man steps into the road, he owes a duty to himself to take care for his own safety, but he does not owe to a motorist who is going at an excessive speed any duty to avoid being run down. was expressly rejected by the Board. Viscount Simon stated that `their Lordships cannot agree with it`.
 
 
 
We do not consider it necessary to examine any of the other authorities cited to us by counsel for the appellant. On the facts of this case, as found by the learned Chief Justice, we have to ask ourselves this plain common sense question: `Did the respondent contribute to his injury by following a motor van on his scooter at a distance of 30 feet behind the motor van when both vehicles were travelling at the same speed of about 30 mph on an open country road with very little traffic on it?` It is common ground that the road at the scene of the accident slopes downwards. It is also conceded that it is dangerous for a scooterist to jam his brakes and come to a dead stop because he may overturn. And according to 
 Bingham`s 
 
 Motor Claims Cases 
, 6th Ed, p 86, two wheel vehicles require double the distance required by a four wheel vehicle to pull up. For a four wheel vehicle, travelling at 30 mph the distance in which it can pull up is 75 feet which figure is made up of a `thinking distance` of 30 feet and a `braking distance` of 45 feet. It follows that for a scooter travelling at 30 mph the distance required to pull up will be 30 + 90, ie 120 feet. The respondent knew or should have known that by following the motor van 30 feet behind it at 30 mph he could not in an emergency stop suddenly without endangering his own life. The respondent should therefore have allowed more room between the vehicle ahead of him and his scooter.
It is contended on behalf of the respondent that a distance of 30 feet between the two vehicles was sufficient and safe in the circumstances of this case. If 30 feet was a safe distance to remain behind the vehicle ahead of the respondent, then what is the explanation for the collision? The sudden stopping of the appellant`s motor van created an emergency for the respondent. He applied his brakes, took evasive action by swerving to the right and yet collided with the motor van and his scooter finished up 58 feet ahead of the van. Three possible inferences can be drawn from these facts on the assumption that 30 feet was a safe distance. First, that the respondent was driving without due care and attention and hence was late in taking preventive measures to avoid the collision. Secondly, that he was travelling at a speed in excess of 30 mph. And thirdly, that he was travelling less than 30 feet behind the van. In our opinion. The real reason for the respondent being unable to avoid colliding with the van when it suddenly pulled up, was that he was travelling too close behind the van. The distance of 30 feet which separated the two vehicles was not a safe distance in the circumstances of this case. A reasonable prudent man riding a motor scooter at 30 mph would have kept much further away from the van because it is impossible for a scooter travelling at that speed to pull up in 30 feet. Quite apart from the fact that the respondent did not in his own interest take reasonable care of himself and contributed by this want of care to his own injury, the respondent in the circumstances of this case owed a duty to the appellant to move with due care and on his own evidence he was clearly in breach of that duty.
In our judgment, there was contributory negligence on the part of the respondent and he must bear his proper share of responsibility for the injury sustained by him. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, we assess the respondent`s responsibility at 40% and that of the appellant at 60%. Accordingly the respondent is entitled to recover from the appellant only 60% of $76,624 ie $45,974. The respondent will pay the appellant the costs of this appeal. The deposit of $500 is to be paid out to the solicitors for the appellant.

2913983,R v Rotner [2016] NSWDC 298,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: There is to be no publication of anything which would identify or tend to identify the name of the complainant in this matter
	
	
	When sentencing for an offence sexual intercourse without consent it is important to bear in mind the words of former Gleeson CJ in Hartikainen. (Unreported NSWCCA 8 June1993). His Honour said that non-consensual sexual intercourse is an “extreme form of violence”. The accuracy of his Honour’s observations are well borne out by the circumstances of the offences for which I must sentence the offender today.
	
	
	Mr Rotner stood trial on three charges. One was of having sexual intercourse with Ms R knowing that she was not consenting to that sexual intercourse. He was found guilty by a jury of that offence.
	
	
	Mr Rotner also faced a charge of supplying Ms R with a prohibited drug. He was also found guilty of that offence. There was a third charge on which Mr Rotner was found not guilty, a charge of stealing from a dwelling.
	
	
	The maximum penalties for the offences which Mr Rotner must be sentenced are significant, 14 years in the case of the sexual intercourse without consent matter and 15 years in the case of the drug supply matter. In addition, there is a standard non-parole period of seven years for the first offence. I have taken both the maximum penalties and the standard non-parole period into account in determining the sentences to impose upon this offender.
	
	
	The main witness for the Crown at trial was of course Ms R. She gave evidence that she had a number of medical concerns which caused her pain. She was on a variety of prescription medication. One day her neighbour suggested that taking the drug, ice, might help alleviate some of her symptoms. It was this neighbour who introduced her to Mr Rotner who then began to supply her with drugs on occasions, small quantities of drugs, for about $100 at a time. By their verdict the jury clearly accepted Mr Rotner’s drug supply activities.
	
	
	Ms R gave evidence that on 5 February 2015, after having consumed a great deal of ice supplied to her by the offender, he turned up at her premises, walked into the bedroom, and called her in telling her to get down on her knees. Her evidence was that in that position he forced his penis into her mouth and she was forced to perform oral intercourse upon him until he ejaculated. The ejaculate went into her mouth and on her face.
	
	
	Despite a threat made to her by the offender in an effort to prevent her revealing to the authorities what he had done Ms R did tell her friends and then the police what had happened to her. The offender was arrested and he has remained in custody to this day.
	
	
	I did mention that Mr Rotner was also charged with stealing from Ms R’s dwelling. Her evidence was that at the time Mr Rotner took the property out of her premises she was “very, very high”, so much so that “I didn’t even realise he was robbing me and I could not even say anything because I was very, very high”. Given her acknowledged inability to actually comprehend what was going on at the time the offender took property from her, the verdict of acquittal on that count is not surprising.
	
	
	Ms R was, as the Crown submitted, an unsophisticated witness who gave her evidence with the assistance of a Hungarian interpreter. She responded to the suggestion that the sexual intercourse which occurred was consensual and indeed it was her idea in the first place by telling the cross‑examiner that she was old enough to be the offender’s grandmother. Whether or not this is biologically possible there is certainly a significant age gap between the offender and the complainant. I have no doubt at all that I should accept what Ms R said beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	These offences were undoubtedly serious, but one is much more serious than the other. The offender took advantage of Ms R’s vulnerability, vulnerability for which he was largely responsible having supplied her with drugs, to perform the act of sexual intercourse upon her.
	
	
	I should at once note that it is important not to double-count. It would be wrong for me to regard the supply of drugs to Ms R as an aggravating circumstance of the sexual intercourse without consent matter at the same as I sentence Mr Rotner for the offence of supplying drugs to Ms R. I will be careful not to do that of course.
	
	
	Not surprisingly, the sexual intercourse offences had a profound impact upon Ms R. It is an awful thing to say what I am about to say but I must. The consequences that Ms R reports in a victim impact statement tendered by the Crown are commonplace.    Many, if not all, victims of sexual violence such as I have just described report similar distressing consequences to those about which Ms R speaks.    She says, for example, that for the first month “I was crying day and night. I washed my hair every day because I felt the spot where his hand held me down and I felt dirty”. She reports trouble sleeping. She reports nightmares. She reports problems with her relationship with her boyfriend.    And of course having to give evidence in these proceedings brought many aspects of the distress felt by Ms R to the fore once again. She began, for example, to have nightmares again.
	
	
	She summarises matters this way:
	


“I lived through the most horrible of horrors with the rape and the innumerable nightmares. I am still not alright mentally/emotionally and he dirtied my body with what he did. I can only hope the good Lord will help and the whole thing ends and I can return to my boyfriend with all my emotions. That is my wish”.


	
	Those consequences were entirely foreseeable. An important part in assessing the sentence to impose upon an offender is to assess the harm caused by his offence. As I have made clear, that harm was significant.
	
	
	Part of my task is to assess the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. I repeat, this was an offence of forced fellatio performed upon Ms R by a man who did not wear a condom, who had a clearly visible sore on his leg, and who continued until he had ejaculated both in Ms R’s mouth and upon her face.
	
	
	During the trial she expressed a fear of disease, a fear of disease I am satisfied was genuine arising in particular from the sore she observed on the offender’s thigh while she was being forced to perform oral sex upon him.
	
	
	There is no hierarchy of the various forms of sexual intercourse without consent covered by s 61(H) of the Crimes Act. What I have described is a particularly intimate form of sexual connection. I regard this offence as a most serious example of an offence of sexual intercourse without consent.
	
	
	I note a number of other features too. There was an aspect of assault beyond the act of sexual intercourse itself. The offender held Ms R so that he could do what he wanted with her. He threatened her with violence - indeed he threatened to shoot her - should she report the matter to the authorities. The offence occurred in her home and as I have already noted Ms R was vulnerable both through her intoxicated state and her medical problems which included a lack of mobility.
	
	
	Mr Averre says I should regard it as a mitigating feature that the offence was not planned. There is no evidence that it was planned and there is no evidence that it was not. I will not accept that as a mitigating feature in the absence of any evidence.
	
	
	The offender did not give evidence either at trial or during today’s sentencing proceedings. A psychological report was tendered without objection from the Crown.    The offender is an only child but he has a large extended family and numerous cousins with whom he had close relationships. There is nothing in his background which would suggest any reason for the offender to have committed these offences or other offences which occur on his criminal history.
	
	
	In particular, his mother was a hard worker and a good provider. Mr Rotner told the psychologist that he never went without, and that his mother was not one of those parents who did not impose any boundaries on her child. He told the psychologist that she was hard but fair with discipline. She continues to support him even today.
	
	
	The offender went to Year 10. He told the psychologist he enjoyed his time at school and had many friends although it was clear that he had learning difficulties. There was some bullying because of these difficulties but he was able to ignore it. It helped that his cousin attended the same school as him and so that cousin stuck up for him.
	
	
	After leaving school he has had various jobs such as being a kitchen hand, a removalist and completed a 12 month course in panel beating which included some work experience as a car mechanic.
	
	
	As well as a learning difficulty which places Mr Rotner in the bottom two per cent of the population as far as his IQ his concerned, he has also experienced anxiety and depression since he was a teenager. He has been prescribed medication at times but it is clear that depression has been part of Mr Rotner’s life for some time.
	
	
	Not surprisingly things have got worse since his incarceration. He also feels stressed in custody. Mr Rotner is Jewish and reports that Lebanese inmates in custody cause problems for him which have led to him being held on protection.
	
	
	It is no longer the case that I would assume that Mr Rotner will serve the entirety of his sentence on protection, nor is it the case that I must assume that that circumstance will necessarily involve harsher conditions of custody than would otherwise be the case. I will however take into account that there is a risk that Mr Rotner will serve his sentence on protection and there is a risk that that will involve harsher conditions of custody.
	
	
	There is no suggestion that Mr Rotner’s intellectual disability or his depression or his anxiety had any connection with the offence of sexual intercourse without consent.
	
	
	The offender has a criminal history which includes offences of violence. Indeed he was on parole at the time of this offence. This is another area where I must not double count. The offender’s parrole was revoked after having been charged with these offences. It would be wrong for me to regard the fact that he was on parole as an aggravating circumstance and not pick an appropriate commencement date for the sentences I will shortly announce.
	
	
	As I mentioned earlier, clearly the offence of supplying drugs to Ms R is less serious than the other offence for which Mr Rotner must be sentenced. He supplied her with relatively small quantities of drugs over a relatively short period of time. This was low-level dealing. Nevertheless as the maximum penalty indicates supply of drugs is a serious offence there must be some additional punishment for that offence to reflect that fact.
	
	
	The offender did not plead guilty. Of course he is not to be punished for that. He is not to be punished for the fact that Ms R’s need to give evidence in this matter caused her nightmares to return. I mention the absence of a plea of guilty for two reasons; firstly, so that when anyone looks at the sentences I will impose and compares them with other sentences imposed for similar offences that person will have to bear in mind that some of those offences will be for people who have pleaded guilty and have thus received a discount on sentence.
	
	
	The other relevance of the absence of a plea guilty is that Mr Rotner continues to deny committing the offences in the first place. Why he committed them, the motive for him doing so, remains something of a mystery. All that I can really assume is that he did so for mere sexual gratification. He was apparently prepared to violently assault Ms R for that purpose alone.
	
	
	I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. His criminal history suggests that there will need to be some close supervision of him upon his release from custody in order to minimise the risk that he will commit further offences.
	
	
	Sometimes the purpose of a period of parole is misunderstood. Often parole is granted to an offender not as a favour to him or her but as a way of minimising the risk that the offender will commit offences in the future. So my finding of special circumstances is not done as a favour to Mr Rotner, it is done for purpose and one purpose alone; to protect the community as much as I can.
	
	
	Mr Rotner will spend a significant period of time in custody and upon release from custody supervision by the Probation and Parole Service will be of benefit to the community. That it will also be of benefit of Mr Rotner is very much a secondary consideration.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Were it not for the imposition of an aggregate sentence I would have imposed the following sentences:
	
	
	The offence of sexual intercourse without consent, sentence of nine years with a non-parole period of six years. The offence of supplying a prohibited drug, a sentence of 18 months.
	
	
	Instead I impose the following sentence:
	
	
	There is a non-parole period of six and a half years to date from 10 December 2015 and a head sentence of nine and a half year. The non‑parole period will expire on 9 June 2022 which is the first day on which Mr Rotner will be eligible to be released to parole.

2913984,R v Khatib [2016] NSWDC 299,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Milad Khatib was detected by police supplying drugs to another male, and after he was arrested for that matter, things got worse for him. He was found to be in possession of 36 white tablets which presumably were MDMA. His mobile phone was searched which revealed text messages relating to the supply of drugs to people known as Dolin Jay Arq, and Younes Milo.
	
	
	It is clear that the offender was an enthusiastic supplier of drugs. He says for various reasons he was subsidising his own drug use. He had debts and he needed to pay his rent amongst other things. Mr Khatib was prepared to supply drugs to anyone who wanted them really so that he could make money. Since his arrest, he says, in a letter to me tendered today that he has completely changed. The rehabilitation of the offender is something upon which Mr Hallani who appears for him today relies in an effort to suggest that his client should not be sentenced to custody full-time.
	
	
	It is clear that the focus of this sentencing exercise is on the question as to whether exceptional circumstances have been shown such as to justify a sentence of other than full-time custody. The offender was clearly trafficking to a substantial degree.
	
	
	There are two difficulties with Mr Hallani’s submission as to the extent of the offender’s rehabilitation. The first is that Mr Hallani relies on the fact that the offender now has a job. Unfortunately that is a job which is at risk once he is convicted of drug supply. He works at Sydney Airport and his air side clearance is likely to be affected by a conviction for drug supply. Thus the chances of him continuing in his present employment are uncertain, if not it being the case that he will likely lose his job. What will happen then as far as Mr Khatib’s rehabilitation is concerned. Will he go back to using drugs? Who knows? I certainly do not.
	
	
	The second aspect of rehabilitation which Mr Hallani relies on concerns the fact that the offender claims he has not used drugs since his arrest. Mr Hallani says that as part of his job he has been drug tested on three occasions but evidence of those tests has not been put before me, nor is there any other evidence about urinalysis or the like which would satisfy me that I should accept the statement not made on oath by the offender that he is not using drugs.
	
	
	Accordingly I proposed to Mr Hallani, and the Crown did not oppose this, that the matter should be adjourned under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to enable Mr Khatib to demonstrate that his rehabilitation is such that, together with a number of other factors, exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence of other than full-time custody have been demonstrated. During the period of the adjournment I expect the following to happen. Mr Khatib will forthwith disclose his conviction for drug supply to his employer and to those who are responsible for issuing his ASIC card.
	
	
	Secondly the offender is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service during the period of the remand. Thirdly the offender is to, at his own expense, or under the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service regular urinalysis in order to demonstrate the truth or otherwise of Mr Khatib’s claim that he no longer uses drugs. Those three matters are conditions of the s 11 remand. It may be that strictly speaking the first of those conditions is not a condition of bail, and so it may well be that it is not a proper condition for remand under s 11. However, even if that is the case, I am sure that Mr Hallani will understand and explain to his client that it is in his interests to demonstrate to me that his rehabilitation will continue even after losing his present employment, if that is the result of the disclosure I suggest should be made. I will have it specifically recorded that I have convicted the offender.
	
	
	Now let us look towards the end of the year to give your client a decent chance to demonstrate something to me Mr Hallani.

2913985,R v Martin [2016] NSWDC 300,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender, Daniel Martin, has a reasonably lengthy criminal history which began when he was about 12 years of age. He was brought up with poor role models. Violence was a feature of his childhood and early behavioural issues were likely the result. After a violent interaction between him and his stepfather he left home at the age of 16 and has largely led a disordered and unstable lifestyle since then. He went to gaol for offences involving drugs in 2012 and was released from custody in August 2013. He committed the offence which I must now sentence him in September 2014.    While living in the community, following his release from custody, he fell back into a fairly well established pattern of living day to day, staying in cheap hotel rooms and on friends’ couches. His Centrelink benefits would not cover his expenses and so he and a co-offender, yet to be sentenced, committed the offence I am about to describe.
	
	
	A co-offender sold a mobile phone to a man by the name of Uzman Umer. That transaction was above board. Mr Umer paid for the phone and got it. A little while later however Mr Umer received a call from the co-offender offering to sell him two further mobile phones. A sale price of $600 each was agreed and a location where the transaction would take place was also agreed. It is clearly apparent that there was no intention to supply these phones, what the co-offender and Mr Martin, had planned was that the victim would turn up at the location with at least $1,200 in cash and they were going to rob him of it. And that is what happened.
	
	
	Mr Umer was with a friend of his when they reached the location, there was some interaction between the four of them, but without prior warning Mr Umer’s car door was opened, he was pulled out of the vehicle and the offender and his co-offender immediately started punching him with closed fists to his face. One of them, and it does not matter who, shouted, “Where is the money?” This assault lasted about ten to 15 seconds with about six or seven punches connecting with Mr Umer’s face. Presumably the violence would have continued were it not for a fortuitous circumstance. A motor vehicle turned into the street where all this was happening, one of the offenders yelled out “run” and they headed off towards North Strathfield Railway Station. They did not actually get the money, what they did steal however was a mobile phone and the keys to the motor vehicle.
	
	
	The offender was identified as having been involved through fingerprints. It was not until some time later, 25 February 2015, that he was arrested. He pleaded guilty at an early stage to this offence for robbery in company so the sentence I impose on him will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Notwithstanding Mr Johnson’s attempts to minimise the significance and severity of this offence I regard it as a serious breach of the criminal law. The victim was set upon without warning, he was not given any chance to comply with any demands made by the offenders, who were in company with each other, the offence was clearly pre-meditated and planned and although only a small amount of property was taken, a mobile phone and some car keys, it is to be noted that the offenders were intent on getting more and probably taking whatever they could.
	
	
	Of course this is an offence of robbery in company and in assessing the objective gravity of that offence I have got to be careful because there was no demand of money by the offenders. The element which converts a stealing to a robbery is the force used and so in this particular case the violence inflicted upon the victim was an element of the offence. I must be careful not to double count in regarding violence therefore as an aggravating circumstance of this crime.
	
	
	I mentioned before that the offender has a lengthy criminal history. These were largely street type offences with short custodial sentences being imposed. There was quite a serious matter committed by the offender when he was a child which led to him serving a significant period of imprisonment. There were no offences of robbery and as Mr Johnson conceded the sentence that I must impose on Mr Martin for this offence is probably the longest sentence that he will serve. Somewhat surprisingly the offender, although an occasional drug user, was not committing this offence to fund his drug use instead, as I mentioned earlier, he was intending to pay living expenses which had arisen out of his somewhat chaotic and unstable lifestyle.
	
	
	There are a couple of features of the criminal history which are worthy of note. One is when it started and the second is that the frequency of offending has somewhat dropped off as of recent times. That is perhaps consistent with the offender growing older. It is notorious that many people of around Mr Martin’s age reach their early thirties and begin to realise the futility of the lifestyle they have led. When assessing Mr Martin’s prospects of rehabilitation I certainly cannot say they are good but I do note that he seems to be offending less and less frequently as he grows older.
	
	
	I mentioned before the offender’s poor upbringing. He has three siblings on his mother’s side and 11 siblings on his father’s side. As a child he had negligible contact with his father, his mother and stepfather would smoke cannabis in his presence and they responded to his misbehaviour by violence, with his punishments escalating as the years went by. Being grounded developed into smacking, whipping and then ultimately punching. The interaction which led to him leaving home occurred when his stepfather was attempting to discipline him and, as was recorded in the psychological report, Mr Martin reacted by “putting him through the wall”.
	
	
	Although he has developed a relationship with his father he, that is Mr Martin’s father, is currently serving a significant custodial sentence. Mr Martin has had a troubled experience of education, being expelled due to misbehaviour on occasions, his schooling in the community interrupted by the sentence for the serious matter committed when he was a child and his employment history is as might be expected from someone living the lifestyle to which I have referred.
	
	
	In between offending by participating in this robbery in company and being arrested the offender moved to Queensland where he engaged with the Boystown Indigenous Vocational Training and Education Centre program. He was obtaining vocational skills and he was doing well. That is a matter which does tend to suggest better prospects of rehabilitation than would otherwise be the case. But no one could disagree with the suggestion that if Mr Martin is to remain offence-free in the future he will need considerable assistance given the life he has led thus far.
	
	
	Of course the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R guideline is, with some modifications, applicable here. Although the decision in Henry was at first confined to the offence of armed robbery, the Court of Criminal Appeal came to regard it as appropriate with modification to the offence of robbery in company. In this regard I should note that Mr Martin’s plea of guilty was early rather than a late plea of guilty postulated in Henry, but that he was certainly not a young offender with a limited criminal history. I have taken the guideline into account in assessing the appropriate sentences as I am required to do.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 25 February 2015, it will expire on 24 August 2017, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of five years.

2913986,R v Ball [2016] NSWDC 301,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: There was a delay in bringing Ms Renee Ann Ball up from the cells so that her sentence proceedings could commence today. With the consent of both parties, I was given some documents to read in the meantime. One of those documents was a criminal history which, as is common these days, contained a photograph of the offender on her arrest. When Ms Ball was eventually brought up from the cells I, at first, thought that I had been reading the wrong papers, such was the contrast between Ms Ball’s appearance when arrested and her appearance today. She is, in many respects, a much different person today than she was when she committed the offences for which I must sentence her.
	
	
	At the time of those offences she was using drugs, mainly ice, but other drugs on occasion as well. In order to fund her addiction, she committed a number of serious offences. In many ways, these offences were pathetic, both in terms of the way they were carried out and the monetary reward that they brought Ms Ball, but they were, nevertheless, harmful and dangerous and objectively very serious indeed. It is for that reason that Ms Ball must spend a substantial period in custody, even given the rehabilitation that she has achieved since her arrest.
	
	
	I am to sentence Ms Ball today for two offences of armed robbery and one offence under s 95 of the Crimes Act of robbery with detention. When I sentence her for that last offence, I am to take into account two offences on a Form 1, an offence of robbery and an offence of stealing from a dwelling.
	
	
	What I will do now is describe the offences in the order in which they were committed.
	
	
	The first offence is on the Form 1 as an offence of robbery. In the early evening of 9 February the offender approached two female American tourists in Hunter Street. She said, “I need your money. I have a knife and my friend across the street has a gun. Give me your money, I’m very sick, I have a baby. I’m very sick and I need the money.” There is no suggestion that there was any truth to the threat involving the supposed friend across the street with a gun and it was apparent that Ms Ball never had a knife.
	
	
	When she made the threat that she did have a knife she had her hand behind her back and so no doubt the victims of this offence believed her. However, as she became more animated, she motioned with her hand and it was apparent that she did not have a knife in it.
	
	
	Ms Ball was told that the women did not have any money, so she said, “Go to the nearest ATM and take out all you have.” At this stage one of the women gave the offender $150 and Ms Ball left, saying, “God help me if I ever see you on the street again, I’ll give it back to you.”
	
	
	We then come, on 14 February, to what is agreed to have been the most serious offence committed by Ms Ball. A Swedish au pair was walking along Beaumont Street in Hamilton South. Ms Ball approached her and started to talk to her. She then grabbed her and held her from behind. She pushed something into the woman’s back and said, “I’m pushing a knife to your back right now. Give me your wallet.” One can only imagine the fear and indeed terror which was likely to have been engendered by the violence and threat.
	
	
	The victim removed her wallet, gave it to the offender who took $50 out. That was not enough for Ms Ball. She said, “Do you have any more money?” The victim said, “My cards are empty.” Ms Ball did not give up. She said, “Is there anyone in this area who could bring you money right now?” The victim said, “No” and still Ms Ball persisted, saying, “You must come up with a way.” So the victim phoned a friend but that friend did not have any money. Ms Ball said, “Is there anyone else you can call?” The victim made reference to the family for whom she worked, who lived around the corner. Ms Ball said, “Call the lady in the family. Tell her to come here with all the money that they have in the house.” The victim called the family and asked if they had $100 in the house. She was told “No”. Ms Ball said, “Just ask if there’s any money at all.”
	
	
	One can only imagine the state that the victim was in by now. She had been held for some considerable period, with what she was told was a knife pressed into her back. She started to beg the family for whom she worked to bring the money. They began, that is the two of them, walking towards that house. One of the occupants, a male, came out of the house. He was concerned by the telephone call he had got from the au pair. He saw Ms Ball holding the victim from behind and told her to let the au pair go. Ms Ball did so. She then started to walk away. The male followed her, caught up with her, demanded she return the victim’s wallet and so Ms Ball took him to where the wallet was hidden.
	
	
	We now come to a series of offences on 17 February 2015. At about 9.25am a Ms Versilla was walking to her place of work in Newcastle East. It was her job to open the business up. As she did so, the offender followed her in. They were both in the premises and, following some small talk from the offender, she said, “Give me your bag.” Ms Versilla said, “No.” Ms Ball repeated the demand and then lunged at Ms Versilla, grabbing the bag. They struggled for possession of it. It was at this stage that Ms Ball produced a box cutter and lunged at the victim with it. Not surprisingly, Ms Versilla let go of the bag and Ms Ball left with it.
	
	
	Ms Versilla called out for help. Her cries for help were heard by passersby who followed Ms Ball into a lane and photographed her. She was cornered and returned the handbag but managed to slip away before police arrived.
	
	
	About an hour later, at 10.30am, she walked to premises in Mayfield and knocked on the door of a Ms Gjuroski. There was no evidence as to how old Ms Gjuroski was but there is evidence that she was frail and relied on the use of a walking frame to move around the home. When she opened the door to Ms Ball the latter said, “I’m tired, I’ve been walking too much.” Ms Gjuroski acted like a good Samaritan, she allowed Ms Ball to enter and asked if she had seen a doctor. Ms Ball asked her to lend her some money so she could go to the doctor’s and asked how much money Ms Gjuroski had. She said she did not have any. Ms Ball persisted, asking for $20, then $10. Ms Gjuroski replied on each occasion she did not have any money at all.
	
	
	Ms Ball began talking about her baby, that she was pregnant at the time and said that she was hungry. Ms Gjuroski, being the good Samaritan that she was, said that she would get a banana and walked into the kitchen. Ms Ball took advantage of Ms Gjuroski’s generosity, took advantage of her good nature, by grabbing her handbag and leaving, taking with her Ms Gjuroski’s purse containing $20, various bankcards and personal cards, as well as a key to her house.
	
	
	This was a nasty offence. When I discussed this offence with Ms Ball while she was giving evidence, quite appropriately, Ms Ball expressed her remorse for how she had treated Ms Gjuroski.
	
	
	Then, on the same day, at 2.45pm, Ms Ball went to a florist’s shop. A Ms Hickson was working there. Ms Ball entered while Ms Hickson was dealing with a customer. After that customer left Ms Ball said to Ms Hickson that she was pregnant, complained of the heat and there was some discussion about purchasing flowers. So, Ms Hickson started to make the flower arrangement.
	
	
	At this stage it appeared to Ms Hickson that Ms Ball was not terribly well. She started to puff and breathe heavily and so Ms Hickson offered to get her a seat and a glass of water. While she was out getting the water she heard Ms Ball at the till, so she came back into the shop. Ms Ball turned to Ms Hickson and said, “Open the till.” Ms Hickson said, “No” and so Ms Ball produced the box cutter and again said, “Open the till” whilst pointing the box cutter at Ms Hickson’s chest. Of course, Ms Hickson was extremely scared. She again said, “No” and started backing away from Ms Ball and ran out screaming for help.
	
	
	Ms Hickson locked Ms Ball in the shop. Ms Ball finding herself trapped, began to violently shake the front door and Ms Hickson decided to let Ms Ball out rather than take the chance there would be further damage done to the shop. So, she left the store having taken $10. Other people attracted by the commotion followed her and, again, she was photographed.
	
	
	That same day she was arrested and has been in custody ever since. She made admissions in relation to the offences and, consistent with those early admissions, pleaded guilty in the Local Court. The utilitarian value of her pleas should be recognised by me imposing a sentence upon her which is 25 per cent less than what it would otherwise have been.
	
	
	Ms Ball has a sad history. She told a psychologist that as she was growing up she was abused, physically and verbally, by her brother, Martin. Her mother did nothing to protect her from her brother’s behaviour, telling her at one stage, “My job is done now you are older.” She left fulltime education very young, at 13 and has had relationships which were detrimental to her. Drug use has been a feature of her adult life. She supported her drug habit through offending at times and prostitution at other times.
	
	
	Her relationship with a Mr Cassel ended when he left her. She began a relationship with a Mr O'Brien. It was then that she began to use the drug ice, having been on a methadone program for some time. She gave up methadone, began using heroin and committed crimes to fund her drug addiction.
	
	
	She had a number of children with Mr Cassel. When they separated the Family Court gave him custody. Ms Ball had the right to contact her children but she did not engage with that process and so her contact with her children ceased shortly after. She began using heroin again, became homeless and it was in these circumstances that she committed the offences which I have described.
	
	
	She told the author of a psychological report “I’d lost my kids, I was pregnant with no methadone and desperate.” She expressed her remorse too, saying, “I wish I could take it back. I wish they”, referring to the victims, “could feel and understand how sorry I am that I’d just take it back.”
	
	
	Whilst in custody she has been doing well. She tries to keep herself as busy as she can. She is on the methadone program and, as I began these remarks on sentence, is a much healthier looking woman from the one who was photographed on her arrest.
	
	
	She has a criminal history but two matters are of note. Firstly, there are no offences as serious as these on it and, secondly, there are significant gaps in that criminal history, which clearly indicate that she is capable of, at times, living a law abiding life. Her lengthy gap in offending coincided with her being stable on the methadone program. There are, thus, I am prepared to find, good prospects for her rehabilitation.
	
	
	Of course, Ms Ball was in a very poor state when she committed these offences, but, despite that, it is to be noted that she was prepared to scare others and to steal from vulnerable people for her own purposes.
	
	
	The objective gravity of her offending is significant and so significant sentences are required, even taking into account the pathetic state Ms Ball was in when she committed these offences.
	
	
	Mr Burke, who appears for Ms Ball today, recognises that a further period of custody is required but asked me to make it as short as I could. I have done that.
	
	
	Of course, I have paid attention to the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R guideline judgment, as in many respects these offences are typical of the standard case referred to in that judgment. There are some differences, of course. The plea was early, not a plea of limited utility and Ms Ball is not a young offender.
	
	
	I should say one thing about a particular submission that Mr Burke made. He asked me, I understand, to find that the weapon Ms Ball used, a box cutter, was a less serious weapon than a knife. I reject that. Ms Ball had a weapon capable of inflicting significant injury on others. She, on occasion, demonstrated a willingness to use that weapon, emphasising the seriousness of the threats she was making, particularly by lunging, at least on one occasion, towards an unfortunate person, whilst armed with that box cutter. I regard a box cutter, in Henry terms, as a weapon like a knife, capable of causing serious injury.
	
	
	There are, of course, special circumstances in this case. They relate to Ms Ball’s ability to live a law abiding life. It is in the community’s interest, as well as Ms Ball’s, of course, that she be assisted to return to a law abiding lifestyle. If that happens, then there will be no other victims who have to experience the type of offence for which I must now sentence Ms Ball.
	
	
	I am going to impose an aggregate sentence. Were it not for that circumstance, I would have imposed on each armed robbery matter imprisonment for three and a half years and, on the robbery with detention matter, imprisonment for four years. Instead, I will impose the following sentence:
	
	
	Ms Ball is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 17 February 2015. I set a head sentence of five years. Ms Ball’s non-parole period will expire on 16 August 2017, on which date she is eligible to be released to parole. I recommend that consideration is given to a condition of Ms Ball’s release being that she enter into a residential rehabilitation program, as she said in evidence she would be willing to do.

The four appellants in this case were convicted of murder in a trial held by jury.
The short facts are these. On the night of 17 August 1965 the deceased Rafie bin Osman was walking along the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent when he was assaulted by some persons and he fell to the ground. Shortly after, he was found dead at the spot where he fell. There were two stab wounds inflicted on the deceased one of which was fatal - the stab wound in the chest which penetrated the heart and in which a knife was found embedded in it. Ex P 11 was the knife. The other stab wound was in the region of the right side of the body level with the right elbow. There were also abrasions and superficial wounds on the body.
The principal evidence against the appellants was the evidence given by five witnesses - Abdullah bin Rawjan, Sinnathamby, Selamat bin Ahmad, Tohar bin Kanali and Hassan bin Haji Ali - whose evidence the learned trial judge described as `tainted evidence`, and by two other witnesses - Mahat bin Moing and Hassan bin Abdul Latiff.
The evidence of Abdullah bin Rawjan was shortly this. He lived at No 178-A Breeze Plain. On the morning of 17 August 1965 he met the fourth appellant. The fourth appellant told him that he wanted to borrow a knife and Abdullah lent him one. Exhibit P12 was the knife. At about 6.30pm that same day the fourth appellant invited him to go to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent. He in turn invited Sinnathamby. He met the fourth appellant, Sinnathamby, Selamat bin Ahmad, Tohar bin Kanali and two other youths in his kampong and together they went by bus to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent. On arrival there they had food at a stall and after that the fourth appellant brought them to see the first appellant. They were introduced to the first appellant who then and there told them that there would be a fight that night and asked them to scatter. He moved away from the place and as he did so he saw the first appellant stop three Malay youths, two of whom were allowed to proceed on their way but one was detained. This Malay youth who was detained was then assaulted but he was unable to say by whom. He saw this Malay youth fall down and then the people scattered. He identified the place where the dead body of Rafie bin Osman was found as the place where this Malay youth fell after being assaulted. He then went straight to the main road and boarded a bus and went home. Two days later he found the knife exh P12 in his house. He did not know who had returned it. Subsequently the police took possession of the knife exh P12.
Sinnathamby`s evidence was shortly this. He lived at 27 Breeze Plain. On 17 August 1965 Abdullah invited him to go to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent. Seven of them went - he, Abdullah, the fourth appellant, Selamat, Tohar and two others. On arrival they had food. While they were having food the fourth appellant produced a knife, similar to exh P12, from his back trouser pocket and had a look at it and put it back in his back trouser pocket. After their food they walked about in the `pasar malam` where the fourth appellant introduced them all to the first appellant who immediately said `There is some matter tonight` by which he understood that there was going to be a fight. The first appellant then asked them to walk in pairs and they did so. He then saw three persons approaching. The first appellant stopped them, two of the persons walked on, one remained. The one remaining and the first appellant then spoke together for a while. Then the first appellant punched this person in the face and he fell down. He then saw the second appellant hit this person who was on the ground with a Qantas bag. He saw no one else attack this person. He saw the fourth appellant who was in front of him, but the fourth appellant did not do anything. Then he and the fourth appellant ran away and with two or three others they went to the sixth milestone Bukit Timah Road where the fourth appellant went into his friend`s house and left the knife on the table in the house and then went to wash his hands. The fourth appellant`s friend was a Malay who was earlier in the group. They waited for the friend who gave the fourth appellant some money for them to go home in a taxi.
The evidence of Selamat bin Ahmad was shortly this. He lived at no 96 Breeze Plain. On 17 August 1965 the fourth appellant invited him to go to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent and seven of them went - he, Abdullah, fourth appellant, Tohar and three others. They had a meal on arrival and after that they walked along the `pasar malam`. They met the first appellant and the fourth appellant introduced him to the first appellant who said `There will be a fight or quarrel tonight` and asked them to disperse, to walk singly. He did not agree to join in the fight and started to walk away. As he did so he saw the first appellant stopping three persons. The first appellant allowed two of these three persons to proceed on but detained the other. He then saw the first appellant punch the person who was detained and five or six other persons rushed at this person who was punched and there was confusion. He was frightened and ran away. He boarded a bus and went to the sixth milestone Bukit Timah Road to the house of the first appellant where he met the fourth appellant, Abdullah and Tohar and together they went back to their respective houses.
The evidence of Tohar bin Kanali was shortly this. He lived at 27-A Breeze Plain. On 17 August 1965 the fourth appellant invited him to go to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent. Seven of them went - he, Abdullah, Sinnathamby, Selamat, fourth appellant and two others. When they arrived they had food at a stall and then they walked along the `pasar malam` where the fourth appellant met the first appellant. The fourth appellant introduced him to the first appellant who said there was to be some matter and asked him to disperse and walk away. He walked away and he saw people scattering and running about. He then saw the fourth appellant and Sinnathamby walking fast in a lorong towards the main road. He followed them and went with them to the sixth milestone Bukit Timah Road and went into a kampong and he waited there for the arrival of the first appellant. About half an hour later the fourth appellant came and told him that the first appellant had given some money for them to go home. He, Sinnathamby, fourth appellant and Selamat then went home. Two days later, on 19 August at 2.30pm he went to the Bukit Timah fire station at the request of the fourth appellant to meet one Mohamed Salleh. The fourth appellant had asked him to get a knife from Mohamed Salleh. He met Mohamed Salleh. He said that although Mohamed Salleh looked like the third appellant he could not definitely identify him as the third appellant. Mohamed Salleh handed him the knife ex P 12 which he took back and handed it to Abdul Rahman bin Rawjan the brother of Abdullah bin Rawjan.
The evidence of Hassan bin Haji Ali was shortly this. He lived at the Bukit Timah fire station. He knew the third appellant. On 17 August 1965 at about 5pm he met the third appellant at the main gate of the fire station. The third appellant asked him to go along with the third appellant to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent and he did. On arrival he and the third appellant met the first and second appellants and another Malay. He then saw the first appellant stop three Malay youths. The first appellant allowed two of these Malay youths to proceed and the first appellant assaulted the Malay youth that remained. The second appellant was then with the first appellant. After the first appellant had assaulted this Malay youth the second appellant hit this youth with a Qantas bag. After that he saw the third appellant rush up to this youth but his view was then obstructed and he could not see what happened. Then he heard the third appellant`s voice asking them to run. He then went towards the main road where he saw the first and second appellants and after that he went home. The following day at 9pm he met the third appellant in the compound of the Bukit Timah fire station. The third appellant told him: `Don`t tell anybody about yesterday`s incident. If you tell I will get into trouble.`
The evidence of Mahat bin Moing was shortly this. At about 2.45pm on 17 August 1965 he went with a Chinese friend to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent on his friend`s scooter. When he was at the `Pasar malam` he saw three Malays walking along and they were stopped by a group of five persons. Two of the three were allowed to proceed leaving one behind and this person was assaulted by the group of five. He identified two of this group of five, they were the first and second appellants. The first appellant assaulted the person who remained with his hands while the second appellant hit that person with a Qantas bag. The other members of the group of five were all there but he could not see what they did as he only saw their backs. The assault lasted about three minutes and the person who was assaulted fell down and he saw a considerable quantity of blood on this person`s stomach. He identified the place where the body of Rafie was found as the place where he saw this person who remained behind finally come to rest after the assault.
The evidence of Hussin bin Abdul Latiff was shortly this. He lived next door to the deceased in Kampong Chantek Lama and was his good friend. On the night of 17 August 1965 he went to the `pasar malam` at Trevose Crescent with his wife and while on his way home he met the deceased and they exchanged greetings. Later that night he returned to the `pasar malam` to change one of his purchases, which he did and then went to an Indian shop to buy some cigarettes. He then stood outside the shop smoking a cigarette and watching the people walking about in the `pasar malam`. He saw three youths walking along and behind them another two. The first, second and third appellants were the three youths who were walking in front. He also saw the deceased there with two companions. The first, second and third appellants were the three youths who were walking in front. He also saw the deceased there with two companions. The first, second and third appellants went across to where the deceased was. The first appellant assumed a fighting attitude and he saw the first appellant aim a blow at the deceased. By that time the deceased`s two companions had walked on. The second appellant was holding a Qantas bag which he swung at the deceased. The bag landed just about the back of the neck of the deceased who bent double. Then the third appellant rushed up to the deceased and he saw the third appellant`s hand flash out in the direction of the deceased`s chest, whereupon the deceased fell by the driveway. He walked quickly away and telephoned the police and told them there was a fight. He then went home.
Counsel for the appellants has raised a number of substantial points but it is necessary to deal with only one of them. It is submitted that the learned trial judge erred in law in that he failed to direct the jury that on the evidence before them they could find the five witnesses, whose evidence the learned judge said was `tainted evidence`, to be accomplices in the offence charged and consequently he failed to direct the jury on the danger of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices and on the rule of law that one accomplice cannot corroborate a fellow accomplice.
The evidence was that these five witnesses were arrested by the police along with the four appellants under s 55 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance 1955. The four appellants were charged with the murder of Rafie but these five witnesses were detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Ordinance 1955, and at the time of the trial they were detained at the Reformative Training Centre. The learned trial judge was accordingly mistaken in treating these five witnesses as convicted persons who were serving sentences of reformative training.
In dealing with the evidence of these five witnesses, the learned judge observed as follows: 
 
Now, it is, in a sense, tainted evidence, because it comes from a source which is tainted. All these five witnesses are convicted persons, and therefore do not bear a spotless character; they are not of good character. But this does not for one moment mean that you can or must disregard their evidence as being unworthy of credit. All it does mean is that you must scrutinize it with the utmost care and caution before you accept it. If, of course, you are convinced they are telling the truth, you may accept it and are entitled to act upon it. You will test that evidence with other non-tainted evidence, with other independent evidence in the case, to see whether it confirms or supports their evidence. If it does on various matters, so will you be the more inclined and entitled to accept it.
 
 
 
The learned judge dealt at length with the question of the common intention of the appellants. In his summing-up he said: 
 
Let me now, gentlemen of the jury, try to summarise briefly to you the evidence which the prosecution say establishes beyond a reasonable doubt the common intention of the four accused. It is too much to expect the four accused to tell us what their common intention was, nor are they by law required to do so, or to say anything. We must try to gauge their common intention by conduct and by surrounding circumstances, by inferences from proved facts.
 
 
 
Let us try to list these various points one by one.
 
 
 
The learned judge then went on to set out the points one by one and he summed up the whole situation in these words: 
 
And so, gentlemen of the jury, I do not say those are all, but those are some of the major factors which the prosecution say must inevitably and inexorably lead you to the one conclusion only, namely, that these four accused had one common intention on that night; they knew there was going to be a fight, two of them armed themselves in preparation for it, a fight did take place with the result that the victim was killed.
 
 
 
Why was it? What was the reason for this gathering at the pasar malam: the fourth accused and his group of Breeze Plain youths; the first, the second and the third accused from the Bukit Timah fire station? Was it to buy clothes which not one of them appears to have bought, or was it to engage in a fight which the four accused were engaged in. Prosecution`s submission to you is that all of these people foregathered there for that purpose, the purpose of a fight. Two of them were armed with knives to be used if the necessity arose; that they were all aware of this, prepared and intending that they should be used to inflict injury on their victim if the occasion should arise. If injury was inflicted it is surely obvious, if inflicted with knives, that any injury done with a knife on the chest is such an injury which is likely in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
It seems to us that in effect the learned judge said that these five witnesses were accomplices.
The learned judge, however, did not direct the jury to consider whether or not these five witnesses were accomplices and that if they considered them to be accomplices, although it was open to them to convict the appellants upon the uncorroborated evidence of these accomplices, it was dangerous to do so unless their evidence was corroborated in material particulars and that one accomplice cannot corroborate a fellow accomplice.
After a careful scrutiny of the record we are of the view that there was sufficient evidence before the jury on which they could, had the issue been left to them, reasonably come to the conclusion that these five witnesses were participes criminis. It follows, in our opinion, that the learned trial judge should have left this question, accomplice 
 vel non 
, to the jury and should have warned them that, if they considered on the evidence that these witnesses were accomplices, it was dangerous for them to act on their evidence unless corroborated in material particulars.
It, therefore, cannot be said that the jury had been properly directed in this case. Had the jury been properly directed on this point it is quite impossible to say with certainty that the appellants would have been convicted. In the circumstances we have no option but to quash these convictions.

The first nine appeals listed above in which the appellants had pleaded guilty to using the respective motor vehicles driven by them on 15 July 1966 in effect, as taxis, without their being licensed as such, were argued before me on 8 February 1967.
Mr Marshall, counsel for the appellants, sought and obtained permission to argue and to add grounds of appeal against the validity of the convictions as well which had been challenged in the original notice of appeal filed by the appellants but had not been included in the subsequent grounds of appeal. Mr Ganesan, the DPP, raised no objections provided he was given an opportunity of an adjournment should the occasion arise and at the close of Mr Marshall`s submissions he renewed his application which I granted.
The same nine appeals came on for continued hearing on 3 March 1967 when the tenth appeal listed above was added as it involved similar facts and similar grounds of appeal. The main difference between the tenth appeal and the preceding nine lies in the fact that the tenth appellant had not pleaded guilty but had claimed trial and had been tried and convicted.
In all the ten cases the magistrates concerned made orders of forfeiture of the vehicles concerned. It should be noted that the grounds in the first nine appeals, as originally filed, were wholly against the aforesaid forfeiture. The tenth appeal contained grounds against both.
The charge on which each of the appellants was tried, except the appellant in No 196 (in respect of whom no complaint was made), followed the following lines: 
 
That you, at or about ... on ... at ... used motor car ... as a public service vehicle when it (
 sic
) was not in force in respect of such vehicle a public service vehicle licence and thereby committed an offence under s 50(1) punishable under s 50(2) of Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1966.
 
 
 
It was argued that this charge did not disclose any offence known to the law. It seems to me that there is no merit in this contention. The ingredients of the particular offence required to be proved under s 50 of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1961 have been clearly set out and I do not think that any mistake in referring to s 50 of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1961 as s 50 of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1966 is so defective as to vitiate a conviction thereunder on this ground alone.
In 
 R 
v 
 Koomah 
(1874) 3 Ky 66 it was held that the mistake was only as to a matter of form and the court amended the conviction by striking out the incorrect citation and inserting the proper one.
It was further argued that before a private motor car could be said to be used as a public service vehicle it should be shown that such use was deliberate, designed and repeated and that there should be an element of continuity in such use. It was submitted that use should be proved to have been made on more than one occasion. With this submission I am unable to concur.
As Earl of Halsbury LC said in 
 Powell 
v 
 The Kempton Park Racecourse Co Ltd 
[1899] AC 143
 at p 160: 
 
It is not the repeated and designed, as distinguished from the casual or infrequent, use which the employment of that word imports here, but the character of the use as a use by some person having the dominion and control over ...
 
 
 
It is not in dispute that the appellants in these cases had dominion and control over the vehicles in question at the relevant times. On the facts admitted by the appellants in the first nine appeals there could be little doubt as to the character of the use made by them of the motor vehicles in question. Further, the proviso to s 50(2) which reads as follows: 
 
Provided that a person shall not be convicted of an offence under this section if he proves to the satisfaction of the court that he used the motor vehicle, the subject of the charge, as a public service vehicle in an emergency for the purpose of conveying a sick or injured person to hospital or to bring medical aid to such person or for the purpose of making a report to a police station and that he had made all reasonable efforts to hire a public service vehicle for the purpose of the journey.makes it clear that the subsection in question clearly contemplates use on a single occasion, eg during an emergency.
 
 
 
In the case of the first nine appellants who had pleaded guilty to the charge it was contended that, being illiterate and unrepresented, they were misled as to the nature and consequences of their pleas. In my opinion they could not have been so misled judging by the facts which they admitted and what they sad in mitigation. In the particular cases of appellants in nos 157, 158, 159, 160, 161 and 196 it was contended that the trial magistrate has misled them by explaining to them that on conviction and on a written application for forfeiture of their vehicles in question by the public prosecutor the court might then make an order of forfeiture. It was contended by Mr Marshall that, in those circumstances, the court should have explained to them that it was bound to make an order of forfeiture. But Mr Marshall, in dealing with the question of the actual forfeiture of the vehicles in question, also contended that it was a prerequisite to an order of forfeiture that the vehicles in question should be proved to have been seized under the provisions of sub-s (4) of s 50. In the circumstances I do not think that the magistrate was entirely wrong in saying that the court might make an order of forfeiture after their conviction on receiving a written application from the public prosecutor, because in the absence of evidence of seizure the magistrate would have had no power to order forfeiture. Evidence of seizure however is not a prerequisite to a conviction. In any case, there seems to be no doubt that the appellants intended to admit their guilt without any qualification whatsoever and I cannot say that their pleas were wrongly accepted.
The convictions recorded in respect of all the nine appellants who pleaded guilty and who were convicted accordingly are therefore upheld.
With regard to no 218 there was, in my opinion, ample evidence to sustain a conviction.
I now turn to the question of the order of forfeiture made in each case.
As I have already indicated earlier there are three prerequisites to such an order:
 
 
(1) That the vehicle has been used in the commission of an offence under s 50(1). 
 
(2) That the said vehicle has been seized under the provisions of s 50(4). 
 
(3) That the public prosecutor has made a written application for forfeiture.
  
 
 
The only prerequisite with which I need concern myself now relates to whether the vehicles in question were seized under the provisions of s 50(4) of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1961. I was referred to the following passage from Brown J`s judgment in 
 DPP 
 
 v Tan Ah Guat 
 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 32
 : 
 
Further, there is no evidence (as there ought to have been) that the vehicle had been seized, and before an order for forfeiture can be made there must in my opinion be express evidence to this effect.
 
 
 
An examination of the record of that appeal shows clearly that the motor car in question had been stopped by the police at a road-block in Thomson Road and on a search of the vehicle dutiable liquor was found therein. There was no evidence that the vehicle was ever taken into police custody or detained by them. The vehicle was neither taken to a police station nor directed to a police station by the officers concerned and there is nothing to indicate that at the time of the trial the vehicle was in police custody. In fact it was stated from the Bar during the argument on appeal that the vehicle was not then under detention.
In a subsequent case, 
 Tai Theong & Anor 
 v R 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 11
  Brown J appears to have come to a different conclusion on the facts where the evidence of seizure was as follows: 
 
When I found the gunny sack I asked the first accused and the second accused to accompany us to the Customs House in the taxi. We brought exhs G and H (dutiable liquor) with us.
 
 
 
It is clear from this that the revenue officers seized the taxi. There was also evidence at the trial that the magistrate made a personal inspection of the vehicle concerned in circumstances showing that the vehicle was under detention by the revenue authorities. There was ample evidence on which Brown J could conclude that the vehicle had been properly seized.
It will be seen therefore that the three preconditions set out earlier will have to be satisfied by strict proof before an order of forfeiture can be made. Where a conviction has been recorded either on a plea of guilty or otherwise there will be clear evidence of the use of the vehicle concerned in the commission of the offence under s 50 but, since evidence of seizure is not an essential ingredient in proving the offence, it may sometimes happen that after conviction the magistrate is left with no evidence on this point. It is therefore incumbent on the prosecution to prove seizure, unless that has already been done. I do not think that a bare statement by the prosecution that the car has been seized will suffice. Nor does a statement to this effect in the preamble to the Attorney General`s written application for forfeiture in my opinion dispense with proof of seizure. Powers of seizure may be exercised under s 50(4) by police officers and other persons mentioned therein on discovery by them that an offence under s 50 has been committed in respect of the vehicle concerned and such persons should give the required evidence.
The difficulty encountered in 
 DPP v Tan Ah Guat 
could have been obviated if there had been evidence that the vehicle had been removed by the police and detained at a police station after it had been stopped at the road-block. In 
 Tai Theong & Anor 
 v R 
there was such evidence.Of the ten appeals before me eight appear to satisfy this test. In the other two there is no evidence of seizure as such. The appellants were told by the police in those two cases to proceed to Maxwell Road police station. Whether they arrived there on foot or by helicopter or in their respective cars no one knows. I do not think that the magistrate was entitled to assume that the cars were driven there by the appellants and detained by the police. He should therefore have called for evidence of this before making the orders of forfeiture in question.
Where parliament has given powers of seizure to the executive to be followed by forfeiture on the written application of the Attorney General even an innocent third party who may own the car has no remedy and the courts are deprived of any power to exercise any discretion in the matter of forfeiture. (See 
 R 
 v Ong Suan 
 
 
[1933] MLJ 17
 .) It therefore seems only just that the three prerequisites to such an order should be strictly proved and if the court is left in doubt as to what took place no such order should be made.
In the case of the two appeals where the appellants were asked to proceed to Maxwell Road police station the court can only make a conjecture as to whether their cars were seized or not after that.
If there is an ambiguity about the facts the prosecution will only have themselves to blame.
I shall now proceed to examine the record of the ten appeals before me as to evidence of seizure which varies from case to case as follows:
 No 157 
- The police drove the car in question with the accused inside to Maxwell Road police station. In my opinion the facts here are similar to those in the case of 
 Tai Theong 
v 
 R. 
 No 158 
- The Police instructed the appellant to proceed to Maxwell Road police station. I am not so sure that this is sufficient to establish seizure of the vehicle driven by this appellant. As I have said, the appellant could have proceeded to Maxwell Road police station without his car and there is nothing to indicate that the vehicle was detained in any police station.
 No 159 - 
The police took the car to Maxwell Road police station after the appellant had run away. This was, in my opinion, adequate evidence of seizure.
 No 160 
- The car and the appellant were brought to Maxwell Road police station. This also seems satisfactory evidence of seizure. Similarly, in Nos 161, 162, 163, 164 and 196.
 No 218 
- The appellant had claimed trial. The only evidence relating to seizure is as follows: Corporal 2535 of the Traffic Police gave evidence to the effect that after he had discovered the commission of an offence by the appellant he asked him to proceed to Maxwell Road police station. The facts here are, in my opinion, similar to the facts in No 158. There is nothing to indicate what happened to the car and the appellant could have arrived at the police station without it.
In Nos 158 and 218 therefore, I am of the opinion that the orders of forfeiture should be set aside. In all the other appeals the orders are confirmed.
I might add that the convictions in all cases, except No 196, will be in respect of offences as charged, with the substitution of the words `Road Traffic Ordinance 1961` for the words `Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1966`. Subject to this, the appeals against convictions in all the appeals are dismissed. So are all the appeals against orders of forfeiture except in Nos 158 and 218 where I set aside the orders made.
 Appeals against convictions dismissed. Appeals against order of forfeiture in Appeal Nos 158 & 218 allowed.",1967-03-08 00:00:00,SG High Court

Sections 161, 162, 163, 165, 169 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 132, 1955 Rev Ed)
 
The three appellants were convicted of robbery by the criminal district court and sentenced to one year`s imprisonment.
The first appellant was also convicted of personating a public servant by the same court and sentenced to six months` imprisonment to run concurrently with the sentence of one year on the robbery charge.
This latter offence was committed at the same time and during the commission of the first offence of robbery.
The case was devoid of all merit on the facts but it so happened that the charge of personating a public servant against the first appellant was made the subject of an entirely independent and separate charge on a separate charge sheet or as would be said in England of another indictment.
The case of robbery against the three appellants was joined with the case of personating a public servant against the first appellant and the two cases were then jointly tried together. There was thus under the phraseology used under English law two indictments, one against the three appellants for robbery and one against the first appellant for personation of a public servant.
No one seems to have been aware of this and the case proceeded as if there had been two counts in the one charge and there was a joint trial of both cases.
Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 132) provides that there shall be separate charges for distinct offences and every such charge shall be tried separately except as provided in ss 162, 163, 165 and 169.
Sections 162, 163 and 165 make provisions for the joinder of charges and s 169 gives power to join persons. There appears to be no power to join cases or indictments.
By virtue of the provisions of s 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code recourse must therefore be had to the law in force in England the application of which is mandatory.
The English authorities make it clear that that a simultaneous trial of two indictments or as here two cases is a nullity. See 
 R v Crane

. Where an accused person has pleaded `not guilty` to the offences charged against him in an indictment or charge and another accused person has pleaded `not guilty` to the offence or offences charged against him in another separate and independent indictment or charge it is elementary criminal law that the issues raised by these two pleas cannot be tried together. See per Lord Atkinson in 
 Crane 
`s case.
It was conceded as I understood it by the deputy public prosecutor that the trial was bad but it was argued that it was but a mere irregularity which could be cured by the application of the provisions of s 440 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
It was not disputed that the procedure adopted here did not result in any miscarriage of justice but in the view I take it struck at the root of the jurisdiction of the court to try the appellants.
The district court in the circumstances had no jurisdiction to try the appellants jointly on these two charges or indictments and the trial was a nullity 
 ab initio 
. It only remains for me to say how much I regret coming to this decision as the point is a pure technicality and as I have said there is no merit in this appeal on the facts.
In arriving at this conclusion I am aware that I have the misfortune to find myself in disagreement with the decision of Raja Azlan Shah J in 
 Syed Ismail 
 v 
 PP 
 
 
[1967] 2 MLJ 123

The appeal must accordingly be allowed and the convictions and sentences quashed and I direct that there shall be a new trial.

These are two motions by Foong Jam Keong to the court for the exercise of the summary jurisdiction it possesses in cases of contempt. The particular contempt alleged being the making and publishing of comments prejudicial to the applicant in a pending criminal trial. The persons against whom these applications are directed are Dr Goh Keng Swee, the Minister of the Interior and Defence and the Straits Times Press (Malaya) Ltd, the proprietors and publishers of the 
 Straits Times 
newspaper.
The circumstances which give rise to these applications are shortly these. On the night of 22 October 1966, at a variety concert at the Gay World Stadium certain persons clashed with the police. The police opened fire and some persons were wounded. The applicant was one of the persons wounded. He was taken to hospital and in the early hours of the morning of 23 October he was arrested. On 24 October the applicant and some others were charged in the magistrate`s court under ss 148 and 332 of the Penal Code. On 25 October there appeared on page nine of the 
 Straits Times 
a report of the proceedings in the magistrate`s court, (exh FJK1). The report was headed `18 people accused of rioting in Singapore.` It was reported that thirteen people were charged in a magistrate`s court on Monday 24 October with being members of unlawful assemblies, rioting and causing hurt to police officers on the night of 21 October and on 22 October and that five others were charged with the same offences in the General Hospital by a magistrate and that they all pleaded guilty. The report went on to say that: 
 
In the court six men faced a charge of being members of an unlawful assembly about 8.45pm on Saturday at the Gay World amusement park and causing hurt to Inspector Ong Eng Say and a party of police officers thereby committing an offence of rioting while armed with chairs, bottles and wooden poles. They also faced a charge of causing hurt to Inspector Ong and his party in the discharge of their duties.
 
 
 
The names of these six men were published which included the name `Foong Jam Keong`. (There is no dispute that this person was the applicant). The names of the three other men who were in the General Hospital and who faced similar charges were also published. It was further reported (1) that three men and a girl were charged with `being members of an unlawful assembly at Eu Tong Sen Street, New Bridge Road and Pagoda Street about 8.20pm last night and assaulting and causing hurt to police officers`; (2) that three men were charged with `being members of an unlawful assembly and rioting while armed with bottles and chairs about 8pm last night at the junction of Arab Street, Victoria Street and causing hurt to police constable Chin Poh Chin`; and (3) that two men were charged in the General Hospital with `being members of an unlawful assembly about 8.10 o`clock last night at Tiwari Street and Rochore Canal Road and causing hurt to Inspector Mohamed bin Abdul Manap and a party of police officers thereby committing an offence of rioting while armed with bottles and stones`.
On the front page of the same issue of the 
 Straits Times 
there appeared an article written by Yeo Toon Joo, a reporter of the 
 Straits Times 
dated Monday 24 October (exh FJK 2). The headlines were `We`ll clobber you properly if ...`; `Trouble makers get a warning.` It is unnecessary to read in full the article, but it stated, inter alia, as follows: 
 
The Minister for the Interior and Defence Dr Goh Keng Swee today warned Barisan Sosialis supporters that they would be `clobbered properly` if they continued their lawlessness. He was speaking at the General Hospital this afternoon, after visiting police constable Chin Poh Chin, 21, who is in hospital with a fractured skull after being clubbed by a mob of party-backed demonstrators at Tiwari Street last night. He said I do not think we can tolerate lawlessness of this kind. Those responsible will have to bear the consequences. If there is any more of this business, we are going to clobber them properly.`Asked to comment on Saturday night`s shooting at the Gay World in which ten Barisan men were wounded, he said: `The police shot in self-defence. There was only a small party of them, and they were cornered by a crowd of about 100.` The police statement said: `Following the refusal by the organisers of the variety show sponsored jointly by the Barisan Sosialis and Partai Rakyat at the Gay World Stadium to admit police officers on Saturday, and the subsequent attack on these officers by the supporters, the licence to hold the show was cancelled yesterday.`
 
 
 
The article then went on to give the five incidents of illegal demonstrations listed by the police which took place in various parts of the town and Geylang on the night of Sunday 23 October.
On Wednesday 26 October the 
 Straits Times 
published a statement issued to the Press by the Ministry of Interior and Defence on Tuesday the 25 October (Ex FJK 4). It is unnecessary to read out the statement in full. The part objected to by the applicant as being prejudicial to him in the conduct of his defence on the charges which were pending against him reads as follows: 
 
On 21 October two customs officers were prevented by the `ushers` - actually strong-arm boys - from checking on one of their `ticket collectors` who had allowed admission to certain spectators on the strength of so-called donation tickets.
 
 
 
Customs checking is a routine practice to ensure there is no evasion of entertainment duty.
While this was going on, the crowd inside the stadium became unruly and some of them shouted `pak` (beat).
The police had to intervene to save the customs officers from assault, and assisted in apprehending one of the officials for obstructing the customs officers in carrying out their duties.
On 22 October at the third concert at about 8.35pm a police inspector and two policemen who had just gained entry into the stadium in connection with their duties, were stopped by about 20 of the `ushers`.
Despite the fact that the police personnel produced their warrant cards to identify themselves, they were manhandled and bodily pushed out of the gate.
They were also punched from behind, and the inspector had to draw his revolver to prevent the unruly crowd from further attacking him, but he did not open fire.
Police presence at the meetings was routine and had not hitherto been resisted.
The same mob then turned their hostility towards another inspector and a police constable who were inside the stadium. They surrounded the two police personnel and ordered them to get out.
Although the inspector identified himself and explained his presence, he was attacked and set upon by the mob. Other policemen on duty nearby, who came to the inspector`s rescue, were also set upon.
Bottles, stones and chairs were used to attack policemen. Heavily outnumbered, the policemen retreated. Instead of allowing them to leave, the mob advanced on them and continued to attack. The policemen had no alternative but to open fire in self-defence. The police fired several warning shots in the air, and when this did not stop the mob from advancing, the police had to direct their fire at the mob.
`Our policemen are trained to fire in such a manner as to avoid inflicting fatal or serious injury, and none of the persons hit sustained serious injury,` said the ministry.
The ministry added: `It is evident that this collision with the police was deliberately contrived to whip up the feelings of party supporters for the party`s militant line, on the one hand, and on the other to discredit the Government.
The organisers were fully aware that one of the conditions of the licence was to allow free access to police and customs personnel into the show in connection with their duties, and yet they deliberately obstructed and manhandled these officers. This was meant as the signal for the beginning of more violent action against the police.`
In the same issue of the 
 Straits Times 
 there appeared an editorial headed `Warning Signs` (exh FJK 3). The passages in the editorial objected to by the applicant read: 
 
The clash between police and Barisan Sosialis supporters at a Vietnam rally in Singapore over the week-end, is rich in cautionary lessons. Five policemen were injured, one of them seriously, when people at the rally refused to allow officers in plain clothes to enter the hall and then turned on them menacingly. The police had to use their guns in self-defence, wounding ten of their attackers. If there is any more of this business, the minister said, giving colloquial emphasis to his warning, `We will clobber them (the agitators) properly`. The question is whether the Government should permit public meetings to be organised by men it has every reason to believe intend to turn them into riots.
 
 
 
The criminal case against the applicant and the other accused was transferred for trial to the first criminal district court and 10 April 1967 was fixed for the commencement of the trial.
On 12 December 1966 the applicant applied for and on the 16 December 1966 the High Court granted the applicant leave to make an application to issue a writ of attachment against the respondents for their alleged contempt of the First criminal district court. Pursuant to such leave the applicant filed the present motions.
On 10 April 1967 the case against the applicant was transferred from the First criminal district court to the second criminal district court and on the same day 17 April 1967 was fixed for the hearing of the case. On 17 April 1967 the prosecution withdrew the case against the applicant and the other accused and they were discharged amounting to an acquittal.
Before I come to deal with the question as to what matter constitutes a contempt of court, I think it is well to bear in mind the duty of the court in such matters. The power of the court to attach or commit for contempt being practically arbitrary and unlimited should be most jealously and carefully watched and exercised with the greatest caution. (

(1877) 46 LJ Ch 375). In 
 Ex parte Gaskell & Chambers Ltd 
[1936] 2 KB 595
, Goddard J said (at p 603): 
 
The jurisdiction sought to be invoked in this case is a jurisdiction which it is very necessary that the court should possess both for the vindiction of its own authority and for the protection of the litigants who may come before it. On the other hand it is a jurisdiction the exercise of which may deprive the subject of his liberty without the intervention of a jury, and in circumstances in which there is no appeal. It is therefore a jurisdiction to be used with circumspection and only to be invoked for grave and serious reasons and on real and substantial grounds.
 
 
 
Now, when does an article or statement published in a newspaper commenting on a pending proceeding amount to contempt? In 
 R 
 v 
 Parke 
 
[1903] 2 KB 432
. Wills J who delivered the judgment of the court, said (at p 436): 
 
The reason why the publication of articles like those with which we have to deal is treated as a contempt of court is because their tendency and sometimes their object is to deprive the court of the power of doing that which is the end for which it exists - namely to administer justice duly, impartially, and with reference solely to the facts judicially brought before it. Their tendency is to reduce the court which has to try the case to impotence, so far as the effectual elimination of prejudice and prepossession is concerned.
 
 
 
It has been emphasised in a number of cases that the summary jurisdiction ought to be exercised only in clear cases. In 
 R 
 v 
 Payne & Cooper 
 
[1896] 1 QB 577
 Lord Russell CJ said (at p 580): 
 
I wish to express the view which I entertain, that applications of this nature have in many cases gone too far. No doubt the power which the court possesses in such cases is a salutary power, and it ought to be exercised in cases where there is real contempt, but only where there are serious grounds for its exercise. Every libel on a person about to be tried is not necessarily a contempt of court; but the applicant must shew that something has been published which either is clearly intended, or at least is calculated, to prejudice a trial which is pending.
 
 
 
In the same case, Wright J said (at p 581): 
 
I agree with all that the Lord Chief Justice has said, and I only wish to add that, in my opinion, in order to justify an application to the court the publication complained of must be calculated really to interfere with a fair trial, and, if this is not the case, the question does not arise whether the publication is so objectionable in its terms as to call for the interference of the court. If the publication is found likely to interfere with a fair trial, a second question arises, whether, under the circumstances of the case, the jurisdiction which the court in that case possesses ought to be exercised, not so much for punishment as for preventing similar conduct in the future. That is the rule which I wish to adopt with regard to applications of this nature.
 
 
 
Accordingly, the question in every case is whether, in all the circumstances existing at the date of publication, including the content and form of the article, the circulation of the paper in which it appears and the state of the proceedings, the article was intended or calculated to prejudice the fair hearing of the proceedings.
In this case there is no suggestion, and indeed there is no evidence, that the respondents intended to prejudice the fair hearing of the proceedings against the applicant. The sole question therefore is whether the statements and articles complained of are, under all the surrounding circumstances, calculated really to interfere with the fair trial of the applicant.
Let us now examine the statements and articles. First, the statement made by the minister to the 
 Straits Times 
reporter. There is no doubt that it was made in reference to the Gay World incident but the reference was to what the police did at the gathering. The statement was far too general in character to refer directly to the charges against the applicant. In my view there was nothing in it which could be said to interfere or tended to interfere with the course of justice.
Second, the ministerial statement. This statement was concerned with certain disruptive movements and forces in the State and the lawlessness that had taken place. Not only did the statement refer to the Gay World incident but also to other incidents which took place prior to 22 October 1966. There had been a number of incidents in several parts of Singapore for two days which took the form of illegal street demonstrations and which culminated in the Gay World incident. There was no reference either directly or indirectly to the applicant or to any of the persons who were charged in court or to any pending criminal proceedings. It is true that the phrase `strong arm boys` was used but there was no insinuation that the applicant was one of them. The statement also mentioned that the Barisan Sosialis in a press statement on 23 October 1966 described the Gay World incident as `the start of a blood-bath` and said that `the blood-debt must be paid.` Now all these lawlessness were certainly matters of grave public interest and concern and the Government owed a high duty to the public to keep it informed. In my view the minister responsible for keeping law and order would be failing in his duty to the public if he had not made some comment on the incidents, for otherwise there might be public apprehension that there was some truth in the `blood-bath` statement made by the Barisan Sosialis. I am of the view that this statement was not calculated to prejudice the fair trial of the applicant.
Third, the editorial. The facts in it came out of the ministerial statement. The comment was that the Government would not allow disturbances of this type to take place. This was certainly a generally-worded observation and a very appropriate observation to make in a time of disorder. There was no reference to the charges against the applicant nor was he named. Here again I can see nothing in the editorial which can be said to interfere or tend to interfere with the course of justice.
For these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the statements and articles did not constitute a contempt of court.
The motions are dismissed with costs.

The plaintiff`s claim against the defendant is for damages for personal injuries, loss and damage suffered by the plaintiff and caused by the negligence of the defendant, his servants or agents.
The plaintiff`s evidence is shortly as follows. On and before 1 March 1966 the defendant was carrying out under a contract with the Government of Singapore certain works on the land forming the curtilege of Monk`s Hill School in connection with an extension of the school by adding an additional floor to the building and constructing a staircase leading up to it. The plaintiff was at all material times an engineer of the Public Works Department and it was part of his duties as such engineer to inspect from time to time the execution of the defendant`s contract. Piles were driven at two sites, at one end of the school building, to take the new staircase but the piles could not be sunk very low as they hit rock. It was then decided to replace the piles with raft foundations, one raft at each site. The piles had to be extracted and the sites excavated first to a depth of six ft to seven ft and the final depth would be decided later. (I will hereafter refer to the two sites as raft No 1 and raft No 2.) It was also decided to put in the rafts one at a time. On 26 February 1966 the plaintiff gave the defendant instruction to dig a trench at raft No 2 to a depth beyond the rocks to firm ground and the plaintiff would come later and inspect and confirm that the depth was sufficient. The defendant was specifically told not to start excavating at raft No 1 until the plaintiff gave the instruction to do so. The plaintiff also told the defendant the same day to put a small earth bund around the trench and put up a shed, with zinc roof resting on struts, well above the trench to keep rain water from getting into it. The next day, 27 February the plaintiff visited the site expressly to see the excavation at raft No 2. The plaintiff found that a trench had already been dug to a depth of two or three feet at raft No 2 but the zinc roof was not up and the earth bund around the trench was not there. No work had been done at raft No 1, it had not been touched. The plaintiff went to the site the next morning, 28 February. He found that the excavation at raft No 2 was well in progress nearing completion; no excavation had been done at raft No 1. He left the site at 9.30am. The following day, 1 March, the plaintiff went to the site at 8.30am to inspect the excavation at raft No 2 and also to inspect the back of the school building to see the progress there. He walked with the PWD overseer towards the excavation site and was talking to the overseer. Coming to the position where raft No 1 was he saw some thin metal sheets lying flat on the ground as if they were on solid ground. He walked on the metal sheets and suddenly he fell into a trench seven to eight feet deep. The metal sheets had in fact covered the trench. He did not think that these metal sheets covered a trench as on the previous day the trench had not been there and he had not given the instruction to excavate at raft No 1. As a result of the accident he suffered personal injuries.
The defendant`s evidence is shortly this. He commenced piling two piles at raft No 1 and two piles at raft No 2 at the end of January 1966. When the piles hit rock piling work stopped. On or about 24 February 1966, the plaintiff instructed him to pull out the four piles and dig two holes at raft No 1 and two holes at raft No 2 where the piles were. While the holes were being dug the earth around the holes kept on falling into the holes and he was instructed by the plaintiff to dig a trench twelve and a half feet long, five feet wide and six to seven feet deep at raft No 1 instead of the two holes and to dig a similar trench at raft No 2. He began to pull out the piles on the afternoon of 24 February and all of them were removed that same afternoon. The next day, 25 February, excavation work at raft No 1 and raft No 2 commenced. On 26 February the plaintiff instructed him to put up a shed over the two trenches and to put an earth bund around them and that was done on the afternoon of the same day. On 27 February, he saw that the trenches were slightly wet and he instructed his workmen to cover up the trenches at the end of each day to keep off rain water by placing rafters, resting on the earth bund, across the trenches and placing thin zinc sheets on the top of the rafters. Excavation work at raft No 1 and at raft No 2 was completed on the afternoon of 28 February and the thin zinc sheets were placed over the trenches at the end of the day.
The plaintiff`s case is that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the trench at raft No 1, concealed as it was with sheets of metal incapable of bearing the weight of a person who might walk upon them, constituted a danger to persons coming upon the land in ignorance of the existence of the trench and that the accident to the plaintiff was caused by the negligence of the defendant, his servants or agents.
The defence is that the plaintiff knew of the trench at raft No 1 and that he accidentally or negligently walked on the metal sheets. Alternatively the defendant says the plaintiff by walking on the metal sheets `voluntarily assumed the risk of injury`.
Counsel for the defendant submits that this case should be decided on the basis that the defendant was the occupier of the land and the plaintiff an invitee and that the duty of an occupier to his invitee is limited to dangers which are unusual, of which he knows or ought to know. With all due respect to counsel I do not agree with his submission.
We are not in this case concerned with the liability of an occupier of land but with the liability of a contractor who was doing work on the land.
There are many authorities which show that the contractor`s duty is not confined to his duty under the contract to his employer. He is under a general duty to use reasonable care to prevent damage to persons whom he may reasonably expect to be affected by his work. In 
 Clayard v 
 Dethick 
 ER 932 a contractor in order to make a sewer dug a trench in a private passage leading to a mews. He negligently failed to fence the opening. Whilst a cabman was leading out his horse it fell into the trench and was killed. The contractor was held liable for negligence. In 
 Corby v 
 Hill 
 ER 1209 the owner of land having a private road for the use of persons coming to his house gave permission to a building contractor, who was engaged in building on the land, to place materials on the road. The contractor placed a pile of slates on the road and left them unlighted at night. A visitor ran into them in the dark. The contractor was held liable for negligence. In 
 Kimber v 
 Gas Light & Coke Co 
[1918] 1 KB 439
 the gas company when putting gas into a private house made a hole in the floor and failed to warn a visitor of the danger. They were held liable for the injury which resulted. There are many other cases. The cases show that the duty of care is owed to all those whom the contractor may reasonably expect to be affected by his work, whatever the capacity in which they come, whether as invitees or licencees or as other contractors.
The main question of fact to be decided in this case is whether or not the plaintiff knew of the existence of the trench at raft No 1.
I have considered the evidence adduced by both sides very carefully. On the balance of probabilities I think the story of the plaintiff is the true story. I find that the defendant was specifically told not to commence excavating at raft No 1 until the excavation at raft No 2 was completed and approved by the plaintiff. I also find that the plaintiff was not aware of the trench at raft No 1 when he visited the site on the morning of 1 March.
The defendant after making the trench at raft No 1 did not fence it. Instead of that he covered the trench with thin metal sheets and created a concealed danger unfenced and without warning. The defendant had no right to set a trap for the plaintiff whom he knew would come on the land. In my view the defendant has been negligent.
It is said that the plaintiff was negligent in walking over the metal sheets when he ought not to. How can one say that the plaintiff was negligent when he had no reason to believe that there might be danger in walking over the metal sheets?
For these reasons the plaintiff succeeds in his claim.
As a result of the accident the plaintiff sustained a fracture of the inferior ramus of the left pubic bone. He has recovered from his injury but there is residual functional impairment in the form of muscle weakness and an aggravation of pre-existing osteo-arthritis of the spine and hips and a superimposed rheumatic affection of the sciatic nerve. Taking all the circumstances into consideration I think the proper figure to award the plaintiff by way of general damages is $5,000.
Special damages has been agreed at $306.
There will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $5,306 and costs

Defendant attempting to avoid cyclist causing car to skid and collide into plaintiff
  – 
Whether skid brought about by defendantÂ’s negligence
 
The question I have to decide in this case is whether the skid in question which led to the collision with the plaintiff was brought about by the defendant`s negligence and, if not, whether he dealt with the skid in the proper manner so as to avoid the result of such skid.
I have no doubt that the collision with the first cyclist earlier on was brought about by the sole negligence of that cyclist. In attempting to avoid him the defendant swerved to his right. Complaint was made that he should have applied his brakes. The defendant says that he thought a swerve to the right was the better of the two alternatives. I cannot say that he was negligent in doing so in the emergency that faced him. In swerving back to his former course his car skidded after travelling 20 feet from the first collision and swivelled round and came to rest on the left hand kerb facing in the opposite direction after knocking down the plaintiff.
I accept the explanation given by the defendant that he did all that he could to avoid both collisions. Moreover, there is no evidence of excessive speed or of bad or careless driving on his part. He is also supported by an eye-witness who saw the first collision whose evidence, which is to the effect that the first cyclist cut across the defendant`s path, I accept.
It was contended that, after the skid began, the defendant travelled slightly over a hundred feet whereas in 
 Hunter 
v 
 Wright 
[1938] 2 All ER 621 where the defendant was held not to blame, the car travelled only 13 to 20 feet and that therefore this showed that he did not deal with the skid in the proper manner. I do not think that the greater distance travelled by the defendant necessarily shows that he acted improperly in dealing with the skid after its commencement. The speed of the car in 
 Hunter`s 
case was 16 to 20 mph whereas the defendant`s speed was somewhat more though less than 30 mph. The defendant gave it as between 25 to 28 mph which does not seem excessive and the defendant says that, after the skid began, he tried to control his car by using his brakes and steering to the right to prevent its making the left-handed U-turn which it did to the left side of the road notwithstanding his efforts. One need hardly add that an important factor in reducing the distance travelled during a skid is how quickly one hits an obstruction such as a pavement.
He had been compelled by the reckless action of the first cyclist to encroach on the path of on-coming vehicles and he had a duty to avoid the latter. He says he swerved violently to the left and went into a skid which he tried his best to control without success.
The principal question is, however, whether the defendant was at fault in going into the skid. As MacKenna J said in 
 Richley 
v 
 Faull 
[1965] 3 All ER 109 at p 110: 
 
In finding that the defendant was negligent I adopt, with a qualification to be mentioned presently, the reasoning of Lord Greene MR in 
 Laurie
 v 
 Raglan Building Co Ltd
. It was a case in which the defendants` lorry had struck and killed the plaintiff`s husband who was standing on the pavement in an omnibus queue. Lord Greene MR said: ` ... The plaintiff gave evidence which showed in the first instance that the position of the lorry over the pavement was due to a skid, and it is contended on behalf of the respondents that, assuming that a prima facie case of negligence arose, the circumstance establishing that the accident was due to a skid is sufficient to displace that prima facie case. In my opinion, that is not a sound proposition. The skid by itself is neutral. It may or may not be due to negligence. If, in a case where a prima facie case of negligence arises, such as that with which I have been dealing, it is shown that the accident is due to a skid, and that the skid happened without fault on the part of the driver, then the prima facie case is clearly displaced, but merely establishing the skid does not appear to me to be sufficient for that purpose. I, of course, agree that where the respondents` lorry strikes the plaintiff on the pavement or, as in the present case, moves on to the wrong side of the road into the plaintiff`s path, there is a prima facie case of negligence, and that this case is not displaced merely by proof that the defendant`s car skidded. It must be proved that the skid happened without the defendant`s default. But I respectfully disagree with the statement that the skid by itself is neutral. I think that the unexplained and violent skid is in itself evidence of negligence. It seems hardly consistent to hold that the skid which explained the presence of the respondent`s lorry on the pavement or, as here, on the wrong side of the road, is neutral, but that the defendant must fail unless he pro ves that this neutral event happened without his default. Whether I am right in this or wrong, the conclusion is the same: the defendant fails if he does not prove that the skid which took him to the wrong place happened without his default.
 
 
 
In answering the question, therefore, as to whether he went into the skid without default on his part I have considered the speed at which he was travelling which does not appear to have been excessive and also the emergency which caused him to swerve to his right and later to his left. According to him it was drizzling and the road was probably wet. There is little evidence as to the precise cause of the skid apart from his violent swerve to the left on a wet road surface and I accept the fact that this was its primary cause. I have also asked myself whether in fairly heavy traffic he should have been travelling more slowly than 25-28 mph but this does not seem to be unreasonable for Outram Road which is 40 feet wide in the vicinity of the collisions and where, according to him, the car ahead of him was 50 yards away. I see no reason why I should not accept his evidence on these matters and his explanation as a whole.
Perhaps the exercise of considerable skill such as that said to have been exhibited by the Canadian Helldrivers, who visited Singapore recently, might have helped to avert the collision with the plaintiff. I do not think, however, that the ordinary, reasonably careful user of the roads today could have done very much more than that which the defendant did.
I therefore find that the defendant was not negligent and the plaintiff`s claim (much as I sympathise with him) is dismissed with costs.
I should have thought that in a case such as this, where the plaintiff is a completely innocent party, the insurers would have made an offer of settlement, at least on an ex gratia basis. This I hope they will do, notwithstanding the result of the case.
I assess the general damages, had the plaintiff succeeded, at $1,750. Special damage has been agreed at $350. Costs will be on the lower scale.

Whether negligence proved
 
These proceedings arose out of an accident which occurred in Havelock Road on 20 May 1964 at about 6.30pm between the plaintiff, a boy of eight years old, and the defendant who was driving his motor car.
The plaintiff`s case was that he and his ten year old brother had left their house at about half past six to go and play in a playground. In order to do this they had to cross Havelock Road. On reaching Havelock Road, the plaintiff stood on the side of the road waiting to cross. His evidence was that he saw a car approaching on his right in what he described as a zig-zag manner which hit him as he stood there and knocked him down.
His ten year old brother also said that the plaintiff was standing still at the edge of the road and was knocked down by a car coming in what he too described as a zig-zag manner.
A third witness, Yacob bin Abdullah, who said he was at the scene and saw the plaintiff standing on a plank across the drain by the side of the road. He too said that he saw this car coming in a zig-zag manner which hit the plaintiff who was flung off the road. The remarkable thing regarding his evidence was that he said he saw these two boys for a quarter of an hour waiting by the side of the road; that he then saw this motor car approaching he said in a zig-zag manner for some three minutes and in the very next breath he said he saw it coming in a zig-zag manner for some 50 to 60 feet. He did not appear to me to be a witness on whose evidence any real reliance could be placed.
The defendant`s case was that he was travelling at some 20 to 25 miles per hour along Havelock Road when the plaintiff infant suddenly ran out from behind a parked vehicle right across the path of his car when it was almost on him. He immediately applied his brakes and swerved the car to the right but was unable to avoid hitting the plaintiff. In the result, the learned trial judge found that the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant and gave judgment for the plaintiff for $2,000 being the agreed damages and costs. From that decision the defendant now appeals.
With respect to the learned trial judge he has, in my view, in arriving at his decision, drawn inferences and assumed facts not justified by the evidence. There was in my own opinion insufficient evidence, or no satisfactory evidence, to support the plaintiff`s contention that the defendant`s car was on a zig-zag course. The learned trial judge found as a fact that the plaintiff did not look to the right before stepping on to the road and therefore never saw the car at all; consequently he could not have seen it coming in a zig-zag manner as he swore he did. His brother never mentioned a word about the car approaching on a zig-zag course when he ran back to his house immediately after the accident to tell his father what had happened. In my view, that is one thing that he must surely have done if it was so.
The father`s report to the police was that his son, Pandian, had told him that the plaintiff had been knocked down when he was crossing the road from the left to the right hand side of Havelock Road; not, be it noted, while he was standing still by the side of the road. Yacob`s evidence on this subject of zig-zagging is, in my view, unworthy of belief.
The reasons given by the learned trial judge for finding it difficult to accept the defendant`s version are so, it seems to me, not justified by the evidence. His finding that the defendant was not telling the truth was based, in my judgment, on erroneous inferences and an incorrect appreciation of the facts.
There was no evidence to support the learned trial judge`s finding that the plaintiff was knocked down as soon as he attempted to cross the road, that is as soon as he stepped forward. The reasons he gave, namely that the only injury was to the lower part of the plaintiff`s right leg cannot possibly, so it seems to me, have any bearing as to where on the road the accident occurred. Furthermore, the other reason which he gave, namely, that the defendant`s evidence was that after travelling some 20 feet or so he stopped his car and turned round to see what had happened and saw the plaintiff lying some four to five feet away from the edge of the road is, if anything, inconsistent with the plaintiff being struck just as he stepped on to the road. Furthermore, the evidence of the defendant was wholly consistent with his report made to the police but a few moments after the accident.
The learned trial judge`s finding as to there being two lines of closely parked cars on either side of the road is again in my view not supported by the evidence.
Finally, the probabilities of the matter support the defendant`s case.
After a close examination of the record and having had the benefit of the argument of counsel, I have arrived at the clear conclusion that there was no negligence established on the part of the defendant and that the infant plaintiff was solely responsible for this accident and was unhappily the author of his own misfortune.
In my judgment the appeal must be allowed with costs here and in the court below. The deposit will be paid out to the appellant`s solicitor.

Charge of permitting another person to use a motor vehicle while it was not insured
  – 
Whether plea of guilty should have been accepted
 
In this case the appellant was charged with permitting another person to use a motor vehicle whilst there was not in force in relation to the user of the motor vehicle such a policy of insurance in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Ordinance 1960, an offence against s 3 (1) and punishable under s 3 (2) of the Ordinance. He pleaded guilty and was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $75 and disqualified for holding a driving licence limited to Class III vehicles for a period of twelve months.
In my judgment, the magistrate should not have accepted the plea of guilty in view of the following considerations. The appellant was not represented by counsel. The question of law whether or not there was in force in relation to the user of the motor vehicle such a policy of insurance as complied with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Ordinance 1960, was a difficult one for a person unversed in the law to answer. The magistrate could not safely convict solely on an admission of guilt by the appellant. The prosecution should have been called upon to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was not in force in relation to the user of the motor vehicle at the material time such a policy of insurance as complied with the statutory requirements. I accordingly set aside the conviction and sentence and the order of disqualification and ordered the fine of $75 paid by the appellant to be refunded.

The plaintiff, who is the executor of the estate of one Syed Eidrus bin Hassan bin Saleh Alsagoff (deceased) (also known by five different variants of the same name, and who will hereinafter be referred to as Syed Eidrus), claims a declaration that a number of mortgages and conveyances of the properties of Syed Eidrus set out in para 23 of his claim are null and void, and for an order directing the Registrar of Deeds, Singapore, to cancel the registration of the said deeds and all relative entries in his books and for other consequential orders.
Of the 16 sets of defendants concerned, the claim is being proceeded against only the first defendants, defendant No 2(b) and defendant No 12(a), all the other defendants having either submitted to judgment against them or reconveyed the properties concerned (the properties) or withdrawn their defences and counterclaims.
The present proceedings are founded on the alleged execution by Syed Eidrus of a power of attorney dated 31 July 1957 (exh P2, which will hereinafter be referred to as the power) in favour of one Syed Abdulrahman bin Abdullah Alsagoff (PW6) who, subsequently, on 30 September 1957, mortgaged the properties of Syed Eidrus, which are the subject matter of this suit, to the abovenamed first defendants as security for repayment of a loan of $100,000.
It is claimed that Syed Eidrus never executed the aforesaid power by affixing his signature thereto, because, on the date in question, he was never in Singapore but in Indonesia of which he was a national and permanent resident, that he had last visited Singapore in as far back as 1927 and never after that, and that Syed Eidrus never authorised PW6 to sell, mortgage or otherwise deal with his properties. In short, the plaintiff claims that both the power and the mortgage deed are forgeries. It is clear from the provisions of s 464 of the Penal Code (Cap 119) that, if the power is a forgery, then any mortgage deed executed on the strength of that power is also a forgery. It is also clear that, if forged, these documents are nullities unless the plaintiff is estopped from setting up the forgery of the power (see 11 
 Halsbury`s 
(3rd Ed) para 587).
The defendants say that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief claimed on the ground that PW6 had or appeared to have, at all material times, the authority of Syed Eidrus to mortgage the said properties, that in any case the mortgages were executed by an agent of the true owner of the properties acting within the real or alternatively the apparent authority of the true owner of the properties and accordingly the said mortgages were, at the material times, valid and effective mortgages.
The defendants also claim that they were bona fide mortgagees for value of the said properties without notice of any incapacity on the part of the mortgagor. The plaintiff admits this proposition.
The defendants further claim that the plaintiff is estopped or alternatively prevented by his laches from denying that the said mortgages were, at all material times, valid and effective mortgages.
Particulars of estoppel and laches have been filed as follows:
 
 
(a) The said Syed Eidrus or his agents failed to disclose or delayed in disclosing the forgery to the first defendants, defendant 2(b) and defendant 12(a) as soon as he or they knew or ought to have known of it and such failure or delay in disclosing as aforesaid has materially prejudiced the position of the said defendants. 
 
(b) The said Syed Eidrus was negligent in entrusting his title deeds to or leaving his title deeds with agents in such circumstances that the said agents would thereby be enabled to carry out the forgery and such negligence has materially prejudiced the position of the said defendants.
  
 
 
Further and better particulars were later filed as follows:
 
 
(a) The failure or delay of the said Syed Eidrus or his personal representatives has materially prejudiced the position of the first defendants, defendant 2(b) and defendant 12(a) in that the said defendants were by reason thereof unable to obtain restitution from the said Syed Abdulrahman bin Abdullah Alsagoff. 
 
(b) The negligence of the said Syed Eidrus has materially prejudiced the position of the first defendants, defendant 2(b) and defendant 12(a) in that but for such negligence (1) the said defendants would not have been put to loss and expense in contesting these proceedings (2) the consideration given by the said defendants for the purchase or mortgage of the said properties would not have failed (as to which the said defendants make no admission).
  
 
 
The issues I have to decide in this case, as submitted by counsel for the plaintiff with which counsel for the defendants did not disagree, are, therefore, as follows:
 
 
(1) Whether Syed Eidrus died on 15 July 1961 leaving a will dated 10 February 1942 and the plaintiff is the present executor of his will. 
 
(2) Whether Syed Eidrus owned the properties referred to in para 2 of the statement of claim. 
 
(3) Whether Syed Abdulrahman bin Abdullah Alsagoff was the agent of Syed Eidrus for the purpose of collecting the rents of his properties and managing same. 
 
(4) Whether the power of attorney dated 31 July 1957 (No 613/57) is a forged document. 
 
(5) Whether the first defendants conveyed the said properties to the other defendants as alleged in the statement of claim. 
 
(6) Whether the said Syed Abdulrahman was guilty of forgery or using as genuine a forged power of attorney and convicted of such offences under ss 471 and 467 of the Penal Code at the Assizes held at Singapore on 20 March 1962. 
 
(7) Whether Syed Abdulrahman when he executed the mortgage in favour of the first defendants was in the execution of the mortgage acting within the scope of his authority real or apparent as the agent of Syed Eidrus and the mortgage was therefore valid and effective. 
 
(8) Whether there was delay in disclosing the forgery of the power of attorney to the first defendants, defendants 2(b) and 12(a) as a result of which their position has been materially prejudiced in that by reason thereof they have been unable to obtain restitution from the said Syed Abdulrahman and the plaintiff is therefore estopped from alleging that the indenture of mortgage is invalid and ineffective. 
 
(9) Whether the said Syed Eidrus was negligent in entrusting his title deeds to or leaving his title deeds with agents in such circumstances that the said agents would thereby be enabled to carry out the forgery and such negligence has materially prejudiced the first defendants, defendant 2(b) and defendant 12(a).
  
 
 
Before embarking on a statement of my positive findings on the above issues apart from issues Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 which I find clearly proved, it will, I think, be useful for me to analyse the evidence relating to the circumstances leading to the execution of the power and the subsequent mortgage of the properties of Syed Eidrus and to indicate my findings of fact thereon as follows:
 
 
(a) The dramatis personaein this true-life melodrama of alleged fraud and forgery which has resulted in the present proceedings against the defendants, who are admittedly bona fidepurchasers or mortgagees for value of the properties, are - 
 
(i) Syed Eidrus (owner of the properties). 
 
(ii) Syed Abdulrahman bin Abdullah Alsagoff (PW6) who is alleged by the plaintiff to be the villain of the piece. 
 
(iii) Syed Saleh bin Eidrus Alsagoff (PW7), who was a partner with PW6 in Abdullah Alsagoff & Co (the firm), a firm of rent collecting agents having its office at No 15 Klang Road. 
 
(iv) Frederick Bernard Oehlers (PW1), an advocate and solicitor in whose presence the power was executed. 
 
(v) Veerapillai (PW2), peon to Mr Oehlers at the time. 
 
(vi) Sulong bin Ismail (PW4), a crier to a firm of auctioneers at Bonham Building where Mr Oehlers had his office, and who was an identifying witness. 
 
(vii) Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim Alkhatib (PW5) an Arab teacher of religion and of Arabic who claims to have been present in Mr Oehlers` office at the relevant time. 
 
(viii) Kiong Chai Woon (DW1), a valuer who valued the properties and claims to have been asked by PW6 to find a mortgagee, and 
 
(ix) Poh Kim San (DW2), representing the first defendants who are all brothers and to whom the properties were mortgaged. 
 
(b) The firm managed the properties and collected rents which, less deductions, were remitted by devious means to Syed Eidrus in Sourabaya. The title deeds of the properties were kept in a safe in the office of the firm. The keys thereto were kept exclusively by PW6 PW7 never had access to them at all because he merely performed the functions of a rent collector who handed the rents collected over to PW6 whilst the latter, who is his uncle, attended to all other aspects of the firm`s business, including correspondence, accounts, banking, payment of rates and maintenance charges, remittances to owners, etc. In short, PW6 provided the brain whereas PW7 provided the brawn. Although PW7 considered that he was the more hardworking partner because of the physical exertion involved in travelling around Singapore to collect the said rents, it is quite clear that, for all practical purposes, PW6 was in complete charge of every aspect of the firm`s affairs except rent collections. 
 
(c) The firm managed not only the properties of Syed Eidrus but, altogether, some 300 to 400 properties belonging mostly to Arabs residing in Arabia or Indonesia. All these owners, who were non-English speaking, kept their deeds in the custody of the firm, as agents, `according to Arab practice and procedure`. Except where specific authority was given by any particular owner, the duties performed by the firm were merely to collect rents, execute repairs to the properties and to remit moneys, less rates, commissions and incidental expenses, to the owners in Arabia or Indonesia. 
 
(d) The properties had been managed by the father of PW6 from as far back as 1927 or even earlier, and on the death of the father in 1942, the remaining partners of the firm continued the management of the properties of Syed Eidrus. At the end of the Japanese occupation, the only partners who were alive were PW6 and PW7 who carried on as agents of Syed Eidrus until at least 1957 when the alleged forgery of the power is said to have taken place. It is, therefore, beyond dispute that for thirty years at least the firm had enjoyed, without a break, the complete confidence reposed in it by Syed Eidrus and, for that matter, all its other clients. 
 
(e) Three days or so before the execution of the power, Mr Oehlers had seen a couple of Malays sitting at the desk of his chief clerk, Lim Chew Kok, and came to know that they were there in connection with the execution of a power of attorney. On the morning of the date of execution, Mr Oehlers told his chief clerk `to hurry up` as he wanted to leave the office. The donor came into his room and was identified to him as Syed Eidrus by both his chief clerk and PW4 Sulong bin Ismail. 
 
(f) The gist of Mr Oehlers` evidence on the question of the donor`s identity is to the effect that he was a well-dressed Arab type gentleman who looked affluent, appeared to be 48/49 years of age and spoke Malay with an Indonesian accent. He said that the photograph of Syed Eidrus in his passport dated 9 February 1927 (exh D1) resembled the person who executed the power. He was definite that PW5 (Shaik Abdullah bin Salim Alkhatib) was not that person, as the latter was thinner and almost hollow-cheeked whereas the donor was bigger-built and younger. It must, however, be remembered that the present photograph was taken at least 30 years before the date on which Mr Oehlers saw the donor. Syed Eidrus must, himself, have considerably aged by 1957 and could not have presented the young and cherubic appearance he had in 1927. Mr Oehlers agreed that the other Malay whom he saw on two occasions with the donor was PW6 (Syed Abdulrahman bin Abdullah Alsagoff). He was, however, quite clear that PW6 was not the person who executed the power. 
 
(g) Lim Chew Kok, Mr Oehlers` chief clerk, could not be called to give any evidence with regard to the execution of the power because he died in December, 1959. 
 
(h) Mr Oehlers` peon, PW2 (Veerapillai), gave evidence to the effect that the two Arabs who were present in Mr Oehlers` office at the time of the execution were PW6 and PW5. He did not recognise the passport photograph of Syed Eidrus although he admitted that he had told Mr Oehlers that the man in the photograph could have been one of the two Arabs concerned. Syed Eidrus and PW6 are first cousins and according to PW6 they resembled each other. It is, therefore, not unlikely that PW2 was thinking of PW6`s face when he was shown the passport photograph. Having clearly identified one of the Arabs as PW5, he described the second Arab as short and stout and dressed like an Arab gentleman. After seeing PW6 he identified the latter as the second Arab who had previously come to the same office in 1953 to see Mr Oehlers` uncle. I am not, therefore, prepared to accept the submission that he ever made a satisfactory identification of the man in the passport photograph as one of the two Arabs concerned. As PW2 was not inside the room at the time of the execution he cannot, of course, say which one of the two Arabs executed the power. 
 
(i) PW4, the crier, was an unsatisfactory and obviously unreliable witness who contradicted himself constantly. He was one of the identifying witnesses. At one stage he said that PW6 executed the power and at another he said that it was PW5. He said that he was asked by PW6 to be an identifying witness. I am thoroughly satisfied that this witness knew that the person who executed the power was definitely not Syed Eidrus. He made the illuminating observation that PW6 had told him that Syed Eidrus was dead and that PW5 would give him a power. I am somewhat surprised that Mr Oehlers should have relied on him. I can only assume that he trusted the other identifying witness, his chief clerk, to such an extent that he did not give serious thought to the credentials for respectability which this witness had (or did not have). One would have thought that a man of proved repute and integrity. if not substance, could have easily been found to identify a wealthy landowner of the standing of Syed Eidrus in place of an auctioneer`s crier. 
 
(j) I now come to the evidence of PW5, an Arab teacher of religion and of Arabic. He was a close friend of PW6, whose children he had taught in the past. He now lives on public assistance. He says that he was taken by PW6 to Mr Oehlers` office on the morning in question and that he was asked to write a name in Arabic on a power of attorney from Indonesia, and that he was told, presumably, by PW6, that the lawyer wanted a religious teacher who could write Arabic. He was then asked to write a name in Arabic and he did so. The name he wrote out was, according to him, `Said Basbaer`. He reproduced this name on exh P19. On being shown the power, he denied that the signature of the donor was his. On being shown exh P15 (a power actually executed in 1927 by Syed Eidrus) he agreed that the signature thereon was different from that on the power. He said that the signature on exh P15 was in links and more scholarly. On being shown another example of the signature of Syed Eidrus exh P20), a letter dated 22 May 1961 which was later included in exh P25, he was positive that this signature had no resemblance to the signature on the power. Towards the latter part of his evidence, in answer to a question by the court, he was definite that the signature on the power was his. This is another witness whom nobody can easily trust but it is part of the price we have to pay for democracy, I suppose, that the taxpayer, through the Public Assistance Department, has to contribute towards his maintenance. 
 
(k) PW6 also gave evidence on the question of the identity of the donor of the power. He had forgotten who executed it although he admitted responsibility for its execution by someone who was not Syed Eidrus. He said that Syed Eidrus had last visited Singapore in 1928 and that he had never seen him since. He admitted that he instructed Mr Oehlers` chief clerk to prepare the power and that he introduced someone whom he could not remember, to the chief clerk as Syed Eidrus. He was quite positive that the power was forged. 
 
Although he was convicted and sentenced to six years` imprisonment in 
 Assize 
Case No 76 of 1961 (exh ABC52 et seq) for a number of offences involving forgeries of powers, the record does not show that any of the offences which he had asked to be taken into account in passing sentence related to the forgery of the power. He claimed that he had, in fact, given instructions to his solicitor or his solicitor`s clerk, one SJ Alfred, to include the offence of using the power as genuine when forged amongst the offences to be considered. 
 
(l) Evidence was called to show that a search of the records of the Immigration Department for 1956/1957 contained no confirmation of the fact that Syed Eidrus had entered Singapore during those years, and also to show that the chances of his having come to Singapore in 1957 were otherwise remote. 
 
(m) Purporting to act on the authority of of this power, PW6 proceeded to mortgage the properties of Syed Eidrus to the first defendants on 30 September, 1957 for a sum of $100,000 with interest thereon at the rate of $1.10 per $100 per month (exh ABC1 et seq).PW6 fell into arrears of interest and eventually the properties were sold by auction on 16 and 17 August 1960 to the other defendants in this suit. 
 
(n) On 30 June 1961 a receiving order was made against the firm (Abdullah Alsagoff & Co). PW7 who had been a partner in this firm claimed to have retired from it and PW6 was adjudicated a bankrupt on 29 September 1961 and he still remains an undischarged bankrupt who has not yet filed his statement of affairs. 
 
(o) PW7 (Syed Saleh bin Eidrus Alsagoff) gave positive evidence to the effect that the signature of the donor on the power was definitely not that of Syed Eidrus and that it had no resemblance at all to the signature on exh P15 which was a genuine power executed by Syed Eidrus. 
 
(p) Before I complete my analysis of the evidence I think I should refer, in particular, to the circumstances in which PW7 came to discover that the properties of Syed Eidrus had been mortgaged. According to this witness he was told by PW6 to stop collecting rents on these properties in August or September 1960, but he was not told that these properties had been mortgaged. He only discovered this in May 1961. 
 
(q) He was a bovine type of witness who trusted his uncle, PW6 implicitly and it never occurred to him to question him in any way about the conduct of the affairs of the partnership. He had no access to the title deeds, accounts, books or correspondence of the firm. As I have said earlier, he was pure brawn as against the brain of PW6, and it was only in May 1961 that he came to discover that the properties of his own wife, Sheriffa Shaikhah, which were being managed by the firm, bad been mortgaged by PW6, who purported to act under a power of attorney from the wife of PW7 which was, in fact, forged. As a consequence he consulted his solicitors, Messrs Mallal & Namazie, who set the law in motion as a result of which PW6 was arrested, charged and subsequently convicted and sentenced in Assize Case No 76 of 1961, inter alia, for that particular offence. 
 
(r) This witness who claims to have retired from the partnership of the firm in May 1961 gave evidence to the effect that soon afterwards he saw the plaintiff in these proceedings and told him about what had happened to his wife`s properties. He also told the plaintiff, for the first time, that the properties of Syed Eidrus had been sold by PW6. The plaintiff became suspicious because Syed Eidrus was his brother. In addition to the properties of Syed Eidrus, properties belonging to his mother, his wife and his elder brother were also being managed by the firm. It would appear from the evidence that the plaintiff went to Indonesia to consult Syed Eidrus and that it was after this that the plaintiff and the witness decided to take action against PW6. It is not very clear whether this witness consulted Messrs Mallal & Namazie immediately after he discovered evidence of a suspected fraud on his wife or whether it was after he had consulted the plaintiff and after the plaintiff had consulted Syed Eidrus in Indonesia that they proceeded to instruct their solicitors to take action. However, it is sufficiently clear that all these events did take place during the month of May 1961. It is also clear that the suspicions of the plaintiff and PW7 were confirmed only after they saw their solicitors and it was only then that the fraud committed by PW6 came to light. 
 
(s) As I have said earlier, this witness was not particularly intelligent but I have no reason to doubt the veracity of his evidence. I, therefore, reject the contention of defence counsel that he was privy to the fraud committed by PW6 and that the latter had asked him to keep quiet about it. He may be bovine but he is not completely asinine. 
 
(t) Not long afterwards, on 16 July 1961 PW7 received a cable (exh P23) from Indonesia, informing him that Syed Eidrus had died the previous day. This unfortunate occurrence no doubt played some part in the delay which subsequently occurred in bringing the true facts to the notice of the first defendants. It should, however, be borne in mind that investigations by the police had not yet been completed. It was, therefore, only in March 1962, at or about the time of the conviction of PW6, that the first defendants were first notified.
  
 
 
I now turn to my findings on issues Nos 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 above.
With regard to issue No 4, i.e., whether the power is a forged document, my finding is in the affirmative. In my opinion the evidence clearly reveals PW6 to be a villain of the deepest dye. It is true that he has purged his other offences by serving a sentence of six years` imprisonment less obvious remissions for ill-health but the offence relating to this power was never directly drawn to the attention of the sentencing judge although he did admit using four other forged powers (not included in the indictment) about which no particulars were, however, disclosed, and about which the Public Prosecutor was ignorant. Notwithstanding the doubt as to whether this offence had been clearly revealed to the learned judge he was prepared to admit it to me. He is bed-ridden and has little to gain by lying on this point and I accept his evidence on this, though he says that he has forgotten whom he introduced to Mr Oehlers in place of Syed Eidrus.
Despite the evidence of Mr Oehlers, who was obviously in a hurry on the morning in question and cannot now be expected to remember all the details, the evidence does point towards PW5 as the impersonator though not with that high degree of probability required to prove criminality on his part. The police, who investigated the matter after the conviction of PW6, did not consider that a prosecution would be justified and have taken no further action against him. This disposes of issue No 6 as well. I find that particulars of the use of the power in the present case were not disclosed to the learned judge in the Assize case heard on 20 March 1962 and that PW6 was not found guilty of using it although the use of four forged powers (of which this may have been one) was, no doubt, taken into consideration in the assessment of sentence. The fact remains, however, that, on the present evidence, he did use the forged power as genuine because, no matter who signed it as donor, I am quite satisfied that Syed Eidrus himself was not in Singapore then or at all after 1927 and did not execute it. The evidence from the Immigration Department, the evidence of and relating to the handwriting and indeed the totality of the rest of the evidence clearly shows that, if it was not PW5 who executed the power, it was someone other than Syed Eidrus - perhaps some other Arab gentleman resembling him to a certain extent who spoke with an Indonesian accent.
Which brings me to issues Nos 7 to 9, the onus of proving which lies on the defence.
Mr O`Connor for the defence contended that acceptance of PW6`s evidence on one issue would necessarily require my accepting the rest of his evidence and, in particular, that he had disclosed to Syed Eidrus his wrongdoing in mortgaging the properties two months after the mortgage and that Syed Eidrus asked him to `pay the money quickly`, and `be careful, don`t let my houses be sold`. I do not think I am bound to accept every part of the evidence of PW6. Indeed it would be unsafe in my opinion to accept any part of the evidence given by him except in so far as it finds support in other acceptable evidence or is evidence of such a kind that from its very nature it cannot be disputed. I, therefore, find that PW6`s evidence of his confessing his wrongdoing to Syed Eidrus two months after the mortgage is unacceptable as it is completely contradicted by letters from Syed Eidrus to PW7 (exh P25) which I admitted as evidence of conduct on the part of Syed Eidrus and not as to the truth of their contents.
From these letters it is clear that Syed Eidrus was reasonably well disposed towards PW6 prior to May 1961 and that in all the earlier letters he has been at pains to send his regards to PW6 through PW7, whereas in a letter dated 22 May 1961 and thereafter, he completely changed his tune and was crying out loud for vengeance - `. . . Prosecute him. . Don`t make any further delay. What he has done it was beyond limit. No one has done like him before. He is not afraid of God nor the people around him. . . .`.
These letters certainly go towards showing that Syed Eidrus did not know that his properties had been mortgaged until May 1961. If he had, it is extremely doubtful whether he would have asked PW7 to convey his regards to PW6.
From May 1961 until his death on 15 July 1961, Syed Eidrus wrote a series of letters in which his main concern was to ensure that the wrong that had been done to him was righted. I have little doubt that the state of shock induced by these revelations to the sickly man that he was in May 1961, accelerated his death which followed.
It is no doubt true that, as Mr O`Connor contended, there is a gap of about eight months between the last letter dated 23 September 1960 from Syed Eidrus (exh P28 page 62) and his next letter dated 22 May 1961 (exh P28 page 65) apart from receipts for certain prescriptions dated 7 November 1960 which are unexplained.
In view of the opinion I have formed of PW7`s veracity, despite the low calibre of his intelligence, and also partly because of the latter quality, I see no reason why I should conclude either that letters between these two dates have been suppressed by PW7 so as to hide the truth or that Syed Eidrus knew from PW6 or otherwise before 22 May 1961 that his properties had been mortgaged. PW7 said that, although he had been told by PW6 to stop collecting rents on these properties in August or September 1960, because the properties had been sold on the instructions of Syed Eidrus, he did not know, at that time, that the properties had previously been mortgaged. He admitted being afraid of asking PW6 why various properties were being sold as PW6 was his uncle and an older man in whom he had complete faith and of whom he stood in awe.
I, therefore, accept his evidence that he did not inform Syed Eidrus about the sale of these properties because he considered it to be none of his business. For one thing he trusted PW6 and secondly, he knew that Syed Eidrus also trusted PW6 implicitly. In fact he had done so for several decades.
Indeed, the fact that it took PW7 some considerable time to discover that his own wife`s properties had been mortgaged strongly supports the view that he did not discover the true facts relating to the properties of Syed Eidrus until after he had discovered the fraud on his wife and because of it. If it had not been for this discovery he may well have continued to remain sublimely ignorant of any of the frauds committed by PW6. Indeed, if it had not been for this fortuitous miscalculation of the odds of discovery (which criminals fortunately evince in their foolhardy haste to advance their nefarious interests) PW6 may well have deluded owners of properties managed by his firm for many more years. It was the fraud perpetrated on his partner`s wife which hastened the discovery of all his other frauds. To this limited extent, therefore, owners of properties managed by the firm may owe a debt of gratitude to PW7, however slow and unsuspecting he may have earlier been and, I suppose, one must be thankful that he did not continue to remain, like Rip van Winkle, in a deep stupor for a hundred years.
The next issue to be determined is issue No 7. Was PW6 acting within the scope of his authority, real or apparent, as the agent of Syed Eidrus when he executed the mortgage in favour of the first defendants and, if so, was the mortgage, therefore, valid and effective?
On this issue I am in entire concurrence with the views expressed by Ambrose J in 
 Sheriffa Shaikhah v 
 
 Ban Hoe Seng & Co Ltd 
 
 
 [1963] MLJ 243 
 where the defendant in that case raised the same question. The plaintiff was PW7`s wife to whom I have already referred. Her title deeds were in the possession of PW6 who mortgaged the properties concerned with the aid of a forged power. In his judgment Ambrose J said: 
 
I had to consider whether Syed Abdulrahman had actual or ostensible authority to mortgage the plaintiff`s properties. It was clear that he had no actual authority to do so. His actual authority was limited to collecting rents, paying rates and assessments and attending to repairs. The next point I had to consider was this: did he have any ostensible authority to mortgage the plaintiff`s properties? He was an estate agent and he had possession of the title deeds. I rejected the suggestion in the defendant`s pleading that these two facts amounted to a representation that Syed Abdulrahman had authority to deal with the plaintiff`s properties, and that they gave rise to such a presumption; for possession of title deeds might imply nothing more than a keeping for safe custody. I took the view that the authority given to estate agents by their principals varies. It seemed to me, therefore, that Syed Abdulrahman had no ostensible authority to mortgage the plaintiff`s properties. In my judgment, anyone whom he approached for a loan on the security of a mortgage of the plaintiff`s properties would be put on inquiry to ascertain whether or not he had actual authority to mortgage the properties. To my mind it appeared that the defendant relied on the actual authority contained in the forged power of attorney and not on the alleged ostensible authority of an estate agent in possession of title deeds.
 
 
 
The answer to the question raised in issue No 7 is, therefore, in the negative. As their Lordships in the Privy Council case of the 
 A-G for Ceylon v 
 
 AD SiIva 
[1953] AC 479 said: 
 
All `ostensible` authority involves a representation by the principal as to the extent of the agent`s authority. No representation by the agent as to the extent of his authority can amount to a `holding out` by the principal.
 
 
 
I now turn to a consideration of issues Nos 8 and 9 relating to the delay in 
 disclosing the forgery 
to the first defendants and negligence on the part of Syed Eidrus in entrusting his title deeds to the firm.
It may be convenient to take issue No 9 first on the 
 question of negligence. 
The following cases in chronological order set out the principles to be applied in determining whether negligence will defeat a claim for avoidance of forged transfers.
In 
 Bank of Ireland v 
 
 Evan`s Trustees 
 (1885) 5 HL Cas 389; 10 ER 950, (I now quote from the headnote): 
 
Trustees of a charity in Dublin incorporated by Act of Parliament, and having a common seal, possessed stock in the public funds, which stock was in Ireland registered in the Bank of Ireland. 
 G
the secretary of the incorporated trustees, was allowed to have the seal in his possession. Five several powers of attorney prepared in different years, sealed with the seal of the incorporated trustees the due affixing of which seal was attested by witnesses, who (though without any fraudulent intention) attested what was not true, since the seal was affixed by the unauthorised act of the secretary alone, were presented to the bank, and the stock was transferred. The facts were afterwards discovered, and 
 G
the secretary, was indicted and convicted. By a power of attorney duly executed, the trustees then authorised 
 C
to transfer the stock, but the bank refused to make the transfer. An action was brought by the trustees on this refusal; the judge who tried the cause, told the jury that if under these circumstances the trustees had so negligently conducted themselves, as to contribute to the loss, the verdict must be given for the bank. On exceptions for this direction: 
 Held,
that it was wrong.
 
 
 
The Lord Chancellor held, at p 960, that the trial judge was wrong because 
 
The direction of the very learned judge who tried the case was clearly not warranted by law. The direction was that if the transfer was caused by such negligence on the part of the trustees as that of which evidence has been given, then that the bank was absolved.
 
 
 
I apprehend that there is no such principle of law. I think it has been fairly put, that there must be either something that amounts to an estoppel, or something that amounts to a ratification in order to make the negligence a good answer`.
 Re Cooper 
 (1881-82) 20 Ch D 611 it was held that a son who executed mortgaged deeds by personating his father had committed forgery thereof and that nothing passed to the mortgagees. As Lindley LJ said at p 634: 
 
There is only one other point to which I will allude, and it is this. It is said, and with some truth, that the plaintiffs were guilty of negligence in not registering the will, and no doubt in one sense it is the non-registration of the will which has led to this unfortunate fraud. But are they in point of law responsible for that? It appears to me that they are not, and this conclusion is amply covered by authority. The fraud and the loss to the mortgagees is not sufficiently the proximate result of the plaintiffs` negligence to make them in law responsible for it. A crime intervened - the forgery; and, although they were negligent in not regestering the will, that negligence was not the proximate cause of the forgery and still less the proximate cause of the fraud which was the result of the forgery. This point has been discussed more than once, and without referring at length to the authorities which dispose of it, I will mention the names of some of them to show that I am not speaking without consideration. The matter was much considered in the case of 
 Bank of Ireland v
 
 Trustees of Evans` Charities,
and also in 
 Baxendale v
 
 Bennett,
and in 
 Johnston`s Claim.
In all those cases and I believe there are others, there had been negligence. That negligence had been followed by a crime - forgery or theft, or something of the kind - which had resulted in loss; and yet it was held that the fraud and the consequent loss were not sufficiently the proximate result of the negligence to make the negligent persons responsible for it.
 
 
 
In 
 The Mayor, Constables, and Company of Merchants of the Staple of England v 
 
 The Governor and Company of the Bank of England 
(1888) 21 QBD 160
 the headnote reads as follows: 
 
The plaintiffs, a corporated body, left their seal in the custody of their clerk, who, without authority, affixed it to powers of attorney, under which certain stock in the public funds, the property of the plaintiffs, was sold. The clerk appropriated the proceeds. In an action in which the plaintiffs claimed that they were entitled to the stock on the ground that it had been transferred without their authority by the defendants:-
 
 
 
 
 
 Held 
 
, on the authority of The 
 Bank of Ireland v Trustees of Evans` Charities, 
 that assuming the plaintiffs had been negligent their negligence was not the proximate cause of the loss, and did not disentitle them from recovering in the action.
As Bowen LJ said at p 176: 
 
Now here can it be said that the negligence, if it was negligence, of the plaintiff company was the proximate cause of the transfer? It seems to me that we must answer that there were no grounds upon which the jury could think that it directly led to the transfer. Mr Drew was a person of position and of reputation; he was a man who might be trusted, to outward appearances, as much as any man in the country, and even if it was careless for the corporation to leave their seal with him, was it a direct and immediate consequence of that carelessness that he would commit the forgery he committed in the power of attorney, and that the bank would be induced by that to transfer the stock? It seems to me here that the proximate cause was the felony and crime of Drew, and that it cannot be said that the felony was itself either the natural or likely or necessary or direct consequence of the carelessness of the plaintiffs.
 
 
 
Finally on the issue of negligence I would refer to the Malayan case of 
 Choo Loong v 
 
 Lip Kwai Kow 
(1930) 7 FMSLR 213 where the headnote reads: 
 
The plaintiff, a woman unable to read or write English, became the registered proprietor of the premises known as No 5, Main Street, Klang, by purchasing them from 
 L
on 2 March 1929. On 1 December 1929 
 L
by a trick, obtained the plaintiff`s grant and charged the premises to the defendant two days later.
 
 
 
Early in August 1930 
 L 
who, up to this time was a person of good repute, absconded, and the plaintiff then became aware of the charge. Between December 1929 and August 1930 plaintiff met 
 L 
six times on three of which she reminded him about her grant.
After 
 L 
had absconded, the plaintiff brought this action for a declaration that the charge in favour of the defendant was a forgery and for an order that the registering authority should cancel the registration of the charge.
The defendant argued that the plaintiff was estopped from denying her execution of the charge on the following grounds: 
 
(1) Plaintiff had been negligent in giving her grant to 
 L
whereby 
 L
was enabled to carry out the fraud.
 
 
 
 
(2) Plaintiff had been negligent in not inquiring earlier and more persistently for the return of her grant.
  
 
 
 
 
 Held 
 
, that the conduct of the plaintiff in handing over her grant to 
 L 
did not amount to negligence, and even if it did, it was not the proximate or real cause of the defendant`s loss.
 Held further 
, that the conduct of the plaintiff between December 1929 and August 1930 was not negligent, and since nothing had happened which imposed on the plaintiff any duty towards the defendant to inquire for the grant the plea of estoppel for that period failed.
It is clear from these cases that mere negligence will not suffice to defeat the plaintiff`s claim but that the defendants must prove that that negligence was the proximate or real cause of the fraudulent transfer.
As Lord Herschell LC said in 
 Brocklesby v 
 
 Temperance Building Society 
 [1895] AC 180: 
 
There can be no doubt that the mere possession of deeds of title, although that possession has been lawfully acquired from the real owner of them, will not of itself validate a security given by the person to whom the possession of the deeds has been committed where there was no authority given to him to use the deeds as security. That is old law, and was distinctly laid down in the case of 
 Martinez v Cooper.
It is only if there has been on the part of the person who trusts the other with the deeds either fraud, or, as it has been sometimes said, such negligence as to be evidence of fraud, that the permitted possession of the deeds of another will validate a security given without the authority of the owner of the deeds.
 
 
 
I now turn to the facts of the present case. Applying the principles which emerge from the cases I have cited, I find that the conduct of Syed Eidrus in entrusting his title deeds to the firm was neither fraudulent nor such negligent conduct as to be evidence of fraud. He had entrusted his title deeds to the firm for a period of more than thirty years during which period he had had no cause for concern over their safety or that they would be likely to be put to any improper use. I, therefore, find that he was not negligent at all. Even if he was (which, of course, I do not find) such negligence was not the proximate or real cause of the fraud. The answer to issue No 9 is, therefore, also in the negative.
Last of all, I turn to issue No 8. It seems to me that the answer to this issue must also be in the negative. Undoubtedly there was some delay in disclosing the forgery of the power to the first defendants, namely, between May 1961 and March 1962 but I do not think that this delay has materially prejudiced the first defendants or otherwise conduced towards their suffering such detriment in obtaining restitution from PW 6 as would give rise to estoppel. The plaintiff is, therefore, not estopped from alleging that the forgeries are nullities.
In 
 Fung Kai Sun v 
 
 Chan Fui Hing 
 
[1951] AC 489
 the facts and decision appear in the headnote as follows: 
 
The manager of certain real property belonging to the respondents fraudulently mortgaged it by means of forged mortgages to the appellant, whose first intimation that the mortgages were alleged to be forged was the service of the writ by the respondents in their action against him for a declaration that the mortgages were null and void and should be set aside. There had been no contractual or other relationship between the respondents and the appellant and the former, after they became aware of the forgery, had, for their own purposes, delayed for about three weeks - until the issue of the writ - before informing the appellant of the forgery. By his defence the appellant alleged, inter alia, that the respondents` silence had deprived him of any opportunity of obtaining restitution from the forger, and he claimed that they were therefore estopped from saying that the deeds were not executed by them.
 
 
 
 
 
 Held 
 
 , that the respondents were not entitled to withhold from the appellant information that his mortgages were forgeries, and that when they chose to do so they took the risk that they would later be estopped from asserting that the deeds were forged if by reason of their keeping silent the appellant had suffered detriment. The true test was whether the appellant`s chance of recovering from the forger had been materially prejudiced by the delay. In the circumstances of the present case, however, the appellant had failed to establish that he had suffered such detriment by reason of the delay as would give rise to estoppel.
Lord Reid, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said at p 500: 
 
`... it was argued for the appellant that the respondents had a duty to inform the appellant immediately they discovered the forgery, that if the appellant had been told in time he might have taken some action against the forger while he could still be found in Hong Kong, and that the respondents` delay in fulfilling their duty, having deprived the appellant of an opportunity to take action against the forger while he could still be found, must result in the respondents being now estopped from pleading the forgery against the appellant. This argument raises two questions; first, whether the respondents had any duty to inform the appellant of the forgery, and, secondly, if they had such a duty, whether their delay in informing him caused detriment to him so that they are now estopped from asserting against him that the deeds are forged. . . .
 
 
 
It was argued for the respondents that they were under no duty to volunteer information to the appellant, and that, as they never said or did anything which misled the appellant, they cannot now be prevented by mere delay from asserting the truth about the deeds. It was said that as there was no contractual or other relationship between the respondents and the appellant there could be no duty to volunteer information. It is quite true that there was no duty in the sense that failure to perform it would be a tort or a ground for an action of damages. But it is well established that silence can in some cases give rise to estoppel without there having been a duty in that sense: one example is given by Lord Cranworth LC in 
 Ramsden v 
 
 Dyson: 
`If a stranger begins to build my land supposing it to be his own, and I, perceiving his mistake, abstain from setting him right, and leave him to persevere in his error, a court of equity would not allow me afterwards to assert my title to the land on which he had expended money on the supposition that the land was his own. It considers that, when I saw the mistake into which he had fallen, it was my duty to be active and to state my adverse title; and that it would be dishonest in me to remain wilfully passive on such an occasion in order afterwards to profit by the mistake which I might have prevented.
The question in this case is whether any duty of that kind arises when a person learns that another person is holding and relying on a forged deed which bears to be signed by him. It is unnecessary to enter on any general consideration of the basis of this kind of duty because there is cogent authority in favour of there being a duty of this kind on a person who becomes aware that another person holds a forged deed which purports to be signed by him, and there does not appear to be any direct authority to the contrary effect ...
In their Lordships` judgment it must be held that the respondents were not entitled to withhold from the appellant information that the appellant`s mortgages were forgeries, and that when they chose to do so they took the risk that they would later be estopped from asserting that these deeds were forged if by reason of their keeping silent the appellant suffered detriment. ...
In their Lordships` judgment this is the true test: the chance of recovering must have been materially prejudiced by the delay. In the present case their Lordships are of opinion that the appellant has not shown that he was materially prejudiced by the delay. The appellant took no action when he was told of the forgery, and he did not give evidence in this case. In the absence of any explanation from him, and the whole trend of the evidence being to show that he would not have taken any action even if he had been told of the forgery earlier, their Lordships are not prepared to assume that he might have done so, and it is only on that assumption that he can have suffered any possible prejudice by the delay. Their Lordships therefore hold that no estoppel arises from the respondents having delayed to inform the appellant that his mortgages were forged.
Although PW6 (Syed Abdulrahman bin Abdullah Alsagoff) was not adjudicated a bankrupt until 29 September 1961 his act of bankruptcy was committed on 17 May 1961. By virtue of s 46 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance (Cap 11) his bankruptcy is deemed to relate back to and commence at the time of the act of bankruptcy. Since the fraud was not discovered till May 1961 when the act of bankruptcy occurred, even if the defendants had been notified of the alleged forgery in May 1961 they could never have successfully pursued their remedies against the bankrupt then. It should also be noted that s 51 of the Bankruptcy Ordinance avoids certain voluntary settlements made by the bankrupt prior to his bankruptcy. As Mr Mallal put it, if anything had been recovered it would have had to be returned.
It should also be remembered that police investigations, which had commenced in May 1961 were not completed until after some time and that the bankrupt was only finally convicted in March 1962. It should also be borne in mind that civil proceedings would ordinarily await the conclusion of criminal proceedings founded on the same facts.
It is always a difficult task to decide which one of two innocent parties should suffer, but I have no choice, having regard to the state of the law as it stands and having regard to the facts of the particular case as found by me.
I have, therefore, no alternative but to deliver judgment in favour of the plaintiff as claimed with costs and to extend my sympathies to the defendants for the unhappy position in which they now find themselves.

Whether sentence manifestly inadequate
 
The appellant was originally charged with having committed criminal breach of trust of certain diesel engines, spare-parts and cash amounting to a little over $18,000 being the property of Cycle & Carriage Co Ltd between February and May 1964. This composite charge was amended into five charges at the end of the prosecution case dealing separately with criminal breach of trust of the proceeds of sale of the same diesel engines and with criminal breach of trust of the spare-parts respectively. The appellant declined to recall any witness and remained silent on being called upon to make his defence. He was convicted accordingly and had nothing to say in mitigation of sentence. He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment on the main charge relating to criminal breach of trust of a sum of $16,600 obtained on the sale of eight engines, and one month concurrently in respect of each of the spare-parts set out in the remaining four charges. These involved comparatively much smaller sums.
The appellant, in my view, was correctly convicted on these charges which were substantiated by the evidence which clearly showed that, whilst employed as sales representative of the firm in question, he utilised his position and authority therein to divert goods belonging to the firm to recipients falling outside the scope of his authority with considerable cunning and resourcefulness. In most cases he caused goods to be delivered against fictitious confirmation orders to persons other than those named therein and converted the proceeds thereof. In one case he purported to fulfil an order placed by a nonexistent firm. The scheme adopted by him appears to be so clearly premeditated in its flagrant abuse of the special confidence placed in him by the firm and his fellow-employees as to leave no room for doubt that he was never the victim of any sudden temptation nor is there any suggestion in the evidence that his employer or other members of the staff were either so negligent or inefficient in the performance of their duties as to invite the criticism that they either encouraged or facilitated these offences by reason thereof.
In other words I can find no mitigating circumstances in the appellant`s favour apart from the fact that this is the first time he has been convicted.
Even taking the latter into consideration I still consider that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate having regard to the degree of cool and calculated, if not brazen, resolution revealed in the perpetration of these frauds which were spread over a period of about four months in circumstances where he must have known that they would sooner or later be discovered. Luckily for the firm and unluckily for him his fraud came to light much earlier than he probably expected. The fact remains that meantime he had caused a loss to the firm of over $18,000. Whilst the quantum of loss does not necessarily determine the degree of culpability involved I must take into consideration the factors to which I have referred relating to the state of mind with which and the period during which the offences were committed. The fact of earlier discovery than perhaps expected does not mitigate at all nor has the appellant advanced any mitigating factor or plea for leniency based on any ground worthy of consideration.
The conviction is therefore affirmed and the appeal in this connection dismissed. He has abandoned his appeal against sentence but the public prosecutor has cross-appealed against sentence.
The appeal against conviction is dismissed but the public prosecutor succeeds on his appeal. I vary the sentence to one of one year`s imprisonment on the first charge. The sentences on the remaining charges will remain, to run concurrently with the sentence on the first.

The appellant was convicted on 18 May 1965 of the murder of one Jenny Cheok Cheng Kid (hereinafter referred to as Jenny) and was sentenced to death. He now appeals against that conviction.
According to the prosecution the offence was committed on 27 August 1963 at about 5pm at sea near two islands called Pulau Dua which are also known as the Sisters Islands. The appellant had hired a sampan from a boatman called Yusof and on his directions Yusof had taken both the appellant and Jenny to a place between the two islands where he dropped anchor. The appellant stated in evidence that his object in going there was to collect corals and that Jenny was to assist him in doing so. According to the prosecution this was only the ostensible reason for going there; the appellant`s real intention was to murder Jenny and in pursuance of that intention he assisted Jenny to put on the diving equipment which had been brought in the sampan and allowed her, a novice diver, to go down alone, wearing a flipper which had previously been cut, into waters which he knew were dangerous and hazardous with the result that she met her death.
The evidence relied upon by the prosecution was wholly circumstantial. For that reason it is relevant to set out the more important facts and circumstances which the jury were in a position to find, if they decided to do so, from the evidence. These facts and circumstances were as follows:
 
 
(1) The appellant had been made a bankrupt in October 1962 and was still a bankrupt on 27 August 1963, being the day on which the offence was alleged to have been committed. He was in need of money and that could be a motive for the crime. 
 
(2) On 27 August 1963 Jenny was insured against accidents with several insurance companies, the total sum being $450,000. 
 
(3) One of the insurance policies under which Jenny was insured for the sum of $150,000 had lapsed on 26 August 1963 but was renewed by the appellant on the morning of 27 August 1963 for another five days. The appellant, however, did not renew or extend his own insurance policy which had been taken out at the same time. 
 
(4) Another one of these insurance policies, which was for the sum of $100,000, was due to expire on 28 August 1963. 
 
(5) The beneficiary named in some of the policies was the appellant`s mother. In the case of the other policies the benefit was to go to Jenny`s estate. 
 
(6) Jenny, who was 22 years of age and was a bar waitress earning $90 per month and about $10 in tips per day when she worked, made a will on 7 August 1963 in which the appellant`s mother was named as the sole beneficiary. The appellant accompanied Jenny to the solicitor`s office when instructions for the preparation of the will were given to the solicitor. 
 
(7) Jenny had only a little experience of what is called scuba diving and might fairly be described as a novice scuba diver. This was known to the appellant, although he claimed that she had made good progress under his tuition. 
 
(8) On 27 August 1963 the appellant allowed Jenny to go down into the waters near Pulau Dua alone. According to an expert witness, it was not safe for a novice to scuba dive alone. 
 
(9) The waters near Pulau Dua were dangerous and hazardous. The appellant had dived in these waters on previous occasions and was in a position to know this. 
 
(10) The appellant did not go down into the water himself even after Jenny had failed to come to the surface. 
 
(11) Jenny did not wear gloves when she went down into the water. This could be inferred, if the jury decided to do so, from the fact that the two pairs of gloves which had been brought by the appellant on that occasion were still in his swimming-bag. Gloves were usually worn when looking for corals in order to prevent the hands and fingers from being cut. It was of course for the jury to decide whether the gloves produced in court were the very same gloves which were in the appellant`s swimming-bag on 27 August 1963. The jury were in a position to observe that the appellant was unable to explain why there should be two pairs of gloves in the swimming-bag after Jenny had disappeared. It was open to the jury to reach the conclusion that the appellant did not really intend to look for corals that day. 
 
(12) One of the flippers worn by Jenny that day was found on 3 September 1963 at a depth of about 45 feet not very far from the place where she had gone into the water. The heel strap was severed and on examination it was found that the strap had been cut in two places by a knife or sharp instrument. There was no direct evidence to show who had cut the strap but it was open to the jury, if they decided to do so, to find that it was the appellant who had cut it. It was stated by an expert witness that if a diver suddenly loses one of his flippers whilst scuba diving, his equilibrium would be upset, his mobility impaired and it might well lead to panic in the case of an inexperienced diver. 
 
(13) The conduct of the appellant after the disappearance of Jenny was described by Yusof and other witnesses. It was open to the jury to find that there was a lack of urgency in the conduct of the appellant at the relevant time. 
 
(14) Less than 24 hours after the disappearance of Jenny, the appellant made formal claims on the three insurance companies which had issued policies covering her against accidents.
  
 
 
It is convenient at this stage to refer to the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to direct the jury on a possible verdict of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Having regard to the facts and circumstances which it was open to the jury to find, we are of opinion that in this particular case, it was not necessary to give that direction to the jury. The case was one in which the appellant was either guilty of murder or not guilty of any offence whatsoever.
Counsel for the appellant contended that the learned trial judge erred in law in permitting the prosecution to abuse the provisions of s 192(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code by adducing the evidence of witnesses who had not been called at the preliminary enquiry after giving only a few minutes` notice of the intention to call such witnesses. It is to be observed that no time limit is prescribed by s 192(3). There was therefore a technical compliance with the provisions of s 192(3) and the prosecution were at liberty to call these witnesses. In so deciding, however, we would express the view that every effort should be made by the prosecution to serve the necessary notices and documents as soon as possible after it is known that a person who has not given evidence at a preliminary enquiry has to be called as a witness for the prosecution. If this is not done it may become necessary to suggest an amendment of the provisions of s 192(3).
It was contended by counsel for the appellant that the learned trial judge erred in law in permitting the prosecution to adduce evidence of attempts to suborn the witness Yusof. On this point it is important to observe that no objection was raised by counsel for the appellant at the trial when Yusof was being questioned by counsel for the prosecution as to his conversations with the appellant`s brother Richard Ang and the appellant`s mother. It can be inferred from the evidence that Richard Ang and the appellant`s mother approached Yusof because counsel for the appellant wished to take a statement from him. Indeed, counsel for the appellant stated during the trial that he had been informed of an attempt to interfere with Yusof and he therefore thought that one way to ensure things, as he put it, was to have a statement recorded from Yusof. In fact Yusof called at his office and made a statement to counsel for the appellant in the presence of another advocate and solicitor. At one stage of the trial counsel for the appellant stated that he certainly wanted the evidence in. He was concerned to explain what he had done and why he had acted as he did. In our view, he should not now complain that the evidence was admitted.
It is relevant to observe that Yusof stated that none of the three persons concerned, that is to say, Richard Ang, the appellant`s mother and counsel for the appellant asked him at any time to change his story.
Another ground of appeal put forward by counsel for the appellant was that the learned trial judge cast unnecessary and unwarranted aspersions on his conduct with the result that the appellant`s case was prejudiced. In considering this matter it should be noted that during the trial itself and while the question of counsel`s conduct was being discussed, the learned trial judge, who no doubt had already expressed himself in strong terms on the point, stated more than once that he accepted counsel`s explanation. He also promised to deal with the matter in the summing-up. This promise was kept, as can be seen from the following passage in the summing-up: 
 
Now, there are one or two matters that I want to clear up right away. The first is in fulfilment of a promise I made to Mr Coomaraswamy during the trial. You will recollect the incident - that I queried the propriety and the wisdom of his interviewing the key witness for the prosecution, the boatman, after the accused had been charged with this offence.
 
 
 
Now, as you have heard me say, I accepted Mr Coomaraswamy`s explanation, in that, according to his lights at any rate, he did what he thought was proper in the interests of his client. So that as far as that incident is concerned you will dismiss it completely from your minds.
You will remember the boatman`s evidence that, he said, he never changed his story, nor did anyone ever ask him to do so. And so with that comment, gentlemen of the jury, you will dismiss that incident from your mind entirely.
In our opinion, having regard to the passage which has just been read, this ground of appeal fails.
It was contended by counsel for the appellant that his client was throughout the trial subject to such prejudice that he could not in the circumstances be said to have had a fair trial. Counsel for the appellant also submitted that the learned trial judge in his summing-up was so biased against the appellant that the appellant could not be said to have had a fair trial. Of the numerous examples of so-called bias which were brought to our attention it must be said that a good number were quite trivial. In one instance, however, it is clear that the learned trial judge was in error when he stated in his summing-up that both the appellant and the witness Henderson used an improvised washer during demonstrations in court. In fact it was Henderson who used the improvised washer while the appellant used a new `Healthway` washer in the course of another demonstration. In our view, this was a slip, of no great consequence, made in the course of a lengthy trial and is no indication of bias on the part of the learned trial judge.
It is true that the learned trial judge expressed himself with great emphasis and in strong terms on various matters. But the jury were left in no doubt that they were the sole judges of the facts in the case. This is what the learned trial judge said in his summing-up to the jury: 
 
The facts of the case, on the other hand, are your responsibility. You are the sole judges of the facts in this case. If, during the course of this summing-up, I express or appear to express my own opinions on the facts, while you will of course consider them, if upon consideration you find yourselves unable to agree with them, then it is your bounden duty to disregard what I say. You and you alone are the ultimate judges of the facts. Your duty is to find what the facts are from the evidence which has been called and presented to you from the witness box. Then you apply to those facts the law as I have directed you.
 
 
 
It may be said that this direction was given at an early stage of the summing-up. However, the jury were reminded repeatedly throughout the summing-up that matters of fact were for them to decide. In our view, there is no real substance in these two grounds of appeal.
It was also contended that the learned trial judge erred in law in failing adequately to direct the jury on the danger of convicting an accused person upon circumstantial evidence. There are two passages in the summing-up which are relevant in this connection. The first passage, which comes after the direction in which the learned trial judge deals with what he refers to as the first question of the cumulative effect of circumstantial evidence, is as follows: 
 
The second question to which I must draw your attention is that the question in this case, depending as it does on circumstantial evidence, is whether the cumulative effect of all the evidence leads you to the irresistible conclusion that it was the accused who committed this crime. Or is there some reasonably possible explanation such, for example - `Was it an accident?`.
 
 
 
The second passage is as follows: 
 
Now, as I told you earlier on, one of the points about circumstantial evidence is its cumulative effect. Any one of these points taken alone might, you may think, be capable of explanation. The question for you is: where does the totality of them, the total effect of them, all lead you to? Adding them together, considering them, not merely each one in itself, but altogether, does it or does it not lead you to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed this crime? Or in there some other reasonably possible explanation of those facts?
 
 
 
The prosecution case is that the effect of all this evidence drives you inevitably and inexorably to the one conclusion and one conclusion only: that it was the accused who intentionally caused the death of this young girl.
In our opinion, these directions are perfectly adequate in a case where the prosecution are relying on circumstantial evidence.
There are other grounds of appeal on which the appellant relied and which were discussed during the argument before this court. In our opinion there is no substance in any of them.
Although Jenny`s body has never been found, there is overwhelming evidence on the record that the appellant murdered her. In our judgment no miscarriage of justice has occurred in this case.
The appeal is dismissed.

In this suit, the plaintiff claims a declaration that he is the tenant of the defendant in respect of a part of house No 3 Evelyn Road, Singapore, a mandatory order, two injunctions and damages for (1) breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment, (2) nuisance, and (3) negligence.
The house is a bungalow, with the floor raised above the ground and supported by pillars. It is built on a slope, and the floor is about seven feet above the ground at the front but touches the ground at the rear. Under the front portion of the floor is a basement consisting of two rooms with a hall between them. These two rooms have a ceiling six ft nine ins high and were built for use as a store-room and not for human habitation.
The defendant purchased the premises during the Japanese occupation of Malaya. After the liberation, he let them out at a rent of $85pm to one Sim Beng Tee, who was to repair and keep them under proper repair.
In November 1957 Sim Beng Tee let one of the rooms in the basement to the plaintiff at $50 per mensem for use in connection with the plaintiff`s business.
Sim Beng Tee died on 14 May 1958. His widow, Ng Meow Keng, was accepted as a tenant by the defendant upon the same terms as applied to him.
In December 1961 the widow agreed to give up vacant possession of the whole premises to the defendant in consideration of his paying her $6,000. The defendant deposited this sum with his solicitors, which was to be paid to her when she gave vacant possession of the whole premises. On 11 September 1961 she and her family removed from the premises; but the plaintiff refused to move out and proceeded to occupy the whole basement.
When Ng Meow Keng removed from the premises, the defendant refused to accept the plaintiff as a tenant and to accept rent from him.
The premises are 60 to 70 years old and have fallen into considerable disrepair. The roof has caved in several places and the ceiling has collapsed. Rain water falls on to the floor and through the floor, into the basement. The floor boards are in a terrible condition, and the whole roof, the whole floor, all the floor beams and all the joists have to be changed. In the words of the architect called by the plaintiff, `all that can be used are the pillars and the walls. There is not a piece of wood worth retaining. That is why it would cost $20,000 to $25,000 to repair the house`.
The city council took proceedings against the defendant in 1960 under the Local Government Ordinance for abatement of nuisance, and an abatement order was made by a magistrate`s court requiring the defendant to carry out certain repairs to the premises. This order has not been complied with by the defendant on the ground that the premises are not worth repairing and that it is not economical to carry out the repairs.
The plaintiff alleges that as a result of the failure to carry out the repairs mentioned in the abatement order, the defendant has caused him annoyance, discomfort, loss and damage.
The defendant`s case is that he owes no duty whatsoever to the plaintiff in connection with the premises and that the plaintiff has no right of action against him.
The premises come within the purview of the Control of Rent Ordinance. The first question that falls to be decided is whether or not the plaintiff is the tenant of the defendant. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that when Sim Beng Tee died, his widow became a statutory tenant, and when she removed from the premises, the plaintiff became a statutory tenant of the defendant. Counsel for the defendant, on the other hand, made this submission: the widow was granted a new tenancy; she removed from the premises without giving up her tenancy; she remains a tenant of the defendant until she gives up vacant possession of the whole premises; it is immaterial that she has not paid rent to the defendant from the day she moved out; she is still the plaintiff`s landlord; and the plaintiff is not a tenant of the defendant.
In my view, the widow abandoned her tenancy when she removed from the premises, and ceased from then to be the landlord of the plaintiff. This is borne out by the fact that she never demanded rent from the plaintiff subsequently. In my opinion when she gave up her tenancy, the plaintiff became a statutory tenant of the defendant in respect of the room in the basement rented to him by Sim Beng Tee. This I find to be the room on one`s left as one faces the house from the front. I make a declaration accordingly.
The plaintiff`s second prayer is for a mandatory order that the defendant do forthwith carry out the repairs to the premises specified in the abatement order. In my opinion neglect to comply with an abatement order made under the Local Government Ordinance does not give an individual whose property may have been injured by such neglect a right to have the abatement order enforced. There is support for this view in 
 Robinson v 
 
 The Mayor and Corporation of the Burrough of Workington 
[1897] 1 QB 619
 where Lord Esher MR said at p 621: 
 
If it were not for the statute, there would be no duty on the defendants to do anything in the matter, and a default on their part is dealt with by a remedy provided by the same statute. I have no hesitation in saying that this is the only remedy which is available. It has been laid down for many years that, if a duty is imposed by a statute which but for the statute would not exist, and a remedy for default or breach of that duty is provided by the statute that creates the duty, that is the only remedy.
 
 
 
In my judgment the plaintiff is not entitled to the mandatory order that he seeks.
The plaintiff`s next prayer is for an injunction to restrain the defendant, his servants and agents from preventing the plaintiff, the members of his family, his servants and licensees from entering and occupying the said premises. There is no evidence before the court that the defendant or anybody on his behalf has prevented or attempted to prevent the plaintiff or members of his family, his servants and licensees from entering or occupying the premises. The plaintiff is therefore not entitled to the injunction that he seeks.
The next prayer of the plaintiff is for an injunction to restrain the defendant, his servants and agents from preventing the plaintiff, his servants agents licensees and the members of his family from re-entering the said premises when repairs have been effected if the plaintiff vacates the said premises for that purpose. There is no evidence before the court that the plaintiff is required to vacate the premises to enable repairs to be carried out. He is therefore not entitled to this injunction.
The plaintiff`s claim for damages is based on three heads of liability: (1) breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment (2) nuisance (3) negligence.
It is alleged that the defendant failed and neglected to carry out the necessary repairs to the premises and `large quantities of water had penetrated and flowed into the said premises and wetted and damaged the plaintiff`s goods. By reason thereof the plaintiff had been prevented from peacefully holding the said premises and the defendant is in breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment whereby the plaintiff has suffered loss and damage`.
In my judgment, there has been no breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment by the defendant`s omission to repair the premises because he is under no legal obligation to the plaintiff to do so. I would add that the defendant`s failure to comply with the abatement order does not constitute a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment.
In considering the plaintiff`s claim for damages for nuisance, it must be borne in mind that the liability of a landlord to his tenant usually depends on contract. It must also be borne in mind that the defendant is under no contractual duty to any one to repair the premises, for he expressly contracted with his tenant, Sim Beng Tee, that the latter should keep the premises under proper repair. It is settled law that a landlord is liable to third persons for the existence of a nuisance upon premises which are in the occupation of his tenant, where the nuisance arises during the tenancy from the dangerous state of the premises, only when he has contracted to repair, or he has expressly reserved the right to enter and repair, or he has an implied right to enter and repair; see 23 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (3rd Ed) p 570. In my opinion, a statutory tenant is not a third person, and this principle cannot be invoked by him even if it is conceded that when the widow, Ng Meow Keng, moved out, the defendant as landlord had an implied right to enter and repair the premises. In the circumstances the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant for damages for the tort of nuisance must fail.
I shall now deal with the claim for damages for negligence. Where the landlord is under no express or implied obligation to maintain or repair the demised premises, he is not liable in negligence or otherwise, either to his tenant or to any other person entering the premises during the term, for any defect in the premises rendering them dangerous or unfit for occupation even if he has constructed the defects himself or is aware of their existence: see 23 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (3rd Ed) p 572. In the present case, the defendant is under no express or implied obligation to maintain or repair the premises: he is therefore not liable in negligence to a statutory tenant for defects rendering the premises unfit for occupation even if he is aware of their existence. The plaintiff`s claim for damages for negligence therefore fails.
It is submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that when the tenant`s widow, Ng Meow Keng, removed from the premises, possession of that part of the premises which was occupied by her reverted to the defendant; that the defendant has since that day been in occupation and control of such part of the premises; and that as rain water flows or escapes from that part of the premises, which is now in the occupation and control of the defendant, into the basement, which is occupied by the plaintiff, the defendant is liable to the plaintiff in damages for (1) breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment, (2) nuisance and (3) negligence.
The law would appear to be that where the landlord retains possession of part of the premises, such as the roof or one floor of a building, his liability for injury to persons or property on the demised premises resulting from the nonrepair of that part depends, not upon any contractual obligation to repair, but upon negligence, the ordinary duty of an occupier of property to take reasonable care that his property does not become dangerous to adjoining property or to persons lawfully thereon. The House of Lords has held that for a landlord to be liable for negligence, he must be in actual possession of the premises and that constructive possession is not sufficient for this purpose: 
 Cavalier v 
 
 Pope 
 
[1906] AC 428
.
The evidence in this case does not support the plaintiff`s contention that the defendant is in occupation and control of that part of the premises which was formerly occupied by the widow, Ng Meow Keng. She vacated the premises three and a half years ago and the defendant has not occupied the part vacated by her. He refuses to do so on the ground that his agreement with the widow was that she would give vacant possession of the whole premises and until she does that he will not take possession of the premises. I hold that the defendant is not in actual occupation of any part of the premises. Under the circumstances I do not see how he could be held liable for negligence or nuisance or breach of covenant for quiet enjoyment.
There is one other aspect of this case to be considered. The motive for this action by a sub-tenant is to get the premises repaired by the owner who had expressly contracted with his tenant that the tenant would be responsible for all repairs. But for the Control of Rent Ordinance, the plaintiff would have been ejected from the premises some three and a half years ago. Is it fair and equitable that the owner of the premises should now repair it at a cost of $25,000 for the convenience of the plaintiff who cannot be compelled to pay a rent of more than $50 per mensem but who may apply to the Rent Conciliation Board to have the rent reduced? In my view, in the circumstances of this case, it would be most inequitable to compel the defendant to repair the premises at such great cost when the premises are in fact more suitable for demolition.
For the above reasons I dismiss the plaintiff`s claim, except insofar as it seeks a declaration. The plaintiff is ordered to pay to the defendant the costs of this action.

2929503,R v Handsaker [2016] NSWDC 304,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offender Tyson Handsaker is to be sentenced for two quite serious offences. In addition, on each of those offences, there are matters listed on a Form 1 and finally there is a matter on a s 166 certificate.
	
	
	The first offence, which appears on an indictment, is an offence of break, enter and steal. The offender, for reasons which I will discuss in a little while, decided that he would steal some firearms belonging to his father and grandfather. They were stored appropriately in locked cabinets in a rear shed at his grandfather’s premises. On 19 September 2015 the offender and his then partner a Ms Urli, went to visit the home of the offender’s grandfather. Clearly, as it turns out, this was part of a plan on behalf of the offender to do what he later did. After they left they went to get some bolt cutters, bought some padlocks and at 9.30 pm that day the offender went back to his grandfather’s house, travelling on his motorbike, with Ms Urli following him in her car. She stayed behind as the offender went to the rear shed of the premises, used the bolt cutters to cut the padlocks and took from the cabinets nine firearms. They all belonged to the offender’s father. Two of them were air rifles but the remaining firearms were much more lethal.
	
	
	After he had succeeded in gaining all of these weapons he went back to Ms Urli’s car and put the firearms on the rear seat. He told her he had borrowed them from his grandfather, but this of course was not true. They went back to where Mr Handsaker was living. He took the firearms from the vehicle and put them inside the bedroom. The following day the offender’s grandfather discovered what had happened and police were called.
	
	
	It was not long before the offender was identified as the person responsible. Indeed Ms Urli quite properly, on 22 September 2015, told police about what she knew about what the offender had done. Other evidence of a forensic nature confirmed the offender’s involvement, in particular police found a set of boots belonging to the offender where the tread pattern matched a tread pattern located at the scene of the crime.
	
	
	While the police were at the offender’s home they saw the offender and a man by the name of Ben Mathieson coming into the property and entering into the house. The offender had two firearms in his possession and as he decided to flee he gave them to Mr Mathieson. Mr Mathieson was arrested but the offender escaped. The two firearms found were both twenty twos. One of them was stolen from the grandfather’s premises but the second was not. Its provenance has never been ascertained. A short time later the offender was found hiding, arrested, refused to participate in an interview, was charged and bail refused.
	
	
	At this stage only one of the stolen firearms had been recovered but some months later, in late November 2013, the offender contacted his solicitor. His solicitor then told police that the property that was stolen was to be found in a vehicle parked at the offender’s home. Police went to that address and they found four firearms but if you do the maths it is clear that there are four rifles which have not been recovered.
	
	
	This is an offence of some seriousness. It hardly needs to be said, but I will say it, stealing firearms is much more serious than stealing a colour TV or an iPad. It is not so much the value of the property which is of concern but the lethality of the items stolen.
	
	
	The other offence is also serious because it strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system. After the offender was bail refused he began to correspond with Ms Urli. It will be remembered that she had told police about his involvement in the offence of break, enter and steal. It is clear that the offender was attempting to get Ms Urli to not give evidence against him. In his letter he tells her that her statement is the only evidence they have got on him, and that she should not be worried about police threats if she decides not to give evidence. He asks her to tell police that he did not take the ten guns.
	
	
	This was not just one letter either. Between 5 October and 6 November four further letters were written to Ms Urli in which he repeats his demand that she not go to court to give evidence against him. Another aspect of the letter was a threat of violence made by the offender in the context of his fear that Ms Urli might leave him for another man. Not surprisingly, as a result of receiving those letters Ms Urli felt scared and anxious. She therefore told police what had happened, told them that she had been receiving almost daily phone calls from him and she did not want to receive them anymore. So an interim apprehended domestic violence order was issued. Despite that, on 13 December 2015, a month and two days after the order was made, the offender telephoned Ms Urli. He had to use some subterfuge to do what he did. Again Ms Urli did the right thing. She told police about this telephone call and once again police became involved.
	
	
	So the offender is to be sentenced for these matters: break, enter and steal where the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment; doing an act with intent to influence the witness where the maximum penalty is also 14 years imprisonment; and possessing an unauthorised firearm where the maximum penalty is five years but because it is dealt with on a s 166 certificate the jurisdictional limit is two years. That firearm is the one which was not stolen from the grandfather’s premises but was found in the offender’s possession when he was arrested.
	
	
	For reasons I will get to, the offender claims that he did what he did by way of stealing his father’s firearms because he was angry at his father and wished to get back at him. There are some difficulties in accepting that that was the sole motivation for the offender’s actions. Perhaps the most important matter in this regard is the offender’s possession of the firearm which was not stolen from his grandfather’s premises. What was he doing with it? How did it come into his possession? We do not know because he has not given evidence and all we are left to do is to speculate. It does however suggest an involvement in firearms and a desire to become involved with firearms which goes beyond merely, as he told the psychologist, wanting to steal his father’s firearms, chop them up and return them to him in that form.
	
	
	Again if that was his motivation why are none of the firearms damaged? What happened to the ones which have not been recovered? It cannot be ignored, as the Crown submitted, that the offender was a drug user at the time, a significant drug user as well. It is possible, the Crown suggests, that he stole the firearms so that he could sell them to buy money for drugs. It is for the offender to satisfy me on the balance of probabilities that his motivation in stealing the firearms was simply to destroy them to get back at his father. I am not satisfied to that standard, that that is what motivated the offender, at least not solely. It may be that the desire to hurt his father was part of the motivation but I do not accept that he at any stage planned to destroy the firearms.
	
	
	The offender’s background was, as is almost invariably the case for people appearing for sentence in these courts, a troubled one. His parents separated when he was quite young and although the offender had a close relationship with his mother his behaviour was such that she found it difficult to control him. A problem arose when the offender’s mother formed a relationship with a man who became the offender’s stepfather. He was, so the offender told a psychologist, a violent man, often drunk and aggressive. The offender witnessed acts of domestic violence on a regular basis until finally the relationship between his mother and his stepfather ceased when Mr Handsaker was about 15 years of age.
	
	
	Not surprisingly whilst his stepfather was around the offender preferred to be outside the family environment which, at the age that he was when this happened, was clearly a factor in him becoming involved with some undesirable influences. The offender’s contact with his father after his parents separated was sporadic. At times he would visit his father but was disappointed at the way his father reacted to those visits. He did get on very well with a person with whom the offender’s father had formed a relationship. He described his stepmother to the psychologist as an important figure in his life. She had provided stability when he was staying with his father.
	
	
	The relationship between the offender’s father and the offender’s stepmother broke up due to the offender’s father’s unfaithfulness. It was this breakup which the offender took hard. So good was his relationship with his stepmother that he continued to visit her even after she had broken up with his father. During that time he learnt more about his father which made him even angrier towards him, and it was in this context that he said that his drug use increased and that he committed the break and enter and steal offence, as I have said repeatedly, he says to get back at his father.
	
	
	I mentioned the offender’s drug use. He began to consume alcohol around thirteen. He began to smoke cannabis at the age of fourteen and use methamphetamine from 18 years of age. Since going into custody Mr Krisenthal, who appears on his behalf, says that he has dried out and now is able to look rationally at what he has been doing and realise the error of his ways. Indeed Mr Krisenthal submits that the offender’s decision to get his solicitor to tell police where the firearms were located is part of the offender’s realisation and maturity as he gave up drug use. The Crown of course has a different submission. The Crown points out that he only told his solicitor to contact police after his attempts to get Ms Urli to withdraw statements she made to the police failed, and it was in those circumstances that he really had no alternative.
	
	
	It may be that the offender’s assistance to the authorities in order to get the firearms recovered was late and it may be that his motivation went beyond wanting to assist the authorities alone, and there was an element of self-interest involved. But it has to be recognised that it is better that he did what he did, which allowed four firearms to be recovered, than if he had not done it at all. Mr Krisenthal submits that the offender is entitled to a discount on his sentence to reflect that assistance to the authorities, and the Crown agrees. I will therefore take it into account. I do not propose to quantify it but it is a matter that I have taken into account in determining the sentence.
	
	
	It is also, I suppose, evidence of remorse, at least a step in the right direction. The offender could have hoped that the authorities would not discover the firearms and that they would be available to him on his release from custody. That he admitted where they were is, as I have said, a step in the right direction for the offender.
	
	
	At the time of these offences the offender was on s 9 bonds. It is important that I do not double count. The offender served a sentence of imprisonment after having been called up for breaching those bonds. It would be wrong for me to commence the sentence I will impose from the expiry of that sentence, and at the same time regard the fact that he was on conditional liberty as an aggravating factor. I will not do that. I will commence the sentence I will shortly announce on 22 November 2015, which is two months before that sentence expired.
	
	
	It is conceded that full-time custody is required. As I began these remarks on sentence the offender’s crimes were serious. They were certainly not spur of the moment decisions made and immediately regretted. There was planning involved in the break, enter and steal offence and the offender’s efforts to persuade his partner to not come to court to give evidence against him were ongoing. It is clear that general deterrence is of relevance for both offences, maybe not as much as would have otherwise been the case because of the matters referred to in the psychological report but general deterrence is still of importance in the sentence that I will impose upon the offender.
	
	
	The offender’s prospects for rehabilitation are uncertain. The offender has a history of criminal behaviour, including for break, enter and steal. Although whilst in custody his barrister tells me that he has not used drugs what will happen upon his release from custody is uncertain. I am told that he wishes to go to residential rehabilitation but whether he will or not remains to be seen.
	
	
	In these circumstances it is difficult, indeed impossible, to assess the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation. I will do however what I can to encourage it, both by imposing a term of imprisonment on the offender which should personally deter him from committing offences of this type in the future, but also by making a finding of special circumstances. The offender will be assisted by the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for an extended period upon his release from custody. If he does what he says he wants to do, that is give up drugs and return to a law-abiding lifestyle, then the opportunities will be available to him. If he does that then the community benefits. That is why I have made a finding of special circumstances in his favour, not as a favour to him but because of the beneficial effect that such extended period of parole should have for the community.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence. Were I not to have done so I would have imposed a sentence of 18 months for the possess unauthorised firearm matter on a s 166 certificate, and on each of the matters on the indictment a period of imprisonment of three and a half years. I should make it clear that I have allowed a discount of twenty five per cent for the offender’s pleas of guilty at the Local Court to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas. The aggregate sentence I will impose consists of a non-parole period of two and a half years with a head sentence of five years. The sentence will date from 22 November 2015. The non-parole period will expire on 21 May 2018, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. Of course those sentences did take into account the Form 1 matters on each of the matters on the indictment.

2929504,R v Connelly-Heap [2016] NSWDC 303,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: On rare occasions offenders who appear before me for sentence tell me that going to gaol has been a positive thing for them. This is one such example.
	
	
	The offender, Joshua Connelly-Heap, committed two offences of some seriousness at a time when he was using drugs and hanging around with the wrong crowd. When he committed an armed robbery offence he told me that he did not really care if he went to gaol and actually at the time thought there might be some benefit to it. He has now been in custody for some eight months. He tells me he has not used drugs. He tells me he has put on weight. Evidence suggests he has an offer of employment when he is released from custody and he plans to live with his father, who is present in court along with his mother and oldest brother.
	
	
	If Mr Connelly-Heap does what he says he is going to do, there are good prospects for his future. But many people say that they do not intend to use drugs again. Many people say they intend to take up an employment offer. And many people say they will live with their father and yet when the opportunity presents itself to do all of those things, they do not take it. I would like to know whether Mr Connelly-Heap is going to do what he says he is before I sentence him. I floated the idea with his lawyer, Ms Rostron, and the Crown as to whether it would be appropriate to release Mr Connelly-Heap on bail so that he can prove to me, if he is going to, that he is capable of rehabilitating himself, not just promising it.
	
	
	It has to be said that ultimately these were very serious crimes. Indeed one of them has a standard non-parole period of four years and the other has a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment with the R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R guideline suggesting that a sentence of somewhere around four years might be appropriate. So there is no guarantee that even if the offender does well I will not impose a custodial sentence. But it will be important in assessing, firstly, whether such a sentence is imposed and, secondly, the length of it, that I know what Mr Connelly-Heap is going to do once released from custody.
	
	
	Accordingly, I will grant him bail under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I will adjourn the matter to this court on October 31 at 9.30 am when I will sentence Mr Connelly-Heap.
	
	
	Conditions of his bail are as follows: he is to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service; he is to use no illegal drugs whatsoever; he is to undergo regular and random urinalysis in order to demonstrate whether or not he is compliant with the second condition of bail; he is to take up the offer of employment from E C Throsby Pty Ltd and he is to remain in that employment unless, through no fault of his own, he loses that job; if he does lose the job, he is to make consistent and substantial efforts to obtain further employment; he is to live with his father at an address known to the Court.. Are there any other conditions of bail you want, Ms Rostron or Madam Crown?
	
	
	HARRIS: No, thank you, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Righto. Now, let me speak to you. You have spent enough time in gaol to see those sad old people who reach the age of about 40, 45 and realise they have wasted their lives.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, I have.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Now, you might be one of those if you keep using drugs, mixing with the wrong crowd and committing offences. You will be the sort of person who turns about that age and thinks what a waste of my life so far, and then it is too late; too late, often, to have children, too late to form a new relationship. So what you have got to do between now and 31 October is demonstrate to me that you are not going to be that sort of person. You have got to not use drugs. You have got to keep that job. Do you understand that?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: If you do, you are going to do much better on 31 October than if you use drugs and you are unemployed. Do you understand?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: So it is up to you what is going to happen. Righto. And your father too. Thank you, I will see you on 31 October.
	
	
	I should order a pre-sentence report for that matter on the next occasion.
	
	
	ADJOURNED PART HEARD TO MONDAY 31 OCTOBER 2016 AT 9.30AM

2929675,R v Imbornone [2016] NSWDC 305,"SeNTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The aggregate sentence I am about to impose on Peter Imbornone is a long one. That is due to the seriousness of the offences he has committed, one offence in particular.
	
	
	There are, in fact, three sets of offences for which I must sentence Mr Imbornone. One is an offence of driving whilst disqualified. That comes before me because he breached a bond a magistrate put him on. He consents to me dealing with that matter.
	
	
	The second set of offences concerns offences committed on 29 September 2014. One was an offence of aggravated break enter and commit a serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence is detaining for advantage and the aggravating circumstance is that Mr Imbornone was in company. That carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of five years. About the same time he committed another offence on a separate victim. This was an offence of reckless wounding in company. It has a maximum penalty of 10 years with a standard non-parole period of four years.
	
	
	The third set of offences concern the same victim, a Todd Wrench. The offender pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and stealing from the person. The first of those carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and the second 14 years imprisonment.
	
	
	I take into account the maximum penalties and, where appropriate, the standard non-parole periods in determining the appropriate sentences to impose upon the offender. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period in either case appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	Before detailing what Mr Imbornone did I should note that to the offences carrying standard non-parole periods the offender pleaded guilty at an early opportunity and so the sentence I will announce for those matters is 25 per cent less than they would otherwise have been. To the offences involving Mr Wrench, the offender’s plea of guilty came later. The Crown suggests that the discount should be 10 per cent and Ms Court, who appears for the offender, did not challenge that. Accordingly, the sentences for those matters will be 10 per cent less than they would otherwise have been.
	
	
	What I am about to describe are offences of significant seriousness. I am referring here to the offences with standard non-parole periods.
	
	
	On 29 September 2014 a Ms Sarah Lewis was living with her partner, David Forbes, in a unit in Mayfield. At about 4 o’clock on that day Ms Lewis was leaving the unit. She closed the front door and was in the process of closing and locking the screen door when she was approached by two men. One of them was this offender, the other has not been identified.
	
	
	Ms Lewis did not recognise either of them but they knew her name. One said, “Sarah, we need to have a chat to you and Dave.” She was told, “We need you inside. We need to talk to you both about what is going on.” Ms Lewis was obviously concerned by this approach, she did not want to go inside with the men. She said, “Can we wait here or in the park?” She was told, “No, we need to do this inside.” Ms Lewis refused the men entry several more times.
	
	
	It was then that this offender pulled a metal pole from a canvas bag he was carrying and showed it to Ms Lewis. The co-offender pulled a knife from his pocket. The co-offender, the man with the knife, then said, “Let us in, open the door, Sarah.” Not surprisingly, Ms Lewis was very scared and started crying. She said, “Please don’t make me let you in. This is not my place. Please wait for David. Please don’t rape me.” There is no suggestion that the offenders wanted to rape Ms Lewis but her expressions of fear as to that being a possibility are, of course, genuine.
	
	
	As a result of the threats, Ms Lewis did open the door and let the men inside. She was scared to the point where she was shaking and asked repeatedly, “Are you going to hurt me?” By stage Mr Imbornone, this offender, was armed with a knife. It may have been the knife that was previously carried by his co-offender or it may have been another one. It does not really matter. The offender said, “We are not going to hurt you. We need to have a chat with you. We will wait for Dave.”
	
	
	It would not be surprising if Ms Lewis was not comforted by the words “We are not going to hurt you”. She had been threatened with weapons, she had been forced to take the men inside. The offender said, “You owe us some money, a thousand dollars.” Ms Lewis knew nothing about what the men were speaking about and said that she did not owe anyone any money.
	
	
	Ms Lewis wanted to ring her partner. She asked if she could use one of the offender’s mobile phones. The offender Mr Imbornone said that his phone was flat. Ms Lewis offered to charge his mobile phone using a charger that was in the unit. That was done and the offender dialled the number for Mr Forbes. This later provided a bit of evidence which inculpated the offender.
	
	
	Ms Lewis managed to speak with Mr Forbes over the telephone, asking him to come home immediately. After a short conversation the co-offender put a knife up to her throat and said, “Hang the phone up now.” The blade was actually touching the left side of her neck. She was told to sit back on the lounge. She wanted to escape, not surprisingly, and asked if she could get a drink or go to the toilet. She was told “No”, she could not.
	
	
	A short time later Mr Forbes returned home. He saw Ms Lewis crying hysterically. He saw the two offenders. The co-offender was holding a metal pole and Mr Imbornone was holding onto a knife. Mr Forbes said, “What are you guys, what is going on?” He was told, “We need to have a chat about some money that your girlfriend owes.” Mr Forbes said, “She doesn’t owe you anything. She’s been here for weeks. Who do you think you are being in my house? Get the fuck out.”
	
	
	He then picked up a baseball bat. He told the offender and his co-offender to get out. The co-offender swung the metal pole at Mr Forbes and lunged towards him. Mr Forbes was trying to avoid being hit and the offender came at Mr Forbes with a knife, thrusting the knife out towards him. During this commotion Ms Lewis was able to run to a neighbour’s unit and call for help.
	
	
	One of the important matters in assessing the objective gravity of the home invasion offence concerns the length of time that Ms Lewis was detained. It must have been significant. She must have been in terror for a significant period of time.
	
	
	After Ms Lewis ran away Mr Forbes also managed to get outside. He pushed the screen door closed, trying to keep the two offenders inside. But he soon let go because he realised he could be stabbed through the screen door. He then ran away with the two offenders chasing him. Mr Forbes managed to connect the baseball bat with one of them but the baseball bat broke. He was then unarmed and not really capable of defending himself. He was struck on the back of the head with the metal pole that was being wielded by the co-offender. He ran to the carport area of the unit block. He tried to take refuge in his boat. He grabbed hold of a ladder and tried to use it as a shield. The co-offender threw the metal pole at Mr Forbes, fortunately it did not hit him.
	
	
	At this stage the offender and co-offender ran off down the driveway, got into a car being driven by a female and the car sped off. It was only at that stage that Mr Forbes realised he was bleeding. He had been stabbed by this offender in the stomach.
	
	
	He was taken to John Hunter Hospital. Laparoscopic surgery was performed to ensure that serious injuries had not been caused to him. Fortunately, the injuries were, as they were described, rather minor.
	
	
	By doing what he did, the offender displayed a high degree of recklessness towards the risk that Mr Forbes would be stabbed by the knife the offender was using.
	
	
	Plenty of evidence was left behind by the offenders. DNA was recovered and, as I foreshadowed earlier, call charge records showed that Mr Forbes had received a telephone call from a mobile number registered to the offender. Accordingly, he was arrested, taken to Newcastle Police Station and interviewed. He denied any involvement in or knowledge of those offences.
	
	
	Let me move now to the final offences for which the offender must be sentenced. On 5 March 2015 Todd Wrench rode his motorcycle to a friend’s house at Bellbird. They were in the backyard of the house, smoking cigarettes. Later that evening when Mr Wrench heard the offender yelling, “I’m going to smash you.” He recognised the offender because they had gone to high school together. The offender punched Mr Wrench to his head a number of times. He suffered minor bruising to his right cheek and it had almost gone by the next day. The offender started accusing Mr Wrench of selling drugs to his niece, saying, “What were you thinking selling drugs to my niece?”
	
	
	I should interpolate at this stage that one of the submissions put by Ms Court on behalf of her client is that I should make a finding that the offender was provoked by the circumstance that Mr Wrench had been selling drugs to the offender’s niece. I am unable to find that on the balance of probabilities. The offender gave no evidence. The only evidence tendered before me on behalf of the accused was a pre-sentence report and a report of a psychiatrist. The hearsay account in the psychiatrist’s report is no basis on which a finding could be made.
	
	
	After the assault was completed, as something of an after-thought, the offender told Mr Wrench that he was taking his bike with him when he left. Mr Imbornone had the presence of mind to pull out a piece of paper and write out a receipt, stating that the victim had sold his motorcycle to the offender. He took the key to the motorbike and rode it away.
	
	
	Later an acquaintance of Mr Wrench recognised the motorcycle at a different location. He told Mr Wrench where the motorcycle was. Police were notified. It was noted that the motorcycle was damaged when it was recovered. It was, in fact, written off and the insurance company paid Mr Wrench more than $4,000.
	
	
	Quite why these offences were committed is difficult to understand. As I mentioned, the offender did not give evidence before me. He was spoken to by Dr Christopher Bench who prepared a report, at the request of the offender’s lawyers, in which the reasons for committing the offences were explored.
	
	
	The offender claims that he had little, if any, memory of the home invasion and reckless wounding offences.
	
	
	It is to be noted that Dr Bench described the offender reporting symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder, relating to sexual abuse that Mr Imbornone said he was subject to as a child. There is, and this is easy to accept, a significant correlation between post-traumatic stress disorder and drug use. But that does not mean that there is necessarily a link between the offender’s PTSD and the commission of these offences.
	
	
	As Dr Bench said,
	


“Drawing any direct correlation between the mental health conditions and the offending behaviours is impossible. Nevertheless, there may be a link between an indirect link but it is likely that the offending that I have described resulted perhaps in part from the offender’s drug use.”


	
	The offender was born in Singleton. His parents separated when he was eight. His mother is on a Disability Support Pension for severe emphysema. There was no domestic violence in the parental relationship. He was brought up by his mother in Murwillumbah and Cessnock, with no significant step-father figure in his life.
	
	
	His drug use began at a relatively early age. He started drinking alcohol at 12 and using cannabis at the age of nine. His drug use progressed to regular amphetamine use at the age of 13. He suggested that his ability to remember too much about the home invasion and reckless wounding offences were due to his drug use. Quite clearly, his prospects of rehabilitation are closely linked to the prospect that he will be able to give up illegal drug use. For that reason, I make a finding of special circumstances in his favour.
	
	
	He will need assistance in dealing with his desire to use and addiction to drugs. If he can be encouraged to give up drugs, he is much more likely to avoid committing further offences in the future.
	
	
	The offender has a criminal history and has regularly been in custody. Notably, on his criminal history there are assault and intimidation offences, but the sentence I am about to impose upon him is by far the longest period of imprisonment he will have ever served. That is because the offences I have described, particularly those involving Ms Lewis and Mr Forbes, are much more serious offences than anything the offender has committed in the past.
	
	
	The offender expressed his remorse to Dr Bench but, once more, in the absence of evidence from the offender, I am not prepared to make a finding that he has expressed that type of remorse which is identified in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
	
	
	I should also mention that the offender’s post-traumatic stress disorder will make his time in custody harder. Prisons are not gentle places. The offender’s PTSD will cause him to be anxious about prison life during the entirety of his sentence.
	
	
	As I began these remarks on sentence, what is required in this case is a lengthy term of imprisonment. It is a fundamental rule in sentencing that the sentence imposed reflects the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. The two offences involving Ms Lewis and Mr Forbes were objectively very serious indeed. I have already mentioned that Ms Lewis was detained for a significant period of time. She was highly frightened. The offender was armed. And the indictable offence he committed was one of much greater seriousness than simply something like stealing.
	
	
	The reckless wounding involved an injury to Mr Forbes which was caused by a knife, wielded in a highly reckless manner by the offender. It came about after Mr Forbes returned home because the offenders were committing an offence involving Ms Lewis. He was entitled to defend himself, as he did. Instead of the offenders running immediately away, they chased him and in the course of either Mr Forbes defending himself or being chased he was wounded.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Were it not for the imposition of an aggregate sentence, I would have imposed the following sentences:
	
	
	For the drive whilst disqualified matter, three months imprisonment. For aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of six years with a non-parole period of three and a half years. For the reckless wounding offence, a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of three years. For the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence and the steal from person offence, I would have imposed in each case two years imprisonment.
	
	
	Instead, I will impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of five and a half years with a head sentence of nine years. That is to date from 30 April 2015. Thus, the non-parole period will expire on 29 October 2020, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.
	
	
	I make an order that the offender is to pay to NRMA by way of compensation the sum of $4,034.18.

The plaintiff, a political party in Singapore, is suing Tay Boon Too for damages for slander. Tay Boon Too is a member of the People`s Action Party, another political party in Singapore, and he was nominated for election to Parliament for the constituency of Paya Lebar in the 1972 general elections (Suit 1913 of 1972).
The plaintiff had also nominated a candidate for election to Parliament for the same constituency.
The plaintiff is also suing the Attorney General for damages for libel contained in a radio broadcast and published by the Department of Broadcasting, Ministry of Culture, on 26 August 1972 (Suit 1207 of 1973.)
By an order of court of 11 February 1974, these two actions were ordered to be consolidated.
The PAP held a public election rally at Lorong Tai Seng in the constituency of Paya Lebar on the night of 25 August 1972. Tay Boon Too was one of the speakers.
That same night in the 11pm regular news broadcast of Radio Singapore the following item of news was broadcast: 
 
At another PAP rally in Lorong Tai Seng, the PAP`s candidate for Paya Lebar, Mr Tan Boon Too, accused the Workers` Party of having received $600,000 from a foreign country for its election campaign.
 
 
 
This item of news was an edited version of a report of Law Ah Ta, a reporter of the Department of Broadcasting.
This item of news was repeated in the 6.30am, 7am and 8am news broadcast on 26 August 1972.
On 1 September 1972, the plaintiff issued the writ against Tay Boon Too. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the statement of claim read: 
 
5 At a public rally addressed by the defendant at Lorong Tai Seng in the constituency of Paya Lebar on the night of 25 August 1972 the defendant falsely and maliciously spoke and published of and concerning the plaintiff and of it in the way of its said undertaking and in relation to its conduct therein by saying to the persons attending the rally that the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from sources outside Singapore for its election expenses.
 
 
 
 
(6) By the said words the defendant meant and was understood to mean that the plaintiff was acting in the interests of persons who were not citizens of Singapore and that the plaintiff`s motives in contesting the elections were questionable as to whether they were genuinely to serve the interests of the citizens of Singapore or foreigners.
  
 
 
The plaintiff also claimed special damage of $10,577.38 for `election expenses incurred by plaintiff`.
On 15 June 1973, the plaintiff issued the writ against the Attorney General. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the statement of claim read: 
 
4 On 26 August 1972 the defendant falsely and maliciously broadcast and published or caused to be broadcast and published over its wireless transmission to the public for reception of and concerning the plaintiff and in relation to its conduct in the same Parliamentary elections a statement allegedly made by one Tay Boon Too on the night of 25 August 1972 that the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from sources outside Singapore for its election expenses.
(5) The said words meant and were intended to mean that the plaintiff was acting in the interests of persons who were not citizens of Singapore and that the plaintiff`s motives in contesting the said elections were questionable as to whether they were genuinely to serve the interests of the citizens of Singapore or foreigners.`
 
 
 
The plaintiff also claimed special damage of $10,577.38 for `election expenses incurred by plaintiff`.
The plaintiff called Ee Boon Lee, Controller News in the Department of Broadcasting and Law Ah Ta the Department`s reporter as witnesses. The report made by Law Ah Ta of the speech made by Tay Boon Too was admitted in evidence.
The relevant portion of the report (exh P4) reads: 
 
In the PAP election rally tonight at Lorong Tai Seng, Paya Lebar candidate Mr Tay Boon Too accused the Workers` Party of having received a sum of 600,000 dollars from Kuala Lumpur for the current election campaign. The WP he said, celebrated its anniversary at the Singapore Malay National Organisation`s premises indicates that it is not an independent party. And the SMNO is a Kuala Lumpur`s arm in Singapore which carries out subversive activities.
 
 
 
The plaintiff applied at the trial for and was granted leave to amend its statement of claim in its suit against Tay Boon Too. Paragraphs 5 and 6 were amended and read: 
 
5 At a public rally addressed by the defendant at Lorong Tai Seng in the constituency of Paya Lebar on the night of 25 August 1972 the defendant falsely and maliciously spoke and published of and concerning the plaintiff and of it in the way of its said undertaking and in relation to its conduct therein by saying to the persons attending the rally that the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from 
 Kuala Lumpur for the current election campaign and celebrated its anniversary at the Singapore Malay National Organisation`s premises indicating that it is not an independent party and that the Singapore Malay National Organisation is a Kuala Lumpur arm in Singapore which carries out subversive activities.
(6) By the said words the defendant meant and was understood to mean that the plaintiff was acting in the interests of persons who were not citizens of Singapore and that the plaintiff`s motives in contesting the elections were questionable as to whether they were genuinely to serve the interests of the citizens of Singapore or foreigners 
 and that the plaintiff was associating itself with a subversive arm of a foreign power in Singapore. 
 
 
 
The amendment is italicised.
Both defendants elected not to adduce evidence. The plaintiff then made a second speech closing his case and the two defendants stated their case.
Counsel for the plaintiff submits that the plaintiff must prove and it has proved (a) that the defendant Tay Boon Too uttered the words complained of and (b) that the words are defamatory.
The Attorney General relies on two defences namely (1) the words complained of are not defamatory and (2) the broadcast was made on an occasion of qualified privilege.
The defendant Tay Boon Too by his re-amended defence raises the following defences:
 
 
(1) He denies he uttered the words complained of in para 5 of the amended statement of claim. 
 
(2) He denies that the words allegedly spoken by him either bore or were capable of bearing a defamatory meaning. 
 
(3) He pleads justification for part of the words allegedly spoken by him.
  
 
 
Counsel for the defendant Tay Boon Too submits that the plaintiff has not proved publication of the words complained of.
In order to appreciate this submission it is necessary to set out the evidence relating to how the report exh P4 was written.
The evidence of Law Ah Ta the reporter from the Department of Broadcasting, is that Tay Boon Too spoke in Hokkien; that he took notes of the speech in point form as Tay Boon Too spoke, not verbatim; that the notes were made in Chinese in his note book; that he later submitted the report exh P4 to the news editor; that the report was a translation of his notes; that the report contained accurately what he heard at the rally; that he cannot remember the exact words used by Tay Boon Too; that the words `subversive activities` were chosen by him when he translated from his notes; that the word `subversive` was the word he chose, that he could have chosen another word but he chose `subversive` as the most suitable word; that he cannot remember the Chinese word used; and that the note book after it was used up was collected by the office attendant and he did not know where it is now.
The plaintiff must prove that the words complained of have been published. The plaintiff has called only one witness, Law Ah Ta, who was present at the rally and heard the speech of Tay Boon Too. No other witness who attended the rally and heard Tay Boon Too`s speech was called by the plaintiff to prove the speaking of the words. Law Ah Ta has not proved the actual words alleged to have been published. It is clear from his evidence that what he set out in his report exh P4 was what he conceived to be the substance or effect of the words or his impression of what was said.
In an action for slander the witnesses must prove the words used and cannot be allowed to state the impression produced upon their minds by the whole of the conversation (
 Harrison v Bevington 
 173 ER 683). It is not sufficient for them to state what they conceive to be the substance or effects of the words (
 Maitland v 
 
 Goldney 
 102 ER 431).
In 
 Rainy v Bravo 
 
(1872) LR 4 PC 287
 which is an action for libel, Sir Montague Smith in his judgment said (at p 295): 
 
If the defamatory writing does not exist, and secondary evidence is offered of its contents, the words must be proved and not what the witness conceives to be the substance or the effect of them; for otherwise witnesses and not the court or a jury, would be made the judges of what was a libel.
 
 
 
Here the slander alleged was spoken in Hokkien but the words complained of were set out in English in the amended statement of claim. English is the official language of the court and in that context any other language would be a foreign language. If the slander alleged is in a language other than English it must be set out in the statement of claim in the foreign language precisely as spoken and followed by a literal translation. It is not enough to set out a translation without setting out the original or vice versa. (
 Gatley 
 
 on Libel & Slander 
, 7th Ed, para 987.) While the absence of a translation in the pleadings may not be fatal to the plaintiffs case the absence of the original words in the foreign language in question is.
In 
 Zenobio 
 
 v Axtell 
 101 ER 489 the libel was published in a newspaper in the French language. The defendant suffered judgment to go by default and the defendant later moved in arrest of judgment and judgment was arrested on the ground that a translation of the words, and not the original French words, was set out in the declaration but the court gave the plaintiff leave to amend his declaration on payment of costs. The amendment was allowed because evidence of the actual words were on the record. In the present case the plaintiff has closed its case with no such evidence on the record.
In 
 Jenkins 
 
 v Phillips 
 173 ER 1045 an action for slander, the declaration stated that the defendant said of the plaintiff, `He is a thief, a swindler, and a forger`, etc. The words were proved to have been spoken in the Welsh language but were of the same meaning as the English words stated in the declaration. Counsel for the defendant submitted that the Welsh words should have been set out in the declaration and also a translation. Whereupon counsel for the plaintiff applied for leave to amend by inserting the Welsh words in the declaration. The court allowed the amendment on payment of costs.
After the plaintiff has proved the actual words published he must also prove that the translation given in the statement of claim is correct by calling an interpreter sworn as a witness (
 Gatley 
, para 1207).
I am of the view that the plaintiff in this case has not proved publication of the words complained of.
The next point taken by counsel for the defendant Tay Boon Too is that this is not a case of slander which is actionable per se and that the plaintiff has not proved special damage.
It is submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that the words complained of are actionable per se without proof of special damage for the reasons that (1) the words impute the commission of a crime by the plaintiff and (2) the words disparage the plaintiff in the way of its business or calling.
The general rule is that no action will lie for slander unless the plaintiff can prove that he has suffered special damage that is to say actual pecuniary loss or damage capable of pecuniary assessment, as a result of the publication of the words of which he complains. The general rule does not apply to four rigidly defined classes of imputations which are described as slanders actionable per se, namely without proof of special damage. Only two of these classes are relevant in this case. They are (1) where the words impute a crime for which the plaintiff can be made to suffer physically by way of punishment and (2) where the words are calculated to disparage the plaintiff in any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of publication (
 Gatley 
, para 143).
Has the plaintiff in this case brought itself within the first class set out above? I do not think so. The words do not impute to the plaintiff that it has committed a criminal offence for which it could be convicted. It is to be noted that this class covers cases where a plaintiff can be made to suffer physically by way of punishment which the plaintiff in this case clearly cannot suffer.
Has the plaintiff brought itself within the second class? The plaintiff relies on s 5 of the Defamation Act which provides: 
 
In an action for slander in respect of words calculated to disparage the plaintiff in any office, profession, calling, trade or business held or carried on by him at the time of the publication, it shall not be necessary to allege or prove special damage whether or not the words are spoken of the plaintiff in the way of his office, profession, calling, trade or business.
 
 
 
In para 7 of the amended statement of claim it is pleaded that `the said words were calculated to disparage the plaintiff in its said undertaking` and counsel for the plaintiff says that the undertaking was to contest the election.
By s 5 any defamatory statement which reflects upon a person in the way of his office, profession, calling, trade or business is actionable without proof of special damage provided he was following that calling at the time when the words were spoken and published and provided the words amount to either a charge of misconduct or of unfitness against him in relation to that calling. Counsel for the plaintiff maintains that the plaintiff is registered under the Societies Act and is a legal entity. But is it? The Societies Act does not create a body corporate. It creates an association of individuals which is given the right, inter alia, to sue or be sued in its registered name. It is clear that the words `office, profession, calling, trade or business` are not applicable to a political party. Most of the reported cases deal with personal rather than corporate plaintiffs but this exception to the normal rule requiring special damage to be proved in cases of slander has been extended to a corporate plaintiff carrying on a trade or business. (See 
 D & L Caterers & Jackson 
 
 v D`Ajou 
 [1945] 1 All ER 563.) It is not suggested by the plaintiff, and it cannot be suggested, that the plaintiff is a profit-making organisation which would justify its inclusion in this exception. It is to be noted that in its pleadings the plaintiff used the word `undertaking` which does not appear in s 5.
The plaintiff therefore does not come within the second class.
Where the spoken words do not fall under one of the four classes I have mentioned the plaintiff can only maintain an action for slander if he has suffered special damage.
What constitutes special damage? It is defined in 
 Gatley 
, para 203, as follows: 
 
Special damage is some `actual temporal loss` - the loss of some `material` or `temporal advantage` which is `pecuniary` or `capable of being estimated in money`.
 
 
 
The actual loss must be proved. The special damage must be the natural and reasonable result of the defendant`s words. The special damage must be the direct result of the defendant`s words.
In the present case the special damage pleaded in the amended statement of claim is the sum of $10,577.38 being the election expenses incurred by the plaintiff and is alleged to flow from a statement made to the two hundred odd voters in the constituency of Paya Lebar who attended the rally. There is no claim against Tay Boon Too for repetition or republication of the words.
The plaintiff has not proved that it has suffered special damage. The evidence is that the sum of $10,577.38 was the entire election expenses of the plaintiff in twenty seven constituencies and that that whole sum would have been expended in any event whatever the result of the election. There is no evidence to link the dismal failure of the plaintiff to win a single seat with the statement of the defendant Tay Boon Too. In any event, it cannot be said that the entire election expenses of the plaintiff in twenty constituencies can represent special damage as a result of words uttered to a small group of people at one street meeting in one constituency.
I next come to deal with the defence of both the defendants that the words are not defamatory.
In para 6 of the amended statement of claim in the suit against Tay Boon Too the plaintiff pleads: 
 
By the said words the defendant meant and was understood to mean that the plaintiff was acting in the interests of persons who were not citizens of Singapore and that the plaintiff`s motives in contesting the elections were questionable as to whether they were genuinely to serve the interests of the citizens of Singapore or foreigners and that the Plaintiff was associating itself with a subversive arm of a foreign power in Singapore.
 
 
 
In para 5 of the statement of claim in the suit against the Attorney General the plaintiff plead in similar terms except for the sentence `and that the plaintiff was associating itself with a subversive arm of a foreign power in Singapore`.
In the suit against Tay Boon Too the words complained of are as follows: 
 
That the plaintiff had received a sum of $600,000 from Kuala Lumpur for the current election campaign and celebrated its anniversary at the Singapore Malay National Organisation`s premises indicating that it is not an independent party and that the Singapore Malay National Organisation is a Kuala Lumpur arm in Singapore which carries out subversive activities.
 
 
 
One has to consider the words complained of in the context of a general election in which the plaintiff was seeking public office. In 
 Seymour 
 
 v 
 
 Butterworth 
 176 ER 166 Cockburn CJ said (at p 168): 
 
It was not disputed that the public conduct of a public man might be discussed with the fullest freedom. It might be made the subject of hostile criticism and of hostile animadversions, provided that the language of the writer was kept within the limits of an honest intention to discharge a public duty, and was not made a means of promulgating slanderous and malicious accusations.
 
 
 
The principles that must be applied in determining whether the words complained of are defamatory or otherwise can be found in para 4 of 
 Gatley 
 where the learned authors explained in these terms: 
 
There is no wholly satisfactory definition of a defamatory imputation. Any imputation which may tend `to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally`, `to cut him off from society` or `to expose him to hatred, contempt or ridicule`, is defamatory of him. An imputation may be defamatory whether or not it is believed by those to whom it is published. Where, as in the cases of libel and of slander actionable per se, the publication of the matter containing the defamatory imputation is actionable without proof of damage, the law will presume that some damage flows from such publication. An imputation may be defamatory whether or not it is true; conversely, untruth alone does not render an imputation defamatory.
 
 
 
The defendants have not sought to justify the statement that the plaintiff received $600,000 from abroad. Much play has been made by counsel for the plaintiff in support of the untruth of this statement but untruth alone does not render an imputation defamatory.
An imputation to be defamatory must tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally (per Lord Atkin in 
 Sim 
 
 v Stretch 
 [1936] 2 All ER 123).
The receipt of funds by a political party is not per se defamatory. It is not unlawful for a political party to receive money at home or abroad and no right-thinking person would have given the words complained of a defamatory sense in their natural and ordinary meaning as the plaintiff seeks to put on them in its amended statement of claim.
In order to read a defamatory meaning into the alleged receipt of $600,000 the plaintiff has set out at length in his amended statement of claim an innuendo.
In 
 Grubb v Bristol United Press 
 [1962] 2 All ER 380 Holroyd Pearce LJ said (at p 391): 
 
But the genuine innuendo which provides a separate cause of action is that which alleges an extension, of the meaning of the words used and it must be supported by evidence of facts extrinsic to the words themselves.
 
 
 
So the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish and if it relies on any extrinsic facts it must prove them.
The innuendo as regards the $600,000 is not at all supported by the evidence that the plaintiff has adduced nor by the arguments put forward by counsel for the plaintiff.
Ee Boon Lee the Controller News in the Department of Broadcasting did say in evidence that the statements made by various Government leaders in Singapore indicated that there were external financing of certain political parties but this does not prove the innuendo suggested by the plaintiff.
Counsel for the plaintiff in his opening address said (after the court has ruled that speeches made by PAP leaders are not admissible) that evidence would be adduced, without reference to the speeches, that (I quote from my notes) `the PAP lost little time in trying to tell the electorate that the opposition parties were proxies for foreign agents in Singapore, that they were being manipulated from outside. The suggestion is that the opposition parties could not serve the interest of Singapore citizens`. But no such evidence was adduced.
To say that the plaintiff `celebrated its anniversary at the Singapore Malay National Organisation`s premises indicating that it is not an independent party and that the Singapore Malay National Organisation is a Kuala Lumpur arm in Singapore which carries out subversive activities` is not defamatory of the plaintiff in its natural and ordinary meaning and indeed they are not capable of bearing the extended meaning which the plaintiff seeks to put on them in its amended statement of claim.
In support of his contentions, counsel for the plaintiff relies on a number of cases but they do not help the plaintiff. 
 Syed Husin Ali 
 
 v 
 
 Sharikat Penchetakan Utusan Melayu 
 
 
 
[1973] 2 MLJ 56
  was a case where at the relevant time Indonesia was in the position of an enemy country. In 
 Braddock v Bevins 
 [1948] 1 All ER 450 the essential element was that Mrs Braddock was imputed to be a communist, which is itself actionable. In 
 Burns 
 
 v Associated Newspapers 
 (1925) 42 TLR 37 Ashbury J said that he thought that `communists were such persons that to describe a man as a communist was probably libellous`. Here the plaintiff is not being accused of being communist.
Another defence of the defendant Tay Boon Too is a plea of justification of the words complained of introduced by the amended statement of claim commencing with the words `and celebrated its anniversary` to the end of para 5 of the amended statement of claim. The defendant in para 7 of his re-amended defence pleads `that the said words are to the extent, if at all, that they were in fact spoken by the defendant in their natural and ordinary meaning and with the meaning alleged in para 6 of the amended statement of claim true in substance and in fact`.
To establish a plea of justification, the defendant must (1) prove that the defamatory imputation is true; (2) justify the precise imputation complained of and (3) prove the truth of all the material statements in the libel. There must be a substantial justification of the whole libel. However, it is not necessary to prove the truth of every word of the libel. As Burrough J said in 
 Edwards 
 
 v 
 
 Bell 
 130 ER 162 at 165 `as much must be justified as meets the sting of the charge, and if anything be contained in a charge which does not add to the sting of it, that need not be justified`.
The facts and matters which the defendant relies on in support of the allegation that the words alleged are true are set out in the particulars to para 7 of the re-amended defence.
It has certainly been proved by the evidence of the plaintiff`s witness Wong Hong Toy, the Chairman of the Workers` Party, that the plaintiff held its Chinese New Year celebration at the premises of the Singapore Malay National Organisation at UMNO House, Changi Road, on 12 March 1972, and that the Singapore Malay National Organisation was originally known as the United Malay National Organisation and is and always has been closely associated with the United Malay National Organisation of Malaysia. But the defendant has not proved that the Singapore Malay National Organisation has encouraged communalism in Singapore leading to riots and breaches of the peace.
The defendant Tay Boon Too has not succeeded in his plea of justification.
I now turn to deal with the defence of qualified privilege raised by the Attorney General.
It is submitted that the broadcast was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. The defendant relies on the statutory protection set out in s 12 of the Defamation Act and Schedule. This defence is made available to the Department of Broadcasting by virtue of s 13 of the Act.
In order to have the protection of the Statute the following must be observed:
 
 
(1) The report must be a fair and accurate report of the proceedings at any public meeting held in Singapore. 
 
(2) The meeting must be bona fide and lawfully held for a lawful purpose and for the furtherance or discussion of any matter of public concern and for the public benefit.
  
 
 
The defendant must prove the facts and circumstances necessary to create the privilege unless they are already in evidence. In this case the defendant claims that he has established them in cross-examination of the plaintiff`s witness.
On the evidence of Ee Boon Lee and Law Ah Ta there is no doubt that the report was a fair and accurate one.
Counsel for the plaintiff has conceded that there was a police permit granted for holding the meeting. There is evidence that there were some two hundred people present at the meeting; that it was an election meeting and that there were nine speakers. I find that the meeting was 
 bona fide 
 and lawfully held for a lawful purpose and for the furtherance or discussion of election issues.
Ee Boon Lee`s evidence was that it was only reports that were newsworthy that were being broadcast and that in determining what is newsworthy he would have regard to the general public interest and that he would only broadcast an item of news if it is for the general benefit.
The meeting at which these words were said by Tay Boon Too was a political rally. The subject matter of the report touching upon the plaintiff was one of public concern and it was for the public benefit that publication was made of the statement that $600,000 had been received by the plaintiff from a foreign country.
It is clear that the words were broadcast on a privileged occasion and there is no evidence to establish malice.
In the result the plaintiff fails in both its actions and they are dismissed with costs.

Introduction
1       In this case the Plaintiffs sought to assert their leasehold interests granted to their predecessors in title over three adjacent properties, which the Defendants purported to have terminated previously. The Plaintiffs further claimed in fraud, conspiracy, and intermeddling against the Defendants. At the trial, only one witness testified for the Plaintiffs. Some of the Defendants did not participate in the proceedings, but those who did (“the active Defendants”) submitted that there was no case to answer and adduced no evidence on their part. Having considered the evidence and submissions, and bearing in mind the Defendants’ election, I found that the Plaintiffs’ claim asserting the subsistence of their leasehold interests was successful, but dismissed their claims in fraud, conspiracy and intermeddling. The Plaintiffs have appealed.
Background
2       The present suit was a consolidated suit bringing together three different suits in respect of three properties: Suits No 263, 264 and 271 of 2010.
3       The three properties at the centre of the disputes were No. 18, 20 and 22 Upper Dickson Road (“No. 18”, “No. 20” and “No. 22” respectively, “the properties” collectively). They were located adjacent to each other. Leasehold interests were carved out of the freehold interests of the three properties in the late 19
th
 century. A chronology of events gives the best overview of the state of affairs between the parties:
(a)     In 1877, a lease for 999 years (“the lease”) was granted for the properties by one Kavena Koonjan Chitty to Moon Meyna Chitty.
(b)     In 1892, one Syed Ahmad bin Abdulrahman bin Ahmat Aljunied (“Ahmad Aljunied”) acquired the reversionary interest over the properties. His estate had apparently not been fully administered. The 4th to 7th Defendants asserted that they were the trustees of his estate in the mid-1990s (“the Former Trustees”). The 1st and 2nd Defendants asserted that they were the present trustees of that estate.
(c)     In 1969, the leasehold interests were according to the Plaintiffs assigned as follows:
(i)       No. 18: This was assigned to one Syed Mohamed bin Hashim bin Mohamad Alhabshi (“Mohamad Alhabshi”). Mohamad Alhabshi passed away in 1973. The 4th and 5th Plaintiffs claimed that they were the beneficiaries, directly and indirectly, of the estate of Mohamad Alhabshi, represented by the 1st Plaintiff as their attorney.
(ii)       No. 20: This was assigned to Shaikh Ali bin Abdulgader Harharah (“Ali Harharah”). A one third-share in the leasehold interest was supposedly assigned by Ali Harharah to one Noor binti Abdulgader Harharah (“Noor Harharah”). The two passed away in the 1990s. The 1st and 2nd Plaintiffs claimed to be administrators of the estate of Noor Harharah. Grant of probate in respect of the estate of Ali Harharah was made in 2013 to the 1st and 3rd Plaintiffs.
(iii)       No. 22: This was assigned to one Shaikhah Fitom binte Ghalbi bin Omar Al-Bakri (“Fitom Al-Bakri”). Fitom Al–Bakri passed away in 1973. In February 2015, the 1st plaintiff was appointed the administrator of Fitom Al-Bakri’s estate.
It was noted that the purported present beneficiaries of the leasehold interests were generally abroad.
4       The Plaintiffs sought, among other things, a declaration that the lease subsisted and that the leasehold interests in the three properties have not been extinguished. The version put forward by the Defendants was that the lease was determined as the covenants in it were not observed. The Defendants alleged that the Plaintiffs (and their predecessors in title) had for years, in breach of the covenants, failed to pay the rent of one Spanish Dollar on the 1
st
 of January of every year without demand to the lessor; not used the properties as dwelling houses; not obtained the lessor’s permission on the change of use of the properties; not obtained the lessor’s consent in respect of a partial assignment of the leasehold interests of No. 20; and had not been able to account for the loss of 218 square feet of land from the properties. The Former Trustees had supposedly notified the Plaintiffs of these breaches by a letter in July 1993. The Defendants said that the Former Trustees were entitled, by reason of the Plaintiffs’ breaches of the lease, to forfeit the lease, and had so became vested with both the reversionary as well as the leasehold interests in the three properties.
5       In 1994, the 4th to 7th Defendants, as the Former Trustees, purportedly conveyed both the reversionary interests and the leasehold interests in the properties to the 3rd Defendant (“the Conveyance”). This was followed by a Deed of Rectification and Confirmation dated 1 November 1994 (“the Confirmation”), between the 4th to 7th Defendants on one side, and the 3rd Defendant on the other.
6       There were various contentions made by both sides about the estates of the various deceased persons, and who was a proper trustee of those estates. These were not generally material in the present proceedings, and any challenge to the status of the Plaintiffs or their predecessors had to be by way of separate proceedings. There were also other proceedings relating to issues relevant for the present action. For instance:
(a)     In 1994, the 3rd Defendant sought to obtain possession of the properties in OS No. 1234 of 1994. Then in 1995, Ali Harharah, together with some others, took out proceedings against the 3rd to 7th Defendants in OS No. 1052 of 1995 to set aside the Conveyance and Confirmation. An order was made for possession of the properties in OS No. 1234 of 1994, and the application for OS No. 1052 of 1995 was dismissed. Subsequently, in Summons No. 4805 of 1999 and Summons No. 4961 of 1999, Kamal Harharah, a son of Ali Harharah, applied to set aside that order for possession and the order dismissing OS No. 1052 of 1995 respectively. Lai Siu Chiu J granted both applications in respect of No. 20, but ordered the 
status quo
 to be maintained as regards No. 18 and No. 22. This, the Plaintiffs said, was so that representatives could be appointed for the estates of Mohamed Alhabshi and Fitom Al-Bakri before the relevant orders could be made for No. 18 and No.22.
(b)     In Summonses No. 2248, 2250 and 2249 of 2010, Belinda Ang J, in a judgment reported as 
Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff (administrator of the estate of Noor bte Abdulgader Harharah, deceased) and ors v Harun bin Syed Hussein Aljuied (alias Harun Ajunied) and others and other suits
 [2011] 2 SLR(R) 661 (“the 2011 striking out decision”), determined an application for striking out which touched on the relationship between the present suit and the earlier proceedings.
(c)     In Suit No. 424 of 2011, the 1st and 2nd Defendants of the present action brought a claim against the 3rd Defendant for failure to pay the full consideration for the conveyance of the reversionary interests and the leasehold interests in the three properties. I gave my decision for Suit No. 424 of 2011 concurrently with my decision for the present action.
(d)     OS No. 1122 of 1992 involved an application by the 4th and 5th Defendants to have themselves appointed trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied. Certain related orders were granted. This was the subject of an intervention application before me, which I dealt with separately.
7       At the close of the Plaintiffs’ case, the active Defendants submitted that there was no case to answer, and so did not call any evidence. They elected to so submit knowing the consequences of their choice. As it was then, the only evidence admitted was that of the Plaintiffs’ sole witness, Syed Ahmad Jamal Alsagoff (“Jamal”), who was the 1st Plaintiff in this action and managing agent of the other plaintiffs.
The Plaintiffs’ Case
8       The Plaintiffs’ primary contention was that the Defendants had over many years deprived them of their inheritance, 
ie
 the leasehold interests in the properties. The Plaintiffs asserted that they were the beneficial owners of the leasehold interests, and claimed that the Conveyance and Confirmation were executed either in fraud and/or conspiracy. It was also claimed that there was intermeddling of the estates, rendering the Defendants constructive trustees. In terms of specific remedies, the Plaintiffs sought declarations that the lease remained valid with the beneficial leasehold interests vesting in them, and the expunging of the various interests registered by the Defendants in consequence of the Conveyance being null and void.
9       The Plaintiffs said that the lease subsisted because under the terms of the lease, the remedy for non-payment of the annual rent was to levy execution on goods and chattels found on the properties to recover the rent in arrears, and not re-entry 
qua
 forfeiture as claimed by the Defendants. Furthermore, there was nothing adduced in evidence as to what the outstanding rent was since this was expressed to be in Spanish Dollars in the lease, and the Spanish Dollar had ceased to be in use. There was also uncertainty as to who, if anyone, could have continued to collect the rent, as there was an extended period of time between 1958 and 1992 during which no trustee was appointed under the estate of Ahmad Aljunied.
10     The essence of the Plaintiffs’ case was that the 4th to 7th Defendants schemed to dispose of the reversionary interests of the properties free of the leasehold interests on the basis that the leasehold interests had been forfeited. Various allegations were made concerning the Defendants. The 4th to 7th Defendants committed fraud when they obtained appointment as trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied even though they had no basis, by concealing facts from the judge in an application under OS No. 1122 of 1992. The Defendants also insisted that they had forfeited the lease even though they knew that they had no right to do so; they alleged that the Plaintiffs had breached the terms of the lease by failing, 
inter alia
, to pay the rent, and that they had in 1993 issued notices to the Plaintiffs about those breaches. They then said that they had a right to re-enter and determine the lease through forfeiture when the Plaintiffs failed to remedy the breaches, and that they had exercised that right. The Plaintiffs dispute that the Defendants had ever issued the notices (no copies of which had been produced to the court), and that they had ever re-entered the properties, which at all times were in the possession of either the Plaintiffs or the Plaintiffs’ predecessors. In any event, the lease did not provide the lessor with the power of forfeiture in the circumstances set out by the Defendants, and the Defendants knew that; the 4th to 7th Defendants had, in a previous lawsuit concerning the sale of other properties belong to the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied, obtained advice from two Queen’s Counsel that under the terms of the lease concerning those properties, the lessor had no right to forfeit the leasehold interests. With respect to the Conveyance, the Plaintiffs argued that the 4th to 7th Defendants had purported to convey the properties to the 3rd Defendant, despite the Plaintiffs’ predecessors being in occupation and possession of the properties. Further, the 3rd to 7th Defendants knew that the Conveyance was doubtful, and that was why they had felt the need to execute the Confirmation. The purported conveyance was also short of full payment of consideration by the 3rd Defendant, and the fact that the Conveyance and Confirmation were executed nonetheless without full payment showed that it was a sham. In fact, the 3rd Defendant had entered into a secret deed of settlement with the 6th Defendant as attorney of the estate of Ahmad Aljunied.
11     The 1st and 2nd Defendants acted in fraud as well, as their position was premised on adopting the acts and deeds of the 4th to 7th Defendants, perpetuating fraud against the Plaintiffs, registering the order of dismissal in OS No. 1052 of 1995 against the properties despite the order of Lai Siu Chiu J for Summons No. 4961 of 1999 (see [6(a)] above), and requiring the tenants and occupants of the properties to pay rent to them instead of the rightful lessors, the Plaintiffs.
12     The Plaintiffs alleged that the actions of the Defendants in the Conveyance and Confirmation and the earlier proceedings as set out above was evidence of a conspiracy between the Defendants by lawful means. It was argued that since the Defendants had submitted that there was no case to answer, the Plaintiffs only had to adduce 
prima facie
 evidence of their case. The Plaintiff had only one witness, Jamal, who was the administrator of the estates of Mohamad Alhabshi, one of two administrators of the estate of Noor Harharah, one of two personal representatives of the estate of Ali Harharah, the sole administrator of Fitom Al–Bakri, an attorney of the beneficiaries of these estates, and the 1st Plaintiff in the present action.
The 1st and 2nd Defendants’ Case
13     The 1st and 2nd Defendants submitted that there was no case to answer as the Plaintiffs had not made out on their evidence even a 
prima facie
 case for their claims. A number of general points were made. The burden of proof was on the Plaintiffs and was not discharged. The evidence of the Plaintiffs was wanting. There were various omissions or failings in the evidence of Jamal, the Plaintiff’s only witness. Jamal referred to various matters that were not in the pleadings. He had no personal knowledge of the facts which were germane to the case. In fact, he had no knowledge of what had transpired concerning the properties before 2004. He relied on what was reported by various persons from whom no evidence was led. While he confirmed that two lawyers were involved in the preparation and execution of the deeds for the Conveyance and Confirmation, yet they were never called to give evidence. The Plaintiffs were thus relying on inadmissible hearsay evidence. Improper attempts were also made to admit evidence; the Plaintiffs attempted to admit documents which were not included in their list of documents. No formal application for leave of court to admit new documents was made, and no affidavit was filed to explain the late filing of documents. Furthermore, there were defects in the Plaintiffs’ pleadings which could not be cured by averments in the affidavits.
14     It was noted that the Plaintiffs’ attack on the Conveyance and Confirmation was made primarily to uphold the lease and their leasehold interests. The Plaintiffs’ claims against the Defendants were in fraud, conspiracy and intermeddling. Fraud required a high level of proof, which was not made out by the Plaintiffs as they failed to adduce sufficient evidence. Furthermore, while fraud was alleged in respect of the Defendants’ purported “assignment” of the properties’ leasehold interests, no assignment was in fact done and the Plaintiffs failed to show how there was any such assignment as part of their pleaded case. Various other allegations were made by the Plaintiffs, but they were not supported by evidence. None of the allegations they made amounted to fraud or conspiracy. The failure to have full payment for the Conveyance could not be sufficient evidence of fraud. Whatever arrangements were made between the Defendants, the Plaintiffs did not lead any evidence that those arrangements were made 
mala fides
. With respect to the Plaintiffs’ allegation that the Defendants had not asserted their title to the properties as two of the properties remained vacant, the 1st and 2nd Defendants submitted that this did not, in any event, support the Plaintiffs’ case. There was nothing to support the Plaintiffs’ claim that the Defendants did not own the leasehold interests.
15     The 1st and 2nd Defendants further argued that the conspiracy claim was also not made out. As regards conspiracy by unlawful means, there was nothing in the Plaintiffs’ pleaded case that showed that the Defendants had done any criminal or illegal acts. As for conspiracy by unlawful means, the essence of a conspiracy is agreement between the alleged conspirators but there was no pleading in this case as to the existence of such an agreement. In any case, any complaints pertaining to the propriety of the Conveyance and Confirmation could not concern the 1st and 2nd Defendants, who were not trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied at the material time. Nothing was also pleaded as to the predominant purpose of any agreement between the Defendants. Any agreement that the Defendants had was intended to further their own commercial interests rather than to injure the Plaintiffs.
16     Other possible causes of action, such as unlawful interference and breach of trust, were not pleaded.
17     In addition, the 1st and 2nd Defendants submitted that in any event, the Plaintiffs’ claims were time-bared. They said that under Section 9(1) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Act), the standing of the Plaintiffs would be valid for 12 years from the date on which the right of action accrued to them. The Plaintiffs had become aware of the relevant facts by 1994 when they were parties to OS No. 1234 of 1994 and OS No. 1052 of 1995, 16 years before they commenced the present suit in 2010. There was also deemed discontinuance of Summons No. 4961 of 1999 but even if the Plaintiffs had elected to reinstate that discontinued action, the time bar would have applied nonetheless.
18     It was noted that no reply was filed by the Plaintiffs with respect to the 1st and 2nd Defendants’ submissions on limitation and inadequacy of evidence tendered.
The 6
th
 Defendant’s Case
19     The 6th Defendant was in person. His position largely mirrored that of the 1st and 2nd Defendants. The 6th Defendant’s main point was that the Plaintiffs’ witness, Jamal, did not have personal knowledge of the various matters, and that his evidence should not thus be accepted. It was also said that there was no basis for the Plaintiffs’ claims. The 6th Defendant reiterated that the lease was validly terminated.
20     The 6th Defendant was an undischarged bankrupt, but his status was not in issue in the present case.
The Other Defendants
21     The other Defendants did not participate in the proceedings.
The Decision
22     The active Defendants in these proceedings chose to submit that there was no case to answer. They were asked to confirm, and did confirm their understanding of the consequences. By submitting that there was no case to answer they had elected not to call evidence on their own behalf. The affidavits that they had filed were not therefore evidence that I could consider in reaching my decision, though I would be able to take into account whatever was elicited by them in cross-examination of the Plaintiffs’ witness. Given this stand, I had to assess the Plaintiffs’ claim on the basis of the evidence that was before me up to that stage of the proceedings, and consider whether that evidence was sufficient to establish their claim.
23     The basis of the Plaintiffs’ claim was that the leasehold interests in the properties subsist, and that they were the beneficiaries. The Defendants argued otherwise, claiming that the lease had been terminated. The Plaintiffs needed only to plead that the lease subsisted. They did not need to plead that there were no termination of their lease. As it was the Defendants who argued that the lease had been terminated, the burden lay upon them to establish this, and thus to plead this.
24     There was no dispute between the parties that the lease was created in 1877, and was to last for 999 years unless terminated earlier. On what evidence there was before me, I could not conclude that there was valid termination of the lease under the relevant law, 
ie
 the law in force at the time of the purported forfeiture of the lease in 1994. In particular, the lease did not contain an express reservation clause for forfeiture for non-payment of rent, nor was payment of rent a condition of the lease. I accepted the interpretation put forward by the Plaintiffs that the reference to re-entry in the lease was re-entry only for the purposes of distraint. That being so, the lease remained in force, and the Plaintiffs’ claim should succeed to that extent.
25     However, I found that it was not proven that there was any fraud or conspiracy committed by the Defendants. There was insufficient admissible and relevant evidence of this. Any inference that I could draw from the conduct of the Defendants fell short of establishing fraud or conspiracy. The Plaintiffs also had a claim for intermeddling. It would seem that this was a claim on the basis of the Defendants acting as trustees 
de son tort
. But liability as a trustee 
de son tort
 is premised on a person acting as if he is a trustee of a particular trust. I did not see sufficient evidence of this in the present case. The Defendants actions were to my mind premised on the view that they had in fact forfeited the lease. In so far as the Defendant’s actions could be taken as interference of contractual relations, I found that it was not pleaded as such and in any event there was insufficient evidence supporting this.
26     In the circumstances therefore, the Plaintiffs only succeeded on part of their claim.
Analysis
The crystallisation of the issues
27     The Plaintiffs’ case was that the lease granted in 1877 remained in force, and that the purported Conveyance was done in fraud. The Defendants had conspired to commit the fraud. There was also intermeddling or interference in the estates. The active Defendants denied these contentions, and maintained that the lease had been forfeited or terminated, and there was no fraud, conspiracy, or intermeddling. The Defendants’ election to submit that there was no case to answer carried implications for the assessment of the case. The issues would thus have to be dealt with in the following sequence:
(a)     The effect of the submission of no case to answer;
(b)     Whether the lease continued in existence;
(c)     The claim of fraud and how this should be construed under the law;
(d)     The claim in conspiracy;
(e)     The claim for intermeddling in the estates.
A number of miscellaneous matters would then be addressed briefly at the end.
Effect of submission of no case to answer
28     Following the evidence of the sole witness for the Plaintiffs, the active Defendants chose to submit that there was no case to answer. Upon being asked to confirm their position, they maintained their stance and indicated that they were aware of the consequences.
29     A submission of no case to answer meant that the active Defendants chose to stand their case on the inadequacy of the Plaintiffs’ evidence: the affidavits that the active Defendants had filed would not be admitted as evidence at all. Conversely however, the Plaintiffs’ case rested solely on the evidence adduced. There is no rule of evidence that the evidence of a plaintiff is to be accorded full weight simply because of the defendant’s election of no case to answer. What must be determined is whether there was any evidence adduced by the plaintiff that 
prima facie
 establishes the elements of his claim. If so, the plaintiff succeeds: 
Lim Swee Khiang and another v Borden Co (Pte) Ltd and others
 
[2006] 4 SLR(R) 745
.
30     Thus, in the present case, the Plaintiffs had to show that their evidence, namely that of their sole witness, established the elements of the various heads of claim. A 
prima facie
 basis requires that the evidence, uncontradicted and unless inconsistent with itself, proves facts which are elements of particular claims. In the end, I found that the Plaintiffs only succeeded in doing so in respect of their claim on the subsistence of the lease, but failed in respect of the other allegations. For the latter what the Plaintiffs brought in as evidence did not make out the claims even on a 
prima facie
 level.
Continued existence of the lease
31     There has been no appeal by the Defendants on this point, which would thus be dealt with relatively briefly. I was satisfied the lease had not been validly terminated; the interests asserted by the Plaintiffs thus remained. The question of the Plaintiffs’ proper succession to these interests was not in issue before me, and would have been properly the subject of separate probate proceedings. Whatever the outcome of that may be, that was a separate matter.
32     The Plaintiffs argued that the lease subsisted. If there was any default in the payment of rent, the right given to the owner of the reversionary interests was only to re-enter and levy rent in arrears on seizure of goods found on the premises. A public sale of the premises may be had if there were insufficient goods. However, the lease could not be forfeited. The Defendants also could not rely on the orders made for OS No. 1234 of 1994 and OS No. 1052 of 1995 (see [6(a)] above) to assert that the lease had been forfeited, as those orders were wrongly obtained. Furthermore, those orders were obtained on the basis that the leasehold interests had already merged with the revisionary interests, which was the very point in issue in the present proceedings. The Defendants on the other hand argued that there had been failure to pay rent as required by the lease, that owing to that failure they as owners of the reversionary interests had the right to forfeit the lease, and that they had in 1993 issued to the Plaintiffs notices to terminate the lease.
33     The Plaintiffs’ contention required examination of the original terms of the lease.
Terms of the lease
34     The relevant clause (“the Clause”) reads:
The said [MMM Chitty] doth for himself [etc] covenant promise and agree to and with the said [KK Chitty etc] that the said [MMM Chitty etc] shall and will well and truly pay or cause to be paid unto the said [KK Chitty etc] the said rent of one Spanish Dollar at the several times aforesaid, and that in case default shall be made thereon, and such rent or any part thereof shall be in arrears and unpaid for the space of Three Calendar Months next after the time hereby appointed for payment thereof, and where the sums ought to be paid and satisfied as aforesaid it shall and may be lawful for the said [KK Chitty etc] into and upon the said demised premises or any part thereof, to re-enter and levy such rent so in arrears and unpaid by seizure and public sale of the goods and chattels as may be found thereon and for want of sufficient goods and chattels, then by Public sale of the said demised premises, or so much thereof as may be sufficient for the payment and satisfaction of such rent so in arrears and unpaid, and will at the expiration or sooner determination of the said terms of 999 years peaceably yield up the said allotment portion or section of Land…
35     In contemporary language, the Clause stipulates:
(a)     An obligation to pay rent at one Spanish Dollar;
(b)     If rent is unpaid for three months after it is due, the landlord may re-renter and levy rent on the goods found on the property, or sell part of the premises;
(c)     The lessee will surrender the land on the expiration of 999 years or upon any earlier determination.
36     The Plaintiffs argued that the obligation to pay rent was not a condition of the lease, but only a covenant. The Plaintiffs further contended that the provision did not operate as a forfeiture clause; it only provided for re-entry to levy distress. It was not re-entry required for forfeiture, which would have been peaceable re-entry or by way of an action for repossession. In any event, there was no re-entry on the facts. The Plaintiffs also denied that the Defendants had made formal demands for the rent. The Defendants, on their part, essentially argued that under the lease they had the right of forfeiture on non-payment of rent, and that valid notice of re-entry had been given in 1993. The lease was thus terminated, and the reversionary interest was free of the claimed leasehold interests.
37     I found that non-payment of rent did not in itself give to the landlord a right to forfeit. In so far as the Defendants purported to forfeit for non-payment of rent, such forfeiture could only be done if either the payment of rent was specified to be a condition of the lease, or the right of forfeiture on non-payment of rent was specifically expressly provided for under the terms of the lease. Neither was the case here. I agreed with the Plaintiffs that the Clause did not make payment of rent a condition of the lease. The term “condition” was not present within the Clause. There was also no separate express reservation of the right of the landlord to forfeit the lease on non-payment of rent. I accepted the Plaintiffs’ argument that the Clause, as properly interpreted, provide for a right of re-entry that was specifically limited for the purpose of distraining goods to make good the arrears in rent. That limitation would not have been present under the Clause had the parties’ objective intention been to have the term “re-enter” entail re-entry for the purpose of forfeiture. This very fact that the lease tied re-entry to distraining for unpaid rent also pointed against non-payment of rent as being a condition of the lease.
38     Furthermore, even if there was a right of forfeiture, formal demand would be required to forfeit the lease, unless the lease provided that this was not necessary. This was not the case here. The Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) does provide for re-entry without formal demand, but the lease here was not governed by the Land Titles Act. In 1993, any forfeiture would have required compliance with the law in Singapore as it stood then, namely that set out under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1730 (4 George II Chapter 28). The active Defendants claimed that they had issued formal notices to the Plaintiffs in 1993, but there was no proof of that since no copies of those were produced to the Court.
39     In the circumstances therefore, on the Plaintiffs’ case, it was shown that the lease claimed by the Plaintiffs continued to subsist.
Fraud
40     I did not find at the end of the day that fraud was made out. The Plaintiffs had a heavy burden to discharge as their allegations were serious. The evidence adduced by them did not bring them over the threshold. But perhaps more importantly in the present case, the Plaintiffs did not make clear what their cause of action was: fraud is not a cause of action in itself, unless what is alleged is fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit.
41     The Plaintiffs’ argument was that fraud was committed by the Defendants in respect of the Conveyance and Confirmation as:
(a)     the 4th to 7th Defendants engineered their appointments as trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied. They knew that their grandfather, Syed Ahmad bin Abdulkader Alhadad, was not the last surviving trustee of the trusts and that there was therefore no capacity for them to be appointed as the trustees, but deliberately chose to conceal the facts from the judge hearing OS No. 1122 of 1992;
(b)     the 6th Defendant knew from 1993 that the lease was validly held by the Plaintiffs;
(c)     the 4th to 7th Defendants’ allegation that they had in 1993 issued to the Plaintiffs’ predecessors notices of breaches of the lease and of re-entry to forfeit the lease was made as part of their strategy to forfeit the lease, but no copy of those alleged notices had ever been produced;
(d)     the 4th to 7th Defendants purported to convey the properties to the 3
rd
 Defendant even though the Plaintiffs’ predecessors in title were in occupation and possession of the properties;
(e)     the 3rd to 7th Defendants went ahead to execute the Conveyance even though they were in doubt as to whether they could forfeit the lease. They had obtained two Queen’s Counsel opinion that they would fail in their attempt to forfeit the lease;
(f)     the Defendants had never re-entered the properties for the purpose of forfeiture;
(g)     the 3rd Defendant did not give full consideration for the Conveyance, contrary to what was stated in the deed for the Conveyance that full consideration had been paid. The transaction was thus a sham transaction.
42     The active Defendants pointed primarily to the paucity of evidence of the alleged fraud. The 1st and 2nd Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs’ pleaded fraud was in the “assignment” of the properties’ leasehold interests, but this was not supported by any evidence, and there was in fact no such assignment. The allegations of fraud concerning the Conveyance and Confirmation also did not relate to the 1st and 2nd Defendants, as they were not trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied then. Further, the 1st and 2nd Defendants attacked the adequacy of the evidence of the Plaintiffs’ sole witness, Jamal. They said that Jamal did not have any personal knowledge of the facts that were material to the allegations, and could give no explanation in support of the Plaintiffs’ allegation of fraud. Jamal made some assertions, but they were not supported by evidence. What the Plaintiffs sought to rely on in Jamal’s affidavit was also not in their pleaded case. Further, the Plaintiffs failed to call the two lawyers who were involved in the preparation and execution of the deeds for the Conveyance and Confirmation, The 6th Defendant made similar points that the evidence produced by the Plaintiffs was not sufficient.
43     I accepted that the Plaintiffs’ case could not succeed in fraud as this claim was not properly pleaded or argued. Fraud is essentially an allegation of dishonesty. It must generally be tied to other elements to be a complete cause of action. The most common claim invoking fraud is that for fraudulent misrepresentation, or deceit. Aside from fraudulent misrepresentation, fraud can also be element of other torts, such as fraud by an agent, as recognised in cases such as 
Salford Corp v Lever
 
[1891] 1 QB 168
, and in 
Clerk and Lindsell on Torts
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 21
st
 Edition, 2014) (“
Clerk and Lindsell on Torts
”) at 18-55. Allegations of fraud may additionally be made in respect of other claims such as that for fraudulent trading under s 340 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed), or fraudulent preference, or insurance fraud. In such contexts, fraud involves some exploitation of an act of dishonesty. None of these was applicable in the present case, and nothing was pleaded by the Plaintiffs as such.
44     What the Plaintiffs appeared to have asserted was an independent, free-standing cause of action of fraud. There is no such cause of action. In other words, committing a dishonest act, without anything more, is not a tort. Nor would it be sufficient to allege acts that may seem wrongful, without establishing the other elements of a recognised tort. The complaints made by the Plaintiffs against the Defendants (see [41] above) were essentially that the Defendants knew that what they had claimed was something they were not entitled to. The allegation was that they were not honest or acting 
bona fides
. Such lack of honesty or even dishonesty does not in itself gives rise to a cause of action. No cases were cited in support of any proposition that it does. No cases were in fact cited in submissions that would have allowed the Court to tease out the doctrinal basis of the Plaintiffs’ claim.
45     The Plaintiffs had in the pleadings only referred to fraud generally. They stated at para 17 of their Statement of Claim as follows:
The Plaintiffs plead that the Conveyance and the Confirmation were, insofar as they purported to assign the Properties’ Leasehold Interest, both executed in fraud…
Then again at para 30, it was stated that:
By the actions and conduct as set out in paragraphs 17 and 27 to 29, the Defendants have acted in fraud with the intention of depriving the Plaintiffs and/or the Estates of their rights and estate in the Properties’ Leasehold Interest…
Such a general claim would not do: nothing was pleaded as to facts that would ground a recognised cause of action. Fraud 
simpliciter
 is not enough.
46     Furthermore, in general, the evidence of Jamal, the sole witness for the Plaintiffs, did not help them at all. He had no personal knowledge of the events germane to the present dispute before he became involved in matters concerning the properties in 2004. Even if hearsay evidence of the previous events could be admitted through Jamal, the fact that he had not directly perceived the events meant that his credibility and credit as a witness could not add to the scales in favour of the Plaintiffs. Thus little weight could ultimately be given to the Plaintiffs’ various allegations of fact as to fraud.
Deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation 
47     In so far as the Plaintiffs’ case alleging fraud was really one for fraudulent misrepresentation, I did not find that this was established on the facts, as the elements were not established. Following the Court of Appeal’s decision in 
Panatron Pte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another
 
[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435
 (at [14]), that cause of action has the following elements:
(i)     A representation of fact made by words or conduct;
(ii)     Such representation must have been made with the knowledge that it was false, or without any genuine belief that it was true;
(iii)     The representation must have been made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff or by a class of persons which includes the plaintiff;
(iv)     The plaintiff had acted upon the false representation; and
(v)     The plaintiff suffered damage by acting upon the false representation.
No allegation of any representation
48     Misrepresentation must be particularised in the pleadings, identifying what was stated, how it was stated, and to whom and by whom it was made. Without these particulars, insufficient notice is given to the other party and to the Court of the nature of the claim asserted to allow either rebuttal or proper consideration.
49     In the present case, the pleadings did not allege anything in the nature of a representation by the Defendants. Nothing in the pleadings could be so construed, even on a broad reading. Further, the focus of the pleadings was on the actions of the various Defendants; nothing was expressly addressed as to any inducement or reliance by any other party let alone the Plaintiffs.
Insufficient proof of the elements of deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation
50     Even if there had been sufficient averment of fraudulent misrepresentation or deceit in the pleadings, there was insufficient evidence adduced, even to establish a 
prima facie
 case for the Plaintiffs. Common law requires serious allegations such as those of fraud to be established by compelling evidence, as the events alleged are deemed less likely to occur: 
Yogambikai Nagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank
 
[1996] 2 SLR(R) 774
; 
Tang Yoke Kheng v Lek Benedict
 
[2005] 3 SLR(R) 263
; and 
Chua Kwee Chen v Koh Choon Chin
 
[2006] 3 SLR(R) 469
 as cited by the Defendants. To prove fraud, the usual civil standard of proof of balance of probabilities applies, but the strength and cogency of the evidence that must be furnished before the Court would conclude that such serious an allegation is established on this standard is relatively higher than that in most other civil claims. By the same token, when, as in the present case, the plaintiff is only required to establish his case on a 
prima facie
 basis, the Court will still not lightly draw inferences on fraud without sufficient proof.
51     There was nothing in the evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs that could have given rise to or be construed as a representation by the Defendants. There was in any event no evidence of any such representation coming from the Plaintiff’s sole witness. There were allegations in respect of the conduct of the Defendants, and their dealings with the tenants on the property. However all of this conduct did not involve the making of any representation to the Plaintiffs. What the Plaintiffs pointed to, even taken at the highest, would have been false statements relating to the Conveyance and the proceedings in court (
eg
 OS No. 1122 of 1992 referred to above). But even if true, and I make no findings on these allegations, the misrepresentations in any of these contexts would have been to persons other than the Plaintiffs, a point addressed below. It may be that offences or other torts may have been committed, but these would not have helped the Plaintiffs before me.
52     Assuming that the Plaintiffs’ allegations and evidence provided proof of misrepresentations by the Defendants, that alone would still not be sufficient. The Plaintiffs had to show that they were induced to do something by the fraudulent misrepresentations of the Defendants and must have suffered loss because of such reliance on the misrepresentations. It would not be enough to allege that some damage was caused to some other person, such as a judge, sub-tenants or persons referring to a land register, for example. In this case, nothing was led in evidence that there was any such reliance. Even where it could be taken that someone might have been misled, such as the Court which heard OS No. 1122 of 1992, this did not give rise to an actionable claim by the Plaintiffs against the Defendants. Without pleading or evidence on reliance, there was no causative link between any wrongful representations by the Defendants to any damage suffered by the Plaintiffs. An essential part of any claim in misrepresentation was thus missing.
53     Furthermore, there was neither allegations nor evidence that whatever conduct of the Defendants, even if they do amount to misrepresentations, were made with the intention of causing the Plaintiffs to act to their detriment, and so caused the Plaintiffs to act to their detriment. It may be that the Plaintiffs could see that the Defendants were asserting an incompatible interest. It may also be that the Defendants were threatening to harm the Plaintiffs’ interest. But none of these involve fraud or deceit as a recognised tort. While it is not necessary for there to be intention to cause harm to the Plaintiffs, what must be shown is that the Defendants must have intended the Plaintiffs to act in reliance of their misrepresentation (see [47(iii)] above). This was not made out, even on a 
prima facie
 basis, based on the evidence adduced.
Conspiracy 
54     I found that the Plaintiffs did not have sufficient evidence to prove the claim in conspiracy either. The elements of the tort, in either form of conspiracy by lawful or unlawful means, were not established on the Plaintiffs’ evidence.
55     The Plaintiffs alleged there was 
prima facie
 evidence of both conspiracy by lawful and lawful means. In respect of conspiracy by unlawful means, it was said that there was evidence of the 4th to 7th Defendants working in combination to get themselves appointed as trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied, by concealing relevant facts from the judge in an application under OS No. 1122 of 1992 (see [10] above). The 3rd Defendant became part of the conspiracy subsequently when it offered itself as a purchaser of the properties, and finally the 1st and 2nd Defendants too when they became aware of the circumstances under which the 4th to 7th Defendants became appointed as the trustees and of the Conveyance and Confirmation but chose not to distance themselves. There was 
prima facie
 evidence of the intention of the Defendants to injure the Plaintiffs, as the object of the Conveyance was, according to the Plaintiffs, to transfer the leasehold interests to the 3rd Defendant. As for lawful means conspiracy, the Plaintiffs, in a somewhat curious submission, said that this was made out as well simply because the Defendants adduced no evidence that the predominant purpose of their conduct was not to injure the Plaintiffs but to protect their own interests or further a legitimate interest, and so from this it could be demonstrated that the predominant purpose of the Defendants must be to injure the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs said that they suffered damage in that they were unable to deal with their leasehold interests as a result of the doing of the Defendants.
56     The Defendants argued that with respect to the claim in conspiracy by unlawful means, nothing was pleaded to aver that the acts complained of by the Plaintiffs were criminal or illegal. As for conspiracy by lawful means, the Plaintiffs had to but failed to establish any agreement between the Defendants or the predominant purpose of that agreement. In asserting its claim, the Plaintiffs referred to the Conveyance and Confirmation which were executed in 1994, but that was before the 1st and 2nd Defendants became trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied; the Plaintiffs thus failed to provide that the Defendants were part of any agreement. The Plaintiffs’ sole witness gave evidence that was contradictory to allegations made in his affidavit and in the Plaintiffs’ pleadings. Overall, insufficient evidence was adduced to establish the elements of the claim.
57     In 
Nagase Singapore Pte Ltd v Ching Kai Huat
 
[2008] 1 SLR(R) 80
 at [23], Prakash J (as she then was) summarised the elements of both forms of conspiracy as such:
(a)     a combination of two or more persons and an agreement between and amongst them to do certain acts;
(b)     if the conspiracy involves lawful acts, then the predominant purpose of the conspirators must be to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff but if the conspiracy involves unlawful means, then such predominant intention is not required;
(c)     the acts must actually be performed in furtherance of the agreement; and
(d)     damage must be suffered by the plaintiff.
Burden
58     As is the case for deceit, the threshold for establishing conspiracy is high: the evidence that is relied upon to establish the elements of the tort must be of a level that is convincing enough in light of the seriousness of the allegations. The more serious the allegations asserted, the more compelling the evidence must be to convince the Court that the allegations are true (whether on a balance of probabilities or 
prima facie
 basis).
Lawful means conspiracy on the facts
59     The basis for the tort of lawful means conspiracy has been much doubted. As has been noted on many occasions, it is odd that the mere combination or agreement between parties to do what they were otherwise legally entitled to do individually can be transformed into a tort, without the need for proof of an independently unlawful act, simply because the predominant purpose of the agreement between the conspirators is to cause damage or injury to the plaintiff. The circumstances and factors that led to its first recognition as a tort are probably different now. In any case, the tort has rarely been successfully invoked in Singapore. Nonetheless, while there may be a lack of enthusiasm for this tort, as well as unlawful means conspiracy, its continued existence or otherwise in Singapore law will need to be determined by a higher court, as was noted by the Court of Appeal in 
EFT Holdings, Inc and another v Marinteknik Shipbuilders (S) Pte Ltd and another
 
[2014] 1 SLR 860
 (“
EFT Holdings
”) at [90].
60     What was not in issue in this case was that damage to the Plaintiffs may be made out, if the allegations they made against the Defendants were true. However, there was insufficient evidence of any combination or agreement between the Defendants. The Plaintiffs relied on inferences. It is true that in proving a conspiracy, there is no need to show an express agreement. Conspiracies by their nature may be secretive, and arise in the course of dealings between those involved under circumstances where there may be little direct evidence of a concrete or tangible agreement being reached by all of them at the same time. Circumstantial evidence may be all that there is. The presence of an agreement or combination may thus be derived or deduced from the actions of the various members. In 
Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)
 
[2006] 1 SLR(R) 901
 (“
Asian Corporate Services
”), it was noted (at [19]) that conspiracy would have to be made out based on inferences drawn from overt acts and objective facts:
It is not often that the victim of a conspiracy will be able to obtain direct evidence to prove the allegation. Proof of conspiracy is normally to be inferred from other objective facts. As the English Court of Appeal said in 
R v Siracusa
 (1990) 90 Cr App R 340 at 349:
[T]he origins of all conspiracies are concealed and it is usually quite impossible to establish when or where the initial agreement was made, or when or where other conspirators were recruited. The very existence of the agreement can only be inferred from overt acts. Participation in a conspiracy is infinitely variable …
And similarly in 
EFT Holdings
, the Court of Appeal stated at [113]:
The existence of a combination is often inferred from the circumstances and acts of the alleged conspirators (
Kuwait Oil Tanker Co SAK v Al Bader
 [2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271 (“
Kuwait Oil Tanker
”) at [110]; 
Asian Corporate Services (SEA) Pte Ltd v Eastwest Management Ltd (Singapore Branch)
 
[2006] 1 SLR(R) 901
 at [19]; The 
Dolphina
 
[2012] 1 SLR 992
 (“
Dolphina
”) at [262]–[264]).These cases were concerned with conspiracy by unlawful means, but the same approach would be taken whichever form of conspiracy is alleged.
61     Furthermore, inferences of the existence of a combination or agreement would not be lightly drawn, and the presence of such a combination or agreement has to be established on the balance of probabilities. It is not sufficient to merely prove the presence of an agreement; there must also be evidence that the alleged conspirators had taken concerted action pursuant to that agreement: 
EFT Holdings
 at [113].
62     The objective evidence presented in the present case did not sufficiently establish that there was any such combination or agreement between the Defendants, even on a 
prima facie
 basis. All the Plaintiffs could point to were:
(a)     The fact that the 4th to 7th Defendants were together in an 
ex parte
 application in OS No. 1122 of 1992 to have themselves appointed as trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied, in which they, according to the Plaintiffs, did not give full and frank disclosure of material facts to the judge;
(b)     The 3rd Defendant offered itself as a purchaser of the properties;
(c)     The 1st and 2nd Defendants were aware of the questionable nature of the Conveyance and the deceit of the other Defendants.
63     Even if it may be shown that the 4th to 7th Defendants may have acted together at least in relation to their application in OS No. 1122 of 1992, the other Defendants were not so involved; the subsequent connection of the 3rd Defendant, and then the 1st and 2nd Defendants to the properties did not show that they were acting in concert with the 4th to 7th Defendants. While it is correct, as the Plaintiffs submitted, that it is not necessary for all the conspirators to come together and execute their respective roles in the scheme at the same time (see 
OCM Opportunities Fund II, LP and Others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and Others
 
[2004] SGHC 115
), it is necessary to show that they came together to take some form of concerted action, whether lawful or otherwise, in pursuit of a common design: Gary Chan Kok Yew, 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 (Academy Publishing, 2
nd
 Edition, 2016) (“
The Law of Torts in Singapore
”) at 15.054; 
Clerk & Lindsell on Torts
 at 24-97. There was nothing on the evidence from the Plaintiffs to show such common design threading through all the Defendants.
64     In any case, even in respect of the 4th to 7th Defendants, the fact that they were together in a summons to be appointed trustees did not by itself show that there was combination in respect of a common design that would support the Plaintiffs’ claim. The common design that formed the crux of the Plaintiffs’ claim must not just be the 4th to 7th Defendants’ appointment as trustees, but such common design must be one that implicated all the Defendants in depriving the Plaintiffs of their rightful position as beneficial owners of the leasehold interests. The presence of such a common design was not proven on the evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs.
65     There was also insufficient evidence of a predominant purpose of the Defendants to injure the Plaintiffs. There was no direct evidence of this. The Plaintiffs had to rely on inferences from the conduct of the Defendants. But what the Plaintiffs could point to, as enumerated above, was not sufficient to establish their case even on a 
prima facie
 basis. What they had pointed to as the basis for an inference of that purpose were only suppositions which were entirely speculative: other possible reasons for the Defendants’ alleged conduct could be reasonably postulated, including that the Defendants were acting in what they perceived to be their own best interests. If so, then it could not be said that they had a predominant purpose to injure the plaintiffs: 
Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co, Ltd v Veitch
 
[1942] AC 435
. Even on the Plaintiffs’ own evidence this element of the tort was not made out.
Unlawful means conspiracy on the facts 
66     For the same reasons as above, it was not established that there was any combination between the Defendants. It has been noted in various texts such as 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 (at 15.062) that the same principles for establishing combination straddle both forms of conspiracy. This is sound in principle, as nothing appears to demand a different approach. Where perhaps there may be a distinction is that the carrying out of unlawful acts by various persons may more easily give rise to an inference that they may have been in together: one does not normally expect to see a group of otherwise disparate individuals committing the same act if it is unlawful unless there has been some prior agreement causing them to do so.
67     In the present case, the fact that the 4th to 7th Defendants sought to be appointed as trustees could be a sign that there was a combination among them had it been proven that the appointment was unlawful: persons not acting in concert would generally not be embroiled in the same unlawful act. But while there may be a dispute as to whether those appointments were proper judging by the circumstances of the appointments as alleged by the Plaintiffs (see [62(a) above), that is far from showing that there was an unlawful act by way of the 4th to 7th Defendants making the application for the appointments. The inference of a combination could not be drawn from this.
68     There was no evidence of the adoption by the Plaintiffs of any unlawful means. The burden to show this lay on the Plaintiffs. Apart from the allegation with respect to the circumstances of the 4th to 7th Defendants’ appointment as trustees (see above), the Plaintiffs’ essential argument was that unlawful means was made out in so far as they alleged that the Defendants had wrongly claimed to have the reversionary interests in the properties free of the Plaintiffs’ beneficial leasehold interests in the same. The commission of a tortious act would certainly be unlawful, but a wrong assertion of property rights is not in itself necessarily a tort: the Plaintiffs had to prove that the actions of the various Defendants involved some recognised wrong that was actionable. Thus, for instance, in 
Max-Sun Trading and another v Tang Mun Kit and another
 
[2016] SGHC 203
, the unlawful act was deceit or fraudulent misrepresentation. In the present case, in order for the Plaintiffs’ claim to succeed, it was necessary that the leases were not only found to persist, but that the actions of the Defendants involved some tort such as trespass, or interference with property rights. This was not shown.
69     Aside from wrongly claiming interests in the properties, the Plaintiffs also seem to have invoked fraud as the underlying wrong committed by the Defendants. It is true that in some conspiracy cases fraud is referred to as a form of an unlawful means. There was reference to fraud in 
Wu Yang Construction Group Pte Ltd v Zhejiang Jinyi Group Co, Ltd and others
 
[2006] 4 SLR(R) 451
 – but that appears to be a form of deceit on the facts. Another case in which fraud was referred to was 
Yap Jeffery Henry v Seow Timothy and others
 
[2006] SGHC 6
 but this case was concerned with fraud in the context of s 340 of the Companies Act. A dishonest act alone by any of the Defendants would not to my mind be sufficient; a recognised tort must have been committed.
70     In addition, intention was not made out because such intention must be intention to cause loss to the Plaintiffs by the unlawful acts: while it is not necessary that the intention to injure must be the predominant purpose, there must nonetheless be an intention to cause damage. The primary difficulty faced by the Plaintiffs here was that the actions of the Defendants were, based on what the Plaintiffs presented, plausibly not targeted at the Plaintiffs as such but was in the pursuit of their own interests. This is not to adopt the approach in 
Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No. 2)
 
[1982] AC 173
 that intention to injure must be the sole objective of the tortfeasors, which has not been adopted in subsequent cases. Rather, it is a finding that in this case, the Plaintiffs had failed to prove any intention of the Defendants to injure the Plaintiffs.
71     It is apposite here to set out the following passages in 
EFT Holdings
:
99 What is clear is that it is not sufficient for the claimant to show that it was reasonably foreseeable that the claimant would or might suffer damage as a result of the defendant’s act. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR who delivered the judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal in 
Hello!
 emphasised that “there is an important conceptual and factual difference between a tort, like negligence or breach of duty, which requires merely that the loss or damage should be reasonably foreseeable and a tort, which requires actual knowledge (or subjective recklessness) as to the consequences” such as the tort of unlawful means conspiracy (
Hello!
 at [160]).
100 We agree. The law has insisted on the element of “intention” for economic torts in recognition of “the need to keep liability within acceptable bounds” (
Carty
 at p 302), particularly in the light of the effect that these torts have on competition and the boundaries of acceptable conduct in the marketplace (see also 
The Law of Torts in Singapore
 at para 15.004). The law recognises that intentionally damaging other persons, by unlawful means is not to be countenanced. In contrast, in the tort of negligence, liability is imposed for a failure to meet an objective standard of reasonable conduct, no matter the state of mind of the actor (
The Law of Torts in Australia
 at p 15).
101 A claimant in an action for unlawful means conspiracy would have to show that the unlawful means and the conspiracy were targeted or directed at the claimant. It is not sufficient that harm to the claimant would be a likely, or probable or even inevitable consequence of the defendant’s conduct. Injury to the claimant must have been intended as a means to an end or as an end in itself.
The Plaintiffs here fell short of the requirements set out above: any injury to them was not shown to have been intended by the Defendants as a means to an end or an end in itself.
Intermeddling / trustee de son tort
72     The Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants’ purported disposal of the leasehold interests by the Conveyance and Confirmation was intermeddling in the trust property of the estates claimed by the Plaintiffs. They based this on the admission by the various Defendants that the leasehold interests were acquired by the Plaintiffs’ predecessors in title. Furthermore, while the 1st and 2nd Defendants initially took issue with the grant of probate awarded to the 1st Plaintiff in relation to the estate of Mohamad Alhabshi, the probate action was eventually discontinued by consent. The upshot of all of this was that the Defendants’ actions amounted to intermeddling in the trust property of the estates, rendering them trustees 
de son tort
, and thus holding the trust properties as constructive trustees.
73     A key element of a claim against trustees 
de son tort
 is that they had acted as trustees in relation to the trust even though they were not trustees. While some of the authorities referred to such trustees as constructive trustees (as for example in 
Mara v Browne
 [1896] I Ch. 199), they are different from constructive trustees in other contexts: here the persons are described as constructive trustees because they have taken on the trappings and powers of an actual trustee, and have cloaked themselves as such though in reality they are not. In the words of the editors of 
Lewin on Trusts
 (Sweet & Maxwell, 19
th
 Edition, 2014) at 42-101:
The principle is that a person who assumes an office ought not to be in any better position that if he were what he pretends: he is accountable as if he had the authority which has been assumed. While it is essential, if a person is to become a trustee 
de son tort
, that he consciously takes the office of trustee, it does not matter whether he knows all the trusts or the extent of his powers…
It is the conscious assumption of a position of a trustee that is the basis of liability for a trustee 
de son tort
.
74     The allegation that the Defendants should be made liable for intermeddling as trustees 
de son tort
 was not made out. Any claim against persons who acted as trustees 
de son tort
 must be in respect of the conduct of those person purporting to act as trustees in relation to that specific trust. The Plaintiffs pointed to the 4th to 7th Defendants’ application to be appointed trustees of the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied. The orders in that application still stood; while there was a separate application, filed in 2015 by the Plaintiffs here to intervene in that matter, which I subsequently determined after the decision in this case, I found that it was not appropriate to allow such intervention given the passage of time and the determination of the court there. In any event, the actions of the Defendants in relation to the sale of the properties was premised on their view that the leases were terminated or not in existence in favour of the Plaintiffs, and that the grants of probate in favour of the Plaintiffs were not valid. Whether or not this was correct was beside the point. Here, the Defendants were acting not as trustees of the Plaintiffs’ claimed trusts under the respective estates (which the Plaintiffs said the Defendants have intermeddled with), but as trustees of some other trust or estate (
ie
 the trusts of the will of Ahmad Aljunied), and this alone meant that the Plaintiffs’ claim could not succeed. A trustee 
de son tort
 purports to act for the beneficiaries: 
Nolan v Nolan
 
[2004] VSCA 109
, and this underlines the conclusion that the Plaintiffs’ claim against the 4th to 7th Defendants was not appropriate. Any assumption of the office of the trustee by the Defendants appeared to have been for other beneficiaries and not in relation to the trusts relied upon by the Plaintiffs.
75     It must be emphasised that a claim against a person 
qua
 trustee 
de son tort
 is a limited claim; if the claim is really with interference with property, that is a different cause of action.
76     While the Plaintiffs did not wholly adopt the language of a claim against a trustee 
de son tort
 in their statement of claim, referring only to intermeddling, there was insufficient evidence to support any broader claim of knowing assistance or knowing receipt of trust property. Nothing of that nature was put forward in the evidence at all, or raised in argument. The Plaintiffs’ claim in intermeddling must thus be dismissed.
Limitation
77     The Defendants argued that the Plaintiffs’ claim was time-barred. The Plaintiffs contended that this was not so for the action was commenced first in 1995, and subsequently led to the consolidated suit in 2010. Given my decisions above dismissing the Plaintiffs’ claims on the merits, I did not need to determine this point, but had this been necessary, I would have accepted that given the history of these proceedings, particularly the orders made in 1995, that limitation was not triggered.
Res judicata 
78     The Plaintiffs contended that the Defendants’ argument on limitation (see above) was 
res judicata
. The 1st and 2nd Defendants had in 2010 applied to strike out the Plaintiffs’ present actions (then unconsolidated), on the basis that they were an abuse of process, but Belinda Ang J had refused to grant the application (see [6(b)] above which referred to “the 2011 striking out decision”).
79     The Defendants argued that their present contention before me on limitation was not 
res judicata
. The basis for their striking out application before Belinda Ang J was abuse of process on the grounds of 
res judicata
 and issue estoppel, stemming from their view that the matters raised by the Plaintiffs had already been decided by the orders made earlier for OS No. 1234 of 1994 and OS No. 1052 of 1995. Belinda Ang J did not find that there was an abuse of process or issue estoppel. More importantly, the issue of limitation was never raised before Belinda Ang J and so that could not now be said to be 
res judicata
.
80     Given my findings and decisions above (see [77]), I did not have to decide on this point of 
res judicata
.
No pleading of interference with contract or property rights
81     There may or may not have been other torts, such as interference with contract or property rights, actionable against some or all of the Defendants, but the Plaintiffs did not plead them. Their pleadings, as they stood, could not be construed or interpreted as capturing or putting forward other causes of action. My decision had to be made on the basis of the case taken to the hearing and the evidence presented.
Other proceedings
82     Judgment was entered in the other set of proceedings (Suit No 424 of 2011) brought by the 1st and 2nd Defendants in this case against the 3rd Defendant. The two sets of proceedings should have been heard together, but it would appear that owing to some oversight, they were not set down for the same trial dates. The Plaintiffs were however informed of Suit No 424 of 2011 and invited to make arguments about the effect of judgment for that matter on the present case.
Orders Made
83     Various orders were granted in relation to the leases, but I did not however make any order for damages as claimed by the Plaintiffs. In view of the outcome, I was of the view that the most appropriate order was to make no order as to costs. Time for appeal was extended while matters as to costs were addressed, which took some time because of the unavailability of one of the parties.",2016-11-09 00:00:00,SG High Court
2954001,Otto v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd [2016] NSWDC 308,"JudgmenT

The application before the court


	
	The plaintiff, by Notice of Motion dated 11 November 2011, seeks leave nunc pro tunc pursuant to s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) to continue the proceedings commenced by the statement of claim filed on 22 July 2016. The plaintiff relies upon the affidavit of David Otto (a.k.a. David Ashworth) affirmed on 11 November 2016.
	
	
	The defendant neither consents to, nor opposes, the relief sought.
	
	
	The previous proceedings which trigger the s 23 application are proceedings commenced by the plaintiff in the Supreme Court of Queensland, under the name “David Ashworth” (the plaintiff’s stage name), and filed in that court’s registry on 27 July 2015, the contents of which are described in more detail below.
	


The defendant’s broadcast and the plaintiff’s response


	
	The circumstances leading to this application are as follows. On 24 July 2015 “A Current Affair” broadcast a program in which the plaintiff was referred to, amongst other epithets, as “David Otto, also known as David Ashworth, loves a business scam and also loves the highlife”. The broadcast went on to describe those business activities and concluded with the warning:
	


“He’s got plenty of tricks doesn’t he, and if you’ve been approached by David Otto in relation to his various events please contact police.”


	
	The plaintiff drafted an originating application and filed it in the Supreme Court of Queensland registry, together with an application for reduction of filing fees, on 27 July 2015, and was given a return date of 13 August 2015. The proceedings were commenced by the plaintiff using the name “David Ashworth” and not by use of the other name also used in the program, namely “David Otto”.
	
	
	There can be no doubt that the Queensland proceedings relate to the same matter complained of as the broadcast the subject of the plaintiff’s claim for defamation in this court. Although the plaintiff did not identify a cause of defamation in precise terms or plead his claim in the usual manner, the relief sought is clearly for damage to reputation.
	
	
	The plaintiff sought this relief against the same defendant, in that the relief he sought was that the defendants (described as Patricia Higgins, one of the interviewees, and the “Nine Network”) take down the publication from its website, apologise and pay the plaintiff $200,000 general damages, $250,000 aggravated damages and $10,000 punitive damages. These sums were asserted to total of $3,018,960 “being total damages less punitive damages payable to the state [sic]”, although how this sum is calculated is unclear (see the pleadings attached to the affidavit of the defendant’s solicitor, Mr C D Jankie, sworn on 29 September 2016).
	
	
	The affidavit in support of the originating application complains of “criminal defamation” and sets out factual information about the plaintiff’s business affairs and music career. He states that one of his accusers is a former girlfriend who is “bitter” and another is a former employee who is “malicious”. While it is a rambling and occasionally vituperative document, it is indicative of a desire by the plaintiff to vindicate damage to his reputation. Unfortunately, he went about this the wrong way.
	


The plaintiff seeks legal advice


	
	Within a day or two of filing the originating application and affidavit, the plaintiff sent a copy of these pleadings to a respected member of the Queensland bar whom I do not propose to name. The plaintiff’s letter to that barrister is not disclosed, but the barrister’s reply dated 30 July 2015 was as follows:
	


“I am not sure why you have sent this email to me but I should make it clear that I would not act in a Claim of this kind on a speculative basis (no win no fee).

Sorry to tell you but your application is doomed to fail in August. You quite simply cannot commence this kind of proceeding by an originating application. At best the court would order you to file a Statement of Claim but more likely it would strike out the application and order costs against you.

You would need to fix this before the court appearance.

If you find a solicitor that is willing to assist you, they could brief me but as I already indicated I would not do it on a speculative basis.” (Affidavit of the plaintiff, annexure “A”)


	
	Also on 30 July 2015, the plaintiff received an email from a solicitor (the text of which is not revealed) warning that proceedings had been commenced by using the incorrect form, and stating that proceedings would need to be commenced by statement of claim.
	
	
	The plaintiff then states that:
	


“In view of the advice I received…I filed a Notice of Discontinuance on 13 August 2015.” (Affidavit of the plaintiff, paragraph 4)


	
	The Supreme Court printout refers to a directions hearing on 13 August 2015 where the proceedings were noted as “discontinued”. That was effectively the end of the proceedings, which were never served on the named defendants.
	
	
	Although the proceedings had already been discontinued, on 18 August 2015 at 6.13 am, the plaintiff sent an email to employees of Channel Nine, including the reporter for “A Current Affair”. This email (sent under Mr Otto’s own name, and not under the stage name he used in the pleadings filed in the Supreme Court registry) was in the following terms:
	


“Concerns Notice – you are hereby formally asked to remove this defamatory material as it is based in untruth. An initial application has been made against you containing an outline of some of the proof as to why this material is both untrue and intended to cause harm and further proceedings are being launched against you. If this is not removed from your website within 24 hours and an apology made in the same manner as the material was first published further damages to the application for orders to be made against you. It is understood that there are various events companies that are subsidiaries of your primary entertainment conglomerate that would benefit from this type of false report. No further notice will be given before trial proceedings unless this untrue, damaging and unable to be proven material is removed.

The material created by your organisation containing the defamatory imputations can still be found here:

http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article/9011512/ticket-con”


	
	The plaintiff did not provide any of these documents in support of this application. They were all attached to the affidavit of Mr Jankie sworn on 29 September 2016, which was filed in support of the defendant’s foreshadowed application to strike out these proceedings if the plaintiff did not seek leave under s 23. The plaintiff has acknowledged, in his affidavit of 11 November 2016, that the contents of Mr Jankie’s affidavit, which attached the plaintiff’s Supreme Court pleading, the Supreme Court of Queensland file record and this email to Channel Nine, correctly reflect the contents of these documents.
	
	
	The plaintiff has not revealed any information about his activities between the date of discontinuance (13 August 2015) and commencing these proceedings (24 July 2016) All that he sets out in his affidavit is that he “subsequently instructed Carters Law Firm who commenced the current proceedings (affidavit, paragraph 5). Whether or not he told them about commencing proceedings in Queensland is not revealed.
	
	
	Proceedings in this court were commenced very late and contain significant defects. The plaintiff’s statement of claim was filed the day before the expiry of the limitation period for the first matter complained of (the broadcast) and failed to identify the defendant correctly. The pleadings failed to identify any downloads for the second matter complained of (the publication of the broadcast on the defendant’s website). On the first return date of these proceedings, the plaintiff was granted leave to amend the defendant’s name and the proceedings were stood over to 22 September 2016 for an imputations argument or “other pleading issue”.
	
	
	The defendant learned of the proceedings in Queensland from its own inquiries. These proceedings were stood over to 6 October 2016 to enable further inquiry to be made by the defendant and on 29 September 2016 the defendant served the affidavit of Mr Jankie concerning the Queensland proceedings.
	
	
	Counsel for the plaintiff wrote to my associate on 5 October 2016, advising the matter could not proceed on 6 October 2016 for the following reasons:
	


“When our instructing solicitor received the letter from the defendant’s solicitors dated 29 September 2016, he wrote to the plaintiff seeking to obtain instructions concerning the alleged trial proceedings in Queensland.

Unfortunately no reply has yet been received and for that reason we are not at this stage able to make application pursuant to s 23 of the Defamation Act for leave to continue the current proceedings in the District Court.

If the defendant’s solicitor had written earlier, the issue may have been resolved.”


	
	On 6 October 2016 I stood the application over to 20 October 2016 for directions. I made a costs order in favour of the defendant. I did not accept the submission that the onus lay on the defendant to make these inquiries, or that the defendant’s solicitor should have written earlier. The onus lay on the plaintiff to be honest with the court by revealing the earlier proceedings and by seeking leave under s 23 at the earliest opportunity. Honesty is not the best policy with the court; it is the only policy.
	
	
	On 20 October 2016 the plaintiff was still not ready to proceed and I made orders for the filing of an affidavit and written submissions in accordance with Practice Note 6. The contents of the plaintiff’s affidavit are set out above. I have not received any written submissions.
	


The relevant legal principles


	
	Judicial considerations of the ambit of s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) to date have to date been restricted to whether the relief may be granted nunc pro tunc (Carey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2012) 200 ALR 348) or whether the proceedings commenced in the other court are the same as those for which it is asserted that leave is required (Sullivan v Griffin [2012] NSWSC 687). The circumstances in which leave should be refused for discretionary reasons are largely judicially unexplored, although I note the comments made by McCallum J in Carey v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2010) 77 NSWLR 136 at [59] – [63], in relation to the portion of Mr Carey’s claim which was not statute-barred. More recently, an application for leave under s 23 was refused on its merits, in Ghosh v Miller [2016] NSWSC 1574, but the circumstances there were that the pleadings the subject of the application were incomprehensible and that the pleadings in the prior proceedings had been even worse. The question of relevant factors for the exercise of discretion are therefore best considered within the framework of ss 56 – 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).
	
	
	The plaintiff’s absence of frankness and promptness in acknowledging that he did commence proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland leaves much to be desired. That must weigh against the exercise of discretion.
	
	
	However, the terms of s 23 (“except with leave of the court”) are broad. The discretion I exercise is unfettered, although it must be exercised judiciously, and not capriciously.
	
	
	While there are unsatisfactory aspects of the plaintiff’s conduct of the proceedings to date, these should not result in his being denied the chance to have his claim proceed to trial. To deny a plaintiff a right to bring proceedings is a step of last resort.
	
	
	I also take into account the defendant’s position, in that no claim of prejudice is put. The “just, quick and cheap” conduct of these proceedings (to quote s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)) by the defendant’s legal representatives, not only in relation to this application but generally, is to be commended.
	
	
	I will grant leave to the plaintiff under s 23 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) to continue the proceedings that he has already commenced. However, after this false start, the plaintiff will have to do better. Further delay in proceedings commenced at the end of the limitation period for the first matter complained of would be unwise, for the reasons explained by Levine J in Campbell v Regional Publishers Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of NSW, 30 October 1998):
	


“Where the plaintiff has been late in the initiation of proceedings, first, the quality of the remedy sought in defamation will or could be, severely affected both in terms of quantum and costs; and second, the requirement in a plaintiff diligently to prosecute the action will be one that demands strict adherence to the Rules of Court or directions given.”


	
	That will include amending the statement of claim to plead downloads of the second matter complained of, as well as conducting these proceedings in a speedy and efficient manner in the future. The parties have leave to bring in a timetable reflecting the outstanding interlocutory issues, including the r 28.2 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) imputations argument foreshadowed by the defendant.
	


Costs


	
	The plaintiff brought this application only after the defendant foreshadowed striking out the proceedings if an application for leave was not sought, and was dilatory in his conduct of it. As a result of his unreadiness, he has already been ordered to pay costs on 22 September and 6 October 2016 and I reserved the costs of the directions hearing on 20 October 2016.
	
	
	In these circumstances, and given the nature of the application (which is the seeking of an indulgence from the court) the plaintiff should pay the costs of the defendant for the directions hearing on 20 October 2016 and in relation to this application today.
	


Orders


	
	Upon the undertaking of the solicitor for the plaintiff to file the Notice of Motion dated 11 November 2016 in the registry in 7 days, grant leave to the plaintiff to move upon the notice of motion for leave to continue the proceedings commenced by statement of claim filed on 22 July 2016.
	
	
	Notice of motion granted.
	
	
	Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs of 20 October 2016 and of 17 November 2016.

2954007,R v Meakin (No. 3) [2016] NSWSC 1602,"remarks on sentence


	
	On 21 February 2014 Nicholas McEvoy was struck and killed by a van driven by the offender on Richmond Road, Glendenning. The Crown case was that the offender had deliberately mounted the kerb and driven his van onto the nature strip in order to strike Mr McEvoy. The offender was charged with murder and in the alternative that he was involved in an impact occasioning the death of Nicholas McEvoy and that at the time of impact the offender was driving a vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor in circumstances of aggravation namely that the prescribed concentration of alcohol was in his blood.
	
	
	The offender stood trial before a jury of 12 and me. Manslaughter was also left to the jury as an alternative. On 4 August 2016 the jury found him guilty of murder. He now stands to be sentenced for that offence.
	
	
	The maximum sentence for murder is life imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 20 years. It is not suggested that the present matter falls within the worst category of murder.
	


The facts


	
	This case is another regrettable example of where excessive consumption of alcohol can lead. It involves a number of its well-known negative side-effects including lack of judgment, lack of insight, lack of self-control and outright aggression.
	
	
	I find the following facts. Those facts which are found against the offender have been found by me beyond reasonable doubt and those in his favour on the balance of probabilities. It is my obligation to make findings of fact consistent with the verdict of the jury.
	
	
	The offender was born on 11 February 1969. He was aged 45 at the time of the offence and is now aged 47.
	
	
	The offender arrived at the Plumpton Inn on Richmond Road, Glendenning at about 2:15pm on 20 February 2014. He stayed at the Hotel drinking and playing pool until approximately midnight on that day. During the time that he remained at the Hotel he purchased 21 schooners of full strength beer. It was suggested on behalf of the offender that he may not have consumed all of those drinks himself particularly because on a number of occasions he was seen to purchase two drinks at a time. Given the offender’s poor memory for the night in question, I cannot accept his evidence in that regard. However, whether he consumed all 21 schooners or not he agreed that by the end of the night he was drunk.
	
	
	Dr Judith Perl, a pharmacologist and a specialist into the effects of alcohol and other drugs on cognitive functions and skill performance particularly in relation to driving ability, estimated that if the offender had drunk all of the drinks he purchased his blood alcohol concentration at about 12:08am on 21 February 2014 would have been within the range of .257 grams per 100 millilitres to .313 grams per 100 millilitres. She agreed that even if he had only consumed 16 of those drinks (taking into account the 5 occasions he purchased 2 at a time) his blood alcohol reading would definitely have been above .15 and more likely above .2. For the purpose of the alternative count charged, the prescribed concentration of alcohol was .15.
	
	
	None of the Hotel staff who served or saw the offender considered that he appeared intoxicated. Dr Perl could only see some slight signs of intoxication when shown part of a DVD depicting the offender in the car park of the Hotel shortly before midnight. She considered that the offender appeared to have a tolerance for alcohol so that, although quite intoxicated in terms of physical and cognitive abilities, he appeared not to be drunk or very drunk.
	
	
	Just before 11:00pm on 20 February Mr McEvoy entered the Plumpton Inn through the car park. He had earlier been at his brother’s house at Dean Park to help him with some landscaping work. During that time and into the evening Mr McEvoy consumed a number of cans of beer.
	
	
	When he was at the Hotel he showed some signs of being affected by alcohol. Some of those signs included overt friendliness towards other patrons, slight unsteadiness on his feet and exuberance on one occasion apparently in relation to a pool game being played by a friend of his, known as Chicken, against the offender. Mr McEvoy was encouraging Chicken and congratulating him on whatever shot he took. At some point the offender spoke to Mr McEvoy and said words suggesting that he let them play their own game. At that point Mr McEvoy stood back and watched. However, when the game concluded and Chicken won, Mr McEvoy jumped up and screamed and congratulated Chicken. He hugged him and became really excited.
	
	
	The security guard assumed that Mr McEvoy may have been intoxicated or under the influence of something so he asked him to leave. Although there was some slight resistance from Mr McEvoy, and he said he did not want to go, he was backed out of the hotel by the security guard although without demonstrating any physical resistance or aggression towards the security guard.
	
	
	Mr McEvoy then stood outside the gates to the beer garden smoking a cigarette. Shortly afterwards the offender went outside to where he was standing. According to the security guard the offender said to Mr McEvoy “Go home”, and then Mr McEvoy and the offender exchanged words that were not friendly. At that point the offender took a swing at Mr McEvoy’s head. Mr McEvoy blocked the punch. Although the security guard gave evidence that Mr McEvoy arced up and wanted to have a go at the offender the DVD of that altercation does not support that evidence. He was not aggressive, he was simply defending himself. The security guard then pushed Mr McEvoy away further into the carpark.
	
	
	It may be accepted, however, that Mr McEvoy was reluctant to leave the Hotel grounds and that the security guard was obliged to walk him almost to the perimeter of those grounds. The offender watched Mr McEvoy walking across the car park and at one point walked some distance in his direction. When Mr McEvoy was over towards the eastern perimeter of the property and the security guard was walking back to the Hotel Mr McEvoy yelled out although what he was yelling and to whom was not disclosed but it may reasonably be assumed that it was directed towards the offender. In any event, Mr McEvoy shortly thereafter left the grounds of the Hotel and walked down Richmond Road. At some point he must have crossed to the other side, being the northern side where he was struck.
	
	
	Shortly thereafter, perhaps five to ten minutes later, the offender drove his van from the Hotel car park. He turned right into Dublin Street and then, contrary to a ‘No Right Turn’ sign he turned right into Richmond Road. At the time the offender lived at Freemans Reach north of Richmond. The most direct route from the Plumpton Inn to Freemans Reach would have involved turning left at the intersection of Dublin Street and Richmond Road. I reject the offender’s explanation that he wanted to get something to eat at McDonald’s at Woodcroft for a number of reasons. First, that particular McDonald’s is about a kilometre to the east away from the direction the offender needed to travel to get home. Secondly, it involved turning right off Richmond Road a short distance after the intersection with Quakers Hill Parkway, yet the offender was driving in the left hand lane nearest the nature strip, notwithstanding that he had turned right into Richmond Road. Thirdly, there was a 24 hours’ McDonald’s next to Richmond railway station which was on the offender’s most direct route to his residence.
	
	
	The offender drove east on Richmond Road travelling on the bridge over Eastern Creek. At that point Mr McEvoy was walking east along the nature strip (there being no footpath) on the northern side of Richmond Road. The offender saw him. The offender drove in such a way that his near side wheels mounted the gutter onto the nature strip and struck Mr McEvoy almost straight on with the near side front of the vehicle. He was thrown slightly to the left and some distance forward. His final resting position was in the vicinity of the sign for the Reserve. At the time of the impact the offender’s vehicle was travelling at about 60km per hour. The impact caused a number of injuries to Mr McEvoy but the most significant was the fracture of his cervical spine at levels C2 to C4. The pathologist considered that death would most likely have occurred instantaneously or soon after impact.
	
	
	The offender did not stop but drove home to Freemans Reach where he parked the van at the back of his property out of sight. There was significant damage to the front of the van consistent with an impact at a speed of about 60km per hour. After parking the van the offender went to sleep.
	
	
	The next morning he got up and went to work. During the day he said that he heard that someone had been struck on Richmond Road and that they had died. He spoke to a friend of his, Julie Meredith, and he went with her to see a solicitor where he wrote out a statement of what he said had happened and then went to Penrith Police Station to hand himself in, as he put it. His account, contained in that statement was that after he had turned into Richmond Road at about 300 to 400 metres away someone stepped out onto to the road in front of the car. He said he did not have time to react when he collided with the person. He said he did not know who the person was. He knew he was over the limit so he kept going and went home the shortest way.
	
	
	The jury clearly rejected the offender’s version of how the accident happened. That was not surprising because there was little evidence to suggest that Mr McEvoy was not capable of walking without staggering onto the roadway. He had successfully crossed the four lanes of Richmond Road and none of the witnesses who observed him before he was struck indicated that he was staggering. He was seen on the CCTV doing shadow boxing in a very co-ordinated way as he walked across the carpark. Dr Perl said, after she viewed the DVD of Mr McEvoy in the carpark, that she could see no signs of significant intoxication; he was steady, co-ordinated and walking in a straight line. Significantly, she said that it was highly unlikely he would have tripped or fallen.
	
	
	The charge of murder went to the jury on the basis that the offender intended either to kill Mr McEvoy or to inflict grievous bodily harm on him.
	
	
	Although it may well be thought that deliberately driving at a pedestrian in a van at about 60km an hour demonstrated an intention to kill the pedestrian, that is not necessarily so. The offender may have intended only to hurt Mr McEvoy seriously to scare or punish him for what the offender saw as his unacceptable behaviour towards him but, because of the offender’s level of intoxication, misjudged his speed or the likely effect of his actions. I am required to make findings against the offender beyond reasonable doubt and there is nothing in the evidence apart from the act of driving and striking Mr McEvoy that suggests the offender intended to kill him. I can only be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. However, like the sentencing judge in Ward (see Ward v R [2013] NSWCCA 46 at [211] and [214]) I can see little difference between the two intentions in the circumstance of the commission of the offence for the purpose of assessing the objective seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	Whilst there was little planning or premeditation, I accept that the offender had formed the intent at least by the time he turned right into Richmond Road. I do not consider, given the interval of time since the offender threw the punch and Mr McEvoy left the Hotel grounds, that the offence was committed from any loss of self-control.
	
	
	The fact that the offender was intoxicated to a significant degree should be regarded as an aggravating circumstance particularly given his criminal history which contains three offences of driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol in his blood. The offender admitted that he knew he was drunk when he got into his van. The offender’s van was used as a weapon, and that is a further aggravating matter. The Court of Criminal Appeal has said more than once that when used as a weapon a motor vehicle is properly described as a weapon of a particularly dangerous kind.
	
	
	In circumstances where I have found that the offender intended only to inflict grievous bodily harm on Mr McEvoy I consider that his failure either to stop after he had struck him or at least to call, even anonymously, for an ambulance to be sent is an aggravating feature of the offence. For all that the offender knew, prompt medical treatment might have prevented his death. Although Mr McEvoy was killed instantly or near instantly this aspect must be viewed from the point of view of the offender at the time. If I had found he intended to kill Mr McEvoy, leaving the scene would simply have been part of the murderous enterprise.
	
	
	I consider that the level of objective seriousness of the offending is within the mid-range.
	


Subjective matters


	
	The offender did not give evidence at the sentence hearing. Although he gave evidence at the trial that evidence was directed only to the circumstances of, and surrounding, the offending. At the sentence hearing there was tendered on his behalf a report from a clinical psychologist, Laura Durkin who examined him on 4 October 2016. The psychologist noted that the offender presented as reserved in demeanour and said that he seemed reluctant to provide information about certain aspects of his life and functioning, and was obviously defensive. Those matters limited the depth of her report.
	
	
	The offender was born in England and was the only child to his parents’ union. The relationship broke down when he was aged approximately three years. Shortly thereafter his mother moved to Australia with the offender. The offender has only twice had contact with his father in the last 43 years. He reported that whilst his mother was practically supportive and said that she loved him, she failed meaningfully to bond with him and was not affectionate. The offender identified the domestic violence she experienced in her subsequent relationship with the offender’s stepfather as being one reason for her inability to engage with him. His stepfather apparently abused the offender, and the offender’s mother did not protect him from that abuse. His unsatisfactory relationship with his mother and the physical abuse from his stepfather led to an insecure childhood and led the offender to become controlling in his adulthood.
	
	
	The offender has two children from two relationships. He has had little or no contact with them for many years although his elder daughter unexpectedly attended Court during the trial.
	
	
	He has maintained regular employment since leaving school and was said to be a hard worker and successful as a window fabricator for many years.
	
	
	The offender’s physical health is relatively unremarkable. He fractured and dislocated both his shoulders in two motorcycle accidents but made a satisfactory recovery. He has for some 10 years suffered from Gastro Oesophageal Reflux Disease and he has recently been diagnosed with Type II Diabetes.
	
	
	The psychologist noted that whilst the offender denied any notable behavioural problems including anger management issues, the offender minimised and was reluctant to provide details of his past criminal conduct which included offences of violence.
	
	
	The psychologist considered that the offender’s guarded and defensive manner would impact on his peer relationships and might also impact on his ability to empathise with others. The offender told her that his use of alcohol was non-problematic although he consumed up to seven standard drinks every day or every second day in the years prior to his offending and subsequent to the offence.
	
	
	The offender maintained to the psychologist that the offence was an accident when the victim stepped out in front of his motor vehicle.
	
	
	The psychologist administered the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). However, she said there was evidence that the offender may not have responded in an entirely forthright manner. She observed that the most notable elevation on the clinical scales of the PAI was in relation to the offender’s account of his alcohol use. His answers indicated that alcohol had had a negative impact on his life. This contrasted with what he had told her.
	
	
	The psychologist considered that the offender lacked insight into his functioning and any limitations, problems or deficits he displayed. However she said there was no evidence that the offender would have met criteria for a diagnosable psychological condition at the time of his offending. She thought his mental health at the time of her consultation with him was relatively stable. Although she said she could not diagnose an alcohol use disorder she said the offender displayed a problematic pattern of alcohol use. She said that if it was determined that the offender deliberately hit the victim with his vehicle, treatment for aggression was indicated and a program such as the Violent Offender Therapeutic Program was recommended. She thought, however, that his denial of his violent offending may render him ineligible for treatment.
	
	
	I do not consider that there is anything in the upbringing or life experiences of the offender which can mitigate the seriousness of the offending.
	
	
	Whilst the offender does not have a lengthy criminal record it extends back to his childhood and involves offences of violence and driving whilst under the influence of alcohol on three occasions. Given that the present offence involved both alcohol and violence his criminal record, whilst not an aggravating matter, does not entitle him to any leniency.
	
	
	I note a reference tendered for the offender from Julie Meredith who gave evidence at the trial. She has known him for 12 years through her partner Ray. She describes him as generous and someone who would do anything for other people. She does not disclose if she is aware of his past offending including the offences involving either alcohol or violence.
	


Remorse


	
	I do not consider that the offender has shown any remorse. He maintains his account of the event which involves an accidental striking of Mr McEvoy when he stepped onto the roadway. At no time has the offender expressed any sympathy for Mr McEvoy or his family, not even after hearing the reading of the heartfelt Victim Impact Statements by various members of Mr McEvoy’s family. Some of those family members feel anger, understandably, towards the offender but all of them feel an intense sense of loss as a result of the senselessness of the killing. Nicholas McEvoy was obviously a person greatly loved by his family and his friends. The Court again extends its sympathy to the members of Mr McEvoy’s family for their loss.
	
	
	The offender was not able to point to anything that Mr McEvoy said or did at the Hotel which led to the offender swinging a punch at him except that the offender said he assumed Mr McEvoy must have said something to him. The evidence suggests only that Mr McEvoy was being perhaps a bit loud under the effects of what he had drunk, and somewhat exuberant, but there is no evidence at least until the two men were some distance apart in the car park that Mr McEvoy did or said anything to justify the punch being swung at him, let alone what ultimately happened. To drive a heavy van at 60kph at a pedestrian whilst on the nature strip is so out of proportion to any offence that the offender might have thought Mr McEvoy caused that it defies description.
	
	
	The only evidence from the offender that could relate at all to the issue of remorse was that he said, when he heard the next day that Mr McEvoy had died, he was devastated and gutted that he didn’t stop. However, that evidence was based on the offender’s assertion that what happened was an accident and not the deliberate act that the jury and I have found occurred.
	


Rehabilitation


	
	Based on the report of the psychologist Ms Durkin I consider that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are guarded. Whilstever he is unprepared to accept his alcohol and anger management problems, including their relationship to his prior offending, and unprepared to accept what really happened that night, there does not seem to be a good chance of proper rehabilitation.
	
	
	That raises consideration of the prospect of reoffending. Mr McEvoy was a complete stranger to the offender and simply by acting in a way no different from many people who have had too much to drink but without any aggression, was first on the receiving end of a punch by the offender and then suffered the fate that has brought the offender before this Court, seemingly because the offender has a problem with both alcohol and anger management.
	
	
	Although Senior Counsel for the offender has urged on me a finding of special circumstances, I see no basis for this. Not only has the offender been incarcerated previously in 1992, so that this is not his first time in custody, the length of time he will spend on parole if the statutory ratio is applied will give ample time for reintegration into the community and whatever rehabilitation is needed in that regard.
	


Deterrence


	
	Noting the offender’s criminal record, the issue of specific deterrence is a relevant consideration. The fact that excessive alcohol was involved (with the side-effects I have previously mentioned) and that the offender drove his motor vehicle when he knew he was drunk puts general deterrence into the spotlight. Even if this event had occurred as the offender asserted Nicholas McEvoy would still have been killed. That also emphasises the significance of general deterrence. Further, what actually happened here was not a unique occurrence as cases such as R v Winner (1995) 79 A Crim R 528, R v Hall [2001] NSWCCA 202, Ward  and Kutschner v R [2015] NSWCCA 73 show.
	
	
	Those cases provide some general guidance for the sentence to be imposed, but what they do emphasise is the serious nature of murder committed in this manner. If there is any solace to be found in what happened here it is that in all probability Mr McEvoy, who did not see what was to befall him, probably died instantly.
	


Sentence


	
	The offender only went into custody on the return of the verdict on 4 August 2016. The sentence will commence on that day.
	
	
	Michael Meakin, for the murder of Nicholas McEvoy I sentence you to a non-parole period of 18 years commencing 4 August 2016 and expiring 3 August 2034 with a balance of term of 6 years expiring 3 August 2040. I dismiss the charge on the s 166 certificate of fail to stop and assist after vehicle impact causing death.

2954009,Benn v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 314,"Judgment


	
	MEAGHER JA: I agree with Gleeson JA.
	
	
	GLEESON JA: The applicant, Andrew Stephen Benn (Mr Benn), seeks leave to appeal from a judgment given in the Common Law Division on 13 November 2015 in which the primary judge (Harrison AsJ) dismissed Mr Benn’s appeal from orders made in the Local Court by Magistrate Heilpern: Benn v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWSC 1672. On 14 April 2015, Heilpern LCM dismissed Mr Benn’s claim against the State of New South Wales (the State) for damages for assault committed on 1 October 2010 when a police officer fired a Taser to restrain Mr Benn: Andrew Stephen Benn v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWLC 16. The discharge of the Taser occurred in circumstances where police apprehended Mr Benn and took him to a mental health facility attached to Lismore Base Hospital.
	
	
	As the matter at issue involves an amount less than $100,000, Mr Benn requires leave to appeal: Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(r). The summons seeking leave was filed on 27 May 2016, a little over five months out of time. Mr Benn therefore also requires an extension of time for seeking leave to appeal from the orders made on 13 November 2015. The State does not oppose an extension of time.
	
	
	For the reasons which follow, I have concluded that an extension of time should be granted, however, the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed with costs.
	


Outline of events


	
	On 1 October 2010 at about 12.30 am, police officers observed Mr Benn drinking and sitting on a roundabout at the intersection of Barker Street and Walker Street, Casino, in northern New South Wales. The two police officers who initially attended that location were Senior Constable Reddell and Constable Campbell. Mr Benn was intoxicated and highly agitated in relation to issues with his girlfriend; he was very upset and crying. Mr Benn gave his mobile phone to Senior Constable Reddell to show him the text messages his girlfriend had sent him. It is unnecessary for present purposes to refer to the content of those messages. A little later Mr Benn said to the police officers “take me to Richmond Clinic for all I care, just fuck off and leave me alone”. The Richmond Clinic was a declared mental health facility attached to Lismore Base Hospital. Senior Constable Reddell had knowledge of Mr Benn’s recent mental health issues, having scheduled him pursuant to s 22 of the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) (Mental Health Act) a week prior to 1 October 2010. On that occasion, Mr Benn had entered the police station requesting to be scheduled as he wanted to hurt someone or kill himself. Constable Campbell was aware of Mr Benn’s history of violence towards police, that he had been charged with assaulting police and had herself previously arrested Mr Benn (for malicious damage).
	
	
	The police officers spoke with Mr Benn for about 30 minutes. Constable Campbell formed the view that Mr Benn needed to be detained for his own safety and called for backup from her supervising officer, Sergeant Walpole, while Senior Constable Reddell continued negotiating with Mr Benn. After Sergeant Walpole arrived, the police continued negotiations with Mr Benn for about a further 25 minutes. During that time they were joined by two other police officers from Lismore.
	
	
	During the negotiations, Mr Benn made a variety of threats to the police officers, including that he would punch them in the face. His reaction was heightened when police moved closer to him. Mr Benn then yelled “come any closer and I’m going to start breaking noses”. He also threatened harm to himself and his girlfriend, saying “I’m going to kill her”. At one point, Mr Benn was encouraged to go near the police truck, but then he refused to get in. The Magistrate found that Senior Constable Reddell was continually saying “calm down” and offering to take Mr Benn to the hospital. When Mr Benn refused the police’s offer to take him to the Richmond Clinic he yelled that they had not done anything for him in the past.
	
	
	The police officers made a decision that they would not leave without Mr Benn. The police surrounded the middle of the roundabout. Mr Benn became more aggressive and agitated, and started to walk away from the police and towards the pedestrian crossing. Police walked towards him. When Mr Benn got to the pedestrian crossing and after Senior Constable Reddell warned him that he would be Tasered if he did not stop, that officer discharged the Taser from a distance of four - five metres. The Magistrate found that Mr Benn was electrocuted in his back for one cycle (of five seconds’ duration).
	
	
	The Magistrate also found that the negotiation period lasted for 55 – 60 minutes (at [32]) and the police’s actions made clear their intentions to detain Mr Benn and that he was resisting that intention: at [56]. That finding is well supported by the evidence. In his written statement, Senior Constable Reddell gave the following evidence:
	


14.   The plaintiff started walking away towards the pedestrian crossing and he made threats that he would kill himself. I said words to the effect of: “calm down” and “we can take you to hospital”. I was attempting to control the situation, but was not able to talk to the plaintiff and get a rational response. It was obvious in getting him to hospital would involve the use of force.

15.   The plaintiff was facing me and backing away and I drew my taser, I didn’t initially activate it, I said to him “Andrew, stop or you are going to be tasered”. I then activated the taser and said, “Put it down or I’ll spark you up”. I was referring to the alcohol beverage the plaintiff was carrying. I wanted the plaintiff to put down the beverage to prevent its use as a weapon, as I approached. The plaintiff saw the light of the Taser and turned around very quickly, at which time the taser was activated into the plaintiff’s back.


	
	In cross examination, Mr Benn gave the following evidence:
	


Q.   Did Senior Constable Reddell say to you, ”Andrew, stop or you are going to be Tasered.”

A.   Yeah, yeah, he said something like that. Yeah.

Q.   And you did not stop did you?

A.   I told him I was going home. Which is all he wanted to do – he wanted me to do and when I seen all the police I just said, ”Okay, I’m going home,” and then that’s when he’s pulled the Taser.

Q.   You were told by police, were you not, “No, you’re not going home in your state of mind after what you’ve said”?

A.   No. No, don’t remember that. They were saying to get in the truck.

The proceeding in the Local Court


	
	Mr Benn sued the State as vicariously liable for Senior Constable Reddell’s conduct in firing the Taser. He claimed damages for trespass to person in the form of assault. By its defence, the State admitted that it was vicariously liable for any torts committed by the police officers. To discharge the Taser on Mr Benn, the police required a lawful justification. The State relied, among others, upon the powers conferred by ss 22 and 81 of the Mental Health Act. The State pleaded in its defence (par 3) that:
	


Senior Constable Reddell used his Taser to physically restrain [Mr Benn] in an exercise of reasonable force to lawfully apprehend [Mr Benn] pursuant to sections 22 and 81 of the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW), to take [Mr Benn] to a declared mental health facility.


	
	In the Local Court, the focus of argument was on the powers conferred on police by the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	Section 22 of the Mental Health Act relevantly provides that, in certain circumstances, a police officer may apprehend a person and take the person to a declared mental health facility. There are a number of conditions for the exercise of the power conferred by s 22. It is prerequisite that the person appear to be mentally ill or mentally disturbed at the time when the police officer finds the person. Relevantly, the police officer must also believe, on reasonable grounds, that it is probable the person will attempt to kill himself or another person, or attempt to cause serious physical harm to himself or another person. Further, the police officer must believe on reasonable grounds that it would be beneficial to the person’s welfare to be dealt with in accordance with the Mental Health Act, rather than otherwise in accordance with law.
	
	
	A police officer may apprehend a person under s 22 without a warrant. Section 81 relevantly provides that a police officer may take to a mental health facility any person who is authorised by the Mental Health Act to be taken to such a facility. Such a police officer may use reasonable force in exercising the functions under s 81 or under any other provision of the Mental Health Act that applies s 81. Such a police officer may also restrain the person in any way that is reasonably necessary in the circumstances.
	
	
	In his written submissions after the end of the trial Mr Benn acknowledged (in par 12), under the heading “Justification”, that the issue raised by the State’s defence – based upon the powers conferred by ss 22 and 81 of the Mental Health Act – was whether the officer used reasonable force to restrain Mr Benn. There was no suggestion by Mr Benn before the Local Court that his apprehension or detention by the police officers on 1 October 2010 was unlawful.
	
	
	Consistently with Mr Benn’s approach in the Local Court, the State’s written submissions noted (in par 3) that there was no claim for false arrest/wrongful imprisonment. The State’s submissions continued:
	


That is, there is no challenge by the plaintiff to the necessity of the arrest, only to the force which was used to effect it.


	
	In supplementary submissions, Mr Benn submitted (par 11) that:
	


… in any event, the real issue is less the head of power, and more the question of whether reasonable force was used. [Emphasis added]


	
	Mr Benn’s supplementary submissions continued by identifying (in par 28) the “ultimate issue” as whether the use of a Taser on a retreating – or fleeing – mental health patient can ever be justified. Importantly, Mr Benn accepted (in par 32):
	


Officer Reddell suggested that he did warn Mr Benn about Taser use, Mr Benn recalled something similar. But on either account it was immediately before the Taser was fired.


	
	Mr Benn’s supplementary submissions continued:
	


39.   At common law there has long been a requirement that a person arrested be informed of the reason why, lest they should resist: Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573.

40.   The nub of the proposition as relevant here is found in the text of proposition four as iterated in the speech of Viscount Simon

The matter is a matter of substance, and turns on the elementary proposition that in this country a person is, prima facie, entitled to his freedom and is only required to submit to restraints on his freedom if he knows in substance the reason why it is claimed that this restraint should be imposed.

41.   The plaintiff submits that this aspect of the common law should be applied in the situation where a person is ‘apprehended’ pursuant to the Mental Health Act, for involuntary detention for assessment at a mental health facility, simply as an extension of the requirement for reasonableness.

42.   Of course in the mental health context what is reasonable will turn on the circumstances, as in any other case. Clearly it is nonsense to require an officer to be so verbose if the situation is urgent or the subject to [sic] deluded or psychotic as to render attempts at clear articulation impossible or pointless.

43.   But that is not the case here. Mr Benn had spoken – quite coherently – with police for some 30 minutes. The options of taking him home or to the hospital had been canvassed.

44.   Whether because the common law requires it, or simply taking the common law as a guide to how ‘reasonable’ force will be interpreted in the Mental Health Act, the plaintiff submits that some degree of pre-warning would be required before Taser operation could be found reasonable.


	
	The State objected in its supplementary submissions (par 7) to Mr Benn being permitted to challenge the lawfulness of his apprehension on this basis, as this matter was not pleaded and was not part of the case run at trial. It was also emphasised that no claim for false imprisonment was or could be made because the Local Court did not have jurisdiction to determine such a claim: Local Court Act 2007 (NSW), s 33(1)(b).
	


The Magistrate’s reasons


	
	After indicating his acceptance of Senior Constable Reddell’s evidence as more reliable and preferable where it conflicted with Mr Benn’s evidence, the Magistrate set out his findings of fact before concluding that the use of the Taser upon Mr Benn constituted an assault, and accordingly, the question arose as to whether that action by the police was justified: at [28].
	
	
	The Magistrate accepted that s 81 of the Mental Health Act was the relevant power under which the police, having formed the view that a person is mentally ill, are entitled to use reasonable force to take that person to a mental health facility, and may restrain the person in any way that is reasonably necessary: at [33]. Relevantly, the Magistrate noted (at [34]) Mr Benn’s submission in reply (set out at [17] above) that the “real issue” raised by the proceedings was whether reasonable force was used.
	
	
	The Magistrate proceeded upon the basis that the test of reasonable force was objective, that is, whether, on the balance of probabilities, the force used was “reasonable and not excessive”: (at [37]). No complaint is made about the adoption of that approach. The Magistrate then addressed the police officer’s decision to detain and whether the use of the Taser was reasonable.
	
	
	The Magistrate found that the decision to detain Mr Benn and take him to hospital was reasonable: at [39]:
	
	
	The Magistrate noted (at [55]) that whether the use of the Taser was reasonable was identified as the “ultimate issue” in Mr Benn’s reply submissions (see [18] above). The Magistrate concluded that using the Taser was the “least worst option” and represented “reasonable and not excessive” force for the following reasons:
	


[56]   In my view, where the mental health patient has a known history of violence to police, has threatened to kill his girlfriend and to assault police and to harm himself, and there have been lengthy negotiations the answer is that it may be justified, if the other options are properly considered and rejected.

[57]   After all, what would have been a better option – to continue the negotiations as he walked off into the night, to crash tackle him to the ground on a road way with the potential for injuries for all, attack him with a baton, or risk police safety by attempting to spray him from a close enough distance without affecting other police? Perhaps it is arguable that there were other options, or even better options, but as discussed above that is not the test. It is not to assess which would be the best option, but whether the one chosen was reasonable in all the circumstances.

[58]   The police were confronted with a set of options all of which were going to involve a degree of violence. They had decided, reasonably, that they could not let Benn go on his way. In the real world, there is a limited timeframe for peaceful negotiations with a person who is threatening themselves, police and threatening to kill others. This is not using the Taser for convenience; it is using the Taser as the least worst option.


	
	The Magistrate rejected Mr Benn’s supplementary submission that the police ought to have warned Mr Benn of the reasons why he was to be detained if the subsequent use of force was to be “reasonable”:
	


[60]   The plaintiff in submissions in reply at [33] to [35] contends that the police ought to have warned Benn that he was to be detained. All the police actions up to that point make it clear that this was their intention, and that Benn was resisting that intention. Surrounding Benn on the roundabout by all the officers made that even clearer to him. As for warning him that if he did not comply he would be Tasered, that was not a requirement in the standard operating procedures at the time to warn. I am satisfied that a warning would most likely have led to reaction, resistance or violence by Benn which may well have rendered the Taser option unavailable.

[61]   LEPRA warnings did not apply to the Mental Health Act 2007 at that time; however, an issue has been raised in the plaintiff’s submissions in reply at [36] to [44] as to whether at common law such warnings ought be given. The contention is that for force to be reasonable, warnings ought be given. For the reasons above, in my view it was perfectly clear by the actions of the police in negotiating, enticing and then encircling Benn what their intentions were. It was not unreasonable not to warn in all those circumstances.


	
	The Magistrate concluded that it was a reasonable assessment of the situation by Senior Constable Reddell that violent confrontation was imminent when the police took action to restrain Mr Benn: at [62]. Further, it was reasonable for Senior Constable Reddell to reject the options of force by unarmed restraint, baton or OC spray in the circumstances: at [63].
	
	
	Accordingly, the Magistrate dismissed Mr Benn’s claim for damages on the basis that he had not proved his case as to liability.
	


Mr Benn’s appeal to the Supreme Court


	
	Mr Benn appealed against the Magistrate’s decision to the Supreme Court. That appeal was limited to questions of law and, with leave, questions of mixed fact and law: Local Court Act, ss 39(1) and 40(1).
	


The grounds of appeal


	
	The primary judge set out Mr Benn’s four grounds of appeal (at [10]) as follows:
	


[10] The plaintiff appeals from the whole of the decision of his Honour Magistrate Heilpern dated 14 April 2015, on the grounds that firstly, the Magistrate erred in law in determining that the plaintiff could be detained pursuant to the Mental Health Act 2007 (NSW) absent some communication or action on the part of the police to communicate plainly to the plaintiff that he was to be apprehended, was under arrest, under compulsion or no longer a free man; secondly, the Magistrate erred in law in determining that the plaintiff could be detained pursuant to the Mental Health Act absent an explanation of the substance of the reason for his arrest under that Act; thirdly, the Magistrate erred in law in determining that electrocution of the plaintiff with the taser constituted a reasonable use of force pursuant to the Mental Health Act, in circumstances where he had not received an explanation from police that he was to be apprehended, or the substance of the reason for that apprehension;  and finally, the Magistrate erred in fact and law in determining that the actions of police made their intentions so clear to the plaintiff that it was “not unreasonable not to warn” before applying force to apprehend the plaintiff under the Mental Health Act. [Emphasis added].


	
	The complaint advanced in grounds 1 to 3 before the primary judge was directed to the “failure by the police to warn Mr Benn that he was being detained and as such no longer free to go, or the failure to advise him of the substance of the reasons for his arrest”. It was contended that the Magistrate had erred in law because the common law of arrest applies to detention under the Mental Health Act and that certain “warnings” were prerequisite to the lawful exercise of a power of apprehension under s 22; or alternatively that the common law informs what is “reasonable” in effecting an apprehension for the purposes s 22 of the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	Ground 4 challenged the factual finding by the Magistrate that the police intentions must have been perfectly clear to Mr Benn that he was to be detained. It was asserted that this finding was against the weight of the evidence and that the Magistrate erred in finding that it was not unreasonable not to have warned Mr Benn concerning his arrest and the reason for it.
	
	
	In support of these contentions, reliance was placed upon the propositions articulated by Viscount Simon in Christie v Leachinsky [1947] AC 573 (Christie v Leachinsky) at 587 with respect to the common law of arrest without warrant, and the decision of this Court in State of New South Wales v Riley (2003) 57 NSWLR 496; [2003] NSWCA 208 (Riley) at [30] (Sheller JA) and at [90]-[92] (Hodgson JA). That case held that a person subject to apprehension under s 24 of the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW) was entitled to be told the basis on which he or she was being detained: see State of New South Wales v Talovic (2014) 87 NSWLR 512; [2014] NSWCA 333 at [24] (Basten JA). Riley was not referred to by the parties in the Local Court, other than in the context of damages.
	
	
	Thus a significant issue sought to be raised on the appeal below included whether the apprehending of Mr Benn under s 22 of the Mental Health Act had been lawful in circumstances where it was said that he was entitled to be told the reasons why he was to be detained. If it was not, it was suggested that there could be no lawful exercise under s 22(2) of any power to use reasonable force conferred by s 81.
	
	
	The State objected to Mr Benn raising that issue on appeal, characterising it as a new point which had not arisen from the way in which Mr Benn had run his case at trial in the Local Court.
	


The primary judge’s reasons


	
	The primary judge concluded that, on appeal, Mr Benn was seeking to run a new argument that he was unlawfully apprehended or detained, and that he had failed to raise this issue in the pleadings or during the hearing in the Local Court: at [80]. Her Honour accepted that Mr Benn made reference to the failure to warn in his supplementary submissions but by then it was too late (being after the trial had concluded).
	
	
	Her Honour observed that there was some evidence on the topic of whether Mr Benn was told he was being apprehended and had produced the situation which made it practically impossible to inform him of the reason for his apprehension, noting (at [74]-[76]):
	


[74]   The plaintiff agreed that Senior Constable Reddell said something to him like “Andrew, stop or you are going to be tasered.” The plaintiff also agreed that he was told by police officers “to get in the truck” and that he did not do so. Thus there was evidence that the plaintiff was told that if he did not stop he would be tasered and he had to get into the truck and walking home was no longer an option. This denotes to the plaintiff that he had to “get in the truck”. In other words the plaintiff was being told he was being apprehended and deprived of his liberty.

[75]   The plaintiff was also asked in cross examination whether he was told by the police officers that they would not allow him to go home as he was threatening to kill himself. The plaintiff denied that he threatened to kill himself. Senior Constable Reddell deposed that the plaintiff was informed of the police officers [sic] wish to take him to hospital to protect him from harming himself. This version of events was expanded upon in cross examination and supported by the evidence of the other police officers.

[76]   So far as whether it was reasonable for the police not to warn the plaintiff about the tasering is concerned, on the way the case was run in the Local Court the Magistrate was satisfied that a warning would most likely have led to reaction, resistance or violence by the plaintiff which may well have rendered the taser the only option available. (J [56]).


	
	Her Honour also observed that the complaint in Mr Benn’s supplementary submissions that there should have been some pre-warning given before the use of the Taser operation was linked to whether the use of the Taser constituted the exercise of “reasonable force”: at [78].
	
	
	Her Honour found that had Mr Benn made it clear that he was alleging unlawful detention or apprehension under the Mental Health Act, the State would have had the opportunity to make different forensic decisions in the pleadings or at the commencement of the trial as to directing questions to Mr Benn’s witness and making submissions on that issue: at [80].
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the Magistrate did not err in law nor did he err on the issue of mixed fact and law raised in the grounds of appeal: at [81]. In dismissing the appeal, her Honour also affirmed the Magistrate’s decision and ordered Mr Benn to pay the State’s costs.
	
	
	Mr Benn seeks leave to challenge the decision of the primary judge.
	


Proposed grounds of appeal


	
	Proposed grounds 1 and 2 of the draft notice of appeal each challenge the primary judge’s conclusion that Mr Benn was seeking to raise a new point on appeal. It is contended that her Honour erred in law in holding that the lawfulness of Mr Benn’s apprehension was not a matter in issue before the Local Court (ground 1); and in holding that it was necessary for Mr Benn to plead and/or prove the unlawfulness of his apprehension, submitting that those are matters for which the State carried the onus at all times, and which the State had raised in its pleadings (ground 2).
	
	
	Proposed ground 3 is a general complaint that her Honour erred in law in failing to find that the apprehension and assault of Mr Benn was unlawful.
	


Mr Benn’s submissions


	
	In oral argument, counsel for Mr Benn adopted a more refined approach to the scope of the proposed grounds of appeal.
	
	
	First, counsel for Mr Benn ultimately accepted that there was no challenge to the legality of Mr Benn’s apprehension and detention by police officers relying upon s 22 of the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	Secondly, the argument sought to be advanced on appeal was confined to two matters. The first and primary matter was directed to the question of what constituted the exercise of reasonable force in apprehending and detaining Mr Benn. It was submitted that it was necessary to have regard to all of the surrounding circumstances, including what was said to him by the police officers, and that there could not have been a reasonable exercise of force in the circumstances of the present case unless there was a Christie v Leachinsky warning given to Mr Benn before discharge of the Taser.
	
	
	The complaint made was that the primary judge had erred in dismissing ground 3 of the appeal below (which was directed to this argument) on the basis that it was not part of the case conducted by Mr Benn at trial.
	
	
	The second matter advanced by Mr Benn was that, in the circumstances of the present case, reasonable force did not involve the use of the Taser because the Magistrate erred in finding that it was perfectly clear to Mr Benn what police intentions were. Counsel for Mr Benn acknowledged that this complaint depended upon an acceptance of Mr Benn’s submission that there was a joinder of issue on the question of unlawful apprehension and detention.
	


Matters not argued in this Court


	
	As already indicated, the premise of Mr Benn’s submissions on the appeal below was that the common law requirements of arrest apply to the exercise of the powers of apprehension and detention conferred by s 22 of the Mental Health Act, or alternatively inform the factual question as to whether there has been an exercise of reasonable force in the exercise of the power of apprehension and detention conferred by s 22. The parties did not direct any attention in this Court to whether that premise was warranted having regard to the terms of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibility) Act 2002 (NSW) (LEPRA), in particular ss 4(1), 5(1), 201 and 202.
	
	
	Section 4(1) states that unless LEPRA otherwise provides expressly or by implication, the Act does not limit the functions, obligations and liabilities that a police officer has as a constable at common law: s 4(1)(a). Section 5(1) provides that LEPRA does not limit the functions that a police officer has under an Act specified in Schedule 1 (which, relevantly, includes the Mental Health Act). Part 15 of LEPRA headed “Safeguards relating to powers” applies to the exercise of various powers by police officers including the power of arrest: s 201(1)(a). Section 202 relevantly provides that a police officer who exercises a power of arrest must provide certain information to the subject of the exercise of that power, including the reason for the exercise of the power: s 202(1)(c). Importantly however, s 201(3) provides that Part 15 of LEPRA does not apply to the exercise of a power that is conferred, relevantly, by the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	The facts in Riley preceded the introduction of LEPRA. That case concerned s 24 of the Mental Health Act 1990 (NSW), the predecessor provision to s 22 of the 2007 Mental Health Act, which is in similar but not identical terms to s 24 of the 1990 Act. Whether the difference in language is material was not the subject of argument in this Court. Nor was any argument directed to the question of whether a person subject to apprehension and detention under s 22 of the Mental Health Act is entitled to be told the basis on which he or she is being detained, having regard to the exclusion of Part 15 of LEPRA with respect to the exercise of the powers conferred by the Mental Health Act. One matter relevant to that question is the interrelationship between ss 4(1) and 201(3) of LEPRA. Another is the question of whether and to what extent a police officer’s power to apprehend and detain a person under s 22 is in the nature of a power of arrest.
	
	
	It is unnecessary for the disposition of the present application to express any view on these matters. Nor would it be appropriate to do so in circumstances where neither party addressed them in either their written or oral submissions.
	


Disposition of the application


	
	Ordinarily, it is only appropriate to grant leave where there is an issue of principle, a question of general importance, or an injustice which is reasonably clear, in the sense of going beyond what is merely arguable: Jaycar Pty Ltd v Lombardo [2011] NSWCA 284 at [46]. It is well established that it is not sufficient merely to show that the trial judge was arguably wrong: see Be Financial Pty Ltd as Trustee for Be Financial Operations Trust v Das [2012] NSWCA 164 (Be Financial) at [32].
	
	
	There are two further considerations which are relevant here.
	
	
	The first is that where small claims are involved, it is important that there be early finality in determination of litigation, otherwise the costs that will be involved are likely to swamp the money involved in the dispute: Carolan v AMF Bowling Pty Ltd [1995] NSWCA 69 (Cole JA); Zelden v Sewell [2011] NSWCA 56 at [22] (Campbell JA, Young JA agreeing); Be Financial at [37] -[39] (Basten JA). Here the amount in issue is acknowledged to be less than $100,000; Mr Benn is seeking a second-level appeal with respect to a Local Court decision; and the relief sought by Mr Benn, if leave were granted and the appeal allowed, would involve a remittal of the matter to the District Court or alternatively the Local Court for the assessment of damages.
	
	
	The second and related consideration is the need for restraint in permitting a second-level appeal in relation to decisions in the Local Court. That need is reinforced by the requirement of s 56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) (Civil Procedure Act) that courts give effect to the overriding purpose of that Act and the rules of court being “to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings”.
	
	
	Proposed ground 1 does not raise any issue of principle or question of general importance. Nor is any error demonstrated in her Honour’s conclusion that in putting this argument Mr Benn was seeking on appeal to rely on a new point which included that he had been unlawfully apprehended or detained. That argument had two limbs. One was the contention that absent any warning there could be lawful apprehension and no lawful justification for the discharge of the Taser. The other was the contention that the lawfulness of the apprehending by compliance with the common law requirements in Christie v Leachinsky determined the question whether the discharge of the Taser involved the exercise of reasonable force.
	
	
	Contrary to Mr Benn’s submissions, there was no (implied) joinder of issue on the pleadings as to the lawfulness of the apprehension: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (UCPR) r 14.27(2). So much was expressly accepted in Mr Benn’s written submissions at trial in the Local Court (see [15] above). There, Mr Benn argued that the “real issue” raised by the State’s reliance upon the powers conferred by ss 22 and 81 of the Mental Health Act was whether the police officer used reasonable force to restrain Mr Benn.
	
	
	Nor was it part of the case conducted by Mr Benn in the Local Court that compliance with the common law requirements in Christie v Leachinsky determined the question whether the discharge of the Taser involved the exercise of “reasonable force”. That matter was first mentioned in Mr Benn’s supplementary written submissions filed 24 March 2015, but, as the primary judge correctly observed, by then it was too late. The trial was over.
	
	
	If Mr Benn had intended to rely upon that matter as informing that question, it should have been pleaded, being a matter which, if not pleaded specifically, may take the other party by surprise. That obligation applies not only to a plaintiff in his or her statement of claim: UCPR, r 14.14(1), but to any subsequent pleading, which would include a reply: UCPR, r 14.14(2). Not having raised the matter in his statement of claim, it was open to Mr Benn to file a reply, with leave, raising the issue of the lawfulness of his apprehension by the police officers. Leave is required to file a reply in the Local Court: UCPR, r 14.4(2).
	
	
	That is not to say that Mr Benn bore the onus of proof on the issue of the exercise of reasonable force. The onus of proof in establishing lawful justification for the Tasering, including the use of reasonable force in exercising the power under s 22 of the Mental Health Act, rested upon the State. Nonetheless, the argument sought to be relied upon by Mr Benn on the appeal below, raised matters which should have been specifically pleaded at trial.
	
	
	Accepting that the issue of failure to give a warning had not been specifically pleaded by Mr Benn, it was incumbent upon him, preferably earlier, but at the latest, at the opening of the trial, to take steps to ensure the other party to the dispute was cognisant of what the issues sought to be raised were. This follows from the requirements of s 56(3) of the Civil Procedure Act, which provides that a party to civil proceedings is under a duty to assist the court to further the “overriding purpose”, as stated above at [56]. The duty mandated by s 56 is not a new phenomenon. It reflects in part what had earlier been described as the “cards on the table” approach to litigation: see Boyes v Collins (2000) 23 WAR 123; [2000] WASCA 344 (Ipp J, Pidgeon and Wallwork JJ agreeing); White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4] (Allsop J); and Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd v Gordian Runoff Ltd [2008] NSWCA 243 at [160]-[162] (Allsop P, Beazley and Campbell JJA agreeing). That approach applies just as much to proceedings in the Local Court as it does to long and complex trials in the Commercial List of the Supreme Court.
	
	
	Here there was no opening at trial by counsel for Mr Benn which outlined the case or the issues likely to arise. After dealing with certain procedural matters, including a subpoena, counsel for Mr Benn called him to give his evidence in chief. The primary judge was correct to conclude that at no stage during the conduct of the trial was the State alerted to the issue which Mr Benn first raised in his supplementary submissions. To that point the absence of various warnings was not relied on as relevant to whether the use of the Taser constituted “reasonable force”.
	
	
	Although the Magistrate addressed and rejected that argument, the primary judge was correct to observe that it was too late for Mr Benn to seek to rely upon the significance of the absence of any particular warnings to the lawfulness of any apprehending. Mr Benn did not challenge the primary judge’s finding as to the prejudice suffered by the State if that argument was allowed to be made. The State was denied the opportunity to make different forensic decisions, including cross-examination and making submissions on the issue belatedly raised by Mr Benn.
	
	
	Leave to appeal should be refused in respect of proposed ground 1.
	
	
	Proposed ground 2 asserts that the primary judge reversed the onus of proof on the issue of exercise of reasonable force, when stating that Mr Benn had failed to plead any alleged unlawful apprehension or detention. This ground is misconceived. As explained above, her Honour’s reference to the need to plead that matter specifically was not related to the question of onus of proof. Rather, there being no claim by Mr Benn for either wrongful arrest or false imprisonment (nor could such a claim be made in the Local Court), any allegation of unlawful apprehension or detention was a matter which, if not specifically pleaded, may take the other party by surprise.
	
	
	There was no error in her Honour’s approach to the significance of the absence of any pleading challenging the lawfulness of Mr Benn’s apprehension or detention, or the failure to give a Christie v Leachinsky warning.
	
	
	Further and importantly, aside from the pleadings, as her Honour found, what was fatal to Mr Benn’s appeal below was the way in which Mr Benn had conducted his case at trial in the Local Court. That case did not raise the issue of unlawful apprehension or detention as either precluding lawful justification for the discharge of the Taser, or informing the factual question of the exercise of reasonable force.
	
	
	Leave to appeal should be refused in respect of proposed ground 2.
	
	
	Proposed ground 3 repeats the complaint made in ground 4 of the appeal before the primary judge that the Magistrate’s factual finding – that it was perfectly clear what the police officers’ intentions were – was against the weight of the evidence. The immediate difficulty for that ground was that it was not directed to a question of law.
	
	
	Before the primary judge, Mr Benn submitted that “there is an inference open that Mr Benn thought he could simply leave the public place and walk home, which is what he tried to do”. The primary judge rejected this submission given the evidence of the police officers that Mr Benn was told that he was not allowed to go home as he was threatening to kill himself: see [75]-[76] of the primary judge’s reasons set out at [37] above.
	
	
	No issue of principle or question of general importance is raised by this ground. Nor has Mr Benn demonstrated that the primary judge was arguably wrong in rejecting a factual challenge to the Magistrate’s conclusion. Leave to appeal should be refused in respect of proposed ground 3.
	
	
	One further matter should be mentioned. The State submitted in the alternative that, on the findings made by the Magistrate, the circumstances of the apprehension of Mr Benn by the police exercising the power conferred by s 22 of the Mental Health Act, fell within either of two well-recognised exceptions to the common law requirements in Christie v Leachinsky. One was that Mr Benn must have been aware of the general nature of the reason for his apprehension. The other, and alternative exception, was that Mr Benn produced a situation which made it impracticable to inform him of the reason for his apprehension. These submissions assumed that those common law principles continued to apply to the exercise of the powers of detention conferred by s 22 and 81 of the Mental Health Act.
	
	
	The State pointed to the Magistrate’s findings, referred to above, that (a) all the police actions made it clear that the police officers’ intention was to detain Mr Benn; (b) Mr Benn was resisting that intention; (c) Senior Constable Reddell continually offered to take Mr Benn to the hospital; (d) ultimately, Mr Benn attempted to get away from the police encircling him at the roundabout; and (e) a warning would most likely to have led to reaction, resistance or violence by Mr Benn.
	
	
	Although these findings were not specifically directed to the exceptions to the Christie v Leachinsky warnings, there is much force in each of the State’s alternative submissions. However, in light of the conclusion that leave to appeal should be refused, it is unnecessary to consider these matters further.
	


Conclusion


	
	Mr Benn has failed to demonstrate any basis for a grant of leave to appeal. I propose the following orders:
	


1   Extend the time for filing the summons seeking leave to appeal to 27 May 2016.

2   Summons dismissed with costs.


	
	JOHNSON J: I agree with the reasons and proposed orders of Gleeson JA.

		18 November 2016",2016-11-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2954025,R v Hart (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 1612,"Campbell Hart stood trial in Albury in July this year on an indictment which charged him with murdering Luke Hargrave on 29 October 2013. He entered a plea of not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. By its verdict delivered on 21 July 2016 the jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. It falls to me to sentence him now for this crime.
	
	
	There are seven related offences to which Mr Hart has pleaded guilty, which I am also required to deal with under s 168 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). My power in relation to those matters is subject to the limitation imposed on the Local Court by s 58 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	By its verdict the jury has determined Mr Hart’s legal responsibility for the death of Mr Hargrave. It is my obligation to find the facts relevant to the offending, to determine its objective seriousness and Mr Hart’s moral culpability. I am not required to second guess the jury or attempt to divine their reasons for the verdict they delivered. It is fundamental that the deliberations of juries remain confidential. Moreover, although the jury’s verdict was unanimous, their reasons for it need not have been. The alternative verdict of manslaughter was left for their consideration on a number of different bases, both as to voluntary and involuntary manslaughter. It is legally possible that each of the different bases appealed to some jurors.
	
	
	Accordingly, I must determine the facts for myself on the basis of the evidence led at the trial and on the proceedings on sentence, bearing in mind for sentencing purposes that the prosecution bears the onus of proving beyond reasonable doubt the facts underpinning Mr Hart’s moral culpability, and any features of them aggravating the seriousness of the offending. The defence bear the onus of proving mitigating factors for sentencing purposes on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	The short facts relied upon by the Crown are that Mr Hart shot Mr Hargrave in the head with a .22 calibre pen gun. The bullet lodged in a part of the brain known as the pons, causing death. Mr Hargrave and Mr Hart were the only two people present in the room where and when the shooting occurred. Two other persons, a Miss Lekic, Mr Hargrave’s partner, and a friend of his, Ms Bromham were present elsewhere in the house. Mr Hart quit the premises immediately after the shooting asserting to Ms Lekic and Ms Bromham that Mr Hargrave had shot at him. The pen gun was a single-shot weapon and only one discharge was heard by the witnesses.
	
	
	Mr Hart left the scene in a black Holden utility, driving some distance from the Albury suburb of Lavington where the shooting took place, before destroying the vehicle by fire. The pen gun was never recovered. The incineration of the car is the subject matter of sequence 6 (H52681852), the charge of intentionally destroying property by fire.
	


Salient background facts


	
	There is no issue that Mr Hart and Mr Hargrave were friends, although the former was somewhat younger than the latter. They both came from hard-working families in the Albury community and each inherited a strong work ethic. Neither had the advantage of particular affluence or a higher education, but both seemed to have been successful in making something of themselves before being gripped by the destructive illicit drug “ice”. Both were interested in and good at sports; each was a hard worker; and both, by their early twenties, had achieved a commendable level of success in life. Both had acquired property in the sense that each was paying off a mortgage and had formed a stable relationship. Mr Hargrave had three children and Mr Hart one. Ice eventually deprived both of them of their domestic relationships.
	
	
	Each started using ice for recreational purposes. In its insidious way, both became habituated to it. Each literally took a fatal turn by becoming involved in the distribution and supply of ice in the Albury area. Both had been involved in this on a commercial basis for some time before the shooting occurred. Sometimes they collaborated on deals and sometimes they operated separately. Although they remained friends, their involvement in this illegal trade lead to financial tensions and other disagreements between them. The evidence established to my satisfaction, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Hart developed a degree of resentment against Mr Hargrave because of the latter’s botched attempt to “cook-up” a batch of ice by cutting it with an inert substance. The resulting product was of very poor quality and did not sell well, leading to customer dissatisfaction and a drug debt to their up-line supplier. This was suggested by the Crown as a possible motive for the shooting.
	
	
	Additionally, Mr Hargrave was strapped for cash to participate in a new deal which was current at the time of the shooting. Mr Hart assisted him in this regard by providing a sum of money in exchange for the black Holden utility owned by Mr Hargrave. I have expressed myself in this stilted language because it’s not quite clear to me from the evidence whether the money paid was: an “advance” for which Mr Hart took possession of the ute as security; a part-payment for the vehicle; or the full payment for the vehicle. There was probably a disagreement between them about this which was another source of resentment between them. It was said by the Crown to provide an additional motive for the shooting because Mr Hargrave was reluctant to hand the registration papers over to Mr Hart. The particulars to sequence 6 assert that the ute is the property of Mr Hargrave, a question about which minds may well differ given this transaction. That the subject property belongs to another, even if jointly with the accused, is an element of the offence under s 195 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). By his plea of guilty, Mr Hart is taken to have admitted all the necessary elements of the offence and I will proceed on the basis that the ute still belonged to Mr Hargrave.
	
	
	In any event, as at 29 October 2013, both had a financial stake in the attempt to purchase a quantity of drugs in Sydney for distribution in Albury. The drugs were to be purchased through an Asian crime gang with whom Mr Hargrave had made some contact. Mr Hargrave had facilitated payment for the drugs by electronic fund transfer to a nominated TAB account. A friend of Mr Hargrave, also known to Mr Hart, was sent to Sydney to collect the drugs but had become incommunicado. This was a great source of anxiety, particularly to Mr Hargrave, but probably to them both. This may have been a further source of friction between them. Repeated anxious attempts were made by Mr Hargrave to contact his friend in Sydney in the hours leading up to his death, but to no avail. As events occurred, the friend in Sydney was out of his depth and unable to close the deal.
	


Illicit drug use, paranoid and delusional thinking


	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, that for weeks, if not months, before 29 October 2013, Mr Hart was suffering from a substance induced mental disorder due, in particular, to his ice habit. Evidence at the trial was given by two consultant forensic psychiatrists, Dr Anna Farrar for the defence and Dr Yvonne Skinner for the prosecution. They differed about the diagnosis. Dr Farrar was of the view that Mr Hart suffered from a substance induced psychotic disorder, whereas Dr Skinner proffered the alternative diagnosis of stimulant or substance use disorder. It emerged from the course of the evidence that despite this both agreed that Mr Hart’s condition was a recognised psychiatric condition. Both also agreed his condition caused a significant impairment of his social, occupational and other important activities of daily life. Both agreed that it gave rise to psychotic symptoms. Dr Farrar’s view seemed to be that they were the most prominent characteristic of the condition. Dr Skinner thought them episodic. But there is no doubt that they both accepted that he had significant clinical paranoia and developed a delusional belief system. His paranoia and delusions centred on the belief that he was under physical and electronic surveillance by the police. These beliefs extended to the conviction that cameras had been placed by police in the ceiling of his home and in the home of a neighbour across the street to watch his activities. He also believed that midgets were in the roof cavity of his home watching him on behalf of the police and that drones were in the air watching his movements and activities.
	
	
	I interpolate that the activities of people involved in the drug trade may well be monitored by police, including electronically. It is commonplace that much of the evidence in drug trials consists of recordings of lawfully intercepted telephone conversations of the persons involved. Moreover, footage obtained through optical surveillance is often tendered. There is no evidence, however, that such surveillance was in fact being carried out of Mr Hart or of Mr Hargrave. Both psychiatrists accepted that his beliefs in that regard were delusional and clinically paranoid. Mr Hart also suffered from auditory hallucinations, but these were not very prominent; did not involve distinct voices; and were not of the type commanding him to act in certain ways.
	
	
	More importantly, the lay evidence clearly established, as the psychiatrists accepted, that over the weeks and months leading up to 29 October, there was a noticeable deterioration in Mr Hart’s functioning in the activities of daily life. His relationship with his partner had broken down and he was seeing other women, including sex workers. His occupational functioning went from being a valued employee to him not showing up for work. His paranoia was such that he heavily padlocked the gates to his home and reinforced the shed from where, I infer, he conducted his drug business. He installed CCTV cameras of his own.
	
	
	One of the related offences (H54103023) provides an obvious and bizarre example of Mr Hart’s paranoid and deluded thinking. Sometime between 16 and 18 October 2013, Mr Hart broke into the then unoccupied dwelling directly across the street looking for the surveillance cameras he was sure had been placed there to watch him. During his search, he attempted to gain access to the roof cavity, damaged a skylight, and knocked a hole in a wall. He also knocked holes in the ceiling of his own home in the time leading up to the shooting, searching for the surveillance cameras he thought were there. He told friends about the midgets he believed were carrying out surveillance in his roof and purported to film them with his mobile phone. He showed them this blank recording.
	
	
	I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these matters are examples of clinically significant paranoid and delusional thinking. There are many other such matters detailed in the evidence that was lead at trial which it is unnecessary to record here.
	


Opinion and diagnosis by psychiatrists on abnormality of mind


	
	Dr Skinner was of the opinion that the stimulant use disorder which she diagnosed was “certainly” affecting Mr Hart’s employment, relationship with his partner and his relationships with other people who were once close friends. It was affecting his day-to-day functioning (740.34T). She accepted that he also suffered from a substance induced psychotic disorder, the symptoms of which fluctuated in intensity (786.20 – 40T). Dr Skinner accepted that his condition was an underlying condition giving rise to an abnormality of mind capable of substantially impairing Mr Hart’s capacity to understand events, judge right from wrong, and control himself. But in her opinion, whether his capacity in those regards was affected at the time of the shooting depended upon whether he was actually deluded at the precise time of the shooting (787.5 - .30T).
	
	
	On Dr Farrer’s view, a stimulant use disorder would not give rise to an abnormality of the mind, but the substance induced psychotic disorder would (731T). The latter was, in her opinion, the operative condition. It would have increased Mr Hart’s impulsivity or risk taking behaviour and impaired his decision making skills and judgments. She also expressed the view (in the Report of 20 June 2016) that the condition impaired his ability to form a specific intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm such as is required as a legal element of the crime of murder. Dr Farrer expressed the opinion that at the time of the shooting Mr Hart:
	


“is no longer able to reality test; he doesn't know what's real and what's not real and as a result his actions are influenced by his delusional beliefs and his perceptions and, therefore, that affects his judgment making capability and his ability to know what's right from wrong essentially.” (713.5T)


	
	To the extent to which there is a difference between the opinions of Dr Skinner and Dr Farrer as to whether Mr Hart’s mental capacities were impaired by abnormality of mind arising from the underlying condition at the time of the shooting, I prefer the evidence of Dr Farrer. Her evidence is more consistent with the jury’s verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Moreover, the Crown submits, in light of the verdict, that this is the conclusion I should reach. Mr Wilson SC for the accused goes further, submitting that I should accept Dr Farrer’s opinion that the underlying condition impaired Mr Hart’s capacity to form the specific intent necessary for the crime of murder. Learned Senior Counsel is not raising a defence of mental illness, rather he submits that as a question of fact, in the light of Mr Hart’s psychiatric condition, I should find that the Crown could not have proved specific intent beyond reasonable doubt. To determine this, it is necessary to examine the evidence available as to what happened leading up to, and at the time, of the shooting.
	


Events leading up to the shooting


	
	At the outset, it is significant to record my finding that there is no doubt that at the time of the shooting Mr Hart was, quite apart from the effects of the underlying condition, intoxicated by the ice he had smoked frequently that day. The effect of this voluntary intoxication, as opposed to the effect of the underlying condition needs to be put to one side when determining culpability (s 23A(3) Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)).    
	
	
	Neither Mr Hargrave nor Mr Hart slept much the night before the shooting: Mr Hargrave because of his anxiety and concern about the arrangements for the Sydney drug deal; and Mr Hart because of his ice-fuelled sex drive, leading him to seek out sex with his then lover, and later with a sex worker. During the day of 29 October 2013, he ended his relationship with his long-time partner, the mother of his son, on ugly terms. Such was the concern of family and friends about his aberrant behaviour that an old friend, a respectable member of the community, was asked by family to speak to him. He saw him twice that day. Once, as he approached the premises, he saw Mr Hart lurking at the premises across the street, still looking for cameras which were not there.
	
	
	On his second visit Mr Hart gave his friend two firearms belonging to his father he had kept. The old friend took them and surrendered them to police. These guns are the subject of related offences: the unauthorised Hammerli self-loading pistol is sequence 3 (H5268252); and the unregistered .22 winchester repeating rifle is sequence 4 (H52681852). I interpolate that an unregistered air rifle was located by police executing a search warrant at Mr Hart’s home. This was sequence 5 (H52681852).
	
	
	Mr Hart had been smoking ice at different times during the day. After his second meeting with the old friend, Mr Hart went out attending a retail outlet where he purchased another phone. The shop assistant formed the view that he was drug affected. He also visited a pub consuming 1 mixed drink before heading for Mr Hargrave’s place.
	
	
	For some time before 29 October 2013, Mr Hart had taken to carrying a loaded pen gun. He had it with him on 29 October 2013. He had said to others that he had acquired it for protection. Possession of the pen gun, a prohibited firearm, is the subject of sequence 2 (H52681852) another related offence. The evidence is that pen guns are a very basic single-shot firearm usually of crude, home manufacture. They have no safety catch and are fired, usually, by drawing and releasing the spring loaded rear portion of the gun. This generally requires two hands, one to hold the barrel and the second to manipulate the end. But the ballistics evidence was to the effect that it can be done single-handedly, holding the barrel with one’s fingers and drawing the firing pin with the thumb. As they are crude weapons it may also be that the application of blunt force to the end of the firing pin would be sufficient to discharge the gun.
	
	
	Mr Hart arrived at Mr Hargrave’s home at about 7 pm. They were apparently on good and friendly terms. Mr Hargrave’s partner, Ms Lekic invited Mr Hart to join them for dinner which invitation he gratefully accepted. There was no sign of any difficulty between the young men at this time. Ms Lekic was familiar with Mr Hart, knew him to be an ice user and was aware of his symptoms of paranoia. Her impression was that he seemed normal that evening. I infer normal for him. After dinner Mr Hart and Mr Hargrave went for a drive. The men left around 8 pm, attending Mr Hart’s home, a bottle shop and a service station. Again, there was no reason to suppose that their interaction during this period was other than amicable.
	
	
	During their absence, Mr Hart had probably shown Mr Hargrave his pen gun, for when they returned to Mr Hargrave’s home at about 10:30 pm, Mr Hargrave remarked to the women “look at Cammie’s new toy”, referring to the pen gun. There was further conversation about pen guns.
	


What happened in the cinema room


	
	From about 10:40 pm, Mr Hargrave and Mr Hart were in a room in Mr Hargrave’s home referred to as the cinema room because it contained a home entertainment unit. While they were there, Ms Bromham entered. She had received a phone call from a Mr Quirk who gave evidence at the trial. He seemed to be involved in various criminal activities. On this occasion, Mr Quirk was spruiking the sale of pen guns. Having seen Mr Hart’s gun, Mr Hargrave was interested in acquiring one for himself and invited Mr Quirk to ring him, which he did, at about 10:45 pm. They spoke on the telephone for two minutes, presumably about the purchase of a pen gun.
	
	
	After Mr Bromham had left the cinema room following the discussion about Mr Quirk’s offer, she heard the door slam and lock. An emphasis was placed upon this circumstance, the inference being that Mr Hart was the person who performed those actions. It was said that something about his intention with regards to Mr Hargrave could be drawn from that circumstance in conjunction with the other circumstances.
	
	
	Mr Hargrave’s day job was selling firewood, a business he had pursued for some years prior to 29 October 2013. An acquaintance, Shannon Turnbull, who had welding skills, was going to help him modify a trailer for use in the firewood business. There had been some problem organising a mutual time. Mr Turnbull had telephoned Mr Hargrave at about 8:15 pm and they had spoken for a little over a minute. No arrangements had been made. Mr Turnbull tried to phone Mr Hargrave again at about 10:05 pm., but missed him. Mr Hargrave returned Mr Turnbull’s call from the cinema room at 10:45 pm. They spoke about the trailer. The call log prepared by the prosecution (Exhibit T) shows that that call was of 5 minutes and 2 seconds duration.
	
	
	Mr Turnbull gave evidence on 7 July 2016. I infer from what he said that at the time Mr Hargrave was shot, he and Mr Hargrave were involved in a somewhat prosaic discussion about fitting the trailer with a hydraulic ram that Mr Hargrave had to convert its body to a tipper body. At trial, Mr Turnbull gave evidence that he was asking Mr Hargrave about the dimension of the hydraulic ram and cylinder. The conversation continued as follows:
	


“Q. He said, ""I don't have the measurements. It will be long enough but,"" is that right?

A. Yes, that sounds correct.

Q. You said to him, ""How high do you want it to lift up?"" And he said, ""I don't really know.""

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And you said, ""High enough for soil or logs to tip or roll out of it,"" is that right?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And he said, ""High enough for stuff to tip out.""

A. Yes, that sounds correct.

Q. At around about that time you heard a sound, is that right?

A. Yes, I'm pretty sure that was at about the time.

Q. And how would you describe the sound?

A. Like a kitchen cupboard door shutting or a door slamming.

Q. Did you hear any other sound after that?

A. Not ‑ there was a bit of background noise but nothing significant.

Q. Did you continue talking with Luke after that sound?

A. Yeah, I kept trying talking. I didn't get any response.

Q. Did you get any response from him?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Did you say, ""Hey Luke, Luke, are you listening to me?""

A. Yes, I did.

Q. There was no reply?

A. No, there wasn't.

Q. There was a period of silence, is that right?

A. Yes, that's right.

Q. How long did that silence go for?

A. I think it was, you know, 20 or 30 seconds. Could have been a little bit less, a little bit more.

Q. What did you hear after that?

A. A girl screaming.”


	
	From other circumstances I will relate, I would regard the noise “like … a door slamming” as the sound of the discharge of the pen gun. It is clear that Mr Turnbull remained on the phone for a lengthy period. Lay witnesses are notoriously inaccurate in their estimates of time. An estimate of 20 to 30 seconds is a relatively long one. From the call log (Exhibit T) I find that Ms Bromham attempted to ring triple - 0 at 10:50 and 24 seconds pm. It is therefore more likely that Mr Turnbull probably remained on the phone for as long as 2 minutes before it was disconnected. I infer that the shooting occurred at 10:50 pm.
	
	
	Mr Turnbull was cross-examined to suggest that his recollection of the events of 29 October 2013 was not good and should not be accepted by the jury. It was put that he only remembered the details by refreshing his memory from his statement to police and that even when he made this statement his recollection was not good, and was merely the product of him doing the best he could. However, I accept Mr Turnbull’s evidence in its entirety. Having seen and heard him give evidence, I formed the impression that in substance, the facts as he relayed them were accurate. Moreover, his account fits in with objective and other evidence which I will now recount. In particular, the time of the call was established by the call log by reference to telephone records. The critical fact is that Mr Hargrave was on the phone to Mr Turnbull talking about the trailer at the time he was shot. This was necessarily inconsistent with some other hypotheses put forward as to what happened.
	


The immediate aftermath


	
	Ms Lekic and Ms Bromham, as would be expected, were distraught when they came across Mr Hargrave in the cinema room. Ms Bromham made two calls to emergency services. Neither of them was able to give much evidence about Mr Hargrave’s posture or position when they found him, a matter which assumed some importance, as it was a key circumstance from which an inference about what happened might be drawn.
	
	
	Two friends, talking outside neighbouring premises, who had heard the noise of the shot, saw Mr Hart hurry away and rushed to see what happened and render assistance if necessary. These witnesses were Mr Traveskis and Mr Walker. Their observation, unshaken I thought by cross-examination, was that when they first saw Mr Hargrave he was gripping his mobile telephone in his right hand and his left hand was firmly thrust into the pocket of his shorts. A neurosurgeon, Dr Spittaler, gave evidence about the phenomenon of decerebrate posturing consequent upon an injury to the part of the brain referred to as the pons. In his opinion, it was highly unlikely that Mr Hargrave could have made a voluntary action inserting his left hand into his pocket after being shot. He did accept there might be a short delay before the phenomenon of decerebrate posturing occurred. This made it possible, if his hand was near the pocket at the time of the shooting, that it might force its way into the pocket soon afterwards.
	
	
	This matter is significant particularly in relation to the question of whether the Crown proved the element of specific intent beyond reasonable doubt, and whether it has disproved the possibility that Mr Hart acted in self-defence likewise beyond reasonable doubt. If the hand was not in the pocket at the time of the shooting, it was at least possible that it was pointing the pen gun at Mr Hart immediately prior to a struggle leading to the shooting.
	
	
	In decerebrate posturing, the hand forms a fist with the palms forcing outwards in reaction to the injury to the brain. My understanding is that it is something like tonic-clonic posturing in an epileptic seizure. The Crown argued that given the precise nature of the posturing, it’s at least less likely that the hand could have gone into the pocket after the shot was fired. Further there was no gunshot residue on Mr Hargrave’s left hand nor inside the left pocket. Gunshot residue was found on the outside of the pocket and it seems to me unlikely that the explanation for its absence from the hand and pocket is that it was wiped off during decerebrate posturing after the shooting, or by police or ambulance officers dislodging the hand whilst rendering aid to Mr Hargrave when they arrived.
	
	
	I recall that Ms Lekic thought that the deceased’s arms were by his side when she attended upon him. But I accept the evidence of Mr Traveskis and Mr Walker that Mr Hargrave’s hand was in his pocket. They were sober and impartial and although finding the scene they came upon distressing, it was necessary for them to notice this matter because Mr Traveskis was on the phone to emergency services for 9 minutes during which time he was asked to check for a pulse. It was in this context that he noticed the position of Mr Hargrave’s left hand.
	
	
	The Crown circumstantial case was put on “a strands in the cable” basis. It was not said that the circumstance that Mr Hargrave’s left hand was in his pocket at the time of the shooting was an indispensable intermediate fact requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt. I am nonetheless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hargrave’s hand was in his pocket at the time of the shooting. I have drawn upon the evidence of Mr Turnbull, the circumstance that Mr Hargrave was on the phone speaking about a matter unrelated to his dealings with Mr Hart, the evidence of Mr Traveskis and Mr Walker and the explanation provided by Dr Spitaller to arrive at this conclusion.
	


The various accounts of Mr Hart


	
	Mr Hart has given a number of accounts of the events in the cinema room. He was apprehended outside Albury in the early morning of 30 October 2013. As luck would have it, he was outside the residence of some police officers who spoke with him and called on-duty officers to attend. I have watched audio visual recordings of police interviews with Mr Hart at the scene of his arrest, in the police car when he was conveyed to the station, of his formal record of interview and of the forensic procedures carried out on him under the Law Enforcement Powers and Responsibilities Act 2002 (NSW).  I formed the very firm view, notwithstanding the “timeout” he was allowed before the commencement of the formal interview, that Mr Hart: continued to be affected by the drugs he had consumed; was probably affected by the symptoms of his underlying condition; was probably anxious as Dr Skinner thought because of the ramifications of the events in which he had been involved; and was aware of the desirability of providing an exculpatory account. This combination of factors renders the accounts he gave to the police entirely unreliable. Depending upon whether you count one version as a mere embellishment of another, or as something different again, there are about seven different versions provided to the police. For the various reasons I have given, I am persuaded that not one of them could be relied upon as being even possibly true and I will put the whole of the accounts made to the police to one side.
	
	
	It is convenient at this conjuncture to record that the final related offence to which Mr Hart is pleaded guilty is an allegation of intentionally or recklessly damaging property under s 195 of the Crimes Act. This appears on court attendance notice 8537853251. It’s alleged that as he was being conveyed to a correctional centre from the police station on 30 October 2015 he damaged the seat in the prison van and began jumping on its cushion. He desisted when rebuked by an officer over the loud speaker. The damage involved is estimated at $100.
	
	
	Mr Hart provided an account to his sister, Amanda Cameron twice while in custody. The first occasion was on 9 November 2013. She said “he babbled and mumbled about all different things because he went off with the fairies sometimes” (47.15T). From the psychiatric evidence, I infer that at that time, notwithstanding his abstention from drug use in custody, his thinking would still have been affected by the substance induced mental disorder. Ms Cameron saw him again on 15 and 16 December 2013 at the correctional centre at Long Bay. By then she said he was “much better” (477.35T). This too is consistent with the psychiatric evidence. After abstention for some months, the underlying condition commenced to go into remission. Ms Cameron gave a relatively lengthy account of what her brother told her. It is pertinent to record that Mr Hart told Ms Cameron about his and Mr Hargrave’s movements earlier in the evening in terms consistent with the objectively established facts. These details included the telephone conversation with Mr Quirk or a similar account about the offer of a pen gun for sale. The account included Ms Bromham being involved in this discussion, and her leaving the room.
	
	
	Mr Hart told his sister that while Mr Hargrave was on the phone, presumably to Mr Turnbull, Mr Hargrave was holding Mr Hart’s pen gun in his left hand. Mr Hart decided to leave, and said he would be back. Mr Hargrave pointed the gun at Mr Hart saying “before you go, put the money on the bed”. Initially Mr Hart thought Mr Hargrave was mucking around, but the latter stood up and pointed the pen gun at Mr Hart’s head. Mr Hart grabbed Mr Hargrave’s elbow bending it back, and tried to wrest the pen gun from him when it discharged, fatally wounding Mr Hargrave. As Mr Hargrave fell, his left hand went into his pocket. Mr Hart told his sister that he panicked and fled the scene. He explained that he set fire to the car with the intention of committing suicide, but got out “after it got too hot” (482.5T).
	
	
	The difficulty I have accepting this account as one that could possibly be true is that when Mr Hart gave evidence in the proceedings on sentence he denied any recollection of the circumstances leading to Mr Hargrave’s death. In cross-examination he was asked the following questions:
	


“Q. Just thinking back, this is something that occurred three years ago; right?

A. Yes, a long time ago.

Q. And you have had plenty of time to think about what happened that night, haven't you, since it happened?

A. I think about stuff every day, yes.

Q. And you have had plenty of time to think about what happened in the room that night, haven't you?

A. I have had plenty of time.

Q. And having that opportunity to think about it, does anything come back into your mind, into your memory as to what occurred?

A. I don't know what's real and what's not. I can't ‑ I have no recollection.

Q. But what is your memory of what happened inside the room leading up to the shooting?

A. I don't know. I can't remember clearly.

Q. So when you say you can't remember clearly, do you have a memory of some things that took place?

A. Time's all distorted. Not really, no. I was like a zombie. Don't know.

Q. Were you standing or seated when the shot was discharged?

A. I can't remember. No recollection.

Q. Was Luke standing or seated when the shot was discharged?

A. I don't know.

Q. Luke was on the phone when the gun shot discharged, wasn't he?

A. So it says in trial, but I can't remember.

Q. You were using your phone yourself shortly before the firearm was discharged?

A. I can't remember.

Q. When the shot was discharged I suggest to you Luke was talking on the phone and he had his other hand inside his pocket; what do you say about that?”

A. I can’t remember.


	
	It appeared from the cross-examination that Mr Hart had no recollection at all of any relevant circumstance surrounding the shooting. He could not remember rushing from the house, getting in the car, driving it out of town and setting fire to it. He denied that he was attempting to avoid answering difficult questions (20.45T); (24.35T).
	
	
	Given that I accept that Mr Hart has been entirely abstemious of drugs and alcohol since he has been in custody, and any effect of his previous mental condition on his powers of cognition has resolved, I do not think it possible that he had a clear, actual recollection of the matters narrated to his sister on 15 and 16 December 2013, which has now eroded due to the effluxion of time. That is to say, I do not accept that what he remembered then, he has now forgotten. I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was not being evasive during cross-examination. But if this is so, the reason for his lack of recall must be that no memory was laid down because of the effects of his underlying condition exacerbated by his voluntary intoxication at the time of the shooting. It follows from this that the account given to his sister in December 2013 was pure reconstruction, not based on any actual recollection at all. By then he knew, from the interview and the provision of copies of evidence provided by the police, the narrative of fact for which the prosecution contended, and perhaps wishing to believe in his own innocence, he came up with a narrative which furthered the exculpatory story of self-defence that he had first proffered as one of the many, conflicting versions given to the police on 30 October 2015.
	


Submissions for the defence


	
	Mr Wilson SC submitted that the facts I should find consistent with the jury’s verdict are those consistent with involuntary manslaughter, or manslaughter by excessive self-defence. In relation to involuntary manslaughter he submitted that because of the circumstantial nature of the case against his client, I could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of circumstances established by the whole of the evidence that Mr Hart deliberately shot at Mr Hargrave with the intention of causing him really serious physical injury. That is to say, I cannot be satisfied that Mr Hart shot Mr Hargrave with a murderous intent albeit one mitigated by the existence of substantial impairment of his mental capacities by reason of an abnormality of mind arising out of the psychiatric condition. Mr Wilson submitted that the present case fell into that category where the primary facts cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt and all that can be said, consistent with the jury’s verdict, is that Mr Hart must have committed some act consistent with a verdict of manslaughter by wrongful and dangerous act. It was posited that the wrongful act was the introduction of a loaded prohibited weapon into the close confines of the cinema room of Mr Hargrave’s home. That act was also dangerous because, given its crude or simple character, the pen gun was highly likely to go off unless handled very carefully. This, it was said, is a hypothesis favourable to Mr Hart which had not been excluded by the Crown. That Mr Hart fired intending to inflict really serious harm was not the only rational inference consistent with the whole of the circumstances established by the acceptable evidence.
	
	
	Alternatively, Mr Wilson submitted that I should find that the account given to Ms Cameron on 15 and 16 December 2016 had not been shown to be one that could not reasonably be true. This left open as a reasonable possibility available on the evidence that Mr Hart acted in self-defence even if it is necessary to say, consistent with the verdict, that the force he applied was, in the circumstances as he perceived them, to be unreasonable or disproportionate.
	


Finding of basis of legal responsibility


	
	Contrary to these written submissions, as carefully and as thoroughly as they were advanced in writing and orally, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Hargrave died because Mr Hart deliberately shot him with the pen gun intending to inflict really serious harm. I am at the same time persuaded on the balance of probability that at the time he discharged the gun, Mr Hart’s mental capacity, in particular, to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from a stimulant use disorder or a substance induced psychotic disorder. To my mind, on the evidence it makes little difference which diagnosis is preferred. I am also persuaded, leaving aside the effects of his voluntary intoxication at the time, that the impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. That is to say, I am convinced to the requisite degree that the proper basis for assessing Mr Hart’s culpability is that he is guilty of manslaughter by substantial impairment.
	
	
	I have come to this view by having regard to the whole of the circumstances established by the evidence which I accept. I have found that at the time he received the fatal wound, Mr Hargrave was holding his telephone in his right hand, talking to Mr Turnbull, and his left hand was in his left pocket. This excludes any reasonable possibility that at the moment of discharge Mr Hargrave was holding the pen gun. Moreover, the same circumstances exclude any reasonable possibility that he demanded money from Mr Hart by pointing the gun at him. Had he made such a demand with menace, Mr Turnbull could not have failed to hear. He would hardly have forgotten it. The underlying condition made Mr Hart paranoid and impulsive. There was tension between Mr Hargrave and Mr Hart in relation to the botched cook-up, the transfer ownership of the ute, and the current Sydney deal. I accept that a sober person would hardly think shooting Mr Hargrave was a reasonable way of resolving any of those issues. A sober person would conclude that shooting him would be counter-productive, rendering a satisfactory resolution of those issues impossible. But Mr Hart’s actions cannot be judged by the standards of reasonable sober people. He was clinically paranoid, intoxicated by an insidious drug; and armed.
	
	
	I also infer that his statement to Ms Lekic and Ms Bromham that Mr Hargrave had taken a shot at him; his flight from the scene of the shooting; apparent disposal of the pen gun; and destruction of the car are circumstances which portray consciousness of guilt of the commission of culpable homicide. I have considered whether those matters might be better explained by panic, as Dr Skinner thought possible, or were simply further acts of irrationality. But taking all of the circumstances together, those innocent explanations have been displaced by the cumulative effect of the whole of the evidence. I am well persuaded that the only rational inference available is the shooting of Mr Hargrave is a case of manslaughter by substantial impairment.
	
	
	An additional factor which causes me to conclude that the Crown have excluded self-defence beyond reasonable doubt is that the account given to Ms Cameron on 15 and 16 December 2013 is consistent not with excessive self-defence, but rather with self-defence as a complete justification for what otherwise would have been criminal acts. It’s impossible to regard pushing away a gun pointed either in jest or in seriousness as an unreasonable act. If as the account suggests, Mr Hart, even in his intoxicated paranoid condition, genuinely perceived that Mr Hargrave was threatening to shoot him, using force to push the weapon away and attempting to wrest it from him could on no rational basis constitute unreasonable or disproportionate force. Such a finding would be entirely inconsistent with the verdict of the jury.
	
	
	I am also convinced however that the shooting was an entirely impulsive, spontaneous act. There was no planning or premeditation involved. The crime was borne of the substantial impairment of his ability to control himself because of the abnormality of his mind arising out of his psychiatric condition.
	


Objective seriousness


	
	In R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 12 December 1995, unrep) Gleeson CJ (with the agreement of the other members of the Court) said:
	


“…. the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case.

When the basis of a finding of manslaughter is diminished responsibility, pursuant to s23A of the Crimes Act, what is nevertheless ordinarily involved, and what is involved in the present case, is a conclusion that the taking of human life was the consequence of a deliberate and willed act, performed with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life. The abnormality of mind substantially impairs the offender's mental responsibility for his or her act but it does not negate such responsibility. The reduction in the capacity for self-control which results from the abnormality of mind diminishes the responsibility, but it does not excuse the act.

Making a judgment as to the extent to which, in a given case, responsibility is diminished, can be a difficult task. The hypothesis, however, is that the offender is responsible for a deliberate act which took the life of another person, and which, but for the abnormality of mind, would bear the character of murder.” [Citations omitted]

Clearly this passage is entirely apposite to the circumstances of the present case.


	
	Taking the starting point as the felonious taking of a human life, it is appropriate to acknowledge the receipt of family victim impact statements from Mr Hargrave’s mother, Dianne Hargrave, and his father David Hargrave. Ms Hargrave and Mr Hargrave spoke on behalf of all of the family victims including Mr Hargrave’s sisters and of course his three young children. The account given by each of them, may I say, was very moving. I was greatly touched by the grief of parents required to bury a son in the full flood of life and well before his time. I acknowledge that their pain and loss can never be salved nor will it ebb entirely. I hope that time will ease it. I offer my sincere condolences to all of them for the loss they have suffered. I will take their statements into account in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of Mr Hargrave’s death on members of his immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community by Mr Hart’s offending (s 28 (4) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999).
	
	
	As Mr Wilson very fairly and properly acknowledged in his written submissions:
	


""It is regarded by all thinking persons as offensive to fundamental concepts of equality and justice for criminal courts to value one life as greater than another (R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at [86] (Hunt CJ)""

These principles have particular resonance in the present case. Mr Hargrave’s involvement in the illicit drug trade did not put him beyond the pale of the law’s protection, as apparently it does elsewhere in our region these days. Indeed that consideration does emphasise the wisdom of the principle that the law does not, for the purpose of sentencing for unlawful homicide, evaluate the worth of the life of the victim on some scale of virtue, or by reference to a register of familial affection. The law offers the same protection to all and provides the same denunciation of the actions of all offenders who have taken life.


	
	The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offender. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending: see Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27]. It is also appropriate in assessing objective seriousness, to have regard to any factors which aggravate the offending (s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). It is, however, important to avoid double counting. No additional regard is to be had to any aggravating factor if it is an element of the offence. This is an important consideration in the present case because the elements of the offence include a deliberate act of violence causing fatal injury. The use of a weapon was integral to this. I accept the submission of Mr Wilson that in the circumstances of the particular case, the use of a weapon is not an aggravating factor as such. It is, of course, however, an aggravating factor that the crime was committed in Mr Hargrave’s home. As the Crown submit, it is relevant to bear in mind that Mr Hart introduced a loaded weapon into the home of Mr Hargrave and even before it was used, he showed it to the members of the household who were interested in seeing it. It is relevant that it was a crude homemade device with no apparent safety mechanism, capable of being discharged if force was applied to the end of it. That Mr Hart on my findings intended to inflict very serious bodily injury is significant. Albeit, it is necessary to bear in mind that his legal responsibility is being ameliorated or reduced by reference to his substantial impairment, effectively his mental disability.
	
	
	There is a certain prevalence of firearm offences in the community which is of great concern to law-abiding people. This calls for denunciation. Mr Hart is not to be sentenced for offences for which he has not been convicted, but there is every reason to believe that the use of firearms is particularly prevalent in the illicit drug milieu in which he and Mr Hargrave moved. That the offending may in not insignificant part be explained by his actual level of intoxication on the day is a matter which I consider should be taken into account in the assessment of objective seriousness. In context, this is a circumstance which explains in some measure what happened. It is not in any way a mitigating circumstance (s 21A(5AA)) even if the offending is extremely unlikely to have occurred without it. Nor is it neutral. Illicit drug use is a voluntary activity. Mr Hart chose to use the drugs and must accept responsibility for the consequences of that choice: R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWRL 346 at [257].
	
	
	For all these reasons, and in particular bearing in mind the protean nature of the offence of manslaughter, I assess Mr Hart’s offending as falling into about the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


Mr Hart’s subjective case


	
	As I have already recounted, Mr Hart is a young man who comes from a good background of hardworking people and until he fell into his drug addiction he was an industrious contributing member of the community. Apart from a previous drink driving offence in 2005, he has no prior criminal record. But I cannot find he was of previous good character given his direct involvement in the distribution of illicit drugs in the Albury region.
	
	
	He offered to plead guilty to manslaughter in the Local Court and by law is entitled to a discount on the sentence which would otherwise be imposed for the utilitarian value that plea would have had, had it been accepted. I also regard the plea as an indication of a preparedness to accept responsibility for taking Mr Hargrave’s life. A point to which I will return.
	
	
	Conventionally, an early plea, or relevant offer to plead, can attract a discount of up to 25 per cent for its utilitarian value. The Crown, however, submit that I would not make that allowance in this case because the offer was first made after a contested committal in the Local Court. Although he was arrested on 30 October 2013, the offer to plead was not forthcoming until 28 May 2015. This was the fourth day of the committal. Sixteen crown witnesses had been cross-examined from 25 to 27 February 2015. Considerable preparation including the preparation of extensive written submissions was required before and after February 2015. Oral argument occupied much of the 4th day. The offer to plead came at the conclusion of that lengthy hearing and after the court had made the order committing Mr Hart for trial. I accept that these are relevant factors to the degree of discount that should be allowed. I am of the view that in the particular circumstances of this case, the appropriate discount is 20 per cent.
	
	
	A central factor in the case, of course, has been Mr Hart’s mental health. It is a settled principle of the law of sentencing that mental illness is relevant when fixing a sentence. Where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence as it did here, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. But as against this as Gleeson CJ said in Blacklidge, to a substantial degree Mr Hart’s mental illness has been taken into account in reducing his legal responsibility from what would have been murder to manslaughter. Making a judgment as to the extent to which culpability should be further reduced is a difficult task. It is important in this case that there should not be double counting on this score and I think it relevant to bear in mind that in the particular circumstances of the case, the mental illness itself was brought about by the voluntary act of Mr Hart in choosing to engage in the consumption of illicit drugs, particularly the notorious drug ice.
	
	
	I acknowledge that mental illness may reduce the need for both general and specific deterrence. At least that consideration may be “moderated”. Again, striking the right balance is difficult. Sometimes mental illness will increase the hardship of custody. That circumstance is not relevant here as the evidence is that Mr Hart’s condition is in full remission. It is unlikely to resurface unless he descends into further drug use.
	


Remorse and rehabilitation


	
	I accept that Mr Hart is genuinely remorseful for the offence. As I have said his early offer to plead to manslaughter showed acceptance of responsibility but more significantly, he gave pertinent evidence on oath in relation to this matter in the proceedings on sentence. It is clear that he has been abstemious from drugs and alcohol since he has been in custody and he is clearly aware of the nexus between drug use and his offending. He expressed what I considered to be a genuine determination to stay drug-free for the rest of his life. When asked if there was anything he would like to say to the family victims, he said at [35.15T]:
	


“…. I am fully responsible for everything that’s happened. There is nobody else to blame but me and this is going to be something that’s with me for the rest of my life and I am sure that it’s with you forever too and I am sorry.”

To Mr Hargrave’s children he said [15.40T]:

“… I lost my father and my brother and I understand what it’s like not to have a father and I just feel sorry for the kids. Like, I don’t know how or … sorry is not enough.”


	
	Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that he has been continuously held in classification A2 on remand, he has shown positive progress toward reform which is relevant both to accepting responsibility and prospects of rehabilitation. He said, which I accept, that there are limited opportunities to participate in programs in his classification, but he has completed the Getting Smart program (Exhibit 8), obtained a Certificate of Attainment, or a license, to operate a boom-type elevating work platform and has obtained Certificate 2 in engineering in arc welding and the use of handheld power tools.
	
	
	He has obtained the trust of the corrections authorities sufficiently to obtain employment as a sweeper and at the request of correction officers he has worked as a fitness trainer for other inmates twice a week. These sessions involve him training 30 or so other inmates. He has not incurred any breaches of prison discipline. I record in particular that there is no indication that he has failed any random urine test.
	
	
	In a statement dated 27 July 2016, his sister, Amanda Cameron says that to her observation, the death of their father, death of their brother in a road accident in America and the illness of Mr Hart’s grandmother were circumstances that contributed to his descent into illicit drug use. I accept that genuineness of her view but these circumstances do not negate the element of choice involved in illicit drug use. However, and more pertinently, she believes that her brother is “a new and rehabilitated person, he even has a different demeanour and outlook on life than he did before he took the drugs” (my emphasis). Mr Hart telephones his sister every weekend and on occasions has told her:
	


“how terrible he feels for [Mr Hargrave’s] parents, brothers and sisters as he knows only too well what it is like to lose people close to you. His quote to me has been “I am so, so sorry I never meant or wanted any of this to happen, Luke was my friend”.


	
	In a supplementary report dated 27 October 2016, Dr Farrer, who re-interviewed and assessed Mr Hart over 1.5 hours, recorded his expressions of remorse. Dr Farrer recorded that Mr Hart became tearful and upset when discussing the offence, the effect of the offence on the victim’s family and the effect of the offence on his own family.
	
	
	I am well satisfied that Mr Hart is truly remorseful for his offending.
	
	
	Dr Farrer confirmed that Mr Hart’s substance induced psychotic disorder remained in remission which she regarded as “sustained”. I inferred that she regarded his prognosis as good.
	
	
	Dr Farrer also carried out a statistical assessment of Mr Hart’s risk of violent reoffending. She set out her results in full in her report and recorded that overall he presents a low risk of future violence.
	
	
	It is not without relevance that he has been baptised as a Christian and attends church services in custody.
	
	
	In the long term he hopes to get back to useful work in the community after his release, particularly in a rural environment. He intends to continue participating in drug and alcohol counselling after his release.
	
	
	I accept that Mr Hart has very good prospects of rehabilitation and presents a low risk of further offending in the future.
	
	
	All of this taken together amounts to a very strong subjective case. However, I remind myself that these matters cannot be permitted to swamp the necessity to impose a sentence which is proportionate to the objective seriousness of the offending.
	


Sentence for manslaughter


	
	It is necessary for me to take into account all of the facts, matters and circumstances that I have set out relevant to sentencing this offence for this offence when fixing the sentence. It cannot be doubted that no penalty other than full-time imprisonment is warranted. I am required by law to impose a sentence which fixes a maximum term and a minimum term that Mr Hart will be required to serve. The minimum term is referred to as the non-parole period. It represents the minimum period that justice requires Mr Hart serve in custody for his offending. The minimum term should be 75 per cent of the maximum term, except when there are special circumstances justifying a variation of that ratio.
	
	
	Although I must fix a non-parole period, no one should assume that release to parole when an offender is first eligible is automatic. The decision about whether to release an offender to parole is made by a branch of the executive government, the State Parole Authority. Generally it will not order an offender’s release to parole unless it is satisfied that he is indeed eligible. Eligibility will depend in large measure upon the Authority’s assessment of the risk the offender may present to the community. An important consideration will be the degree to which the offender has demonstrated by his good behaviour in custody, and his participation in available programs of rehabilitation that he is at least well on the way to reformation. As I have said, I am satisfied that Mr Hart is well advanced on this path. He will need to continue on it if he is to be released when first eligible.
	
	
	I am required by law to advise Mr Hart that this offending falls within the definition of a serious violence offence under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW). This circumstance should provide an added incentive for him to continue on the path of rehabilitation as that Act provides for the making of continuing detention orders or extended supervision orders for high risk violent offenders beyond the term of the sentence imposed, if on the application of the State, the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender continues to pose an unacceptable risk of committing a serious violence offence if released into the community.
	
	
	Bearing in mind all of the matters to which I have referred, including the need for retribution and denunciation of Mr Hart’s offending; an appropriate degree of general and specific deterrence; and the maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment provided by law, the term of imprisonment I would have imposed upon Mr Hart for the manslaughter of Mr Hargrave, but for his early offer to plead guilty to manslaughter, is 10 years. Allowing a discount of 20 per cent for the early plea, I propose to fix a maximum term of imprisonment of 8 years.
	
	
	Mr Hart has been held on remand for more than 3 years since his arrest. I hasten to add this is not the fault of the prosecution or of the courts, but is the product of the many interlocutory applications that have been brought in his case along the road to finality. Nonetheless, this is his first time in custody and he has been held in more onerous circumstances on remand than may have been available to him, had he, for one reason or another, been dealt with sooner. I am satisfied that these considerations constitute special circumstances and that the statutory ratio ought to be varied in Mr Hart’s favour. I think it appropriate that the non-parole period should be fixed at two-thirds of the maximum sentence. This equates with a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months. This should encourage his continuing rehabilitation and takes into account the need to impose penalties for the related offences.
	
	
	I have had regard to the pattern of sentences suggested by the comparable cases and statistics provided by Mr Wilson SC. Given the protean nature of this offence I think nothing is to be gained by me setting out a detailed analysis of them. I am satisfied that the sentence I will impose in not inconsistent with the yardstick they provide.
	
	
	I think it appropriate that the related offences be dealt with briefly. I have set out the circumstances in the course of my reasons. I bear in mind that he has now pleaded guilty to all matters, and I infer would have done so in the Local Court had his offer been accepted. I will allow the same discount. I will deal with these matters in the order in which they were laid:
	



	
	For sequence 2 of H52681852, possessing the pen gun, I am of the view that the criminality for this matter is subsumed in the criminality of the manslaughter offence. I propose to impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months duration, wholly concurrent with the sentence passed for the manslaughter offence;
	
	
	I think it appropriate that sequences 3 and 4 in H52681852 should be dealt with together. These are the offences of possessing the Hammerli self-loading pistol and the Winchester repeating rifle. The evidence was that these weapons belonged to Mr Hart’s deceased father. His offending came to light because he gave them to his friend Mr Wright, a law abiding member of the community. Mr Hart contemplated that he would, as he did, hand them into police. There is no evidence that they were ever used by Mr Hart. His offending came to light by reason of his own actions, which is a significant mitigating circumstance, even though they may have been discovered in the execution of a search warrant at or before the time of his arrest. In each case, I will impose a fixed term of imprisonment to be served concurrently of 3 months duration commencing 30 October 2013 and expiring on 29 January 2014;
	
	
	Sequence 5 H52681852, possessing the unregistered air rifle. This was an incidental product of the search warrant. It is a minor matter. Had it stood alone it would not have attracted a custodial sentence. Given that Mr Hart will be in custody for other matters, I think it appropriate to dispose of the proceedings by recording a conviction without imposing any other penalty;
	
	
	Sequence 6 of H52681852, this is destroying the Holden utility by fire. As I have said, there was an issue about ownership of that vehicle, although Mr Hart has pleaded guilty. Again I think the criminality involved in this matter is substantially subsumed in his culpability for the manslaughter offence. I propose to impose a fixed term of imprisonment wholly accumulated on sequence 2, but to be served concurrently with the sentence for the manslaughter offence, the term of imprisonment will be 3 months;
	
	
	The offence of H54103023 is the break and enter the home across the street and damaging property. The total cost of repair was $260. At the time of the forced entry the house was unoccupied, being prepared for sale. His culpability for this matter is greatly attenuated by reason of his paranoia and delusions which were symptomatic of his mental illness. It is possible, but for the more serious offending that he may have been dealt with under the Mental Health Legislation had this matter come before the Local Court to be dealt with on its own. However, I will impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 month duration, wholly accumulated on the sentence for sequences 3 and 4 in the earlier matter. The sentence will commence at the expiration of the earlier sentence on 29 January 2014 and expire on 28 February 2014;
	
	
	H543483251 – damaging the seat of the prison van. The value of the damage is estimated to be $100. I think it appropriate to deal with the matter by disposing of the proceedings under s 10A, by recording a conviction and otherwise disposing of the proceedings without further penalty.
	



	
	Mr Hart I sentence you to the following punishments:
	



	
	For the offence charged by Court Attendance Notice H52681852 sequence 3, of possessing an unauthorised Hammerli self-loading pistol to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months commencing on 30 October 2013 and expiring on 29 January 2014;
	
	
	For the offence charged by Court Attendance Notice H52681852 sequence 4, of possessing an unregistered Winchester repeating rife to a fixed term of imprisonment commencing on 30 October 2013 and expiring on 29 January 2014;
	
	
	For the offence charged by Court Attendance Notice H54103023 of break and enter a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence to a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 month commencing on the expiration of the sentence for H52681852, sequences 3 and 4 on 29 January 2014 and expiring on 28 February 2014;
	
	
	For the offence charged by Court Attendance Notice H53783251 of intentionally damaging property of the New South Wales Corrective Services Department, I record a conviction and otherwise dispose of the proceedings without penalty under s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999;
	
	
	For the offence charged by Court Attendance Notice H52681852 sequence 5 of possessing an unregistered air rifle, I record a conviction and otherwise dispose of the proceedings without penalty under s 10A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure Act) 1999;
	
	
	For the offence charged by Court Attendance Notice H52681852 sequence 2 of possessing a prohibited pen gun to a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months commencing on the expiration of the sentence for H 54103023 on 28 February 2014 and expiring on 27 May 2014;
	
	
	For the offence charged by Court Attendance Notice H52681852 sequence 6 of intentionally destroying by fire the Holden Utility, a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 months duration commencing on the expiration of the sentence for H 52681852 sequence 2 on 27 May 2014 and expiring on 26 August 2014;
	
	
	For the manslaughter of Luke Hargrave, a term of imprisonment of 8 years, having a non-parole period of 5 years and 4 months, commencing on 28 February 2014 and expiring on 27 June 2019 with an additional term of 2 years and 8 months commencing on 28 June 2019 and expiring on 27 February 2022.
	
	
	The total effective sentence is one of eight years and four months. You will first be eligible for parole at the expiration of the non-parole period on 27 June 2019.
	
	
	The firearms, the subject of sequences 2, 3, 4 and 5 are to be forfeited to the Crown.

2954026,Kremisis v R [2016] NSWCCA 257,"Judgment


	
	Hoeben CJ at CL: I agree with the judgment of Button J and the orders which he proposes.
	
	
	Button J:
	


Background


	
	On 22 August 2014, Judge Craigie SC sentenced Steven Kremisis (the applicant) for three offences of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. One of the offences had seven offences “attached” to it by way of a Form 1 pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). The applicant, a man of generally good prior character, had pleaded guilty to all offences at an early stage, and received a 25% discount on his sentences as a result. Rather than imposing an aggregate sentence, his Honour imposed three separate sentences in a “cascading” structure. The total head sentence imposed was imprisonment for 13 years and 6 months, with a total non-parole period of 8 years and 5 months.
	
	
	The following grounds of appeal were notified, and pressed at the hearing before us:
	


Ground 1: The sentences imposed were, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.

Ground 2: The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance given the sentence imposed on the [co-offender].

Ground 3:

(i) His Honour erred by finding that the evidence of the wife and daughter was untested.

(ii) His Honour erred by failing to find that the Applicant was using drugs prior to and during his offending to a detrimental degree.

Ground 4: His Honour erred in law by finding that as the effect on family was not exceptional, it could not be taken into account under the relevant sub-section.


	
	Turning to discuss the grounds very briefly at this stage, Ground 1 speaks for itself.
	
	
	Ground 2 is founded upon an aggregate sentence subsequently imposed upon the man to whom I shall refer as the co-offender on 5 May 2015 by Acting Judge Marien SC; the analysis in support of the ground is focussed upon the starting points of the indicative sentences provided by Acting Judge Marien with regard to three offences that the co-offender “shared” with the applicant. I shall provide more detail about the co-offender and his offending when I come to discuss that ground.
	
	
	Ground 3 is founded on the proposition that his Honour made a finding of fact that was not reasonably open, in refusing to find that the applicant had fallen into supplying large quantities of the prohibited drug as a result of his own drug addiction.
	
	
	As for ground 4, at the hearing of the appeal senior counsel for the applicant accepted that success of the ground in this Court is foreclosed by binding authority, and explained that the point was being taken only so that it could be reserved for the consideration of the High Court of Australia.
	


The offences


	
	The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court were as follows.
	
	
	First, between 8 December 2011 and 12 January 2012 he supplied not less than the commercial quantity of methylamphetamine; namely, 325.45 grams (described in the remarks on sentence as count 1 and sequence 1).
	
	
	Secondly, between 1 March 2012 and 4 May 2012, he committed the same offence. The amount in question was 677.7 grams of the same prohibited drug (count 2, sequence 7).
	
	
	Thirdly, between 28 June 2012 and 30 June 2012, he committed the same offence with regard to the same prohibited drug. The relevant quantity was 566 grams (count 3, sequence 11).
	
	
	With regard to each offence, the applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years, pursuant to s 33 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). There was also an applicable standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	It was when sentencing the applicant for the second offence (that is, with regard to the supply of 677.7 grams) that his Honour was asked to take into account the seven further matters on a Form 1. They were as follows.
	
	
	First, an offence of possessing a prohibited weapon (an expandable metal baton). The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment, pursuant to s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW), with a standard non-parole period of 3 years.
	
	
	Secondly, an offence of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime ($31,320 in cash). This sum was related to funds accumulated between 13 January 2012 and 30 June 2012, and was undoubtedly connected to drug dealing. The maximum penalty for this offence is 15 years imprisonment, pursuant to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).
	
	
	Thirdly, five counts of supplying a prohibited drug. The maximum penalty for each count is 15 years imprisonment, pursuant to s 32 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The amounts in question were 113.2 grams, 141.5 grams, 56.6 grams, 141.5 grams and 28.3 grams. Again, the prohibited drug in question was methylamphetamine.
	


Objective features


	
	An agreed statement of facts was placed before his Honour. Without descending to a level of great detail, it may be summarised as showing that, for a period of seven months, the applicant was in the business of supplying very substantial quantities of methylamphetamine in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. All of the substantive offences and the offences on the Form 1 were part of that ongoing course of conduct. The quantity of the drug involved show that the applicant was clearly operating far beyond “street level”.
	
	
	He was receiving the prohibited drug from a man called Jeffrey Sahyoun, who was closely associated with a notorious motorcycle club. Mr Sahyoun was sentenced by Judge Sides QC on 25 November 2013 for a number of offences. Judge Craigie was aware of the sentences imposed on Mr Sahyoun. Because they form no part of any ground of appeal, however, I shall not discuss them further.
	
	
	Two other men, a Mr Jadran and the co-offender, were the suppliers to the applicant on behalf of Mr Sahyoun.
	
	
	The operation was not without sophistication, and featured the use of multiple mobile telephone services, code names, and a factory used to store and purify the prohibited drugs.
	
	
	Inevitably, extremely large sums of cash were derived from the unlawful enterprise. For example, with regard to count 2, it seems that the price of the 677.7 grams of methylamphetamine supplied to the applicant was almost $240,000.
	
	
	With regard to objective seriousness, at p 17 of the remarks on sentence his Honour found that :
	


Upon individual assessment of each of the matters described in the agreed statement of facts and assessment of the totality of criminality consisted by both the committal for sentence matters and the seven Form 1 matters it is abundantly clear that in each case the offender had engaged in a very serious level of persistent, inherent criminality over the subject period of seven months.

Sequence 1 of the three substantive charges involve four transactions in a little over a month. Sequence 7 in one transaction of 677.7 grams, that is the second matter, and sequence 11 relates to the supply of 566 grams in two transactions. Together with the facts in the Form 1 matters, as they are required to be taken into account with sequence 7, the offender is revealed over the period of seven months to have been a pivotal actor standing in the midst of a highly profitable ring of drug traffickers as the Crown has submitted. This has involved transactions as to drugs totally around $600,000 in value.

Trafficking of the order involved, and with the offending having contacts as both a purchaser and on-supplier bespeaks a high level of organisational involvement and familiarity with others involved in the drug trade and, indeed, this is consistent with the offender’s closeness to transactions, including the use of acetone to perfect drugs.

This was trafficking on a significant scale and exhibited some commercial skill on the part of the offender in his criminal dealings over the subject seven months.


	
	At p 18 of the remarks on sentence, his Honour found that:
	


What can be determined from the frequency and scale of the deals done and from the reasonably high level of purity in that part of the dealing that can be assessed by reference to the drugs seized at the point of arrest is that the offender was knowingly involved in very serious criminal conduct. I find that in respect of each of the substantive committal for sentence matters these matter and what they reveal as to the offender’s role was such that the objective criminality is at or slightly above that of the middle of the range of seriousness for such matters, as has indeed been suggested as an appropriate and available assessment by the Crown.

Subjective features


	
	Subjectively, the applicant was born in June 1965 and therefore aged 49 years when he stood for sentence. He is a family man, married since 1987, with four adult children. There was evidence that, before he committed these offences, he was very highly thought of by many members of the community.
	
	
	The applicant came to Australia from Greece as a child. During his upbringing, his father suffered from schizophrenia. A further disadvantage suffered by the applicant is that at the age of five he was left permanently blind in one eye, after being injured by another child.
	
	
	He was described in evidence as a hardworking man, and his daughter recounted that he sometimes worked three jobs at a time. He has run multiple family businesses in the Australian Capital Territory; worked as a carer nurse in a nursing home; and worked at the Australian Defence Force Academy in a role involving hospitality, maintenance and domestic duties.
	
	
	Judge Craigie characterised the prior criminal record of the applicant as “relatively minor”, consisting as it did largely of traffic violations and two fines for drug possession in 2012. His Honour accepted that the applicant had been a “person of generally good character”.
	
	
	Based on the evidence of family members and long-term friends and colleagues, who spoke fulsomely of the applicant as a hardworking man of prior good character, Judge Craigie found that the “prospects of rehabilitation are good”.
	
	
	In short, there was much to be weighed subjectively against the undoubted objective seriousness of what the applicant had done. There was also a serious question in the proceedings on sentence about why the applicant had become a dealer of commercial quantities of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	In that regard, the remarks on sentence at p 16 show that counsel then appearing for the applicant (who was not counsel who appeared on the appeal) submitted that the motivation of the applicant for the commission of the offences was “involvement in drugs and the addictive quality, the addictive environment and the psychological addictive qualities”. That submission was made although the applicant had neither given oral evidence of his motive nor provided a document about it. Rather, the submission was based upon observations made by members of the family of the applicant, and their suspicions and belief about his use of prohibited drugs. Their written evidence had been received without objection by the Crown, and without a requirement that the witnesses who provided documentary evidence to that effect be available for cross-examination.
	


Aspects of sentence


	
	As I have said, Judge Craigie uncontroversially provided a 25% discount with regard to all three offences for the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty.
	
	
	Rather than providing indicative sentences and imposing an aggregate sentence, Judge Craigie sentenced for each offence, and made each sentence cumulative to a small degree. His Honour structured the sentences so that the sentence for count 1 commenced first, then the sentence for count 3 commenced 6 months afterwards, and finally the sentence for count 2 commenced 6 months after that.
	
	
	For count 1, a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years and 9 months to date from 30 June 2012, with a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months was imposed. As a matter of arithmetic, the starting point of the head sentence must have been 13 years. The ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence is 58.1%.
	
	
	For count 3, a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years and 6 months to date from 30 December 2012, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 3 months was imposed (a starting point of 14 years). The ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence is 59.5%.
	
	
	For count 2, a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years and 6 months to date from 30 June 2013, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 5 months was imposed (a starting point of 16 years and 8 months). The ratio between the non-parole period and the head sentence is 59.3%.
	
	
	It can be seen that, as I have said, the total sentence imposed was a head sentence of imprisonment of 13 years and 6 months, with a total non-parole period of 8 years and 5 months. The ratio between the total non-parole period and the total head sentence is 62.3%.
	
	
	Turning to the grounds of appeal, it is convenient to discuss them a little out of order.
	


Ground 2

The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance given the sentence imposed on [the co-offender].


	
	As I have said, this ground was founded upon the aggregate sentence subsequently imposed upon the co-offender by Acting Judge Marien.
	
	
	Acting Judge Marien imposed an aggregate sentence upon the co-offender for five offences, not all of which were shared between the applicant and the co-offender. The three offences of supply for which the applicant was sentenced, however, were all common to the applicant and the co-offender.
	
	
	As well as that, the co-offender asked that a Form 1 be taken into account that included the five offences of supply that appeared on the Form 1 of the applicant. The Form 1 of the co-offender contained two different further offences, however: possessing a prohibited drug (63.8 grams of cannabis leaf, and 15.43 grams of 4-Bromo-2, 5-Dimethoxy Ethylamine) and dealing with proceeds of crime ($22,650 cash); neither was identical to the offences that appeared on the Form 1 of the applicant. Finally, the Form 1 of the co-offender was taken into account with regard to a different offence from the offence of the applicant that had his Form 1 “attached” to it: in the case of the co-offender, the supply of 566 grams, and, in the case of the applicant, the supply of 677.7 grams.
	
	
	Indicative sentences were provided by Acting Judge Marien with regard to the shared offences. As a threshold matter, I consider that there is nothing inappropriate in comparing the actual sentences imposed upon the applicant with the indicative sentences of the co-offender. I do not consider that Parliament intended, by way of the commencement of the regime of aggregate and indicative sentences, that parity arguments previously available would thereafter be forestalled: see the judgement of McCallum J in R v Clarke [2013] NSWCCA 260 at [68].
	
	
	The following aspects of sentencing of the co-offender were pointed to by the applicant in support of this ground.
	


Objective features of offences of co-offender


	
	The first, second, third and fifth counts on the indictment of the co-offender were supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in its commercial quantity. The first count involved approximately 325.45 grams of the prohibited drug over a total of four transactions; the second count involved approximately 680 grams of the prohibited drug; the third count involved 566 grams of the prohibited drug; and the fifth count involved 474.1 grams of it. As I have said, the shared offences were the first count (supply of 325.25 grams), the second count (supply of approximately 677.7 grams), and the third count (supply of 566 grams).
	
	
	The fifth count was based on the onus reversal known as “deemed supply”, and related to a separate quantity of the drug found at the home of the co-offender.
	
	
	The fourth count on the indictment was a count of possessing nine firearms and ammunition (all of which were prohibited and unregistered firearms, in the context of the co-offender not being licensed to possess any firearm).
	
	
	With regard to the three shared counts on indictment, and indeed the five shared charges on the Form 1, the allegation was repeated before Acting Judge Marien that the co-offender was supplying to the applicant; in that sense, it could be said that the co-offender stood above the applicant in the criminal hierarchy.
	
	
	Again, the objective seriousness was found to be grave: Acting Judge Marien found that the applicant was a principal (but not the principal) in a well organised operation that was in the business of selling very large quantities of the prohibited drug for very large sums of money. His Honour said at p 9 of the remarks on sentence:
	


As is apparent from those facts and from the maximum penalties applicable to the offences, the offences committed by the offender over a period of seven months involve criminality of a very high order. The offender played a pivotal role in a highly organised drug supply network which network derived enormous profits and which in relation to the principal offences involved the dissemination of a total quantity of just over 1.5 kilograms of methylamphetamine into the community.

Subjective features of co-offender


	
	Subjectively, the co-offender was born in September 1982 and was 32 years old at the time of sentencing. He suffered physical abuse from his father until the age of six, but reported a stable and happy upbringing following the divorce of his parents. He had worked in the motor sports injury, both in Australia and overseas; operated a car haulage business; worked as a salesman; and had set up a battery recycling company. Eventually his businesses failed, and it is not clear from the evidence whether he was operating a business or unemployed at the time of the offences.
	
	
	The co-offender admitted to drug use at the time of the offences, but denied that he was a drug addict. He denied that he was a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang, and claimed that he was pressured by the members of the gang in question to commit the offences. Acting Judge Marien approached the question of mitigatory duress cautiously. Another motivating factor for committing the offences was said to be the financial difficulties that the co-offender suffered after the failure of his business.
	
	
	The co-offender expressed regret for his actions, but Acting Judge Marien found that those expressions disclose a limited degree of insight into the full criminality of his offending, and the destructive effects of drug trafficking.
	
	
	The co-offender had a minor criminal record comprising convictions for driving unregistered and uninsured vehicles, and driving while suspended. He was sentenced on the basis that he did not have a significant record, and was a man of previously good character.
	
	
	There was evidence that the co-offender had provided, and had agreed to provide, assistance to the authorities. For obvious reasons, I shall not detail that further.
	
	
	Acting Judge Marien granted the co-offender a 50% discount on the starting points of the indicative sentences. That discount was made up of a discount of 20% for the pleas of guilty, 10% for past assistance, and 20% for proposed future assistance (it will be recalled that Judge Craigie provided a 25% discount to the applicant, based only upon the utilitarian value of his pleas of guilty).
	
	
	In short, apart from the marked difference in the discounts of 25% and 50%, there was perhaps not much to differentiate the applicant and the co-offender: they were both dealing in prohibited drugs in very large quantities, for very large amounts of money; they each played a significant role in the organisation; and each was basically a man of good prior character. The points of distinction were: the co-offender was seemingly higher in the enterprise than the applicant; there was a suggestion of pressure having been placed on the co-offender; the co-offender was a decade or so younger than the applicant; and it seems that the Form 1 of each man was (for some reason) attached to a different count.
	


Aspects of sentence of the co-offender


	
	For the first shared count (relating to approximately 326 grams of methylamphetamine), Acting Judge Marien indicated a head sentence of 4 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years and 8 months. For the second shared count (relating to approximately 680 grams of methylamphetamine), his Honour indicated a head sentence of 5 years and 5 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 1 month. For the third shared count (relating to approximately 566 grams of methylamphetamine, and being the count that carried the Form 1 with regard to the co-offender) his Honour indicated a head sentence of 6 years and 2 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 7 months.
	
	
	The starting points of those indicative sentences were, as a matter of simple arithmetic, 9 years and 6 months (count 1); 10 years and 10 months (count 2); and 12 years and 4 months (count 3).
	
	
	The  Table (188 KB, pdf) attached to this judgment provides a comparison, with regard to the three shared counts, of the individual sentences actually imposed upon the applicant; the starting points that must have been adopted by Judge Craigie with regard to those sentences; the indicative sentences provided by Acting Judge Marien with regard to the co-offender; and the starting points that must have been adopted by Acting Judge Marien with regard to those indicative sentences. For completeness, it also shows the total sentence imposed on the accused and the aggregate sentence imposed on the co-offender.
	
	
	I interpolate that, in a recent decision of this Court, the discount granted to the co-offender was increased from 50% to 55%, and he was re-sentenced accordingly; that judgement is currently restricted, for obvious reasons. But senior counsel for the accused accepted that that adjustment is of no great moment, because the parity argument of the applicant is founded not upon the ultimate aggregate sentence imposed upon the co-offender, but rather upon the starting points of his indicative sentences.
	
	
	For completion, however, I record that the co-offender was re-sentenced by this Court as follows. On count 1, an indicative sentence of 4 years and 3 months; on count 2, an indicative sentence of 4 years and 10 months; and on count 3, an indicative sentence of 5 years and 6 months. For the un-shared counts, the following indicative sentences were provided: for count 4, an indicative sentence of 2 years and 8 months; and for count 5, an indicative sentence of 3 years and 1 month.
	
	
	Ultimately, an aggregate head sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and 1 month with a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months was substituted by this Court.
	
	
	It can be seen immediately from the table that I have provided that the starting points adopted by Acting Judge Marien with regard to the co-offender are markedly below the starting points adopted by Judge Craigie with regard to the applicant. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the starting points adopted by Acting Judge Marien with regard to the co-offender approximate the discounted sentences imposed by Judge Craigie upon the applicant.
	


Submissions about parity


	
	During the hearing before us, the Crown Prosecutor was asked whether a tentative submission (seemingly made in the separate hearing of the appeal of the co-offender on the same day) was maintained in this appeal. That submission had been that one could respectfully infer that Acting Judge Marien had made some kind of mathematical error. The submission was not, in fact, maintained, and the Crown Prosecutor submitted that she was not in a position to explain the marked divergence between the starting points on the basis of mathematical error.
	
	
	She submitted that there were different features of the matters before the two sentencing judges, as the applicant was acting for profit and enmeshed in his own business, whereas the co-offender was a younger man acting under duress. It was said that those points of distinction could justify the divergence in the starting points.
	
	
	In response, senior counsel for the applicant simply submitted that, whatever may have been the differences in the culpability between the two men, including with regard to subjective matters, the divergence in starting points is unsustainable.
	
	
	He accepted that the exercise of analysis and possible correction by this Court is complicated not only by the fact that the co-offender was sentenced for other offences, but also by the fact that an aggregate sentence was imposed upon him, making the measures of concurrence and cumulation implicitly adopted with regard to the co-offender impossible to determine with precision.
	
	
	But even allowing for those complications, he submitted that one can see here an inexplicable divergence in the starting points with regard to shared offences that must surely found a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant with regard to the sentences ultimately imposed upon him and the co-offender.
	


Erroneous disparity established


	
	Turning to my determination of this ground, if I had been satisfied that the co-offender had obtained an unearned advantage by a mathematical slip on the part of Acting Judge Marien, such a finding could well have stood in the way of the success of the applicant on this ground. That is because an error that wrongly advantages a co-offender may not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of an offender that should lead to intervention. In other words, if an error has been made that led to a wrongful advantage for one offender, that error should not be compounded by permitting it to reduce the sentence of a further offender.
	
	
	But that is not the case here: as I have said, the Crown disavowed any submission that the divergence in starting points can be explained by mathematical error. In those circumstances, although one may respectfully suspect (by way of simple comparison by way of the table) that Acting Judge Marien may have committed a mathematical slip whereby the starting point with regard to the co-offender replicated the discounted sentences of the applicant, nevertheless I do not think that that suspicion should stand in the way of success of this ground.
	
	
	As for the submission of the Crown that the divergence is explicable and justifiable on the basis of differences between the two offenders, I do not accept that proposition. Although there were, in fact, factors that pointed both ways, in the ultimate analysis the two of them were to be roughly equated in objective and subjective features with respect to the shared offences. And yet the divergence in starting points is manifest. I also consider that the divergence is unable to be justified on any basis.
	
	
	In short, I consider that a failure to intervene to reduce the sentences actually imposed upon the applicant, bearing in mind the starting points of the indicative sentences that played a role in informing the aggregate sentence actually imposed on the co-offender, would leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance.
	
	
	I consider that this ground has been established. The fact that this Court would therefore proceed to re-sentence means that the other grounds, including the assertion of manifest excess, can be dealt with more concisely than if they were determinative.
	


Ground 3

(i) His Honour erred by finding that the evidence of the wife and daughter was untested.

(ii) His Honour erred by failing to find that the Applicant was using drugs prior to and during his offending to a detrimental degree.


	
	As can be seen, the first part of this ground focuses upon the reference in the remarks on sentence to the evidence of family members as being “untested”. To place the reference in context, it appears within the remarks on sentence at pp 16-17, where his Honour was discussing the submission that the finding should be made that the drug dealing of the accused arose from drug addiction:
	


The offender himself did not give any evidence and much of the evidence of any drug use, let alone any addiction, is slight. It arises somewhat obliquely, in the defence case, resting wholly in untested, albeit evidence not subject to objection. In saying that I intend no or [sic] disrespect for those people who have conscientiously tried to find an explanation for the offender’s conduct, particularly those who have been close to him.


	
	Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that it was erroneous for his Honour to refer to the evidence in that way. Whilst it was objectively true that the evidence had not been tested, that was hardly a matter that could be held against the applicant in the circumstances of the Crown agreeing to the tender of the documents. It was submitted that, read in the context of the overall finding of the learned sentencing judge (namely, that his Honour was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that dependence on prohibited drugs had played a role in the offending), the reference to the evidence being untested was inappropriately adverse to the applicant.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this sub-ground, it is undeniable that the evidence of the wife and daughter of the applicant was not tested. It is also true that Judge Craigie was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities of the subjective feature for which counsel then appearing for the applicant contended. But, reading the reference to the untested nature of the evidence in the context of the entirety of what his Honour said about this question of drug addiction, I do not believe that that showed an approach by his Honour that was wrongly against the interests of the applicant. The objective truth was that the evidence was untested; in my opinion, it can hardly be an error for a sentencing judge to refer to something that is objectively true.
	
	
	I would reject this sub-ground.
	
	
	As for the second sub-ground, senior counsel submitted that it was not open, as a finding of fact, for Judge Craigie to fail to find on the balance of probabilities that a dependence on prohibited drugs lay behind the very serious offending of this mature man of prior good character. It was said that the combination of factors – which included the affidavit evidence of the wife and daughter of the applicant, and his convictions in 2012 for methylamphetamine possession - meant that the refusal of his Honour to accept the submission of counsel then appearing was not reasonably open.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this sub-ground, it was uncontroversial before us that, in the proceedings on sentence, the applicant bore the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities any mitigating factor that he sought to have taken into account on sentence: see The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270; [1999] HCA 54. The mitigating factor contended for was that the applicant had committed the offences because of a particular motivation. The only person who could give direct evidence of his motivation for committing the offences was the applicant. And yet he did not do so, either in the witness box or even by way of a document signed by him and tendered in his case.
	
	
	In those circumstances, it is very hard to accept the proposition that it was not open to his Honour to fail to find that the motivation contended for had been established on the balance of probabilities.
	
	
	Separately, in considering this ground, it is important to reflect upon what Judge Craigie did find about this topic. The discussion of the question in the remarks on sentence extends over eight pages, and I shall not extract the entirety of it. But it may be summarised as being a detailed analysis of the evidence about this topic, including that given by family members (generally supportive of it, by way of their observations and suspicions), and other subjective material tendered on sentence such as references from other persons (generally not supportive, because it made no mention of the asserted motivation).
	
	
	What his Honour ultimately did find with regard to this topic appears at p 23 of the remarks on sentence:
	


…I am unable to conclude from the sum of that and other evidence, much of it suggesting an explanation that has not been forthcoming from the offender in any coherent explanation for, let alone mitigation of his offending or how he came to embark upon it. What is clear is that he was obviously deeply involved in aspects of the drug culture in so far as he was a trafficker and plainly in contact with others of that culture.

I find it probable that he may well have partaken of his own product, although there is no specific evidence of this, as to scale or frequency or sufficient to amount to a factor constituting addiction let alone one explaining his precipitous fall from the status of a law abiding and decent family man to that of a drug dealing criminal.


	
	In other words, the sentencing judge was prepared to accept that the applicant was a person who had involved himself in the milieu of prohibited drugs, and in doing so was probably using the product that he was supplying. His Honour was not prepared to go further and make a finding about the amount that the applicant was using; that was unsurprising, in light of the absence of evidence from the applicant or anyone else about the question of quantity. Finally, his Honour was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it was addiction that drove the applicant to do what he did.
	
	
	On the evidence placed before his Honour, I consider that those findings were reasonably open.
	
	
	Thirdly, in a sense this ground, taken as a whole, does not lead very far in any event. That is because, pursuant to s 21(5AA) of Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), Parliament has explicitly commanded that self-induced intoxication is not to be taken into account in mitigation of an offence. The exact words of the sub-section are as follows:
	


21A Aggravating, mitigating and other factors in sentencing

…

(5AA) Special rule for self-induced intoxication

In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the self-induced intoxication of the offender at the time the offence was committed is not to be taken into account as a mitigating factor.


	
	Furthermore, since R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111, at the latest, the law of New South Wales has been that addiction to prohibited drugs, prescribed drugs, or alcohol does not (except in very limited circumstances, none of which apply here) mitigate an offence.
	
	
	In other words, even accepting (for the sake of argument only) that the sentencing judge made an erroneous finding of fact about drug use or drug addiction, it is not easy to see how that could constitute a material error calling for re-sentence.
	
	
	In short, I would not uphold ground 3.
	


Ground 4

His Honour erred in law by finding that as the effect on family was not exceptional, it could not be taken into account under the relevant sub-section.


	
	This ground was based upon the finding by Judge Craigie that the hardship upon the family of the offender was not exceptional. His Honour addressed this issue in the remarks on sentence at p 26:
	


Although as in any such case there is undoubted hardship resulting from the offender’s continued imprisonment, it has not been submitted to be of a kind that is exceptional to the degree such as at law would justify consideration on that basis. I would in any event have rejected any such submission, on the basis that the evidence has not reached that high threshold required – however regrettable are the consequences of the offender’s imprisonment for his wife and children.


	
	The submission in support of error was based upon the dissenting judgment of Beech-Jones J in R v Zerafa (2013) 235 A Crim R 265; [2013] NSWCCA 222. There, his Honour said:
	


[140] This succession of cases has led to the adoption of a principle with little to commend it. If in other contexts Courts are bound to consider the impact of their orders on innocent third parties (Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30; 195 CLR 1 at [65] to [66]; Silktone Pty Ltd v Devreal Capital Pty Ltd (1990) 21 NSWLR 317 at 324 and 332), why is the impact on children of any sentence under consideration to be excluded unless their hardship is only exceptional? The primary objects in sentencing of ""retribution, deterrence [and the] protection of society"" described by Wells J in Wirth [(1976) 14 SASR 291] can still be given effect to without requiring sentencing courts to divide the forms of hardship occasioned to an offender's family into those which meet the description ""exceptional"" and those which do not. The assessment of probable hardship to family members is a task that sentencing courts are perfectly able to undertake, and no doubt they do. In any event, the words of the section [that is, s 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth)] and the secondary materials indicate a clear policy choice on the part of the legislature on this topic.

[141] Further, the difficulty that accompanies the addition of a gloss to a legislative provision that is otherwise clear is revealed by the different formulations of the gloss that have emerged from the cases. The construction adopted by Howie J in Hinton [(2002) 134 A Crim R 286; [2002] NSWCCA 405] suggests that no consideration can be given to hardship that falls short of the description ""exceptional"". The judgment of Spigelman CJ in Togias [(2001) 127 A Crim R 23; [2001] NSWCCA 522] suggests that something other than ""substantial weight"" might be afforded to probable hardship occasioned to family members of offenders even if exceptional circumstances cannot be demonstrated. Nguyen [(2006) 166 A Crim R 124; [2006] NSWCCA 369] appears to confirm that. In circumstances where s 16A(2) specifies that a court is to take a ""matter into account"", what authority does an intermediate court of appeal have to specify the weight a sentencing court attaches to that factor? The relevant constraint on a sentencing court affording too much weight to the factor set out in s 16A(2)(p) is to be found in s 16A(1). Unconstrained by authority, in my view, s 16A(2)(p) should be applied by sentencing courts according to its terms, without having to determine whether the circumstances are exceptional or otherwise. If the result of affording weight to that consideration is that the sentence is unduly lenient then that will attract appellate interference on the established basis that it is manifestly inadequate, but not because some specified level of weight was attached to this factor that the Crimes Act does not expressly preclude. A sentence that is manifestly inadequate does not conform with s 16A(1).

[142] Standing in the path of the adoption of this approach is the stream of authority in this Court and other intermediate courts of appeal that I have referred to. In so far as the latter is concerned, I can only depart from their interpretation of a Commonwealth law if I am ""convinced that that interpretation is plainly wrong"" (Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd [1993] HCA 15; 177 CLR 485 at 492; Hili at [57]). The same test has been said to apply to departures from earlier decisions of this Court (Hili at [74] per Heydon J).

…

[144] In my view, the words of s 16A(2)(p) are clear. The secondary materials confirm that meaning. The cases that have considered the provision have not reconciled their construction with either. I am satisfied that the construction of s 16A(2)(p) which reads the provision as though it was preceded or proceeded by the words ""in an exceptional case"" is plainly wrong on either of the approaches suggested in Gett at [294] to [295].


	
	Senior counsel invited our attention to the fact that, in R v Curtis (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 866 at [37], McCallum J recently said:
	


[37] Section 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act requires the Court to take into account the probable effect that any sentence under consideration would have on the offender’s family. There is binding authority to the effect that such circumstances may not be given substantial weight unless they can be characterised as “exceptional”. The correctness of that principle was questioned by one member of the Court of Criminal Appeal [footnote omitted] in R v Zerafa on the basis that it puts a gloss on the terms of the section. [footnote omitted] After a comprehensive review of the relevant authorities, Beech-Jones J noted in that case that the origin of the principle was a decision concerning State legislation and that none of the judgments that have applied it have attempted to reconcile it with the express words of s 16A(2)(p). In my respectful opinion, there is much force in his Honour’s view. However, Mr Thangaraj accepted that I am bound to follow the existing principle and that exceptional circumstances are not established here. Even if the approach favoured by Beech-Jones J were to prevail, it is doubtful whether that consideration would be of significant weight in the circumstances of this case.


	
	It was said before us that that more liberal approach to the effect of incarceration of an offender upon members of his or her family should be adopted by the Crown, including with regard to State, as opposed to Federal, offences. It was also accepted, however, that to do so would not be consonant with binding authority.
	
	
	Turning to my determination, as Beech-Jones J recorded, the restrictive approach adopted by Judge Craigie is in accordance with longstanding authority of this Court: see for example R v Togias (2001) 127 A Crim R 23; [2001] NSWCCA 522 at [9]-[17] and R v Hinton (2002) 134 A Crim R 286; [2002] NSWCCA 405 at [31]. And this Court has recently reaffirmed the correctness of that approach: see Nguyen v R [2016] NSWCCA 5 at [69].
	
	
	As Beech-Jones J said, as a matter of precedent, this Court should not depart from its earlier considered judgments unless satisfied that they are “plainly wrong”, meaning, in my opinion, that there must be either a failure to collect and attend to relevant legal materials, or egregiously erroneous reasoning: see Gett v Tabet (2009) 254 ALR 504; [2009] NSWCA 76 at [274]-[295]; Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [74].
	
	
	The approach adopted by Judge Craigie was undoubtedly consonant with the approach that this Court has said should be adopted by sentencing judges to the question of the effect on the family of an offender of his or her incarceration. It may also be significant that Beech-Jones J and McCallum J were speaking of the construction of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), not the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). I do not hold the affirmative opinion that the approach taken by this Court to the question over many years is plainly wrong. On the law as it currently stands, therefore, I consider that this ground should be rejected.
	


Ground 1

The sentences imposed were, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.


	
	Counsel for the applicant made the following submissions in support of this ground.
	
	
	First, he noted that the sentencing judge had found that the objective seriousness for the offence was at or slightly above the middle range of seriousness for such matters. He submitted that it was relevant that in R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135 this Court concluded that, for drug supply offences, the role of the offender is relevant to determining the objective seriousness of an offence. He submitted that the applicant was a mid-level participant, and not a principal, and it was therefore an error to find that the role of the applicant was at or above the middle range of seriousness.
	
	
	Secondly, counsel for the applicant noted the subjective features of the applicant that were taken into account by his Honour (including prior good character, contrition, and good prospects of rehabilitation); the finding of his Honour that specific deterrence had already been achieved, but that there was a strong requirement for general deterrence, retribution and denunciation; and the finding of his Honour that there were special circumstances. He submitted that the subjective circumstances of the applicant were quite favourable.
	
	
	Thirdly, counsel for the applicant calculated the starting point for each sentence of the applicant, prior to the 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty. He then contrasted these sentences to other sentences imposed by this Court for the same offence, in other matters, and submitted that the comparison of the sentences supported his submission that the sentences imposed on the applicant were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Fourthly, counsel for the applicant provided sentencing statistics for the same offence to demonstrate that the sentences imposed upon the applicant are too high. He submitted that the combination of the relatively favourable subjective circumstances of the applicant, the proper objective characterisation of the offending, and the comparable cases and sentencing statistics, demonstrated that the sentences were manifestly excessive.
	
	
	The Crown made the following submissions in resistance to this ground.
	
	
	First, the Crown submitted that the sentence is not shown to be unjust when one takes into account the following three overarching factors.
	
	
	First, his Honour found that the relevance of the applicant’s prior good character was limited by the type of calculated conduct in which he was engaged. Seven months of criminal activity could not be considered limited or isolated. His Honour accepted that the not inconsiderable delay to the applicant represented a measure of hardship which could be punitive of itself. Finally, there was undoubtedly a strong requirement for a sentence that reflected general deterrence, retribution and denunciation.
	
	
	Secondly, the sentencing judge had addressed the subjective case in significant detail in the remarks on sentence; had considered all aspects of the evidence before making a finding that the drug use of the applicant was slight and only arose obliquely on the defence case; had allowed a 25% discount for the plea of guilty, and found that the applicant demonstrated contrition; had found that the prospects of rehabilitation of the accused were good; and had found special circumstances in favour of the applicant. None of that was ungenerous or erroneously unfavourable.
	
	
	Thirdly, his Honour adopted a significant degree of concurrence between the individual sentences, an approach said by the Crown to have been generous to the applicant.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that all of these factors supported the submission that the sentence imposed by his Honour was not manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown analysed the eight comparable cases referred to by the applicant. It was submitted that none of the cases could truly be compared to the case of the applicant: the majority related to an isolated incident of offending; none of the cases were connected to an outlaw motorcycle gang; the sentences were imposed either before the commencement of the standard non-parole period regime or involved lesser findings of objective seriousness; all but two involved a significantly lesser amount of drugs; the applicant could not be considered a “runner or courier” (as in two of the cases relied upon); and there was no aspect of entrapment in the case of the applicant that operated to reduce his moral culpability.
	
	
	Thirdly, the Crown submitted that the sentencing statistics provided by the applicant could not be relied upon to any great degree, as the details underpinning them were not disclosed. It was said that the statistics, of themselves, did not demonstrate that the sentence of the applicant is manifestly excessive.
	
	
	Turning to my determination of this ground, as I have said, I shall not deal with it at length, due to my opinion that the appeal should be upheld on a separate ground.
	
	
	The fact is that, for a period of 7 months, the applicant engaged in dealing in a damaging prohibited drug in very large quantities: the total of methylamphetamine captured by the substantive counts is almost 1.6 kilograms, and the total supplied (including the charges on the Form 1) is just above 2050 grams.
	
	
	Self-evidently, vast amounts of money were generated, and the applicant was motivated by a desire to make a profit.
	
	
	Each of the substantive counts carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 20 years, with a standard non-parole period of 10 years.
	
	
	The role of the applicant was well above that of a street level dealer, or drug addicted on-supplier, or factotum within a large criminal enterprise.
	
	
	Subjectively, the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, was a person generally of good character, and had good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	Although lengthy sentences were imposed, a significant degree of concurrency was afforded the applicant in the sentencing structure: as I have explained, the starting dates of the sentences were cumulative upon each other only to the extent of six months.
	
	
	To my mind, the assessment of objective gravity was soundly open to his Honour.
	
	
	In my opinion, neither the individual sentences imposed, nor their starting points, nor the total effective sentence is so far beyond the bounds of the sentencing discretion open to Judge Craigie as to be erroneous. I do not consider that detailed analysis of statistics or comparable cases is necessary in order to demonstrate that proposition. One may accept that the sentences were stern, bearing in mind the favourable subjective features pointed to on behalf of the applicant, but that sternness is the inevitable consequence of the objective gravity of what the applicant had chosen to do.
	
	
	I consider that this ground should be rejected.
	


Re-sentence


	
	Normally, when error is established, this Court needs to turn to the question of whether, on re-sentence, a lesser sentence is warranted in law, pursuant to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). However, when a ground of erroneous disparity or manifest excess has been established, except in very unusual circumstances, the proposition that a lesser sentence is warranted in law has inherently been established.
	
	
	Evidence was placed before us by way of a number of affidavits, both of events that have occurred since the imposition of sentence on 22 August 2014, and also of some circumstances that were said to exist before that date. In accordance with the recent decision of the High Court of Australia in Betts v The Queen [2016] HCA 25 at [14], I do not consider that evidence contained in those affidavits (which were not placed before the sentencing judge) about events or circumstances predating the proceedings on sentence should be taken into account by this Court on re-sentence: see also AGF v R [2016] NSWCCA 236 at [24] and [25].
	
	
	In short, the position is that the accused is doing his best to serve his sentence quietly and constructively, and with an eye to his rehabilitation when he is released.
	
	
	The admissible new evidence shows the following. The accused has spent much of his time in the South Coast Correctional Centre at Nowra. He has had no behavioural incidents since being sentenced. The only drugs the applicant has consumed, whilst in custody, have been supervised or prescribed ones. The applicant has completed courses run by “Enough is Enough” in First Aid, and Barista Training. He is employed at the gaol in an engineering capacity, being in charge of the Plasma Cutting Machine. He is completing a course in Engineering and Fabrication at TAFE, and a traineeship in Furniture/Cabinet Making. Now aged 51 years, his health is not good: he states that he has suffered from two strokes in custody (their seriousness is not revealed), a 60% blockage in his neck artery, an enlarged prostate and chronic back pain.
	
	
	Exercising the sentencing discretion afresh, and placing particular emphasis on the need for the individual sentences to avoid demonstrating erroneous disparity with the starting points of the indicative sentences imposed upon the co-offender, I regard the maximum penalty and standard non-parole periods as important guideposts. I also consider that the serious offences contained on the Form 1, and to be taken into account with regard to count 2 (sequence 7), have an important role to play. As I have said in the context of the assertion of manifest excess, the generally favourable subjective circumstances must be weighed against the significant objective gravity of the crimes of the applicant.
	
	
	I consider that a number of aspects of the sentences imposed by Judge Craigie should be replicated, as follows.
	
	
	First, the backdate to 30 June 2012 should be maintained, it not having been impugned before us.
	
	
	Secondly, so should the uncontroversial discount of 25% for the utilitarian value of the early pleas of guilty.
	
	
	Thirdly, the imposition of separate sentences (as opposed to an aggregate sentence) should be maintained.
	
	
	Fourthly, so should the “cascading” structure of the starting dates, including the commencement of the sentence for Count 3 after the commencement of Count 1 but before the commencement of Count 2.
	
	
	Fifthly, in light of the fact that all offences reflected what was really an ongoing course of conduct over a period of seven months, so should the generous degree of concurrency, whereby each sentence commenced only six months after the commencement of its predecessor.
	
	
	Sixthly, the relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period of each individual sentence, and of the total sentence, whereby there was a significant departure from the statutory ratio, should also be replicated.
	
	
	To my mind, the starting point of the sentence for count 1 (sequence 1) should be a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years. Applying the discount and replicating the ratio, that leads a to a head sentence of 7 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months, to commence on 30 June 2012.
	
	
	The starting point of the sentence for count 3 (sequence 11) should be a head sentence of imprisonment for 11 years. Applying the discount and replicating the ratio, that leads a to a head sentence of 8 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 5 years, to commence on 30 December 2012.
	
	
	The starting point of the sentence for count 2 (sequence 7) should be a head sentence of imprisonment for 13 years. Applying the discount and replicating the ratio, that leads to a head sentence of 9 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months, to commence on 30 June 2013.
	
	
	That leads me to propose a total head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years and 9 months, with a total non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months. I consider that such a sentence would balance the objective and subjective features of the matter, and also avoid erroneous disparity when one considers the starting points of the sentences pertaining to the shared offences of the co-offender.
	


Orders


	
	Accordingly, I propose the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
	
	
	The appeal is allowed.
	
	
	The sentences imposed by Judge Craigie SC on 22 August 2014 in the District Court are quashed.
	
	
	The applicant is re-sentenced as follows:
	


Count 1 – A non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 30 June 2012 and concluding on 29 December 2016, with a balance of term of 3 years concluding on 29 December 2019.

Count 3 – A non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment, commencing on 30 December 2012 and concluding on 29 December 2017, with a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months concluding on 29 March 2021.

Count 2 – A non-parole period of 5 years and 8 months imprisonment, commencing on 30 June 2013 and concluding on 28 February 2019, with a balance of term of 4 years and 1 month concluding on 29 March 2023.


	
	To express the sentences another way, the applicant is re-sentenced to a total head sentence of 10 years and 9 months with a total non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months.
	
	
	The first date upon which the applicant will become eligible for possible release to parole would be 28 February 2019.
	



	
	N Adams J: I agree with Button J.

2954027,Lehn v R [2016] NSWCCA 255,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The applicant stole a manual vehicle, which he then drove to collect an acquaintance and purchase cannabis. While negotiating a bend at a speed in excess of 20km/h over the speed limit, the applicant lost control of the vehicle, which collided with a pedestrian on the nature strip. The applicant and his passenger got out of the vehicle and ran away without assisting the victim, who later died as a result of his injuries.

The applicant did not know how to drive a manual car. He had smoked ice half an hour before the collision. At the time of the accident, he had not slept or eaten for three to four days. The applicant stated that his intention was to burn out the vehicle. A psychiatric evaluation concluded that the applicant’s drug history met the diagnostic threshold of substance use disorder.

The applicant was charged with aggravated dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act), with a Form 1 offence of failing to stop and assist after a vehicle impact causing death contrary to s 52AB(1) of the Crimes Act. He was also charged with stealing a motor vehicle contrary to s 154F of the Crimes Act, with two counts of possessing prohibited drugs contrary to s 10 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) on a Form 1.

A guilty plea was entered at the earliest opportunity. The Crown made no submission that less than the full 25% utilitarian discount should be applied. Nonetheless, the sentencing judge applied a discount of 20% noting that “care must be taken not to attribute a discount that would have the effect of reducing a sentence to below that which would be recognised to accurately reflect the Court’s assessment of the objective gravity of the offending conduct”. It was accepted by both parties that the failure of the sentencing judge to raise this with the parties at the hearing was a denial of procedural fairness.

The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years for the s 52A(2) offence and a fixed term of 2 years for the s 154F offence, taking into account the respective Form 1 offences. The aggregate sentence imposed was 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.

The issues on appeal were:

1.   Whether the failure to accord procedural fairness in determining the utilitarian discount vitiated the entire sentencing discretion or only a discrete component;

2.   Where the error affects only a discrete component, whether the Court of Criminal Appeal must re-exercise the sentencing discretion generally or only in respect of the component affected by error; and

3.   If the Court was required to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, whether the Court was of the opinion that a lesser sentence was warranted in law.

Did the failure to accord procedural fairness in determining the utilitarian discount vitiate the entire sentencing discretion or only a discrete component?

(i)   The discount given for the guilty plea was directly connected to a sentencing purpose, namely, ensuring that the penalty reflected the objective gravity of the offence: [64] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [128] (Schmidt J).

(ii)   (R A Hulme J) An error in determining the sentence of an individual offence will, at least potentially, affect the exercise of discretion in determining questions of concurrence and accumulation and in applying the principle of totality. Furthermore, where there has been a finding of special circumstances and subsequent reduction of the non-parole period, this discretionary exercise will be affected by an error in the determination of an individual sentence: [120] (R A Hulme J).

Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57 applied

If the error affects only a discrete component of the sentence, is an appellate court required to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh?

(iii)   If there is an error which affects the exercise of the sentencing discretion, s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) requires the Court to form its own view of the appropriate sentence, although not necessarily to resentence. It is an essential pre-condition to resentencing that the Court forms a positive opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law: [68], [73]-[74] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [119] (R A Hulme J); [128]-[129] (Schmidt J); [141]-[142] (Wilson J).

Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37; Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; [2001] NSWCCA 534 applied

(iv)   There is no requirement in an appeal under s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) that the applicant demonstrate substantial injustice: [77], [79] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [123] (R A Hulme J); [128]-[129] (Schmidt J); [141]-[142] (Wilson J).

Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37; O’Grady v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 621; [2014] HCA 38 applied

(v)   Where the discretion has miscarried in respect of a discrete component of the sentencing process, as where it has miscarried generally, it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh: [68]-[71], [75]-[78], [80]-[87] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [125] (R A Hulme J); [128]-[129] (Schmidt J); [141]-[142] (Wilson J).

Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37; Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; [2001] NSWCCA 534 applied

MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37; Hutchen v R [2015] NSWCCA 101; Arsiotis v R [2015] NSWCCA 275; Marrow v R [2015] NSWCCA 282; Alpha v R [2015] NSWCCA 225 cited

Carroll v R [2015] NSWCCA 219 distinguished

Daniels v R [2016] NSWCCA 35; O’Connell v R [2016] NSWCCA 43 not followed

(vi)   (R A Hulme J, obiter) The High Court in Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 did not expressly deal with error in sentencing that only affects a discrete component and where there is no conceivable impact upon the overall sentence. Nonetheless, the words used in the judgment were not vague or ambiguous and must be applied faithfully: [124]-[125] (R A Hulme J).

(vii)   There may be occasions when, notwithstanding error, it is not necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion. It will not be necessary where, for example, an arithmetical error occurred in the calculation of the date of commencement, end date or expiration of non-parole period or in the calculation of the effect of a discount for a plea or assistance to authorities, the extent of which was properly determined: [72] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [125] (R A Hulme J); [129] (Schmidt J); [141]-[142] (Wilson J).

Was a lesser sentence warranted in law?

(viii)   The offence of dangerous driving causing death was in the upper range of objective seriousness taking into account the fact that the applicant was driving a manual car which he had no knowledge or experience of driving, was under the influence of drugs, subject to sleep deprivation and driving at a grossly excessive speed: [106] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [119] (R A Hulme J); [128] (Schmidt J).

(ix)   The applicant’s case fell generally within the typical case described in the guideline judgment. The presence of multiple aggravating features identified in the guideline judgment confirmed that the applicant bore a very high degree of moral culpability: [109]-[110] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [119] (R A Hulme J); [128] (Schmidt J).

R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252; [2002] NSWCCA 343 applied

(x)   Comparable cases could be taken into account to ensure consistency and to demonstrate the approach taken by courts to serious offences where there is a high degree of moral culpability: [111] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [119] (R A Hulme J); [128] (Schmidt J).

Bombardieri v R [2010] NSWCCA 161; (2010) 203 A Crim R 89; R v Wright [2013] NSWCCA 82; (2013) 229 A Crim R 245; Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 290 considered

(xi)   A lesser sentence was warranted in law: [113] (Bathurst CJ); [118] (Beazley P); [119] (R A Hulme J); [128] (Schmidt J).

(xii)   (Wilson J in dissent) No lesser sentence was warranted in law. Each of the subject offences was serious with distinct criminality, requiring some level of accumulation. It was necessary for there to be some substantial appreciation in the penalty to reflect the Form 1 offences. The grave criminality demanded the imposition of a stern sentence and nothing in the applicant’s subjective circumstances or criminal record entitled him to any amelioration of penalty or leniency. While the cases relied upon by the applicant were of some assistance, none were truly comparable: [145]-[154] (Wilson J).

Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; [2002] NSWCCA 518 applied

Judgment


	
	BATHURST CJ: The applicant, Matthew Lehn, pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one charge of aggravated dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act) and one charge of stealing a motor vehicle contrary to s 154F of that Act.
	
	
	The offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, whilst the offence of stealing a motor vehicle carries a maximum penalty of 10 years. Neither offence carries a standard non-parole period.
	
	
	On the offence of stealing a motor vehicle, the applicant was sentenced in the District Court to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 10 June 2013 and to expire on 9 June 2015. Two counts of possessing prohibited drugs contrary to s 10 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) were taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to this offence.
	
	
	On the s 52A(2) offence, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7 years, dating from 10 June 2014 and expiring on 9 June 2021 with an additional term of 3 years expiring on 9 June 2024. In sentencing the applicant for this offence, the sentencing judge took into account a Form 1 offence of failing to stop and assist after a vehicle impact causing death contrary to s 52AB(1) of the Crimes Act.
	
	
	The applicant was thus sentenced to an effective head sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. The sentencing judge, whilst accepting that the plea of guilty was entered at the earliest opportunity, allowed a discount of 20% for the utilitarian benefit of the plea, rather than 25%.
	
	
	The applicant has sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed.
	


Factual background


	
	In his written submissions, the applicant set out the factual background surrounding the offence in a manner not inconsistent with the findings of the primary judge, nor in a manner disputed by the Crown. The summary below is based on those submissions.
	
	
	At about 5.00am on 10 June 2013, the applicant stole a manual silver Nissan vehicle.
	
	
	At about 10.25am, the applicant drove to an address in Ambarvale and collected an acquaintance, Mr Joshua East. The applicant and Mr East then purchased cannabis. Following the purchase, they travelled north along Dickens Road in Ambarvale. Mr East was sitting in the front passenger seat.
	
	
	Dickens Road is defined as a local road within the Campbelltown Local Government area. It is bordered by residential houses and caters for single lane traffic in each direction, separated by unbroken lines. The road has a number of bends and slight undulations. A speed limit of 50 km/h applies.
	
	
	As the vehicle travelled north along Dickens Road another driver, Mr Shane Long, was further down the road approaching in the opposite direction. Mr Long’s vehicle was fitted with a dashboard camera. The dashboard camera captured footage of the 75 year old victim, Mr Harry McCarroll, walking along Dickens Road in the concrete gutter. Mr McCarroll was dressed in light coloured clothing and was carrying grocery bags.
	
	
	As the vehicle passed Mr Long’s vehicle on Dickens Road, the dashboard camera recorded Mr Long’s remark, “Yeah right you’re really doing 50 kms an hour”. An expert opinion assessed that the vehicle was, at that moment, travelling at a speed not less than 94 km/h.
	
	
	The vehicle continued travelling north along Dickens Road, along part of the roadway that has a bend to the right followed by a bend to the left in an “S” shape and advisory “keep left” signs.
	
	
	Whilst traveling at a speed greater than 73 km/h, the applicant began to negotiate the left hand bend when he lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle lost traction with the roadway and began to rotate anticlockwise with the offside rear sliding to the right. Due to oversteer, the vehicle then rotated clockwise, travelled onto the incorrect side of the road and continued to rotate clockwise across the road towards the grassed nature strip on the eastern side of the road outside 1 Neil Place. The victim, Mr McCarroll, was walking south along the grassed nature strip at the time.
	
	
	The vehicle mounted the eastern kerb before the front nearside of the vehicle impacted heavily with Mr McCarroll on the grassed nature strip. The force of the impact caused Mr McCarroll to be thrown a considerable distance towards the front steps of 1 Neil Place.
	
	
	The vehicle continued to travel into the front yard of 1 Neil Place where it collided with and then uprooted a small tree. The vehicle rolled over and collided with the front balustrade and footsteps of 1 Neil Place and eventually came to rest on its roof against the veranda of the house.
	
	
	On hearing the impact, one of the residents of 1 Neil Place, Mr Rawari Nicholson, came outside and saw the vehicle. He saw Mr East get out of the vehicle and run north along Dickens Road. Mr Nicholson then saw Mr McCarroll lying unresponsive on the veranda stairs. He went to assist Mr McCarroll when he heard banging from inside the vehicle. He then saw the applicant get out of the vehicle through the rear window and run off north along Dickens Road. The applicant did not stop or look back.
	
	
	Following the arrival of police and emergency services, Mr McCarroll was taken to Campbelltown Hospital where he passed away from the injuries he had suffered in the collision.
	
	
	Police examined the scene and observed that the roadway was dry at the time and that there were no contaminants or obstructions on the road surface that may have contributed to the collision. Tyre markings on the roadway were consistent with the vehicle moving from the northbound lane across the unbroken dividing lines and mounting the concrete kerb outside 1 Neil Place. There was no other road evidence to suggest any braking by the applicant before the vehicle lost traction and mounted the kerb. Mechanical examinations of the vehicle, conducted at a later stage in the police investigation, found no defects or failures.
	
	
	Police conducted a search of the vehicle and located a small bag belonging to the applicant. Inside the bag was a small resealable plastic bag containing 0.10 grams of amphetamine and a tissue containing 0.5 grams of cannabis leaf.
	
	
	At about 11.00am, the applicant attended his grandmother’s home at 1 Greenoakes Avenue, Bradbury, with Mr East. He made admissions about being the driver in the collision. Police were contacted and informed that the applicant was at those premises. Upon their arrival, the applicant and Mr East ran from the residence. Mr East was apprehended hiding inside a shed and subsequently informed police that the applicant was the driver of the vehicle. The applicant was not located at that time.
	
	
	At about 6.25pm, police were informed that the applicant had returned to 1 Greenoakes Avenue. Police attended and found the applicant. The applicant was arrested and cautioned at which time he abused his uncle, Mr Clay King, stating, “… you’re a fucking dog. A fucking dog. I’m your nephew and this is how you treat family you dog”.
	
	
	During a subsequent ERISP interview, the applicant admitted being the driver of the vehicle and stated it had been his intention to burn it out. He informed police that he could not drive a manual vehicle and thought he would just have a go. He said that while he was driving down Dickens Road in third gear, Mr East told him to slow down because of gravel. The applicant said that he “tapped the brakes and the car … slid” and that he “tried to correct it and it … swung the other way and then hit the deceased”. He also stated that Mr East was yelling at him “Matty, Matty, this corners [sic] fucked you need to take it easier you know like this” and that he “let go of the accelerator”.
	
	
	The applicant said that he “panicked” and was “freaking out”, like scattered off his head and there were people screaming at him through the house and he just legged it as he wasn’t “sticking around”. He “did not have any fears for his safety, just a lot of guilt”. Once he climbed out of the vehicle, he ran away and did not look around to see where the deceased was.
	
	
	As to why he ran when police attended his grandmother’s house, he said that he was “scared and just wanted to have a hot shower, feed and spend time with his family as he wasn’t ready to go to gaol”.
	
	
	The applicant admitted that he was “drug affected every day”. He indicated that he was using 400mgs of Seroquel and 10mgs of Valium, had been a daily “user of cannabis for the past 10 years” and also used ice. He had smoked about 3 grams of cannabis in the “couple of days” before the collision. He said that he used ice because it had a good effect on him and “ma[de] him feel ten foot tall and bullet proof, like he could do anything”. He smoked ice the day before the collision and had last smoked ice about half an hour before the collision. He had last slept three or four nights before the collision and had not eaten anything over the same period.
	
	
	Mr East told the police that he had the impression the applicant was not confident in driving the vehicle and that he was screaming at the applicant as he started showing off, telling him to slow down and not take the corner too fast. He said the applicant was going “70 km/h easy”.
	
	
	Dr Judith Perl, a clinical forensic pharmacologist, gave an expert opinion that, based on the manner of driving and the level of methylamphetamine used by the applicant prior to the collision, the applicant’s driving ability would have been very substantially impaired at the time of the collision. Senior Constable Fenton provided an expert report in relation to the speed of the vehicle as it was depicted in the footage from Mr Long’s dashboard camera. He opined that it was travelling at an average speed of not less than 94.7 km/h as it travelled north along Dickens Road. Another expert was of the opinion the vehicle would have been travelling at a speed of about 73 km/h to account for all the evidence.
	


The applicant’s subjective circumstances


	
	The applicant was aged 24 years at the date of the offence. He had a criminal record, which the sentencing judge described as, though not extensive, not one entitling him to leniency. He was convicted in the Children’s Court in 2005 of two charges of armed robbery for which he received 18 months control orders. In 2009, he was fined for possession of a prohibited drug and for stealing in a dwelling house and received a good behaviour bond for 12 months under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Procedure Act). In 2010, he was fined for possessing a prohibited drug and placed on a s 9 bond for shoplifting. In 2011, he was convicted of common assault and damaging property and again received s 9 bonds.
	
	
	Tendered at the hearing was the report of a forensic psychologist, Mr Patrick Sheehan, who interviewed the applicant on 2 October 2014. Mr Sheehan stated that the applicant believed he was raised by his natural parents until aged 15 when he was told his father was in fact his stepfather, a discovery he found painful and bewildering. The applicant told Mr Sheehan he had no contact with his biological father, who he heard was a chronic drug addict. The applicant described his mother as “sweet natured and loving” but that his stepfather was a strict disciplinarian who “flogged” him up to three times a day. He told Mr Sheehan he remained in close contact with his mother, who visited him weekly, and his sister, who visited him intermittently.
	
	
	The applicant told Mr Sheehan that he had difficulties from a young age. He said he frequently ran away from home. He said that aged 13 he was placed in a “Youth off the Streets” residential home in the Southern Highlands, where he was exposed to violence and illicit drug use. He told Mr Sheehan his conduct pattern worsened thereafter and, since the age of 13 years, he did not reside consistently with his family.
	
	
	The applicant was diagnosed with ADHD during kindergarten. So far as his education was concerned, he said that he obtained Year 9 equivalence. He mainly held “cash in hand jobs”, the longest period of continuous employment being 13 months as an assessor and detailer.
	
	
	The applicant told the psychologist that his most significant intimate relationship lasted for 6 years with a fellow drug user and homeless person he met in his late teens. He said his partner overcame her substance problem. He said that he had fathered a child and that he tried to take parenthood seriously. He said his partner left him after he was charged with the offences the subject of these proceedings. However, he told the psychologist that his relationship with his former partner remained reasonable and his mother brought his daughter to see him every weekend.
	
	
	So far as his drug use was concerned, the applicant told Mr Sheehan that he used cannabis but escalated to amphetamines by the age of 15. He said he started using heroin from the age of 18, although he abstained from heroin between the ages of 18 and 20 years, during which time he commenced methylamphetamine use.
	
	
	The psychologist stated the applicant’s drug history met the diagnostic threshold of substance use disorder. He stated that in his view the culmination of anxiety, substance use disorder and personality disorder played the dominant role in sustaining the applicant’s community maladjustment and criminality.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. He expressed remorse and read a letter to the sentencing judge in which he reiterated that remorse and stated that he resolved to do whatever he had to do to rehabilitate himself.
	


The remarks on sentence


	
	The sentencing judge referred to the guideline judgment in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252; [2002] NSWCCA 343 (Whyte), which he said set out a number of aggravating factors for this type of offence, whilst recognising that they operated as a guide, not a checklist. He referred to the fact that the applicant was driving at an excessive speed and in a manner which caused his passenger to scream at him to slow down when he started showing off. He noted that the applicant’s driving was substantially impaired by the use of illicit drugs.
	
	
	The sentencing judge pointed to the fact there was a significant potential for adult and child pedestrians to be put at risk. He concluded that the applicant had abandoned his responsibility to other users of the road and therefore his moral culpability was high.
	
	
	Dealing with the objective seriousness of the offence, the sentencing judge stated that, while the circumstances in question did not perhaps fall into the worst case category, they fell within the upper end of the range.
	
	
	The sentencing judge referred to the subjective circumstances of the applicant which I have set out above. He noted that the applicant intended to work through the prison classification system to obtain a work release program. He accepted that the applicant had time to reflect on the enormity of his conduct and that his expressions of remorse were genuine. He stated that he was satisfied that, provided he remained drug free, he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded that both general and specific deterrence were significant factors. In relation to the accumulation of the sentences, his Honour stated that, although the offences occurred on the same day they were separate and distinct. He noted that the applicant always contemplated the destruction of the motor vehicle and thus, it was his intention to permanently deprive the owner of its possession. In those circumstances, he considered partial accumulation was called for.
	
	
	With respect to the Form 1 offences, the sentencing judge noted what was said by Spigelman CJ in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146; [2002] NSWCCA 518 that the essence of the process is to impose a longer sentence than would be imposed if the primary offence stood alone: at [18].
	
	
	In relation to the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea, the sentencing judge made the following remarks:
	


“The offender is entitled to have his plea of guilty taken into account in mitigation of penalty. This is done on two bases, to reflect the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system and also to reflect contrition. The plea was entered in the Local Court on 27 August 2014, accordingly it can be regarded as a plea at the earliest opportunity. In such circumstances a court may consider a discount of up to 25% to reflect the utilitarian benefit of the plea. However care must be taken not to attribute a discount that would have the effect of reducing a sentence to a level below that which would be recognised to accurately reflect the Court’s assessment of objective gravity of the offending conduct. In the exercise of my discretion I intend to reflect the utilitarian benefit by a discount of about 20%.”

The grounds of appeal


	
	The grounds of appeal are:
	


“1   The sentencing judge erred in applying only a 20 per cent utilitarian discount for the applicant’s plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court.

2   The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.”

Ground 1


	
	The Crown accepted that the judge had erred in giving a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea of 20% rather than 25%. The Crown stated that it had made no submission that anything less than a 25% discount was appropriate and the sentencing judge gave no indication of his intention to grant a lesser discount. It was accepted, in those circumstances, that procedural unfairness had occurred.
	
	
	The issue which divided the parties was the consequence of the error. The Crown submitted that it did not vitiate the entire sentencing discretion but only a discrete component, namely the discount for the plea and thus only required a re-exercise of the discretion so far as it concerned the discount to be applied for the plea of guilty. The applicant, on the other hand, contended that once error had been established, the Court was required by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (Criminal Appeal Act) to resentence the applicant, taking into account any additional material placed before the Court for that purpose. Having regard to the importance of this issue, a five judge bench was convened to consider it.
	
	
	It is convenient to deal with this issue prior to dealing with Ground 2. This is because, if the Court has to form an independent view of whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law, it will be necessary for it to form a view as to the appropriate sentence as distinct from determining whether the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321; [2000] HCA 54 at [22]; Hili v The Queen (2010) 242 CLR 520; [2010] HCA 45 at [58]-[59]. Thus, if the Court is required to resentence, Ground 2 will fall away.
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown, in its original submissions, placed reliance on the decision of R A Hulme J in Application by Darush Majid pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) [2016] NSWSC 561. In that decision, his Honour referred to some errors as only affecting a discrete component of the sentencing outcome, giving examples which included the extent of the discount for a plea of guilty. His Honour expressed the view that, in those circumstances, there was a persuasive argument in favour of the view that all that was required by Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 (Kentwell) was to re-exercise the discretion in respect of the discrete component of the sentence infected by error.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that that approach was consistent with the approach taken by this Court in O’Connell v R [2016] NSWCCA 43 (O’Connell) at [29] and Daniels v R [2016] NSWCCA 35 (Daniels) at [61].
	
	
	At the hearing, the Crown accepted that the grant of a discount for a plea was not entirely a matter of arithmetic, as it was necessary to ask whether the sentence derived after the application of any discount was reasonably proportionate or disproportionate to the offending the subject of the sentence to be imposed.
	
	
	In supplementary submissions filed after the hearing, the Crown, whilst noting that the High Court in Kentwell adopted the analysis of Spigelman CJ in Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 (Baxter), submitted that both Kentwell and Baxter were dealing with error that vitiated the sentencing process. It submitted that, by contrast, this appeal was concerned with an error in respect of a discrete part of the process. Reliance was placed on what was said by R A Hulme J in Martin v R [2016] NSWCCA 104 (Martin) to the effect that all a court should do in circumstances such as the present is re-exercise the discretion so far as it concerns, in the words of the Crown, “the discount for plea”. The Crown placed particular reliance on the statement in Kentwell that not every error vitiates the exercise of the sentencing discretion: at [42].
	
	
	The Crown emphasised that the only error in the present case was in respect of a discrete component of the sentence, which, it said, referring to the remarks of R A Hulme J in Martin, had no potential bearing on the whole sentence.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the judgment of R A Hulme J in Martin accepts that the correction of a “discrete component” error does enliven the discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal but only to the limited extent of that error. It submitted that s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act is capable of facilitating the exercise of the discretion limited to a component of the sentencing outcome. It submitted that this was the approach taken by Fullerton J in O’Connell.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the limited approach suggested by R A Hulme J in Martin should be adopted in the present case.
	
	
	The applicant referred to the approach taken by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; [2001] NSWCCA 534 (Simpson), as modified by his remarks in Baxter, which were approved by the High Court in Kentwell at [42]. Counsel for the applicant submitted that, where there has been a miscarriage of discretion, the Court will need to reconsider the sentence and, in order to determine whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law, the sentencing exercise needs to be carried out afresh.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant, whilst not conceding that the approach in Daniels was correct, referred to the fact that the ground of manifest excess in that case was not made out on the appeal and, in those circumstances, resentencing was limited to effectively striking down an impermissible condition on parole and otherwise confirming the sentence. He submitted that the approach adopted in Marrow v R [2015] NSWCCA 282 (Marrow), where the Court resentenced, having found error by the sentencing judge in allowing only a 20% discount for an early plea, was the correct approach.
	
	
	In supplementary submissions filed after the hearing, the applicant submitted that the tentative view I expressed in Martin, namely that it was not appropriate to adjust that part of a sentence affected by a discrete error as distinct from resentencing, was correct. He submitted that, once a court found error, it was not for the court to speculate as to how such error affected the sentence, as distinct from proceeding to resentence.
	
	
	The applicant referred to the following passage from the judgment of R A Hulme J in Martin at [95]:
	


“This indicates to me that it was not held that any error in sentencing requires a fresh exercise of the sentencing discretion. Arguably, it was held that only an error that potentially had an effect on the sentencing outcome invokes that requirement. Put another way, it is what has been held to have been affected by House v The King error that should be the subject of the ‘fresh exercise’.”


	
	He submitted that this passage was a restatement of the requirement of a material error rejected in Kentwell. He also pointed to the difficulty of identifying what could be classified as a limited error.
	


Consideration


	
	In my opinion, the Court having found error, it is necessary for it to exercise its discretion to resentence the applicant, rather than to focus on correcting the discrete component of the sentence which was the subject of the error. That this is so can be demonstrated by consideration of the nature of the error, a consideration of the text of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act and the authorities which have dealt with the issue.
	


The nature of the error


	
	It is important to bear in mind that the error in the present case was not, for example, a mistake in the calculation of the discount to be granted for the early plea, nor a mistake as to when the plea was entered. By contrast, the sentencing judge expressly noted that the plea was entered at the earliest opportunity but he considered that a 20% discount was appropriate so as not to reduce the sentence below that which would reflect the Court’s assessment of the objective gravity of the offence.
	
	
	In that context, it must be emphasised that the grant of the utilitarian discount of 25% for a plea entered at the earliest possible opportunity is not mandatory. Section 22(1A) of the Sentencing Procedure Act provides that a lesser penalty imposed under that section must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and gravity of the offence. Although it is well accepted, consistent with the guideline judgment in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 (Thomson), that a utilitarian discount of 25% will generally be granted for a plea entered at the earliest possible opportunity, it remains a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge: Thomson at [153]; see also Marrow at [39].
	
	
	This is not to suggest that the instinctive synthesis approach in sentencing is inconsistent with the award of a discount for a factor which can be seen to relate to a purpose distinct from a sentencing purpose, as is the case with a discount solely related to the utilitarian value of the plea. So much was made clear by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357; [2005] HCA 25 (Markarian) at [74]:
	


“[74]   Nor is the instinctive synthesis approach inconsistent with awarding a discount for some factor, provided that discount relates to a purpose distinct from a sentencing purpose. The distinction between permissible and impermissible quantification of ‘discounts’ on a sentence will usually be found in whether the quantification relates to a sentencing purpose rather than some other purpose. So, the quantification of the discount commonly applied for an early plea of guilty or assistance to authorities is offered as an incentive for specific outcomes in the administration of criminal justice and is not related to sentencing purposes. The non-sentencing purpose of the discount for an early guilty plea or assistance is demonstrated by the fact that offenders are ordinarily entitled to additional mitigation for any remorse or contrition demonstrated with the plea or assistance, aside from the discount for willingness to facilitate the course of justice. That said, I think the use of discounts should be reserved for only one – maybe two – factors in a particular sentence that serve some goal other than a sentencing goal.”


	
	In the present case, the approach the sentencing judge took meant that the discount for the plea was directly connected to a sentencing purpose in that he declined to grant a further utilitarian discount because the resulting sentence would not reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. It was not debated at the hearing whether the reason for the reduction of the discount conflicted with the provisions of s 22(1A) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, but whether it did or not, the question of the extent of the discount directly related to a sentencing purpose, namely, ensuring that the penalty reflected the objective gravity of the offence.
	
	
	Further, the error which was made was that the applicant was denied procedural fairness in circumstances where, during the sentencing hearing, the Crown did not contend that anything less than a 25% discount should be awarded and the sentencing judge gave no indication that he contemplated giving a lesser discount. It was not disputed that such a denial of procedural fairness constituted an error. A denial of procedural fairness has been held to be an error of law which can be classified as jurisdictional: Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala (2000) 204 CLR 82; [2000] HCA 57 (Aala) at [41], [169]; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah (2001) 206 CLR 57; [2001] HCA 22 at [26], [213]. In the context of court proceedings, such a denial of procedural fairness will entitle the aggrieved party to a rehearing, unless a particular breach would not have affected the outcome: Aala at [104]; Stead v State Government Insurance Commission (1986) 161 CLR 141; [1986] HCA 54 at 145. Put another way, where there has been a denial of procedural fairness, a miscarriage of justice has occurred in respect of which the person affected is entitled to relief.
	
	
	I have dealt with the nature of the error in order to demonstrate that it is not open to conclude that the error was not connected with the sentencing process or did not affect the sentencing discretion. The question remains whether, assuming the error only affected the discretion to a limited extent, it is appropriate to exercise the discretion only in relation to that particular component.
	


The relevant legislation


	
	Whether or not it is necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion generally, as distinct from the discrete component of the sentence affected by the error, depends ultimately on the construction of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. The subsection is predicated on error of the nature of that described in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40 at 504-505. The subsection is in the following terms:
	


“6   Determination of appeals in ordinary cases

…

(3)   On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.”


	
	As was stated in Alcan (NT) Alumina Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Territory Revenue (2009) 239 CLR 27; [2009] HCA 41, the task of statutory construction must begin with a consideration of the text itself, although the meaning of the text may require consideration of the context which includes the general purposes and policy of the provision: at [47]; see also Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia v Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd (2012) 250 CLR 503; [2012] HCA 55 at [39]. The text of the section under consideration in this case, where it applies, requires a court to form an opinion as to whether some other sentence, whether more or less severe, is warranted in law. The section, as a matter of language, does not provide that if a discrete error is found, the sentence can be adjusted to take account of that error. It seems to me that if there is an error which affects the exercise of the sentencing discretion, the section requires the court to form its own view of the appropriate sentence, although, as pointed out in Kentwell at [43], not necessarily to resentence.
	
	
	That seems to me consistent with what is evidently the purpose of the section, namely to ensure that a person whose sentence is affected by error is sentenced according to law.
	
	
	Further, there are difficulties with the alternative approach. The instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing is now well-established. As explained by McHugh J in Markarian, it involves identifying all factors relevant to the sentencing discretion, discussing their significance and making a value judgment as to what is the appropriate sentence: at [51]. A separate adjustment of a particular component of a sentence infected by error does not seem consistent with this approach.
	
	
	There is a further difficulty. Assume an error affecting only a discrete component is established so that the power conferred on the Court, and the corresponding duty imposed on it under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, is invoked. Is the Court, in those circumstances, entitled to resentence generally, having regard to all the material before it, or is its power limited to re-exercising the discretion in respect of the discrete part of the sentence infected by error? The section provides no assistance on this question.
	
	
	That is not to say that there will not be occasions when, notwithstanding error, it is not necessary to re-exercise the sentencing discretion. It will not be necessary where, for example, an arithmetical error occurred in the calculation of the commencement and end date of the sentence or the date of the expiration of a non-parole period arrived at in the proper exercise of discretion or, for example, an error in the calculation of the effect of a discount for a plea or assistance to the authorities, where the extent of the discount to be allowed was reached in accordance with proper principles.
	


The authorities


	
	What I have stated, in my view, is consistent with the authorities which have dealt with this issue, subject to two exceptions. In Simpson, Spigelman CJ noted that the appellant’s submission in that case proceeded on the assumption that if he could identify some error then the Court would proceed to resentence: at [74]. He made the following remarks at [79]:
	


“[79]   Sentencing appeals in this Court frequently proceed as if the statutory trigger for the quashing of a sentence were expressed as follows: ‘If it is of the opinion that error has occurred in the sentencing process.’ That is not the statutory formulation. By s 6(3) this Court must form a positive opinion that ‘some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed’. Unless such an opinion is formed, the essential pre-condition for the exercise of the power to ‘quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor’ is not satisfied. As the judgments in Dinsdale to which I have referred indicate, the exercise of the power in s 6(3) further requires the identification of error in the requisite sense.”


	
	Spigelman CJ explained these remarks in Baxter. In that case, his Honour made the following remarks concerning the construction of s 6(3):
	


“[8]   The dominant and active verbs in s 6(3) are both in the present tense, ie if the Court of Criminal Appeal ‘is of opinion’ and ‘some other sentence … is warranted in law’. The employment of the past tense in the phrase ‘should have been passed’ is distinctly subsidiary. It is employed in order to reflect the fact that, when the Court of Criminal Appeal intervenes, it does so with effect from the date of the original sentence.

[9]   This interpretation is consistent with the reference in s 6(3) to s 5(1). That section permits an appeal ‘against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction’. The appeal is from the sentence that has been passed by the sentencing judge. However, the reference in s 6(3) should not be understood as saying ‘should have been passed by the sentencing judge’. It should be understood as an institutional reference, ie ‘should have been passed by the Court’.

[10]   When the Court of Criminal Appeal turns its mind to forming the opinion which s 6(3) requires, it must do so by reference to the facts as they exist at that time, insofar as the Court permits evidence of those facts to be placed before the Court.”


	
	In a passage approved by the High Court in Kentwell, his Honour made the following remarks concerning [79] of his judgment in Simpson:
	


“[19]   The import of [79] of Simpson was to ensure that submissions in the Court of Criminal Appeal did not proceed as if the identification of error created an entitlement on the part of an Applicant to a new sentence, for example, by merely adjusting the sentence actually passed to allow for the error identified. That would be to proceed on the assumption that the sentencing judge was presumptively correct, when the Court has determined that the exercise of the discretion had miscarried. Section 6(3) is directed to ensuring that the Court of Criminal Appeal does not proceed in that manner, but re-exercises the sentencing discretion taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles with a view to formulating the positive opinion for which the subsection provides.” (Emphasis added)


	
	The portion of the passage which I have emphasised seems to me directly contrary to the proposition that adjustment can be made to a discrete component of the sentence in respect of which an error of discretion occurred.
	
	
	The High Court in Kentwell rejected the proposition that a court could dismiss an appeal unless the applicant could demonstrate substantial injustice. The plurality stated that the passage from the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Baxter, which I have set out above, correctly stated the law. The plurality made the following remarks at [42]:
	


“[42]   Spigelman CJ’s analysis in Baxter should be accepted. When a judge acts upon wrong principle, allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the determination, mistakes the facts or does not take into account some material consideration, the Court of Criminal Appeal does not assess whether and to what degree the error influenced the outcome. The discretion in such a case has miscarried and it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the Sentencing Act, and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit. As sentencing is a discretionary judgment that does not yield a single correct result, it follows that a range of sentences in a given case may be said to be ‘warranted in law’. A sentence that happens to be within the range but that has been imposed as the result of a legally flawed determination is not ‘warranted in law’ unless, in the exercise of its independent discretion, the Court of Criminal Appeal determines that it is the appropriate sentence for the offender and the offence. This is not to say that all errors in the sentencing of offenders vitiate the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion. By way of example, s 44(1) of the Sentencing Act requires the court when sentencing an offender to imprisonment to first set the non-parole period and then set the balance of the term. Prior to 1 February 2003, a court was required to first set the term of the sentence and then specify the non-parole period. A court which sentences an offender to imprisonment after 1 February 2003 by first setting the term of the sentence commits legal error. Without more, the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion.”


	
	These remarks, in my opinion, are equally appropriate to circumstances where the discretion miscarried in respect of a discrete component of the sentencing process as where the sentencing discretion generally miscarried.
	
	
	In O’Grady v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 621; [2014] HCA 38 (O’Grady), the High Court again emphasised the importance of the offender being sentenced according to law. The Court made the following remarks at [13]:
	


“[13]   For the reasons given in Kentwell, it was an error to confine the discretion conferred under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (s 10(1)(b)) and the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) by requiring the appellant to demonstrate that refusal of the application would occasion substantial injustice. The application was to be determined by consideration of the interests of justice. The statement that no matter advanced by the appellant established that substantial injustice was occasioned by the sentence is best understood as a conclusion that, upon summary review, the sentence did not impress as excessive. The appellant is entitled to be sentenced according to law. The issue for the Court's consideration was whether upon the hearing of the appeal it might conclude, taking into account the full range of factors including the evidence of the appellant's progress in custody, that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.”


	
	The authorities since Kentwell and O’Grady, with perhaps two exceptions, are not inconsistent with this approach. They have been helpfully reviewed by R A Hulme J in Martin. A number of these have adopted the approach which I suggest is appropriate without considering the alternative: MD v R [2015] NSWCCA 37; Hutchen v R [2015] NSWCCA 101; Arsiotis v R [2015] NSWCCA 275; Marrow; Alpha v R [2015] NSWCCA 225. In the latter case, R A Hulme J expressed doubts that complete resentencing was required where an arithmetical error is the sole basis for the Court’s intervention in a sentencing appeal: at [53]. To the extent his Honour was referring to a mere error of calculation, this is not inconsistent with what I believe to be the correct approach.
	
	
	In Carroll v R [2015] NSWCCA 219, the re-exercise of the discretion was confined to determining the degree of concurrence/accumulation. However, this was the result of a concession by counsel for the applicant that that was all that was necessary in the circumstances of that case: at [40].
	
	
	There have been two cases in which a contrary approach to that which I have suggested was taken. In Daniels, the relevant error was the imposition by the sentencing judge of a condition that, on the offender’s release to parole, he enter a residential rehabilitation program. It was conceded that the imposition of such a condition was beyond the power of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	Fullerton J, with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and R S Hulme AJ agreed, referred to the fact that in Kentwell, at [42], the plurality noted that not all errors affected the sentencing judge’s discretion. Her Honour went on to make the following remarks:
	


“[28]   In my view, the error in the sentencing exercise the subject of the second ground of appeal is an example of an error of the kind to which the High Court in Kentwell was referring. After setting aside the parole condition (it being of no legal effect being made beyond power), the sentencing judge’s appointment of a non-parole period of 3 years as the minimum period the applicant is to spend in custody is unaffected. Although his Honour clearly intended that the applicant’s release at the expiration of three years should be subject to the further condition that he be willing to comply with the restrictions on his liberty that would result from his participation in a residential rehabilitation program, it was also treated as a special circumstance for the purposes s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act giving the applicant the benefit of a shorter period in full-time custody.

[29]   I do not regard the error in imposing a parole condition as part of the sentencing order as vitiating the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion in this case. I would order that the parole condition be set aside but I would not move to re-sentence the applicant.”


	
	That decision is explicable on the basis that the invalid condition was something entirely discrete from the sentencing process or the exercise of the sentencing discretion. As such, it does not provide support for the contrary view to that which I consider to be correct. However, if in fact the imposition of the condition formed part of the discretion, even if it could only be said to affect the non-parole period, then, in my respectful submission, the Court was in error in failing to resentence the applicant.
	
	
	In O’Connell, the issue was whether the sentencing judge, having found special circumstances, erred in failing to adjust the non-parole period pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. Fullerton J, with whom Hoeben CJ at CL and Adams J agreed, stated that she was satisfied the sentencing judge intended to make some adjustment to the statutory ratio and his failure to do so must have been through oversight or miscalculation or both: at [27]. Her Honour went on to make the following remarks:
	


“[28]   That being the case, the applicant has made out a sentencing error that requires this Court to apply s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

[29]   Since the appeal is limited to the question whether the sentencing judge erred in failing to adjust the non-parole period in accordance with his conclusion that special circumstances warranted such an adjustment pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, it is not necessary for this Court to consider whether the non-parole period and the additional term, taken together, were affected by an error of law. The only question for this Court was the propriety of the proportion of the sentence constituted by the non-parole period. Accordingly, it is necessary for this Court, in accordance with the principles in Kentwell v R (No 2) [2013] NSWCCA 96, to independently consider the application of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to the applicant’s sentence and, in substance, if a lesser non-parole period should have been imposed, quash the sentence and pass the appropriately adjusted sentence.

…

[31]   Having considered the material upon which the applicant relies on re-sentence, I am not persuaded that this Court should intervene and reduce the minimum time the applicant is to serve in custody by extending the time he will be under supervision on parole, even if only by the margin of five months the applicant proposes. That is, I am unable to come to the positive finding that some other sentence is warranted in law under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.

[32]   In my view, the evidence at the sentencing hearing, as supplemented by the evidence of re-sentence upon which the applicant relies in this Court, does not allow for a finding of special circumstances - a finding of fact that in the first instance has to be resolved in the applicant’s favour if this Court is to intervene and allow for a further adjustment in the statutory ratio. I note it is not suggested by the applicant’s counsel that the order for partial accumulation of one year should attract a finding of special circumstances, and neither could it have been when the measure of accumulation was so modest for two distinct courses of very serious offending separated by three years. Neither is it suggested that there is any other basis the finding other than the applicant’s continued preparedness to seek treatment.”


	
	Kentwell v R (No 2) [2015] NSWCCA 96 (Kentwell (No 2)), to which Fullerton J referred, with respect, offers no support for a limited approach to a re-exercise of the sentencing discretion. By contrast, both Rothman J and I emphasised in that case that, error having being established, it was necessary to resentence the applicant: at [6], [12] (Bathurst CJ); [50]-[59] (Rothman J).
	
	
	In these circumstances, in my respectful opinion, the approach adopted by the Court in O’Connell was not in accordance with the requirements of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
	
	
	In these circumstances, it is necessary in the present case to resentence the applicant, having regard to the material presently before the Court.
	


Is a lesser sentence warranted in law?


	
	The parties were in agreement that their submissions on Ground 2 of the grounds of appeal could be treated as submissions on this issue.
	
	
	In addition, the applicant relied on an affidavit sworn by him on 13 May 2016 and an affidavit of his solicitor, Stephen Eccleshall, affirmed on 13 May 2016. In his affidavit, the applicant repeated his remorse for what had occurred and indicated that, since his sentence, he has not breached any prison disciplinary rules. This was confirmed by the Corrective Services records annexed to Mr Eccleshall’s affidavit.
	
	
	The applicant stated in his affidavit that being on a methadone program has reduced his desire for illegal drugs and that he has been taking Zyprexa, the antipsychotic medication prescribed for him.
	
	
	The applicant also stated in his affidavit that he wants to participate in programs to help him with his drug problem, but has, as yet, been unable to enrol in them. This was confirmed by the prison records annexed to Mr Eccleshall’s affidavit.
	
	
	The applicant also stated that, whilst at Goulburn Gaol and currently at Cooma Gaol, he has worked in the textile shop and has started studying for his Year 10 School Certificate. He remains in contact with his family and daughter. He stated that in the future he hopes he can get a job and become a good father to his children.
	
	
	The applicant, whilst recognising the limitations, referred to the Judicial Commission’s statistics for the period from April 2008 to March 2015, which shows that the head sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was the highest recorded sentence for the offence in question over that period. He pointed out that the statistics showed that, of the 43 offenders who were sentenced to imprisonment for an offence under s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act, 25 were sentenced to head sentences ranging between 3 to 5 years, 11 to sentences of approximately 6 years, three for approximately 7 years, one to 8 years imprisonment, two to 9 years imprisonment and the applicant to 10 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The applicant referred to three cases where sentences of 8 to 9 years were imposed. The first of these cases was Bombardieri v R [2010] NSWCCA 161; (2010) 203 A Crim R 89 (Bombardieri). The applicant in that case, who was 20 years of age at the time of his offence, left the Gold Coast intending to drive to South Australia. He drove 290 kms before the fatal collision, driving at a high speed and erratically, including overtaking on the nearside of the road and crossing double lines.
	
	
	After a minor accident, a police pursuit ensued. When the applicant overtook a utility, crossing double yellow lines to do so, an oncoming vehicle swerved onto a grass verge to avoid a collision and came back on to the road into the path of a semitrailer. The driver was killed instantly. The appellant showed remorse for his actions and was considered to have good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The appellant was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with a discount of 16.6% for a plea of guilty. A non-parole period of 6 and a half years was fixed. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to a term of 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months. In the course of her judgment, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) made the following remarks at [20]-[21]:
	


“[20]   The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was recognised by all as being severe. That, of itself, is not sufficient to place it in the category of manifestly excessive. Nor is the fact that it is the highest sentence imposed for an offence under s 52A(2). However, it is the comparison with the sentences imposed for manslaughter which has satisfied me that his Honour’s discretion did miscarry and that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. In reaching this conclusion, I am acutely aware that a person, who was doing no more than driving on the right side of the road, has been killed and that the purposes of sentencing include denunciation of the criminal conduct of the offender and the need to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 3A(f) and (g).

[21]   However, sentencing principle also demands consistency of sentencing: see Whyte especially at [146]. The seriousness of the applicant’s conduct cannot be understated. It falls at the high end of objective seriousness for this offence. However, I am bound by the various principles of sentencing to which I have referred, recognising their internal tension. Had the overwhelming principle been denouncement, I would not have interfered with the sentence imposed. However, that is not an overwhelming tenet of sentencing principle. It is one purpose of sentencing that must play its appropriate role with others, including, as I have said, consistency of sentencing.”


	
	In R v Wright [2013] NSWCCA 82; (2013) 229 A Crim R 245 (Wright), a sentence of imprisonment of 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months was held not to be manifestly excessive. The applicant in that case was convicted of aggravated dangerous driving causing death and a second count of aggravated dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm. The matters of aggravation were driving the vehicle more than 45 km/h over the speed limit and having a blood alcohol level of at least 0.157 g of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. One passenger in the car, a 16 year old boy was killed whilst the other, a 14 year old girl was seriously injured. The applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of 3 years, commencing on 24 May 2012 for the second count, and 9 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months, commencing on 24 November 2012 for the first count, the overall sentence thus being 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months.
	
	
	The applicant had an appalling driving record. It was summarised by Price J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, in the following terms:
	


“[27]   The applicant was born on 28 May 1967. He was 43 years old when the offences were committed. His record as a driver in New South Wales and Queensland reveals an appalling traffic history between 1984 and 1997. He had four convictions for driving with the high range concentration of alcohol, the last conviction being on 23 May 1997 when he was sentenced to serve 9 months imprisonment by way of periodic detention and disqualified from driving for 5 years. His driving history prior to 1997 includes convictions for driving whilst disqualified (four times) driving after license cancelled, driving under the influence and driving whilst suspended. It appears that since he was re-issued with an unrestricted license in August 2002, he exceeded the speed limit in July 2007 by not more than 15 km/h and in April 2010 by more than 20 km/h, but not more than 30 km/h. These offences were dealt with by traffic infringement notices and the loss of demerit points.”


	
	In describing the offence as close to the worst kind of offence, his Honour made the following remarks:
	


“[86]   To my mind this is a very bad case of aggravated dangerous driving causing death. Whilst it is always possible to imagine driving that might have been more outrageous, the applicant's disgracefully irresponsible conduct is close to the worst type of offence of its kind. The judge described the applicant’s driving as extraordinary and correctly found that the applicant’s moral culpability was high. The applicant drove his vehicle at an extreme speed along a major highway for some 38½ km whilst his driving ability was substantially impaired by alcohol. He placed not only his young passengers at great risk but also many other motorists who were travelling along the Pacific Highway. The judge did not impose the maximum penalty for the offence, but commenced with an undiscounted starting point of twelve years imprisonment. Although stern, the sentence imposed for count one was within the legitimate exercise of his Honour’s sentencing discretion.”


	
	Price J distinguished Bombardieri in that the applicant did not have the benefit of Mr Bombardieri’s youth, Mr Bombardieri was the sole occupant of the vehicle, alcohol was not a factor and the totality principle did not apply. Price J pointed out that although manslaughter was a more serious case, sentences imposed for that offence do not provide the upper limit of sentences for offences under s 52A(2), the upper limit being the maximum penalty fixed by the statute.
	
	
	The third case referred to by the applicant was Smith v R [2011] NSWCCA 290 (Smith). In that case, the offender, who was aged 30 at the time of the offence, was sentenced to imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years and 3 months. The offender had driven his utility at speeds of between 80 and 100 km/h in a 60 km/h zone. The vehicle went through a red light and shortly thereafter was found upturned in a ditch. The applicant’s girlfriend was trapped in the vehicle and died at the scene. The applicant had a blood alcohol reading of 0.188.
	
	
	Blanch J, who delivered the judgment of the Court, noted that the sentence was significantly higher than that specified in the guideline judgment of Whyte and, after referring to a number of cases including Bombardieri, reduced the sentence to “maintain a consistency of approach”.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that, without more, statistics relied upon by the applicant were meaningless and the objective and subjective circumstances in the particular cases referred to were not related to the particular circumstances of the present case. The Crown submitted that it was unarguable that the applicant’s offending constituted a high level of moral culpability. It pointed out that the guideline judgment referred to the minimum sentences that might be imposed and is of little utility unless considered with the maximum penalty. The Crown pointed out that of the 11 aggravating factors identified in the guideline judgment, the only one that did not apply was “escaping police pursuit”.
	
	
	At the hearing, counsel for the Crown pointed to the inability of the applicant to drive a manual car, submitting also that the objective seriousness was elevated substantially by the fact that the applicant was driving a motor vehicle well in excess of 50 km/h in a residential area and that what occurred was illustrative of precisely the danger that could be expected. He emphasised that the applicant was drug affected and sleep deprived.
	


Consideration

The offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death


	
	I have set out the facts surrounding the commission of the offence above. The offence was a particularly serious one of its kind. The applicant was driving a manual vehicle which, on his own admission, he had no knowledge or experience of driving, at a time when he was substantially affected by drugs and sleep deprivation. Although I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was driving at a speed in excess of 45 km/h above the speed limit at the time of the offence (see Crimes Act s 52A(7)(b)), he was driving at a grossly excessive speed, having regard to the state and contours of the road at the time of the incident. The circumstances in which the accident occurred put the offence in the upper range of objective seriousness for offences of this nature. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the offence on the Form 1. Further, as the sentencing judge remarked, specific and general deterrence are of considerable importance in relation to offences of this nature.
	
	
	I have also set out the applicant’s objective circumstances. He was relatively young (aged 24) at the time of the offence and had a difficult upbringing, hardly assisted by his lengthy drug abuse. The sentencing judge considered that his remorse was genuine and that, if he remained drug free, his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable, matters which were not disputed on the appeal. The evidence provided on the appeal showed that, to the extent that he was able to do so, he was seeking treatment for his drug addiction. In addition, he was complying with prison discipline and seeking to enhance his educational qualifications.
	
	
	I have also set out the applicant’s past criminal record above. As the sentencing judge pointed out, it disentitles him to leniency.
	
	
	In the guideline judgment of Whyte, Spigelman CJ set out what he described as a typical case of an offence of dangerous driving causing death: at [204]. The applicant’s offence falls generally within such a case, he was a young man with limited prior convictions. A single person was killed, the victim was a stranger and the applicant showed genuine remorse. There was a plea of guilty which had, in the present case, more than limited utilitarian value.
	
	
	Spigelman CJ also set out what he described as aggravating features: at [215]-[217]. All of these, with the exception of escaping police pursuit, were present, although failing to stop should not be regarded as a separate aggravating factor having regard to the Form 1 offence. Although these factors should not be used as a checklist, they demonstrate in the present case why it is correct to say that the applicant bore a very high degree of moral culpability.
	
	
	In a case such as the present, consistency in sentencing is important. It is helpful to take into account sentences which have been imposed where there has been a high degree of moral culpability. I have referred above to Bombardieri, Wright and Smith (see [95]-[103] above). Although the facts and subjective circumstances in each of those cases were different to the present, they demonstrate the approach taken by courts to serious offences of this nature.
	


The offence of stealing a motor vehicle


	
	No separate submissions were made in respect of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge on this count. However, it was not contested that it was appropriate to grant a 25% discount on sentence for the utilitarian value of the plea.
	


Conclusion


	
	Taking the matters referred to above into account, I am of the view that a lesser sentence is warranted in law. In the circumstances, in my opinion, the appropriate sentence for the offence of stealing a motor vehicle is a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year and 9 months to date from 10 June 2013.
	
	
	So far as the offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death is concerned, in my opinion the applicant should be sentenced to a total term of 8 years and 3 months. As the offence the subject of that count was separate to the offence of stealing a motor vehicle, some degree of accumulation is necessary and the sentence should commence on 10 December 2013. Having regard to the need for extended supervision of the applicant on his release to parole because of his addiction difficulties, I find special circumstances and would fix a non-parole period of 5 years.
	
	
	Each of the sentences has been reached after allowing a 25% discount for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas.
	
	
	The sentencing judge also disqualified the applicant from driving for a period of 10 years expiring on 9 June 2023. The effect of this order was the applicant was disqualified effective from two years from the expiration of the non-parole period fixed by his Honour. That approach should be maintained. The appropriate order is to disqualify the applicant for a period of 2 years. By virtue of s 206A of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) that period will be extended by the period the applicant is incarcerated.
	
	
	In those circumstances, I would make the following orders:
	



	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal.
	
	
	Appeal allowed.
	
	
	Quash the sentence imposed on the applicant on 4 March 2015 and in lieu thereof impose the following sentence:
	



	
	For the offence of stealing a motor vehicle contrary to s 154F of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), a fixed term of imprisonment of 1 year and 9 months to date from 10 June 2013 and expire on 9 March 2015.
	
	
	For the offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death contrary to s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 10 December 2013 with a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months expiring on 9 March 2022. The earliest date the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 9 December 2018.
	



	
	Order that the appellant be disqualified from holding a driver's licence pursuant to s 205(2)(d)(ii) and s 206A(3) of the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW) for a period of 2 years.
	



	
	BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of the Chief Justice.  I agree with the Chief Justice’s reasons and with the orders his Honour proposes.
	
	
	R A HULME J: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment of Bathurst CJ. In relation to what I might term the ""Kentwell issue"" I express my own views in what follows. Otherwise, I agree with his Honour's reasons and the orders he proposes.
	
	
	It is common ground that there was error in the sentencing judge’s reduction of the sentence by 20 rather than 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian benefit flowing from the applicant’s plea of guilty entered in the Local Court. This is not, however, an error that only affected a discrete component of the sentence. It was necessary for the judge to determine the sentence for the individual offences before considering the question of concurrence or accumulation and the application of the principle of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [1998] HCA 57 at [45]. If there is error in the former it will, at least potentially, affect the exercise of the discretion as to the latter. Further, the judge found that there were special circumstances whereby he reduced the non-parole component of the primary sentence to 70 per cent of the total term and achieved an effective non-parole component that is 73 per cent of the total effective sentence. This was a discretionary exercise that was also informed by the assessment of the individual sentences.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the Crown has squarely raised the application of the principles in Kentwell v The Queen (2014) 252 CLR 601; [2014] HCA 37 and has contended that this Court should confine the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion to either (a) determining that no higher discount than 20 per cent was appropriate pursuant to s 22(1A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), or (b) reducing the sentence(s) by 25 per cent. (In its further written submissions the Crown suggested that the reduction only apply to the sentence for the offence of aggravated dangerous driving causing death but in accordance with principle it should apply to both sentences.)
	
	
	In Martin v R [2016] NSWCCA 104 I raised a question about whether taking the approach the Crown now advocates was appropriate. I made the observation that Kentwell v The Queen (and Baxter v R (2007) 173 A Crim R 284; [2007] NSWCCA 237) were cases in which the overall sentencing discretion was vitiated by error and queried whether what was said in the High Court should also apply when the error clearly only affected a discrete component of the sentence. I gave some examples of the approach taken by this Court, which has not been entirely consistent. They are discussed in the judgment of Bathurst CJ in this matter at [81]-[88].
	
	
	Contrary to the further written submissions for the applicant, I did not suggest in Martin v R that this Court should engage in an assessment of whether an error was material in the assessment of the overall sentence. Such an approach was clearly disapproved by the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen with the endorsement of the judgment of Spigelman CJ in Baxter v R in preference to those of Kirby and Latham JJ. I suggested (at [111]) that there was a “persuasive argument” that:
	


“Where there is error that does not entail vitiation of the entire sentencing discretion, but is an error that only affects a discrete component of the sentence that could have no potential bearing on the whole, the discretion should be re-exercised but only in relation to that particular component.” (Emphasis added)


	
	I reiterate what I said in Martin v R (at [96]) about the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen not expressly dealing with error in sentencing that only affects a discrete component and where there is no conceivable impact upon the overall sentence. I gave examples, such as an error in the commencement date of the sentence; the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period; or the extent of the discount for a plea of guilty or assistance to authorities. The present case is of the latter type but it does not fall within the type of case I was speaking about in Martin v R because, as I have indicated above, it is complicated by virtue of the fact that the primary judge was required to impose sentences for multiple offences and that brought into play other aspects of the sentencing discretion. I gave other examples in Martin v R (at [98]): an error in failing to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody by backdating the sentence; or post-dating a sentence to an extent that was beyond the statutory power to do so.
	
	
	Having said all of this, I have come to the conclusion that the applicant’s submissions as to the application of Kentwell v The Queen should be accepted. I maintain misgivings as to whether what was said by the plurality was contemplated and intended to apply to each and every error that may occur in the sentencing process (aside from a ""legal error"" that is clearly inconsequential such as the example given at [42]), no matter how minor and confined to an easily identifiable component of the sentence they may be. But on their face, the words used in [42] of the judgment are not in any sense vague or ambiguous. It is the role of this Court to faithfully apply them and not to qualify or quarantine their application; that is a matter for the High Court itself if a litigant seeks to persuade it to do so: Ravenor Overseas Inc v Readhead (1998) 72 ALJR 671; [1998] HCA 17 at [3].
	
	
	The applicant’s further written submissions suggest that some errors are amenable to adjustment “to correct the discrete error” which “is, in effect, done with the agreement of the parties, and by convention”. Experience suggests that this does, on occasions, occur. Further, there are cases in which counsel for appellants make concessions to the effect that the Court may confine the exercise of its sentencing discretion to the subject matter of the error: Carroll v R [2015] NSWCCA 219 (which is referred to by Bathurst CJ) is one example and Haines v R [2016] NSWCCA 90 would appear to be another.
	
	
	Simple and readily-correctable errors can easily occur in the now (regrettably) complex environment of sentencing law and practice. One would hope that such a practical and efficient approach will be adopted in the cases where there is error of the type I raised in Martin v R.
	
	
	SCHMIDT J: I also agree with the Chief Justice, for the reasons he discusses, that the appeal must be upheld. Given the failure to afford Mr Lehn procedural fairness and the miscarriage of the exercise of the sentencing discretion, under s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, this Court must exercise the sentencing discretion afresh to arrive at the sentence which is warranted in law. I also agree with the orders which his Honour proposes.
	
	
	I consider that Kentwell requires that in any appeal where it is established that the exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried, correction of the error found will require the discretion to be re-exercised by this Court, to determine whether some other sentence is warranted in law, rather than by way of correction of a “discrete error”. That includes error in relation to entry of a plea, given the requirements of ss 21A(3)(k) and 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the need to undertake the instinctive synthesis discussed in Markarian, in arriving at the sentence. The parties’ agreement to some different course cannot relieve the Court of the obligation to exercise the discretion afresh. It is only if the error does not affect the exercise of the sentencer’s discretion, that its “discrete” correction can be undertaken.
	
	
	WILSON J: The grounds of appeal advanced by the applicant complain of error in the application of a discount on sentence to reflect an early guilty plea, and manifest excess. The hearing of the appeal proceeded on the basis of a concession from the Crown that ground 1 was made out. The consequences of the conceded error have been the principal focus of the parties and of the Court.
	
	
	Ground 1 as pleaded is set out at [44] in the judgment of Bathurst CJ. The applicant contends that, his plea of guilty having been entered in the Local Court, he was entitled to a discount on the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed of 25%, rather than the 20% granted by his Honour Judge Conlon SC. Although the sentencing judge did not raise the question of the quantification of the discount with the parties prior to sentence, or warn the appellant that a discount of less than 25% was contemplated, the appellant’s complaint is not one of denial of procedural fairness.
	
	
	The Crown’s concession was on the basis that there had been procedural unfairness to the applicant. During the sentencing proceedings both parties had submitted to the sentencing judge that a discount of 25% on sentence was appropriate to reflect the early plea of guilty.
	
	
	In allowing a discount of 20% on sentence, the sentencing judge accepted that the applicant’s plea of guilty had been entered at the earliest opportunity. His Honour said,
	


In such circumstances a court may consider a discount of up to 25% to reflect the utilitarian benefit of the plea. However, care must be taken not to attribute a discount that would have the effect of reducing a sentence to a level below that which would be recognised to accurately reflect the court’s assessment of [the] objective gravity of the offending conduct. In the exercise of my discretion I intend to reflect the utilitarian benefit by a discount of about 20%.


	
	In declining to award a discount of 25%, his Honour was mindful of s 22(1A) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which provides:
	


 A lesser penalty imposed under this section must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.


	
	Clearly, his Honour concluded that, having regard to the objective gravity of the offence, which was very high, a discount of 25% on sentence would have had the effect of reducing the sentence to one which was unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.
	
	
	As the Chief Justice observed at [62] above, a discount on sentence of 25% to recognise the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity is not mandatory. The quantification of the discount within the range considered in R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309, is a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge (see Thomson at [152] - [153]; [160]).
	
	
	There is no principle or rule of law, and there should be no expectation, that a plea of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity will always result in a discount on sentence of 25%. The conclusions of this Court in Thomson at [157] – [158] and [160(iv)] should not be overlooked.
	
	
	In the circumstances of this case, where the objective gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the appellant were very high, it was in my view well open to the sentencing judge to conclude, as he did, that a discount of 25% would result in a sentence that would fail to properly reflect the gravity of the offence.
	
	
	The Crown’s concession as to error in the quantification of the discount must be taken to refer to the omission of the sentencing judge, hearing sentence proceedings in a busy suburban court dealing with a large list of matters, to warn the applicant that a lesser discount than 25% may be awarded.
	
	
	On that basis, there is error.
	
	
	An error of that nature is one contemplated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505 and this Court is bound by what was said in the High Court in Kentwell v The Queen  (2014) 252 CLR 601 at [42], to “exercise the discretion afresh taking into account the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the [Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)] and any other Act or rule of law, require or permit”. 
	
	
	I respectfully agree with the Chief Justice in that regard, and with the observations of R A Hulme J at [125].
	
	
	In that there is a need to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, ground 2 falls away.
	
	
	Bathurst CJ has set out all of the relevant objective circumstances of the offence, together with the features of the case personal to the applicant, and I gratefully refer to his Honour’s account of those matters.
	
	
	Each of the offences for which sentence must be imposed is serious. As the criminality encompassed by each is distinct, there must be some level of accumulation of the penalties imposed for each.
	
	
	The s 154F offence, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, reflects the applicant’s theft of a car from the residential property of its owner for no better reason than to drive it and thereafter destroy it by setting it alight. It is a grave example of such an offence.
	
	
	The s 52A(2) offence carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment, with an automatic disqualification from driving.
	
	
	Three other offences must be taken into account pursuant to s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act when sentence is imposed for it, including an offence of failing to stop and assist contrary to s 52AB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), an offence which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment when prosecuted on indictment. In accordance with the guideline judgment of Attorney General's Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, there should be some appreciation in that penalty, to reflect the need for personal deterrence, and the community’s entitlement to exact retribution relevant to the offences on the Form 1 document. It is wrong to suggest that the increment must be small; indeed, in the present case, it should in my view be substantial.
	
	
	The applicant, a man with neither the ability nor the authority to drive a manual car, drove it when very affected by the drug “ice”, having smoked the drug about half an hour prior to the fatal crash. He must have appreciated that he was intoxicated, having regard to both his own comments about the impact of the ice he had consumed had upon him, and by reference to the expert opinion as to the level of impairment to his driving ability. The appellant had a passenger in the car, and he drove in a highly reckless and dangerous way in residential streets to which a speed limit of 50km/hour applied. The appellant’s driving was so markedly dangerous that his passenger called out to warn him. Ignoring the warning, the appellant continued to drive, and collided at some speed with Harry McCarroll, killing Mr McCarroll. He then fled the scene, doing nothing to check Mr McCarroll’s condition, or to get aid for him (that conduct being charged as the s 52AB(1) offence).
	
	
	Such grave criminality demands the imposition of a stern sentence, to punish the applicant and make him accountable for his actions, to denounce the offence, to recognise the great harm done, to protect the community, and to deter the applicant and others from like conduct.
	
	
	The applicant’s criminal record shows a regular pattern of criminal conduct, and disentitles him to leniency.
	
	
	Although the applicant appears to be genuine in his remorse for his crimes, and he has some prospects for rehabilitation if he pursues drug rehabilitation, nothing in the applicant’s subjective case allows for any marked amelioration of penalty.
	
	
	The cases relied upon by the applicant to demonstrate that a lesser sentence than that imposed at first instance should be fixed are of some assistance but none are truly comparable, not least because of the three offences against the applicant to be taken into account on sentence for the s 52A offence, including an offence with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Additionally, none of the cases cited involved a driver significantly impaired, as was the applicant, by his use of a prohibited drug.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, I do not conclude that a sentence less severe than that imposed by Conlon SC DCJ is warranted in law: s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Accordingly, whilst I would grant leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.

		01 June 2017",2016-11-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2954084,R v Brewster [2016] NSWDC 310,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The offender is before the Court for sentence following his pleas of guilty on indictment to two offences in an indictment dated 1 December 2015. The first of those - count 1 - is an offence of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence knowing that there was a person inside the premises. The serious indictable offence is nominated as stalking with intent to cause physical or mental harm. That offence is contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and, where appropriate, a standard non-parole period of 5 years applies.
	
	
	He also pleaded guilty to count 2, being an offence that on 10 October 2014 he assaulted the named complainant and thereby caused her actual bodily harm. At the same time I will be sentencing him for a summary offence of destroying or damaging property brought up to the Court pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That is an offence which also occurred on 10 October 2014 and is contrary to s 195(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. It is a matter which would otherwise be dealt with in the Local Court with a jurisdictional limit of 2 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The relevant facts are that the offender was in a domestic relationship with the victim of these offences for about two years before they were committed. According to the facts it was an occasionally violent relationship. At the time the offender was using drugs, significantly the drug methamphetamine or crystal methamphetamine, known as ice. Eventually the victim decided to end the relationship because of his drug use and violence. That occurred on 8 October 2014.
	
	
	On 10 October 2014 she was at home alone. She lived in those premises with her mother, in a granny flat at the rear of the premises. Just before 8am she was woken by the offender banging on the door. She sent her mother a text telling her that the offender was there. He then started banging on the window and telling her that he knew she was there and swore at her. He threatened to kick the door in. He knocked on the wall next to the front door causing the wall to dent which caused the light and fan switch to be forced from the wall. The victim went to the front door and slid the curtains back and saw the offender outside. She asked him to go away. She was upset. He threatened to pull the door off unless she opened it. She held the glass door with one hand and begged for him to go away. She told him she had to go to work. The door was locked but she felt it loosen and she saw the offender with both arms on either side of the door lifting it up. She ran to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and was extremely fearful for her safety. The offender removed the door from its frame and it fell backwards onto a table.
	
	
	He entered the premises and the victim continued to ask him to leave. She was on the phone to her mother. She was upset. The offender was heard saying that he wanted to talk with her. She told him she did not want to talk and to go away. She also told him that her mother was going to call the police. The offender grabbed her hand and pushed her onto the ground in the kitchen. She felt pain to her legs and back. He then pushed her into the lounge room and she sustained a small cut to her knees. He picked her up again and put her on the lounge. He told her she brought this on herself and told her to call her mother back to cancel the call to police. He was pacing up and down and told the victim that he knew the police were coming. He picked up a candleholder and threatened her with it and threatened to hurt her. The victim asked for her phone and said she would call her mother and tell her to advise the police not to come. He then threw her phone at her and walked out of the premises. She called her mother again and said he is still here. The police were called.
	
	
	The offender came back, which caused great fear and upset to the victim. When he came back he said to the victim, “It didn’t have to be like this. You could have just spoken to me”. The police arrived but by that stage the offender had gone. The victim’s mother had to come home. The police did attend the premises. The offender was not there but they found him in a car park at a boat ramp in Kurnell, standing next to his truck. He said to police, when confronted, that the victim had recently broken up with him and that he did not know why, so he went there to get some answers.
	
	
	He was arrested and participated in an interview. He made admissions to police about opening the door whilst the victim was on the phone to her mother to contact police and made admissions to pushing her and admitted that she had told him to leave. He was charged with damaging the property and released.
	
	
	After a further statement was taken by the victim on 13 October, further charges, as I understand it before me, were added. He was granted bail. There was an interim AVO put in place after the initial event on 10 October. On 14 October he attempted to contact or approach the victim and was arrested for breaching the AVO but released on bail. He remained on bail for a period of time.
	
	
	The relationship between the victim and the offender resumed in November 2014 but ended again in May 2015, again because of his continuing use of drugs. On 22 July 2015 he was arrested in relation to a series of other offences and has remained in custody ever since. That was bail refused in relation to these offences but also in relation to the subsequent offences and also having been called up on the breach of six section 12 bonds.
	
	
	His offending for the matters before me is aggravated by the fact that at the time he was subject to conditional liberty, namely six section 12 suspended sentences which were all for eight months. He was resentenced to serve those by way of fulltime imprisonment with sentences commencing on 22 July 2015. For the other offences for which he was arrested in July 2015, he was ultimately sentenced in the Local Court on 22 October 2015 to a series of aggregate sentences with overall a 22 month term of imprisonment with a 12 month non-parole period, all of which commenced on 22 November 2015. His first entitlement to release to parole thus is 22 November 2016.
	
	
	As a result of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence, the victim sustained bruising to her right arm and a cut on her right knee and a small graze to her right ankle. The damage to the property the subject of the section 166 charge includes the damage to the sliding door, to the wall and the light and fan switch which were knocked off the wall when he hit it.
	
	
	In terms of assessing the objective seriousness, count 1 is at about the middle of the range for offences capable of being dealt with as aggravated break, enter offences. The circumstance of aggravation, namely knowing that someone was present is a relatively serious circumstance of aggravation. The offence committed inside, that is stalking with intent to cause physical or mental harm, being a domestic offence, is serious. The fact that this was committed in the context of a domestic relationship aggravates the commission of the offence. As I have said it is aggravated by the fact that he was on a form of conditional liberty at the time. The degree of damage to property is not significant.
	
	
	The offence was also accompanied by threats to cause harm. Whilst there is no evidence before me by way of a victim impact statement, I accept from the facts that the victim was frightened and felt real terror by the actions of the offender. His explanation for committing the offence indicates that he thought he had some degree of entitlement to behave violently towards the victim. She, in her own home, was entitled to feel safe and entitled to feel that she had autonomy to end a relationship if it was no longer working.
	
	
	Regrettably this is yet another example of domestic violence offences that come before the Courts. They are all serious offences. Fortunately this offence did not end in the tragic way that so many do. Domestic violence is all too prevalent in the community. Two or three women a week die as victims of domestic violence in Australia and many more are injured. Even more suffer ongoing psychological symptoms as a result of being terrorised by their partners or former partners. Sentences for offences involving domestic violence must carry a serious message of general deterrence. The community must realise that domestic violence is entirely unacceptable and those who would engage in it can expect to receive lengthy prison terms.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty to this offence. It was not at the first available opportunity, but it seems to me there is a utilitarian value reflected in the plea. It is relatively high, given that the victim was not required to give evidence. Further the plea was entered well before the trial date set. So even though the plea was entered on indictment after committal for trial, nonetheless there is a significant utilitarian value and it seems to me that a discount of about 20% is appropriate.
	
	
	I do accept from the pre-sentence report that the offender has expressed contrition and remorse, which on the face of it is genuine. There seems to be a degree of insight now shown for the way in which he behaved. He has as criminal history, regrettably on an occasion in the past for an earlier incident of domestic violence against another victim. The majority of the matters on his record however are not offences of violence but either offences involving driving or connected with drugs.
	
	
	He had a significant drug addiction at the time he committed this offence which cannot amount to a circumstance of mitigation, but provides some explanation. He was using the drug ice extensively and probably was addicted to it. He had not undertaken realistically any form of rehabilitation at that stage. He is now 31 and was 29 at the time he committed these offences.
	
	
	His offending behaviour, on my assessment, is in large part connected to his use of this particular drug, although I accept the opinion of the pre-sentence report author that he suffers from at least potentially a range of mental health issues that might dispose him towards such behaviour. However in large part it seems to me that his use of drugs is the major explanation for the way in which he has behaved on this occasion and on those other occasions that are on his record where he has acted violently.
	
	
	He migrated to Australia with his mother as an infant. He has a very good relationship with his mother who raised him as a single parent. She remains available to provide support to him, although there have been some difficulties in the past, which more probably than not were connected with his use of drugs. He has had some partners in the past. He was educated to Year 10 level and then established his own business as a concreter. That apparently was going relatively well except that he was using drugs which meant that he was not as successful as he might have been. He sold the business when he went to gaol but I accept that he is a person who used to work and he will seek work as a paid employee on his release. He has a number of debts including business related debts that he will need to resolve on his release. There will be a number of factors that require resolution on his ultimate release from custody, including his work situation, ongoing debts and the need to deal with what had been a longstanding addiction to drugs.
	
	
	There are two entries on his custodial record which indicate that he continued to use drugs at least for a period whilst in custody and that he has also been in trouble on one occasion in recent times in the gaol system for disciplinary matters.
	
	
	I accept that he has, as I have said, expressed genuine remorse to the extent that he has told the author of the pre-sentence report that he is not proud of what he has done and he understood that what he did was wrong. He has also told the author that he in particular regrets the impact that his actions had on the victim. This degree of insight provides some positives in terms of an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	His rehabilitation, however, must be regarded as somewhat guarded but will be assisted by access to courses whilst he remains in gaol and also by a somewhat longer than normal period of supervision in the community so that he can deal with issues of drug abuse, mental health and the proper way to deal with domestic relationships and issues that arise within those relationships.
	
	
	I accept that when he is released from custody he apparently has accommodation available to him with his mother who, as I have said, will also provide ongoing support for him.
	
	
	In the circumstances I have concluded that without taking into account the plea of guilty an overall term of imprisonment of four years would be appropriate for the most serious of the offences. I will be reducing that by nine months to take into account the discount for the plea of guilty which will give rise to an overall term of imprisonment of three years and three months.
	
	
	There are some special circumstances, namely the need for a somewhat longer than normal period of supervision in the community to deal with drug addiction and relapse strategies, mental health issues and domestic violence issues. However nothing short of a non-parole period of two years and three months could deal with the criminality involved in my view.
	
	
	The assault is a serious offence, given that it is committed in a domestic circumstance. The actual bodily harm is of relatively minor nature. If that were the only offence before the Court it may be that something other than fulltime custody could be applied, but that is not so and a term of fulltime imprisonment is necessary. I will be sentencing him to a fixed term of nine months.
	
	
	For the section 166 matter, the damage property, I will be sentencing a six month fixed term. Each of those sentences should be concurrent with each other. In my view they are all part of the one episode of criminality and each of them to an extent inextricably connected to each other.
	
	
	The remaining issue is the commencement date of this sentence. The total criminality involved in these offences and all of those other matters for which he has been in custody and serving sentences since 22 July, it seems to me require some partial accumulation, but of modest terms. In those circumstances I will be commencing this sentence on 22 September 2016 which is a partial accumulation of two months.
	
	
	For those reasons then, there is nothing else that anyone thinks I have overlooked that I should deal with is there at this stage? I will deal with the AVO in a moment.
	
	
	For those reasons then I make the following formal orders. On counts 1 and 2 in the indictment the offender is convicted. For count 1 he is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and three months commencing on 22 September 2016 expiring on 21 December 2018, with parole thereafter of 12 months commencing 22 December 2018 expiring 21 December 2019, giving rise to an overall term of imprisonment of three years and three months commencing 22 September 2016 expiring 21 December 2019.
	
	
	For count 2 he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months commencing 22 September 2016 expiring 21 June 2017. I decline to fix a non-parole period because it is served as part of an overall non-parole period.
	
	
	For the 166 offence he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing 22 September 2016 expiring 21 March 2017.
	
	
	I note the appeal offences. The appeals being withdrawn are dismissed. I confirm the convictions and the aggregate sentences imposed by the Magistrate.
	
	
	Further, pursuant to the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, I make an order that the sentences be recorded on the offender’s record as domestic violence offences.
	
	
	Now I just need to make an ADVO don’t I? If I can I’d like to make an AVO order that at least extends for the time he’s on parole. I mean not that this is the be all and end all, because the complainant can always approach the Court to have it varied, the Local Court.
	
	
	Pursuant to the Crimes Domestic and Personal Violence Act vary the existing ADVO by extending it for three years from 22 July 2017 to 21 July 2020. Now you won’t disagree with that Mr Thomas? A further condition of the ADVO will be a condition that the offender not himself or through any other person attempt to contact the victim or anyone with whom she is in a domestic relationship. This won’t be a problem when he comes out because presumably he won’t want to have anything to do with her anyway and at some stage, if that’s no longer necessary, then the Courts can be approached to revoke it or vary it or do whatever. Alright, so does everybody understand that situation then?

		18 November 2016",2016-04-13 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2954480,R v Ethan Lindsay Beckett [2015] NSWDC 416,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The offender, Ethan Beckett, is before the Court for sentence on five charges set out in the court attendance notices tendered.
	
	
	The first is a charge that on 28 October 2013 at Orange, he robbed the named victim of a motor vehicle whilst being armed with a 30 centimetre kitchen knife.
	
	
	The second is a charge that on 29 October 2013 at Wagga, he robbed a named victim of a motor vehicle whilst being armed with a 30 centimetre kitchen knife.
	
	
	Both of these offences are known as armed robbery and they are brought pursuant to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of them carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	The third charge is a charge known as police pursuit, an offence contrary to s 51B(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 committed at Henty on 29 October 2013. That offence carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and would be capable of being dealt with in the Local Court where the maximum penalty would be two years imprisonment.
	
	
	The fourth charge is that on 29 October 2013 at Lavington he wounded the named victim with intent to prevent lawful arrest. That is an offence contrary to s 33(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and has a standard non-parole period of seven years.
	
	
	When sentencing him for that offence, the offender asks that I take into account three offences on a Form 1 document signed by him and tendered on sentence. Those three offences are one of common assault occurring at Orange on 28 October 2013, one of larceny of a computer also occurring on that date in Orange, and a further offence of larceny also occurring at Orange on 28 October 2013.
	
	
	The fifth charge is one that on 29 October 2013 at Lavington he threatened to injure the named victim with the intention of preventing his lawful apprehension. That offence is contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 12 years imprisonment. That is also an offence capable of being dealt with in the Local Court where the maximum penalty would be two years imprisonment.
	
	
	There are agreed facts before the Court. The background to this slew of criminal offending is that the offender had been released to parole on 30 September 2013 after serving a term of imprisonment for a number of offences including a carjacking offence. He had been in prison for these offences from 1 July 2012 and was meant to be in the community on parole for 21 months from 30 September 2013.
	
	
	The offender is, as will become clear later in these reasons, a person of low intellectual capacity, diagnosed by a psychologist as suffering mild intellectual disability with an IQ score of 60 and with the cognitive reasoning function of a child between seven and eight.
	
	
	The Public Guardian had been appointed to manage his affairs on 9 October 2012, I infer because of his low intellectual capacity.
	
	
	After his release to parole, accommodation was arranged for him by the Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care in supported accommodation in Orange. He was living there on 28 October 2013 with other residents having similar difficulties.
	
	
	The offender’s stepfather gave evidence on sentence. I found his evidence to be very useful in understanding the offender’s background. He was living with the offender’s mother in country Victoria when the offender was released to parole. He had had a good relationship with the offender, having met him when the offender was about nine and he had tried to help him in the past. The offender looked up to him and regarded him as his father.
	
	
	The stepfather and the offender’s mother were not able to see the offender in Orange between when he was released to parole and when he committed these offences. There had been some attempts to arrange a halfway meeting with the assistance of authorities but that never happened. All parties, I accept, were quite disappointed about that. He did, however, speak to the offender on the phone and became aware that the offender was in contact on the phone with his sister and her boyfriend and that the offender had formed a view that he should go to see them in Shepparton. That of course, he realised, would have been in breach of his parole.
	
	
	The offender told his stepfather that his sister’s boyfriend told him to steal a car and this person in Shepparton promised him money and a girlfriend if he came down. His stepfather advised him not to do it, that is, not to risk breaching his parole, but the offender, I accept, was under pressure from his sister and her boyfriend to come to see them and, I accept, was inclined to breach his parole, not acting sensibly in part because of his low intellectual ability.
	
	
	With this background then on 28 October 2013, I accept that the offender had been drinking heavily and was intoxicated. He got into a verbal and physical altercation with another resident of the supported accommodation. The other resident provoked by offender by swearing at him and using a racist slur. The offender went into his room and hit this resident a couple of times with a closed fist. This is the assault which is the first of the form 1 offences.
	
	
	Support workers at the boarding house intervened and called the police to report it. The offender went to collect his belongings to leave and packed a staff member’s laptop while doing so. That is the second form 1 offence of larceny.
	
	
	He rode his pushbike down to Woolworths and stole a 30 centimetre curved kitchen knife there which was worth $15. That is the third form 1 offence also of larceny.
	
	
	At about 10 o’clock at night the victim of the first offence, the first armed robbery offence, drove into the Woolworths car park at Orange to do some grocery shopping. She locked her car and turned around and saw the offender about one and a half metres away from her. He pulled out the knife he had just stolen and held it at stomach height and said, “Give me your car, give me your keys, give me your car, give me your keys.” He walked towards her until he was about a half a metre away and she handed him the keys. He got straight into the car and drove off. He drove towards Wagga but crashed the car at West Wyalong. He left it there and got a lift into Wagga.
	
	
	The next day at about 11am the victim of the second armed robbery went to the Sturt Mall in Wagga to do some shopping with her three year old daughter. She parked her car in the street, did some shopping and came out at about 11.30 with groceries in a trolley. She opened the rear tailgate door to the boot of her car and put her young child into the back who then started to help her to store the groceries. She put her handbag in the back of the station wagon and left her daughter in the car while she took the trolley back. When she returned she opened the back door and reached in to put her daughter into the child seat. The offender came up behind her and said, “Take the kid out of the car.” She turned around and saw that he had a knife at his hip and was holding out his other hand for the keys. She gave him the keys and took her daughter out of the car. The offender drove off with the car, including taking her shopping and her handbag. The victim noticed that the offender spoke to her in a direct but soft voice and seemed really desperate.
	
	
	The offender then drove down the Olympic Highway towards Albury. I accept more probably than not that he was intending to drive to Shepparton.
	
	
	Police had been notified about the offence and were keeping a lookout for him. They located the car travelling at speed between Henty and Culcairn. They signalled for him to stop but he sped up to speeds of about 190 kilometres an hour. Police initiated a pursuit but stopped it at one stage because it became dangerous.
	
	
	They located the car again just north of Culcairn and started the police pursuit again. The offender travelled through Culcairn at speeds of 170 kilometres an hour in a 50 zone.
	
	
	Police then next saw the car in Gerogery and reactivated the pursuit when the offender drove onto the Hume Highway. They set up road spikes on the Hume Highway. The offender was travelling at about 150 kilometres an hour.
	
	
	At the interchange of the Olympic Highway and the Hume Highway, he crossed onto the northbound lane for a short distance, then back again into the southbound lane, but fortunately there was only light traffic in the area at that time.
	
	
	When the offender approached the road spikes, he crossed onto the northbound lane to avoid them. He left the Hume Highway at Racecourse Road and abandoned the car at Boomerang Drive in Lavington.
	
	
	The police officer victim of the fourth and fifth charges was a senior constable with the New South Wales Highway Patrol at the time. He located the offender in a street in Lavington. He told him to stop and the offender swore at him and jumped over a fence. He hid behind a shed in the backyard of the house.
	
	
	The officer jumped over the fence to follow him and as he landed on the ground the offender came out from behind the shed armed with the kitchen knife he had stolen in Orange. He swung it at the officer a number of times in an aggressive motion. He said, “I am going to fucking kill you.” The officer tried to step back to avoid the knife but it connected with the outside of his upper arm and wounded him.
	
	
	The wound was later treated at Albury Hospital and was found to be a 2 centimetre laceration to his left upper arm which was 5 centimetres deep, penetrating into the deep dermis. It ultimately required two stitches and antibiotic treatment. These are the facts for the fourth offence of wounding the officer with intent to prevent lawful arrest.
	
	
	After this happened, the officer drew his service firearm and pointed it at the offender and told him to get on the ground. When that occurred, the offender held the knife to his own throat and walked backwards and jumped over another fence. The officer started to climb the fence to follow him and the offender swung the knife towards his torso and arms in a ripping motion. The officer pushed himself back off the fence and narrowly avoided being struck by the knife a second time.
	
	
	The offender then jumped another fence to get away from the officer who also jumped over a fence and followed him. He located the offender behind a garage and the offender then came out from there and pointed the knife at him. Again the officer drew his firearm and pointed it at the offender and again the offender put the knife to his own throat and took a couple of steps back to the garage.
	
	
	The officer removed his capsicum spray and told the offender to put down the knife. The offender went into the garage and closed the roller door. The officer re‑holstered his firearm and opened the roller door. The offender ran out of the garage and down the driveway.
	
	
	The officer followed him through a number of yards before stopping near a boundary offence. The offender swung the knife in a figure of eight motion towards the officer who drew his firearm again and told the offender to drop the knife, which the offender refused to do. The officer sprayed capsicum spray at him again which connected with his left cheek and eye and caused him to drop his head down to protect himself. The offender covered his eyes and nose with a T-shirt and continued to swing the knife.
	
	
	The offender was sprayed again and it started to burn his eyes. He asked for some water. The officer said that he would help him but he had to throw the knife away. The offender refused and continued to swing the knife in front of him whilst continuing to wipe his eyes and walk towards the officer. He was only taking small steps because of the effect of the capsicum spray on him and the officer sprayed him again and told him to drop the knife. The offender then threw the knife into a garden bed and the officer took him to the ground.
	
	
	The officer asked the offender, “Why are you doing this?” to which he replied, “Because I breached my parole.”
	
	
	There was a short struggle but the offender handcuffed the offender with some assistance from a bystander. Police and ambulance arrived. As I said, the officer was taken to Albury Hospital for treatment to his left arm wound and the offender was treated for capsicum spray exposure and taken to Albury Police Station. He participated there in an electronically recorded interview during which he admitted to having committed the offences and was charged.
	
	
	He has been in custody ever since. This custody has been for two reasons. First, he was refused bail in relation to these charges. Also his parole was revoked by the Parole Board on 31 October 2013 and he was ordered to serve the balance of his parole which is due to expire on 1 July 2015.
	
	
	Clearly enough, having recited those facts, which are agreed between the parties, these are all very serious offences. The first two offences are armed robbery offences which almost, by definition, are very serious offences, particularly as they attract a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.
	
	
	In each case the offender was armed with a knife. There is no evidence, however, that he acted aggressively towards either of the two women, in fact for the second offence, the victim thought that he seemed desperate. There was no actual violence, nor threats of violence employed by him.
	
	
	The second robbery which occurred in Wagga is aggravated to an extent because the victim’s child was present and that must have increased her sense of fear. However, there is no evidence nor suggestion that the offender directed any aggression nor comments at all towards this child.
	
	
	There was no real planning for either of these two offences except to the extent that the offender had stolen a knife and taken it with him, but the evidence suggests, in my view, that the choice of victim for each of these two offences was spontaneous.
	
	
	There is no victim impact statement from either of these two women but I accept that each of them must have been very frightened and shocked by being confronted in this way by the offender. It would not be surprising if they still have some psychological consequences and particularly so for the victim whose child was present when the offence occurred.
	
	
	Both of these offences are also aggravated by the fact that the offender was on parole at the time and in fact had only been released to parole about a month before the offences occurred.
	
	
	The guideline judgment in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal of Henry & Ors suggests as a guideline, an overall sentence for armed robbery offences with certain characteristics, of between four and five years. Some of those characteristics are present in this case, namely he was a young offender, he was armed with a knife, there was limited or no planning and there was no actual violence.
	
	
	There are also some dissimilarities, some of which assist the offender and some of which do not. One which assists him is that he entered an early plea of guilty, a dissimilarity with the Henry guideline judgment. Another dissimilarity which does not assist him is that although he was a young offender, he has a very lengthy criminal history.
	
	
	It is a guideline, however, which I will take into account and bear in mind when assessing the appropriate sentences for each of these offences. They seem to me to be offences in terms of objective seriousness which are around the middle or a little lower for offences capable of being charged as armed robberies.
	
	
	As for the police pursuit, it was a very dangerous course of driving that the offender embarked on, both for himself, the police and potentially other road users. The police had to stop the pursuit at least twice because the conditions became dangerous. If he had been thinking straight or had been capable of thinking straight, he would have known and must have recognised that he was going to be caught and he should have just stopped.
	
	
	It is a serious example of a police pursuit given the distance travelled, the length of time, the speeds that he reached. It is an inherent part of such an offence that it indicates a disregard for public safety.
	
	
	I do not accept, however, that the evidence allows for a finding that the offending involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons. The police appropriately called the pursuit off when it became too dangerous, and even though the offender crossed onto the wrong side of the road, according to the evidence, twice, the only evidence there is about the conditions at the time was that the traffic was light.
	
	
	The potential for harm, however, including the police and other road users was very high and that is one of the reasons why this is a very serious example of a police pursuit. The circumstances of this offence mean that only full‑time imprisonment is appropriate and that a significant sentence should apply.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the remaining two offences involving the police officer is also high. The offender used a knife to cause the wounding and to threaten injury. That aggravates the offence. Fortunately, the wound in this case was relatively minor, as I have said, involving the 2 centimetre laceration to the outside of the officer’s upper left forearm which required two stitches and a course of antibiotics. There is no evidence about any ongoing physical consequences of this wound and I accept it is likely that it has healed.
	
	
	The offences were not planned or premeditated by the offender. He was on the run, fearful of the consequences of breaching his parole following the altercation at the boarding house in Orange, making matters infinitely worse by committing the two armed robberies and trying to get to Shepparton and doing all of this in a way which did not suggest any form of planning or real thought at all and which was in reality very much consistent with his limited cognitive abilities and lack of ability to make proper reasoned judgments.
	
	
	Again I do not accept that there is evidence for either of these two offences from which I could make a finding that in fact there was grave risk of death to any person. The very restrained actions of the officer in drawing but not in fact discharging his firearm on three occasions would tend to suggest that whilst he was in fear at the time, he did not himself fear that he was at grave risk of death. Clearly enough, by brandishing and waving a knife around in the direction of the officer, and on occasions when the officer had to jump out of the way to avoid being cut again means that the situation was dangerous and there was a significant risk of further harm to him. There is nothing in the evidence, however, which would enable a finding that there was a grave risk of death to him or any other person.
	
	
	One aspect I must consider in relation to these two offences is the impact of the offences on the victim. I have received and considered a victim impact statement from this victim as provided for in s 28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That statement was compiled by the victim himself and unfortunately there was much in that statement that falls outside the definition of a victim impact statement, namely a statement that contains particulars of the harm suffered by the victim as a result of the offences. Some of that material was edited from the original document by agreement between the Crown and counsel for the offender. The solicitor for the Crown further, on the hearing of the sentence, agreed that other parts could not be relied on.
	
	
	Unfortunately, the document that was tendered was the original with the edited parts still present but highlighted in a way that could still be seen and read. This, in my view, is not an appropriate way in which to tender an admissible victim impact statement to a court, and both parties in this sentence should have ensured that an admissible document was tendered.
	
	
	Further, there is no evidence, apart from what is in the victim impact statement, to establish the actual circumstances of this victim. I accept that he has suffered as a result of these offences. Physical injuries as previously found were relatively minor and there is no evidence tendered in relation to that wound. It is not the type of injury which is likely to have had ongoing physical consequences.
	
	
	There is, from these offences and the circumstances in which they were committed, likely to have been a considerable emotional and psychological impact on the officer, particularly, it seems to me, once he started to think back about what happened and to ruminate over the potential consequences, not only to him physically but also if in fact he had discharged his firearm. It would be likely that he would continue to suffer psychological consequences as a result of these offences and that they would be ongoing, and I consider that to be a likely event. There is, however, no evidence in fact to establish the extent of any such psychological condition.
	
	
	I do accept from the victim impact statement that there has been an impact on his life in other ways, including that he has been restricted to light duties in the police service since these offences, and that this had a knock‑on effect of preventing him continuing his work as a fire fighter which he had previously done for 20 years.
	
	
	These changes to his work conditions have also had a negative impact on his financial position, which in turn negatively impacts on his sense of wellbeing and self-esteem. It is clear from the victim impact statement that the victim is very angry about the impact that these offences have had on him, not just with the offender, but also with the authorities.
	
	
	The impact on this officer of these offences are indeed considerable, but there is no evidence from which I could make a finding the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offences was substantial. It is to be hoped that the conclusion of these sentence proceedings will see the beginning of a full healing process for the victim. He may well be dissatisfied with the sentence outcome. That is often the situation seen in these courts. But of course, the situation of the victim in any sentencing process is only one factor to be taken into account and where there is no actual evidence presented in relation to the impact on this victim of these offences, the extent to which that situation can be examined is limited.
	
	
	As I said, for all of these offences they are aggravated by the fact the offender was on parole at the time.
	
	
	I now turn to assess the situation of the offender himself which of course is also an essential matter to be taken into account when setting any sentence.
	
	
	He is now 21, thus still a young man. He has a very lengthy criminal history for one so young. He comes from an extremely dysfunctional and deprived background. There has been a very large body of medical and psychological reports tendered on his behalf going back as far as 1998.
	
	
	They all make it clear that he was raised as a young child in a household exposed to violence and drug abuse by his father. His father is a serious criminal now serving a 35 year non-parole period in Victoria for the rape and murder of two New South Wales schoolgirls. Those offences occurred when the offender was four. He is not here, however, to be sentenced for the sins of his father, but the sins of the father have, to an extent, shaped who he has become. For many years after this notorious offence, the offender and other members of his family were bullied and discriminated against in the various communities to which they moved because of his father’s notoriety.
	
	
	His mother formed a relationship with another person who became his first stepfather. This person was violent towards his mother and also was convicted of manslaughter involving the shaking death of his own child. This offender was living in that environment when he was eight. More probably than not, this person also assaulted the offender and his sister.
	
	
	The bullying by community members meant that the offender’s mother moved the family frequently. They lived in many regional towns including Goulburn, Yass, Leeton, Whitton, Coleambally, Colac, Singleton, Forbes, Parkes and Orange.
	
	
	He attended many schools, which of course is very disruptive to any child, even if of robust nature and sound intellectual ability. Unfortunately, this offender is neither of those two.
	
	
	He was diagnosed with ADHD from the age of about three and treated with various forms of medication at least from the age of about four and a half. The frequent moves meant that his presentation for treatment was often sporadic and not always consistent. He was diagnosed with a learning disability and placed in a special education system.
	
	
	His mother formed a new relationship with his now stepfather, who gave evidence as I said. That relationship started in 2002 when the offender was nine. That is a positive relationship, and as I have said, I found this man’s evidence helpful and realistic.
	
	
	The offender has had a positive relationship with this man, but by the time he came into the offender’s life it was probably too late to undo some of the damage which had already been done by the disruption and dysfunction that had already occurred.
	
	
	He has a diagnosed intellectual disability and mental disorder. As I said previously, he was diagnosed with ADHD as a very young boy and he has been medicated for it and continues to be medicated for it.
	
	
	He was assessed by forensic psychologist Dr Susan Hayes at Long Bay on 29 March 2013 in relation to the earlier sentence. She found that his cognitive functioning was at a level lower than 99.6% of his peers with an IQ score of 60. Whilst he was able to move around the community fairly independently, it is the case that his affairs were being managed by the Public Guardian at the time he committed these offences, and I accept her opinion that he had serious deficits in all of the activities of daily living.
	
	
	Whilst she diagnosed this as a mild intellectual impairment, that does not denote that his intellectual deficits are minor. That is a method of classifying intellectual impairments and must be read together with the further explanations in Dr Hayes’ report, specifically that he functions at a cognitive reasoning age of between seven years nine months and eight years three months.
	
	
	There is also evidence from Dr Ruth Allen, forensic psychologist at Long Bay, from an assessment she undertook on 6 January this year, who offers the unchallenged opinion that his abusive and chaotic family background meant that he did not receive the guidance, consistency and protection that he required growing up. This I accept has meant that he has a tendency to assume hostile intent in others and together with the ADHD means that he will be inclined to respond impulsively to threats or emotional harm directed at him by others.
	
	
	Also Dr Furst, forensic psychiatrist, assessed him at Long Bay on 2 April this year. He discovered him to have limited insight presenting as immature and impulsive. Dr Furst’s opinion is that he suffers from a number of defined psychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression, ADHD, and together with his diagnosed intellectual disability, in Dr Furst’s view, gives rise to psychiatric problems that relate to his intellectual disability, and associated impulsivity gives rise to poor emotional control and poor decision making.
	
	
	I accept Dr Furst’s opinion that these factors probably contributed to the poor decision making evidenced by his commission of these offences in October 2013. In fact, the offender’s stepfather in his evidence summed it up that in his opinion the offender was a boy in a man’s body.
	
	
	Whilst of course it may be of small comfort to the victims, nevertheless it is the case that this man’s mental condition was in part responsible for the fact that he committed these offences and in those circumstances considerations of general deterrence play a lesser role than if he were not a person suffering from a mental condition. It is not completely removed and the sentences should, to some extent, convey a message to the community that serious offences such as these, particularly offences committed against law enforcement officers, will always attract full-time imprisonment for relatively lengthy periods.
	
	
	There are other considerations that I must take into account, however, when setting the appropriate sentences, including the need to protect the community from this offender, and also for the sentence to give some consideration to issues of specific deterrence.
	
	
	He is, as I have said, still very young, and for young offenders, considerations of rehabilitation would normally be given considerable weight and possibly greater weight than some other considerations. However, he comes to court with a very lengthy criminal record for a person so young.
	
	
	It is tendered to court. He has a criminal history both here and in Victoria. His New South Wales history commenced in the Children’s Court in 2007. The details of it are before the Court as tendered. He has numerous convictions for offences, including offences of violence and other offences.
	
	
	In terms of assessing his prospects of rehabilitation, it is of concern that the offence for which he was on parole at the time he committed these offences is very similar, a carjacking offence. He had only been released on 30 September and these offences occurred a month later. His prospects of rehabilitation are at best guarded in the circumstances. He has, however, I accept, expressed contrition and remorse to Dr Allen and Dr Furst, and in particular I accept he has shown insight into the plight of the victims of his offences, especially the woman whose child was in the car that he stole.
	
	
	He has undertaken some courses in custody and there are certificates tendered indicating that he had completed those. He is proud that he finished those and it is some proof of attempts that he has made towards his own rehabilitation. That is unfortunately tempered by the fact that he has also committed some institutional offences whilst in custody. He has been housed in five different parts of the New South Wales prison system since his arrest in October 2013.
	
	
	Whatever are his real prospects of rehabilitation, he will need considerable supervision when he is released to the community on parole. There is a proposal tendered on his behalf that he attend a residential rehabilitation centre in Hawkesbury. There is a report from that institution which appears an appropriate place for him to go and such a residential placement would seem desirable. Whether or not it remains available at a time when he is due to be released on parole time will tell. It only commenced in November last year. He will need that sort of supervision, however, and supervision for relatively lengthy period of time to prevent the prospect of further offending.
	
	
	I then turn to consider what is the appropriate sentence for each of these offences. Each one of them should have a separate sentence attached. The decision of the High Court in Pearce’s case makes that so.
	
	
	I will deal first of all with the police pursuit offence because it has the lowest maximum penalty. It is a serious example of this offence, but for this, as for all of the other offences, his mental condition must be considered both including the impact it played on his commission of the offence, but also because it reduces the extent to which general deterrence plays a part in the sentence.
	
	
	Taking into account the early plea of guilty and the discount available, I will be imposing a prison term of 12 months for that offence.
	
	
	On the findings that I have made in relation to the two armed robbery offences including their similarities and dissimilarities with the Henry guideline judgments, but taking into account the offender’s mental condition and the fact of an early plea of guilty, each, it seems to me, should have an overall term of imprisonment of two and a half years. I will, if necessary, deal with the issue of a non-parole period in due course.
	
	
	For the wound with intent to avoid arrest, this is the most serious offence and there are also three additional offences that I must take into account as form 1 offences.
	
	
	The two larceny offences are of relatively minor severity and would not, in my view, increase the overall criminality of the substantive offence.
	
	
	The assault offence is a matter which normally should be given some weight or treated in a realistic way as an additional offence. But in circumstances in which it occurred in which there was some provocation and also where I am not informed of any further detail about anything that might have been suffered by the victim, in my view that should not increase the overall sentence for the substantive offence either.
	
	
	The substantive offence is itself a very serious offence and I must bear in mind that there is a standard non-parole period of seven years for offences committed under this section, sentenced under this section. Because there is a plea of guilty, that would not strictly apply. Further, the offence itself, for the reasons I have already stated, is in the bottom range of offences capable of being charged under this section. Nevertheless, the standard non-parole period is a factor I bear in mind.
	
	
	It seems to me in those circumstances and bearing in mind the offender’s mental condition and the other factors to which I have already alluded, and taking into account the early plea of guilty, the appropriate sentence for that offence is an overall penalty of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	There are special circumstances. There will be some partial accumulation. His mental condition is a factor and there is a need for a longer than normal period of supervision in the community. I will be setting a non‑parole period for that offence of three years.
	
	
	The remaining offence is, as I said, capable of being dealt with in the Local Court. It is a serious offence. Taking into account the circumstances of the offending and the condition of the offender, however, it seems to me, after taking into account the early plea of guilty, a term of imprisonment of two years and three months is called for.
	
	
	The issue then arises about the accumulation and concurrency of each of these five sentences. If each of these sentences were entirely accumulated, it would give rise to an overall sentence of 24 years. That is significantly excessive in the circumstances of the offender and the offending, in my view, particularly given his youth, his background and the need to ensure that there is an attainment or goal for him, also bearing in mind his intellectual disability.
	
	
	I have concluded that there should be an overall term of imprisonment of eight years with an overall non-period of five years. I will be giving effect to that by imposing fixed terms for all but the wound with intent offence.
	
	
	The issue then arises of when this group of sentences should commence. His balance of parole ends on 1 July 2015. He has effectively either served or been ordered to serve all but one month of the earlier sentence, most of it after revocation of parole and most of it serving balance of parole. The fact that his parole was revoked is because he committed these offences. In those circumstances there should be some partial accumulation of that balance of parole with these sentences. I propose to backdate these sentences nine months from today to take that into account. These sentences will commence on 18 September 2014.
	
	
	My formal orders then are that for each of the offences the offender is convicted.
	
	
	For each of the offences the offender is convicted. For sequence 7, the police pursuit offence, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months commencing 18 September 2014 and expiring 17 September 2015.
	
	
	For sequence 6, threaten injury to prevent lawful apprehension, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and three months commencing 18 March 2015 and expiring 17 June 2017.
	
	
	For the first armed robbery offence, sequence 4, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and six months commencing 18 September 2015, expiring 17 March 2018.
	
	
	For the second armed robbery offence, sequence 5, he is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years and six months commencing 18 March 2016, expiring 17 September 2018.
	
	
	For the remaining offence, sequence 11, wound with intent to prevent arrest, he is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years commencing 18 September 2017, expiring 17 September 2020, with parole thereafter of two years commencing 18 September 2020, expiring 17 September 2022, giving rise to an overall term of imprisonment of five years commencing 18 September 2017, expiring 17 September 2022.
	
	
	I recommend that he be released to parole at the expiration of that non‑parole period and that that parole will be subject to supervision by Probation and Parole for the entirety of the parole with consideration to referral to a residential rehabilitation programme specifically aimed at dealing with people with intellectual disabilities.
	
	
	I indicate that I have taken into account three form 1 offences when sentencing on sequence 1.
	
	
	And the intention is that the sentence starts - the non‑parole period in effect starts on 18 September last year and expires on - I might’ve got the maths wrong. Well rather than doing it in court, my intention is that to be a combination of sentences that gives rise to five years non-parole with three years on parole, overall eight years. All of the first four offences will be fixed terms in the periods that I announced and it may be that I need to adjust the remaining sentence to give effect to that overall intention, but that’s what I will do. Rather than sitting in court doing this and not being able to do the other matters in the list, we can all work it out amongst us.
	
	
	In announcing the relevant dates for the sentences it became clear that my intention of an overall non-parole period of five years with an overall period of imprisonment of eight years, thus with three years on parole, was not capable of occurring in circumstances where the non-parole period previously announced of three years for the most serious offence was fixed. This is as a result purely of the mathematical issues that arise in circumstances of partial accumulation.
	
	
	I have found special circumstances. On the basis of those special circumstances, but in large part to give effect to my overall intention, I will fix a non-parole period of two years for that substantive offence with parole of three years. That will give rise to an overall non-period once the partially accumulated fixed terms are added.
	
	
	For those reasons then, these are the formal orders:
	
	
	The offender is convicted. For the police pursuit charge, as I have said, sentenced to 12 months fixed term from 18 September 2014 to 17 September 2015.
	
	
	For the threaten injury to avoid apprehension charge, two years and three months from 18 March 2015 to 17 June 2017.
	
	
	For the first armed robbery charge, two years and six months commencing 18 September 2015, expiring 17 March 2018.
	
	
	For the second armed robbery charge, two and a half years, fixed term 18 March 2016 to 17 September 2018.
	
	
	For sequence 11, wound with intent to prevent arrest, non-parole period of two years commencing 18 September 2017, expiring 17 September 2019, with parole thereafter of three years, 18 September 2019, expiring 17 September 2022, giving rise to an overall term of imprisonment of five years, 18 September 2017 to 17 September 2022.
	
	
	I repeat what I said. I recommend that he be released to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period, to be subject to supervision from Probation and Parole Service with referral if possible to a residential unit specifically dealing with intellectually disabled people.

2954554,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 64) [2016] NSWSC 1269,"Judgment


	
	In the State of New South Wales, the defence of duress is a creature of the common law. In many jurisdictions the defence has been codified or modified by legislative enactment. [1]  A controversy has arisen in the present case surrounding the precise content of the defence of duress. Insofar as they exist, the authorities on the issue are either not binding or flawed. As Lord Wilberforce said, as he considered the scope of the defence of duress in Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v Lynch (1975) 61 CR App R 6; [1975] AC 653, at 684-685:
	


“We are here in the domain of the common law: our task is to fit what we can see as principle and authority to the facts before us, and it is no obstacle that these facts are new. The judges have always assumed responsibility for deciding questions of principle relating to criminal liability and guilt, and particularly for setting the standards by which the law expects normal men to act. In all such matters as capacity, sanity, drunkenness, coercion, necessity, provocation, self-defence, the common law, through the judges, accepts and sets the standards of right-thinking men of normal firmness and humanity at a level which people can accept and respect. The House is not inventing a new defence: on the contrary, it would not discharge its judicial duty if it failed to define the law’s attitude to this particular defence in particular circumstances.”


	
	More simply, as Moffitt P said in R v Lawrence [1980] 1 NSWLR 122 at 247, while considering a similar issue and adopting Lord Wilberforce’s words:
	


“The Court should make up its own mind what the law now is.”


	
	It is one thing for the House of Lords to declare the common law of the United Kingdom or for the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal to declare the law of New South Wales. It is a very different thing for a puisne judge to indulge in that undertaking in the course of a criminal trial. However, that is the task that must now be undertaken in order to determine the proper directions to be given to the jury in the Crown’s case on two counts of attempted murder (and, in the two alternative charges of shoot with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm) against the accused man, Mohammed Kalal.
	
	
	The controversy affects one of the five accused men currently standing trial in relation to a number of shooting offences which allegedly arose out of their involvement in a criminal gang called the Brothers for Life at Blacktown (“BFL Blacktown”). This issue arose initially in the context of an argument as to whether duress should be put to the jury at all: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 63) [2016] NSWSC 1216 at [25]-[39]. I decided that the defence should be put to the jury but identified at [32]-[36] that there was an outstanding question as to the precise content of the defence, which would need to be resolved before directions were given to the jury. That question, in short, is whether there is a limitation on the availability of the defence of duress when an accused voluntarily joins a criminal gang or otherwise puts themselves in a position where they might be subject to illegal compulsion. If there is such a limitation, there is a further question as to the content and extent of that limitation.
	
	
	Mr Kalal faces one count of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to murder (count 8) and three counts of shoot with intent to murder (counts 11, 13 and 15). There are alternative charges (counts 9, 12, 14, and 16) that arise if the prosecution does not establish an intention to kill. All of these charges arise out of two separate shooting incidents. It is not in dispute that in the first of those incidents (referred to throughout the trial as “the Zakaria shooting”), Mr Kalal discharged a pump action shotgun at or into a residential home. The sister of the intended target received serious injuries when she was struck by shotgun pellets. A fellow member of the BFL Blacktown (Witness D) attempted to lure the target out of the house and another member (Witness I) was present, armed with a revolver. It appears to be common ground that Witness I did not discharge his weapon. In the second incident (referred to as the “Chokolatta Café shooting”), Mr Kalal discharged a .38 calibre revolver at or into a motor vehicle occupied by three men. At the same time, Witness D discharged a shotgun into the car. There is no evidence that the bullets fired from the revolver hit any of the men inside the car but two of the men were struck and injured by shotgun pellets.
	
	
	The Crown case is that the principals in each shooting were solicited and directed by the leaders of the BFL Blacktown. Mr Kalal embraces this part of the Crown case and relies on evidence from various witnesses that he was threatened before each of the shootings and expressed a reluctance to be involved. This includes evidence that he was told before the Zakaria shooting, “If you don’t get Masood [Zakaria] one of yous are going to get shot” and “whoever doesn’t get him, I’m going to shoot him”. Prior to the Chokolatta Café shooting he was told, “If you don’t do it I’ll have to get your family, sorry bro, like it’s not a game”. There is other evidence to similar effect. This evidence is disputed by Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi.
	
	
	Subject to the matters identified in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 63) at [30] and [38], the Crown properly and fairly concedes that the evidence gives rise to a possible defence of duress.
	


The legal problem and conflict in the authorities 


	
	In R v Qaumi & Ors (No 63), I identified the difficulty in determining the issue as follows:
	


“30. The first is that Mr Kalal voluntarily joined an illegal organisation knowing, or where he ought reasonably to have known, that he may be the subject of compulsion by those people who were members of the organisation. He points to a body of evidence that has been elicited by counsel for Mr Kalal in which it is said that his client became aware of other acts of violence and threats and intimidation engaged in by the leadership of the Brothers for Life at Blacktown. In making that submission reliance is placed on a decision of the House of Lords in Hasan v R [2005] UKHL 22:

‘38. …The policy of the law must be to discourage association with known criminals, and it should be slow to excuse the criminal conduct of those who do so. If a person voluntarily becomes or remains associated with others engaged in criminal activity in a situation where he knows or ought reasonably to know that he may be the subject of compulsion by them or their associates, he cannot rely on the defence of duress to excuse any act which he is thereafter compelled to do by them. It is not necessary in this case to decide whether or to what extent that principle applies if an undercover agent penetrates a criminal gang for bona fide law enforcement purposes and is compelled by the gang to commit criminal acts.

39. I would answer this certified question by saying that the defence of duress is excluded when as a result of the accused's voluntary association with others engaged in criminal activity he foresaw or ought reasonably to have foreseen the risk of being subjected to any compulsion by threats of violence...’

31. Hasan, decided in 2003, purported to overrule an earlier case of Baker and Ward [1999] 2 Cr App R 335. Baker and Ward presented a different test at 344:

‘What a defendant has to be aware of is the risk that the group might try to coerce him into committing criminal offences of the type for which he is being tried by the use of violence or threats of violence.’

32. [In Hasan, Lord Bingham held that this test misstated the law. There are two significant differences between the law as stated in Hasan on the one hand and Baker and Ward on the other. The first is that Baker and Ward required subjective awareness or foresight on the part of the accused while Hasan said that an objective test was sufficient. The second is that Baker and Ward required knowledge or foresight that the accused may be forced to commit criminal offences of a similar kind to that under indictment while Hasan merely required that the accused ought to have known that he may be subject to compulsion by threats of violence.] [2] 

33. Neither counsel was able to take me to any Australian authority where that conflict of authorities, or change in the law of the United Kingdom, has been considered by an Australian Court. Both counsel referred to the case of Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 22; 181 A Crim R 72. Unfortunately, the comment in that case appears to misstate the law that it purported to apply. That case, decided in 2008 (after both Baker and Ward and Hasan), referred at [28] to a submission by the Crown in which reliance was placed on the decision in Baker and Ward. Nguyen was a case in which a trial Judge took the defence away from the jury and the Crown set out the basis upon which it was submitted that the defence was properly taken away from the jury and why it was not available:

‘Where an accused knowingly joined an illegal organisation or otherwise voluntarily put himself or herself in a position where he or she was likely to be subject to an illegal compulsion.’

34. Then reference is made to Baker and Ward. That test, as stated in the submission reproduced by Hodgson JA, appears to be the test from Hasan, and not the test from Baker and Ward. [3]  When Hodgson JA decided that the defence was available and should have been left to the jury, his Honour made the following obiter remark at [40]:

‘The defence would be excluded if the appellant voluntarily joined an illegal organisation.’

35. That observation represents a limitation on the defence of duress which goes well and truly beyond either of the decisions that had preceded it in the United Kingdom.”

The proposed draft directions


	
	Having decided that the defence of duress should be left for the jury’s determination, I circulated to the parties a proposed written direction in draft form for their comments and suggestions. [4]  I sought submissions on the question of whether there was any restriction on the defence when a person voluntarily joins an organisation knowing that they may be subject to compulsion to commit criminal offences. I also sought submissions on the question of whether any such limitation was based on the subjective knowledge or belief of the accused or whether it was an objective test under which the question for the jury was whether the accused “ought to have known” that joining the organisation would place himself or herself in a position where they may be subject to illegal compulsion. Finally, I sought assistance on the extent of the limitation, if one existed, and whether the limitation included the accused placing themselves in a position where they may be subject to unlawful compulsion or whether it went further and concerned unlawful compulsion to commit offences of a similar kind to those in fact committed. Those are the questions thrown up by the decisions of Hasan v R [2005] UKHL 22, R v Baker and Ward [1999] 2 Cr App R 335 and Nguyen v R (2008) 181 A Crim R 72; [2008] NSWCCA 22.
	
	
	The draft direction was in two parts. First, it identified four propositions that purported to summarise the relevant law relating to duress. Second, it identified four questions that arose. If the jury came to an affirmative answer in relation to any one of those questions, the defence of duress would be disproved. The parts of the draft direction that are controversial were in the following terms:
	


“4. A person cannot rely on duress if they voluntarily put themselves in a position where they are likely to be threatened to commit the kind of crime that was in fact committed. On this issue, as with all other issues, the onus of proof is on the prosecution and the standard is beyond reasonable doubt. That is (in this case) the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Kalal placed himself - or remained - in a position where he might be subject to illegal compulsion to commit offences of a similar nature to those which he did in fact commit.

…

4. Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused placed himself in a position where he was likely to be subject to illegal compulsion to commit the kinds of offences that he was forced to commit?”

The position taken by the parties


	
	The parties took diametrically opposing positions although they did agree on one proposition – the proposed draft directions were wrong.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused Mohammed Kalal argued that the law of New South Wales contemplated no limitation on the defence of duress along the lines of that articulated by the Court of Appeal in Baker and Ward and the House of Lords in Hasan. He relied on the draft direction provided in the Criminal Trials Courts Bench Book and the absence of any direction in that publication along the lines proposed. There are two difficulties with this submission.
	
	
	The first is that the notes that follow the draft directions in the Bench Book include the following under the heading Notes at [6-170]:
	


“6. As to the limitations on duress, see: R v Baker and Ward [1999] 2 Cr App Rep 335 which holds (inter alia) that if a person joins an illegal organisation or voluntarily puts himself or herself in a position where he or she is likely to be subjected to illegal compulsion, duress cannot be relied upon as a defence in relation to crimes committed as a consequence of association with that organisation.”


	
	This note contains a significant error in that the limitation to which it refers has more in common with the test stated by the House of Lords in Hasan while attributing that test to the earlier case of Baker and Ward which Hasan overruled. However, by including this note, the authors of the Bench Book clearly contemplated that there was some such limitation on the availability of defence of duress.
	
	
	The more fundamental flaw with this argument concerns the use to which the Bench Book can legitimately be put. The Foreward to the current version contains the following observation by the former Chief Justice made in October 2002:
	


“It is appropriate to reiterate that the Bench Book does not contain an authoritative statement of the law. Practitioners should not act on the basis that a failure to direct in accordance with the Bench Book is of itself indicative of legal error for appellate purposes. Authority for what ought to have been in the contents of a direction in a particular case will need to be identified elsewhere.”


	
	A disclaimer two pages later is in the following terms:
	


“The Commission does not warrant or represent that the information contained within this publication is free of errors or omissions. The Criminal Trial Court’s Bench Book is considered to be correct as at the date of publication, however changes in circumstances after the time of issue, may impact the accuracy and reliability of the information within.”


	
	In Hong v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 242, Spigelman CJ criticised the use of the Bench Book as authority in support of legal submissions:
	


“33. The appellant’s submissions, however, sought to reinforce this ground on the basis that the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book had been amended to take into account the observations in Mahmood.

34. As this Court has said on previous occasions, the Bench Book should not be relied upon in this way. (See R v Zoef [2005] NSWCCA 268 at [93]; R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1 at [72]-[76].) The contents of the Bench Book are no more than suggested guidance for trial judges.”


	
	His Honour then set out parts of the Foreward including the passage to which I have referred above at [15], as well as the following:
	


“The directions are not intended to constitute an authoritative statement of the law, nor is it the case that the whole of each direction will be appropriate in each case. In all respects the directions ought be adapted to the circumstances of the individual case and the legal issues which have arisen.”


	
	Further, there have been cases, including a recent case, where directions based upon those contained in the Bench Book have been held to be erroneous: see, for example, H v R [2016] NSWCCA 63 at [41]-[44]. [5] 
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Kalal ultimately submitted that he was unable to find any case in New South Wales where the restrictions suggested in Baker and Ward and Hasan were adopted as the law of this State or the common law of Australia. In relation to the observation of Hodgson JA in Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 22, counsel relied on the fact that the comment made at [40] of that judgment was clearly an obiter remark. This was a fact to which I referred in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 63) at [36] while indicating:
	


“I do not accept that the statement at [40] of the judgment in Nguyen should be followed.”


	
	Counsel for the Crown took the opposite view. His submission was that the proposed draft direction was unduly restrictive in terms of the limitation on the defence of duress. His submission was that Hasan was correctly decided and that the principles stated by Lord Bingham of Cornhill at [38]-[39] should be taken as representing the law of New South Wales.
	
	
	He accepted that the obiter remark of Hodgson JA in Nguyen v R went too far and was “just a very loose paraphrasing of what the real test is” but, as I understood it, relied on the judgment in Nguyen v R as indicative that the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal had at least impliedly accepted that a limitation on duress arose when a person voluntarily placed themselves in a position where they may be subject to compulsion.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor submitted that the policy considerations behind Hasan, namely to “discourage association with known criminals”, was equally applicable to New South Wales and Australia in 2016. He submitted that the reasons of Lord Bingham at [29]-[39] were “compelling” and should be followed.
	
	
	To summarise the position of the parties. Mr Kalal submitted that paragraph 4 and question 4 of the draft direction should be deleted and that the jury should not be instructed that there was any limitation on the defence of duress based upon Mr Kalal’s voluntary association with the BFL Blacktown. The Crown submitted that the directions should be amended in two ways. First, to delete the reference to “the kind of crime that was in fact committed” and, secondly, to emphasise that the defence would not apply when the accused “ought to have known” that he may be subject to unlawful compulsion.
	


Whether the defence applies to attempted murder


	
	Toward the end of the submisisons, the Crown drew my attention to the decision of the House of Lords in R v Gotts (1992) 94 Cr App R 312; [1992] 2 AC 412, in which a majority of their Lordships held that the defence of duress did not apply to cases of attempted murder. He also referred me to R v Goldman (2004) 147 A Crim R 472; [2004] VSC 291 in which Redlich J (sitting at first instance in the Supreme Court of Victoria) declined to follow R v Gotts. The Crown brought these authorities to my attention for completeness given that the charges faced by Mr Kalal are in the nature of attempted murder charges. [6] 
	
	
	The decision in Gotts was not relied on in the earlier argument as to whether the defence should be withdrawn from the jury’s consideration and the Crown did not submit that the defence was not available.
	
	
	However, in my judgment the approach taken by Redlich J and by the dissentients in the House of Lords (Lord Keith and Lord Lowry) is to be preferred. I agree with the simple statement of Lord Keith at 313:
	


“There is much to be said in favour of the view that the generally accepted wisdom then was that the defence was only witheld in cases of murder and treason. Murder is in a category of its own. The fact that it involves the actual destruction of life makes its nature special.”


	
	See also Lord Lowry at 323 and the analysis by Redlich J in R v Goldman at 480-481.
	
	
	Other jurisdictions have enacted legislation which abolishes the defence of duress in respect of certain serious offences: see, for example, Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas), s 20; Criminal Code 1899 (Qld), s 31(2), Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT), s 40(2); Criminal Code (RSC) 1985 c C-46, s 17; Crimes Act 1961 (NZ), s 24(2). There is no such legislative restriction on the defence in New South Wales.
	
	
	No authority has been brought to my attention in which it has been suggested that the common law of Australia does not recognise a defence of duress in cases of attempted murder. In R v Goldman, Redlich J held that the defence applied to attempted murder and noted at [36]:
	


“Lord Wilberforce and Lord Edmund-Davies, in their dissenting judgments in Abbott thought it was unarguable that one charged with an attempt to murder may plead duress, it having been ‘ever permitted as a defence even to charges of great gravity’. Glanville Williams was to state prior to Gotts that it had never been suggested that the defence of duress is denied to the attempted perpetrator of murder.”


	
	In R v McConnell [1977] 1 NSWLR 714, the Court of Criminal Appeal held the defence did not apply to principals present at the scene of a murder, but there was no suggestion that the defence would not apply to an accused charged as an accessory. Street CJ followed the decision of the House of Lords in DPP for Northern Ireland v Lynch, in which it seemed to be accepted by a majority that the defence would (or at least may) apply to an accessory to murder but would not apply to a principal, at least a principal in the first degree. Street CJ set out at 718 the position in the United Kingdom following Lynch:
	


“This, then, is the state of the law as laid down by the House of Lords. Two of their Lordships deny the availability of the defence of duress on a charge of murder, whether it be in the first degree or the second degree. Two of their Lordships accept the availability of the defence in a charge of murder in the second degree, and leave open its availability in a charge of murder in the first degree, whilst at the same time holding out little encouragement to any judicial extension of its availability in this regard. The fifth Law Lord accepted the defence as available in a charge of murder in the second degree, and indicated at least a willingness to entertain an argument should the occasion arise to the effect that it should also be available to a principal in the first degree. The weight of authoritative judicial opinion must, in the light of these views, be accepted as continuing, perhaps even with reinforced significance, to justify the conclusion expressed by Lord Wilberforce, namely, that, in a case of actual killing by a first degree principal, the balance of judicial authority at the present time is against the admission of the defence of duress. The speeches of the Law Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v. Lynch (8), do not, in my view, disturb the balance as stated by Lord Wilberforce (9).” [Footnotes omitted]


	
	Taylor CJ at CL at 723 held that the defence did not apply “in the case of principals (that is, those who perform an act in furtherance of the proposed killing)” and Begg J (also at 723) held that it did not apply “in a case of actual killing by a first degree principal”.
	
	
	It would be anomolous if an accessory to murder could rely on the defence of duress while a person charged with attempted murder could not. Some of the judgments in the House of Lords show there is an anomaly in allowing a person who acts with murderous intent to rely on the defence while a person charged with the completed offence cannot: see, for example, the speech of Lord Jauncey in R v Gotts. On the other hand, as Lord Keith demonstrates, it is anomalous to allow the defence for the intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm but not for the same offence done with the intent to kill. Lord Lowry collected some of the earlier judgments at pp 231-323. Some judgments question the proposition the defence is not available for murder itself. For example, Lord Brandon in R v Howe and Others [1987] AC 417 at 438:
	


“It is not logical, and I do not think it can be just, that duress should afford a complete defence to charges of all crimes less grave than murder, but not even a partial defence to a charge of that crime. I say nothing as to treason, for that is not here in issue. I am persuaded. nevertheless, to agree with my noble and learned friend by three considerations. First. it seems to me that, so far as the defence of duress is concerned, no valid distinction can be drawn between the commission of murder by one who is a principal in the first degree and one who is a principal in the second degree. Secondly, I am satisfied that the common law of England has developed over several centuries in such a way as to produce the illogical, and as I think unjust, situation to which I have referred. Thirdly, I am convinced that, if there is to be any alteration in the law on such an important and controversial subject, that alteration should be made by legislation and not judicial decision.”


	
	It seems to me, the answer is provided by Lord Kieth at 313: “Murder is a crime in a category of its own”.
	
	
	There is an observation in Blackmore & Hosking, Criminal Law NSW (Thompson Reuters, 2012, update 220) that duress does not apply to the offence of attempted murder. The learned authors cite Gotts in support of that proposition but I am not aware of any Australian (or NSW) authority that justifies this approach. Howie and Johnson, Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW (Butterworths) do not suggest the defence is excluded in cases of attempted murder. Duress is dealt with at [6-705] which includes the following:
	


“It has been held that duress is available in respect of a minor participation in murder: R v McAfferty [1974] 1 NSWLR 89 but see R v Brown [1968] SASR 467. It is available to a person charged as a principal in the second degree to muder: R v Darrington [1980] VR 353.”


	
	Howie and Johnson do not suggest the defence does not apply to cases of attempted murder and there is no reference to the United Kingdom authorities suggesting otherwise.
	
	
	I proceed on the basis that, as of the time of these offences and this trial, the defence applies to an accused charged with attempted murder in New South Wales. To adopt the words of Deane J in Zecevic v DPP (Vic) (1987) 162 CLR 645 at 678; [1987] HCA 26, it would be “simply wrong that an accused may be adjudged not guilty or guilty of [attempted murder] according to the chance of whether his trial is completed before or after this Court has abolished a defence” upon which he could previously have relied. As his Honour said at 677, such an approach would reduce the administration of the criminal law to a “macabre lottery”.
	
	
	Further, there is much to be said for consistency and comity between the approach of this Court and that taken in the Victorian Supreme Court by Redlich J in R v Goldman.
	
	
	For those reasons, I confirm my earlier ruling that the defence will be left for consideration by the jury. The more difficult question is the content of the defence.
	


Is there a restriction on the availability of the defence of duress when the accused voluntarily associates with a criminal group?


	
	The policy considerations that attracted the House of Lords in Hasan are equally applicable to the circumstances prevailing in Australia in the early part of the 21st century. The prevalence of criminal groups and street gangs is an important consideration in determining whether there should be some limitation on the availability of the defence of duress to those who voluntarily associate with or join criminal organisations.
	
	
	Further, the analysis of Lord Bingham shows there was a longstanding understanding, at least in the United Kingdom, that there is a limitation on the availability of the defence of duress when a person is part of a criminal organisation or where they otherwise put themselves in a postion where they may be coerced to commit criminal offences.
	
	
	In Nguyen, Hodgson JA clearly accepted that there was such a limitation although, because the question did not strictly arise for determination, his Honour referred at [28.1] to the wrong case (or to the wrong test) and at [40] overstated the nature of the limitation. In spite of these flaws in the judgment and the fact that the observations were obiter dicta, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that his Honour (with whom Kirby and Buddin JJ agreed) understood there was such a limitation on the availability of the defence.
	
	
	Howie and Johnson refer to his Honour’s decision as authority for the proposition that “the defence would not apply if the accused had voluntarily joined an illegal corporation but this was a question for the jury”. The learned authors did not analyse the case law upon which Hodgson JA relied in Nguyen and did not make reference to the errors to which I have drawn attention. As I have said, the authors of the Bench Book considered there was such a limitation although, again, the patent errors in Nguyen are present in the Bench Book and the Bench Book does not purport to be a substitute for authority.
	
	
	The relevant policy considerations and the obiter remarks of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Nguyen satisfy me that the law of duress in New South Wales contains a limitation of the kind under consideration.
	


Is the limitation based on objective or subjective considerations?


	
	Many cases have considered whether or not the defence of duress involves entirely subjective considerations. Any suggestion to that effect has been firmly rejected over many years: see, for example, R v Lawrence at 138 (Moffit P) and 162-163 (Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J); R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 537 and 542 (Hunt J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed). At least part of the defence of duress involves an objective consideration of how the reasonable person of ordinary firmness would conduct themselves and whether that hypothetical person would have yielded to the threat in the way that the accused person did.
	
	
	In R v Abusafiah, Hunt J drew an analogy with other defences such as necessity, self-defence and provocation. [7]  His Honour noted at 541 that each of those defences introduced “an objective test of reasonableness, in order to ensure that accused person with sensitivities fall outside the ordinary or common range of human temperaments are not permitted to escape responsibility for their actions”. However, Hunt J was careful to note “beyond that … there is no true analogy”.
	
	
	Consistently with the approach of the law to those other defences and the introduction of an objective analysis to the defence of duress more generally, it is appropriate that the jury be directed that an accused who joins a criminal organisation should be restricted in their reliance on the defence of duress not only on the basis of what they knew, but also on the basis of what they ought to have known. This is consistent with the approach of the House of Lords in Hasan.
	
	
	In the present case, any distinction between the objective and subjective aspect of this limitation to the defence is unlikely to impact on the jury’s determination. Similar observations were made in R v Lawrence by Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J at 162:
	


“…we would point out that in most cases, and indeed in the present case, having regard to the manner in which the trial was conducted, it would not be a matter of any consequence whether the test to be applied was subjective or whether it was objective.”


	
	While that remark was made in the context of the defence more generally and in circumstances where there was no evidence that the accused were other than men of ordinary firmness, similar considerations apply here. The way in which the prosecution put its case to the jury is really that the accused knew that he may be compelled to commit a crime because of his knowledge of the violent conduct and reputation of the group and the way in which the leaders of the group exercised control over the group by intimidation and fear. For example, the learned Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury: [8] 
	


“So, in our submission, albeit he hasn't been asked to do anything by way of a violent crime to this point, he is aware, does have knowledge that the leaders of this group whose directions must be obeyed, their directions must be obeyed on the basis if you don't do this, even if it is just not paying your money or wanting to leave, or wanting to go to the police, you are going to get shot.

So, in our submission, you would give consideration as to whether, by his being in this group and remaining in this group, knowing these threats that have been made at other times, that he voluntarily put himself in the position where he knew or ought to have known that he would be forced to do an act of violence like this with a firearm.”


	
	I propose to direct the jury in accordance with what I consider to be the law – that is, the limitation is based on what the accused “knew, or ought to have known”. However, I will make it clear to the jury that the real issue in the present case appears to be what the accused actually knew based on his knowledge of the activities and conduct of the group and its leaders.
	


What is the content of that which the accused knew or ought to have known? 


	
	The second matter upon which the House of Lords in Hasan overruled the decision in Baker and Ward concerned the subject matter of the accused’s knowledge. Baker and Ward held that what was required was for the accused to be aware that the group might “coerce him into committing criminal offences of the type for which he is being tried”. Hasan held that this was incorrect and that the real question was whether the accused knew, or ought to have known, that there was a “risk of being subjected to any compulsion by threats of violence” [my emphasis].
	
	
	The rationale behind the decision in Hasan was the desirability of discouraging association with criminal organisations. While I accept that this is a strong policy consideration in favour of some limitation to the availability of defence, the terms in which the House of Lords stated the test has a capacity to operate harshly and to produce unjust results. To take a hypothetical example, a youth who joins a group that is involved in small-time shoplifting or minor drug dealing organised by a criminal cartel would (on the House of Lords’ formulation) be denied the defence if he was forced at gun point to take part in a bank robbery, kidnapping or major drug importation. While I must afford a decision of the House of Lords considerable deference, I am unable to conclude that the approach in Hasan represents the law of New South Wales.
	
	
	In the circumstances of the present case, the distinction may be significant depending on the factual findings made by the jury. On the one hand, there is no evidence that Mr Kalal had previously been directed to engage in offences of violence – his only criminal activity appears on the evidence to have been in the sale and distribution of cannabis. On the other hand, the jury may conclude that he was aware both of the involvement of the group in violent offending and the intimidation and threats used by the leadership against other members.
	
	
	The formulation I prefer allows some flexibility and permits the jury to apply its sense of justice to the facts and to determine, applying the community’s standards of fairness and common sense, whether the association with the BFL Blacktown disentitles Mr Kalal from relying on the defence in all of the circumstances. That formulation is as follows:
	


“4. Duress does not apply if an accused person voluntarily put themselves in a position where they knew, or ought to have known, that they might be forced by threats of violence to commit criminal offences of a similar kind to those that were in fact committed. On this issue, as with all other issues, the onus is on the prosecution and the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.”


	
	Similarly, the fourth question to be posed in the written directions will be:
	


“4. Has the Crown proved beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Kalal placed himself in a position where he knew, or ought to have known, that he may be subject to threats of violence (to himself or his family) if he did not commit offences of a similar kind to those that he was forced to commit?”


	
	I amended the written directions accordingly and provided the revised document to the parties on the third day of the Crown Prosecutor’s address. [9]  The jury will be instructed that those written directions are not a substitute for the summing up. The summing up will include more extensive directions as to the law of duress, including this limitation on its availability, and will be calculated to place those directions in the context of the factual matrix of the present case.

		22 November 2016",2016-09-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2954555,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 56) [2016] NSWSC 1130,"Judgment


	
	On 16 August 2016 I ordered that a particular juror be discharged and that the trial continue with a reduced number of jurors (13). These are my reasons for those decisions.
	
	
	On 23 June 2016, I refused an application by the Crown, supported by the accused Mohammed Kalal, that the juror be discharged: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 41) [2016] NSWSC 857. That application was based on the evidence of a number of police officers and the solicitor instructing the learned Crown Prosecutor in the trial. The evidence is set out in the judgment, for example at [15], [18], [19], [20], [25], [26], [28]-[29]. That evidence is relevant to the present decision, and was tendered on the application, but I do not propose to repeat that survey of evidence in these reasons. However, the reader should incorporate that factual material into these reasons.
	
	
	The basis of the earlier application was twofold. First, it was submitted that the observations of the juror smiling towards some of the accused was such as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias pursuant to s 53B(b) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW). Second, it was submitted that part of the evidence suggested that the juror may have disobeyed a direction not to discuss things that occurred in the course of the trial. This was the basis of an alternative submission under s 53B(d) of the Jury Act that there was “another reason” to discharge the juror because of matters “affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror”. I was not satisfied that the evidence established that the juror had disobeyed directions. On the primary application I concluded, largely for the reasons given at paragraphs [43] and [50]-[54], that the evidence did not establish that a fair-minded observer of the proceedings might conclude that the juror might not bring an impartial mind to bear upon the issues to be determined.
	
	
	Since that judgment was delivered, I have made a number of observations of the juror. Just four days after the earlier judgment was published, I raised with Mr Young SC the fact that I had observed an interchange of smiles between the juror and his client (Mumtaz Qaumi). [1]  Several weeks passed. On 8 August 2016 I indicated that I may need more assistance in relation to the question of whether the juror should now be discharged. [2]  The next day I raised the question again, and specifically sought assistance in relation to the interpretation and operation of s 53B(b). [3]  Later on Wednesday 9 August 2016, I brought to the attention of counsel some of my observations and concerns. [4]  The matter was raised again on Thursday 10 August 2016 [5]  and Friday 11 August 2016. [6] 
	
	
	On Monday 15 August 2016, one of the jurors was sick and the remaining thirteen jurors were allowed to disperse. I heard full argument on the issue of whether the juror should be discharged. In the course of the argument and as a matter of procedural fairness to those opposed to the application to discharge the juror, I set out the observations that I had made between 23 June 2016 and 11 August 2016. [7]  Both the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for Mr Kalal submitted that the appropriate course was to discharge the juror. Detective Inspector Glen Browne provided a statement dated 11 August 2016 (exhibit VD RRR). He was called to give evidence and was cross-examined. Both counsel for the Crown and counsel for Mr Kalal relied on the evidence adduced when the application was made on 22 June 2013. Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi opposed the application. To a more muted degree, Mohammad Zarshoy also resisted the discharge of the juror.
	
	
	Sections 53A and 53B of the Jury Act are in the following terms:
	


“53A Mandatory discharge of individual juror

(1) The court or coroner must discharge a juror if, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest:

(a) it is found that the juror was mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, whether because the juror was excluded from jury service or was otherwise not returned and selected in accordance with this Act, or

(b) the juror has become excluded from jury service, or

(c) the juror has engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial or coronial inquest.

(2) In this section:

misconduct, in relation to a trial or coronial inquest, means:

(a) conduct that constitutes an offence against this Act, or

Note. For example, under section 68C it is an offence for a juror to make certain inquiries except in the proper exercise of his or her functions as a juror.

(b) any other conduct that, in the opinion of the court or coroner, gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the trial or inquest.

s 53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:

(a) the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge’s or coroner’s opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or

Note. Under clause 12 of Schedule 2, a juror who because of sickness or infirmity is unable to discharge the duties of a juror is ineligible to serve as a juror.

(b) it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial or coronial inquest, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason, or

(c) a juror refuses to take part in the jury’s deliberations, or

(d) it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.

Note. Section 22 provides for the continuation of a trial or inquest on the death or discharge of a juror.”


	
	One notable aspect of these provisions is that s 53B(b) alone requires there to be material “from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court”. There was a dispute between the parties as to whether or not the trial Judge’s observations was “evidence before the court” and the status of those observations in terms of the relevant provisions of the Jury Act. It was submitted on behalf of Farhad Qaumi that, as absurd as the results might appear to be, the observations that I had made were not “evidence before the court”. Accordingly, it was submitted that I could not discharge the juror on the grounds of apprehended bias pursuant to s 53B(b) on the basis of my observations. Those supporting the discharge of the juror submitted that the phrase “evidence before the court” encompasses things that occur in the courtroom as observed by the decision maker. Reliance was placed on observations by the High Court in Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA 59; 72 ALJR 250 and the ACT Court of Appeal in Bailiff v R [2011] ACTCA 7.
	
	
	I will return to that issue in due course, but it should be observed that the application by both the Crown and Mr Kalal encompassed a submission that the juror had engaged in “misconduct” as that expression is defined in s 53A(2). Section 53A does not require that there be “evidence before the court”. Further, s 53A(1) is in mandatory terms; if there has been misconduct, the trial Judge must discharge the juror. The definition of misconduct encompasses conduct that constitutes an offence under the Jury Act or any other conduct that “gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the trial”. Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi relied on the explanatory notes to the Jury Amendment Bill 2008 and the New South Wales Law Reform Commission report upon which the Bill was based. Based on that extrinsic material, it was submitted that the kind of conduct contemplated by s 53A was serious misconduct and that the conduct here complained of could not properly be so categorised.
	
	
	In addition to reliance on s 53A (misconduct) and 53B(b) (apprehended bias), the Crown and Mr Kalal also relied on the provision in s 53B(d). It was submitted that the conduct complained of constituted “any other reason, affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror”. Section 53B(d) does not require evidence. Rather, it requires that “it appears to the court” that there is such a reason. It was not suggested that the Judge’s observations could not properly be taken into account in taking action under that provision.
	
	
	Putting to one side whether or not my observations constitute “evidence before the court” for the purposes of s 53B, it is necessary to set out my observations since 23 June 2016, to understand the context in which the current decision is made. There is no dispute that my observations are relevant to the application insofar as it is made under ss 53A and 53B(d).
	
	
	For the benefit of all parties I detailed my observations in the course of argument. This was based on notes that I made, and then transcribed, in the course of the last several weeks of the trial. I commenced making notes after refusing the earlier application to discharge the juror on 23 June 2016. The following is a reproduction of those notes, amended in form but not in substance, for the purpose of this judgment. I have incorporated other relevant events and included transcript references where relevant. I have placed square brackets around those parts that might be considered to be based on inference or impression rather than simple reporting of what I saw.

	The relative position of the accused in the dock was described in an earlier judgment: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 55) [2016] NSWSC 1068 at [7]. Because of the position of the accused in the dock, the separation of the two groups of men and the geography of the courtroom, it is clear when a juror is looking in the direction of the Qaumi brothers as distinct from looking in the general direction of the dock or at Mr Kalal and Mr Zarshoy. To look at the Qaumi brothers, the juror looks directly across from where she sits and between the two bar tables. To look at the other accused, her gaze would be at (roughly) a 45 degree angle to the front and across (or over) the front bar table.
	
	
	In addition to the evidence tendered on the last application, Detective Inspector Glen Browne provided a statement and gave evidence of noticing what he described as “unusual behaviour” on the part of the juror. [9]  This largely consisted of staring in the direction of the Qaumi brothers. He said:
	


“It appears to me that the young juror holds her stare until such time that she realises it will not be reciprocated. I have also observed that on many occasions, when the young juror sits down and stares across the court room in the direction of the Qaumi’s, she holds documents or a folder in front of her face so that only her eyes are visible above the object.”


	
	Mr Browne contrasted this conduct with the actions of the other jurors and described the conduct as “repetitive and continuous”. He estimated that he had observed this “on as many as twenty or thirty occasions since [late June 2016]”.
	
	
	I accepted the evidence of Mr Browne. Similarly, I accepted the evidence of the officers and the solicitor who gave evidence on the previous application. [10] 
	
	
	Before embarking on an analysis of the merits of the application, I should refer back to the analysis of some of the relevant legal principles undertaken in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 41). I also summarised relevant principles in an earlier judgment where another juror was discharged for apprehended bias: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 36) [2016] NSWSC 718. The reader should be aware of my earlier analyses and incorporate them into this judgment. It is unnecessary to repeat the earlier discussion here, but it is critical that the reader understands that the considerations that led me to decline the application on 23 June 2016 have operated on my mind in considering the present application. I have applied the legal principles discussed in the two earlier judgments in determining the present application.
	


Misconduct


	
	I accept the submission of Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi that the definition of “misconduct” in s 53A and the secondary materials to which he has referred suggests that, before a juror is subject to mandatory discharge under s 53A, there must be misconduct of a relatively serious kind.
	
	
	Ordinarily, the fact that a juror smiles in the course of a trial, even in the direction of an accused person or at an alleged victim sitting in the back of the court, would not give rise to a finding of misconduct for the purpose of this section. Similarly, if a juror was seen to react adversely to an accused upon heard the evidence of a complainant, such a reaction would not ordinarily result in a finding of misconduct (or for that matter give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias).
	
	
	However, in the present case, the smiling is both continual and specifically directed to three of the accused. It is of some significance that one of the accused men (Mr Kalal) supports the application in circumstances where he is conducting a defence of duress in which he says that he was threatened by two of the three accused brothers to whom the juror’s attention is directed. In those circumstances, there is a respectable argument that the conduct “gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice”.
	
	
	The term “substantial miscarriage of justice” is one that is very familiar to criminal appellate lawyers because it forms part of the common form “proviso” in, for example, the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The term has been subject to considerable jurisprudence in the context of appeals against conviction: see, for example, the catalogue of cases in my dissenting judgment in RP v R [2015] NSWCCA 215 at [151]–[154]. [11]  While that jurisprudence is not directly relevant to the interpretation of the definition of misconduct in s 53A, it is significant that one of the applicants for a discharge of the juror is the accused, Mohammad Kalal. If it were found that the juror’s interaction with the Qaumi brothers was such as to diminish Mr Kalal’s prospects of receiving a fair trial and having his defence of duress considered seriously by the particular juror, there is a strong argument that there is a “risk” that it would give rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Furthermore, this is not an instance of an occasional or isolated smile that can readily be explained in some other way. Some of the conduct appeared to be furtive and, on occasion when the juror realised that I was observing her, the conduct ceased. These things could lead to an inference that the juror believed or realised that her conduct was inappropriate.
	
	
	In the course of the previous application the learned Crown Prosecutor accepted the fact that if a juror was seen to be scowling at the accused it would not give rise to a legitimate application by an accused person to have that juror discharged. Similarly, as I pointed out in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 41), the High Court held in Webb and Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 that direction could cure an irregularity even where a juror gave a relative of a homicide victim flowers during the course of a murder trial.
	
	
	Because I have determined that the juror should be discharged under the provisions of s 53B, it is strictly unnecessary to determine whether the juror’s conduct rises to the level of “misconduct”. It is also the case that the juror has not been examined and has not had the opportunity to explain herself. As I said to the juror when she was formally discharged, her “interaction [with the accused] may well be perfectly innocent”. [12]  In those circumstances, I do not propose to make a formal finding of misconduct.
	
	
	However, because of the persistent and furtive nature of the conduct, which went on for at least two months, and because of the unenviable position in which it placed the accused Mohammed Kalal, I was inclined to take the view that the conduct overall constituted misconduct as that expression is defined in s 53A of the Jury Act. If that finding was made formally, the discharge of the juror would be mandatory.
	


Reasonable apprehension of bias


	
	Section 53B(b) provides for discretionary discharge of a juror when “it appears to the Court” that a juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of (amongst other things) a “reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest or any similar reason”. That power can only be invoked when the appearance arises “from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court”. As I have said, there is a dispute as to whether my own observations can be taken into account because (it is submitted) that my observations do not constitute evidence.
	
	
	Accepting that submission for the purpose of the argument, the material in Detective Inspector Browne’s statement shows that the conduct has been persistent over many weeks since the original application to discharge the juror was refused. The conduct to which he testified involves the juror staring for periods of time towards the Qaumi brothers apparently in an attempt to gain their attention. This is, as Detective Inspector Browne suggested, “unusual” behaviour. When it was put to him that his statement did not suggest whether the juror has “a partisan feeling one way or another either for or against the accused”, he replied
	


“A. I haven't suggested that, Mr Stratton, but I think the fact that ‑ in my mind at least, the fact that they are stares accompanied with smiles, as opposed to stares accompanied with snarls or something similar that I imagine ‑ to me it suggests that she would be perhaps in favour of the accused.”


	
	Based on the evidence previously before the Court, along with Detective Inspector Browne’s additional statement and evidence, I concluded that a fair-minded observer of the proceedings might conclude that the juror might not bring an impartial mind to bear upon the issues before the court. As advised on 23 June 2016, I was unable to reach that positive conclusion for the reasons stated in the judgment. In particular, I was not then persuaded that the conduct would mean that the juror would not, when confronted with the reality of having to make the decision concerning the guilt of the accused, be able to put any feelings which are reflected in her conduct out of her mind. However, I have now reached the contrary view. In coming to that opinion, I am particularly conscious of the position of Mr Kalal. Detective Inspector Browne’s evidence was that he has not seen the juror look in the direction of Mr Kalal or Mr Zarshoy. The reasonable apprehension of bias arises in circumstances where Mr Kalal will rely on threats allegedly emanating from the Qaumi brothers, where those threats are denied, and where the juror’s smiling and staring appears (on the evidence) to be solely directed to the Qaumi brothers.
	
	
	It is impossible for me to know whether the conclusions that I reached were influenced to some degree by my own observations and it would be disingenuous to suggest that I can be certain that my observations have not impacted on my decision. I am reminded of the words of North J in Sun Zhan Qui v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 1488; 81 FCR 71:
	


“A decision-maker may not be open to persuasion and, at the same time, not recognise that limitation. Indeed, a characteristic of prejudice is the lack of recognition by the holder. Some judges, including myself, who have in recent years attended gender and race awareness programmes, have been struck by the unrecognised nature of the baggage which we carry on such issues. Decisions made upon assumptions or prejudgments concerning race or gender have been made by many well-meaning judges, unaware of the assumptions or preconceptions which, in fact, governed their decision-making.”


	
	Whatever subliminal influence my own observations may have had, I have attempted to put those observations to one side in considering the application.
	


Are my own observations “evidence before the Court” for the purpose of s 53B(b) of the Jury Act?


	
	In any event, I was also persuaded that the proper interpretation of s 53B(b) and the phrase “evidence before the court” as it is used in that provision is capable of encompassing the observations made by the judicial officer upon whom the duty of making such decisions is cast. However, the terms and structure of the Jury Act mean that this is not a matter free of controversy. The fact is that – of all of the powers to discharge in ss 53A and 53 – only s 53B(b) requires statements from the juror or “evidence before the court”.
	
	
	Although the legal and factual circumstance are not analogous, the approach urged by the Crown gains some support from the observations concerning “autoptic proference” discussed in Evans v The Queen at [20]–[21]. Similarly I have considered the discussion of the ACT Court of Appeal in Bailiff v R, where the Court said:
	


“Nothing in s 52 of the Evidence Act prohibits a court, in the course of an investigation or inquiry undertaken such as the one undertaken by the primary judge, from taking into account what the court observes about the behaviour of a party. It was recognised, in Evans v The Queen [2007] HCA; (2007) 82 ALJR 250 at [21], per Gummow and Hayne JJ, that a tribunal of fact in a personal injuries matter is entitled to make its own observations about the extent of a plaintiff’s injuries on the appearance of the plaintiff.”


	
	I appreciate that the observations of the High Court in Evans v The Queen and those of the ACT Court of Appeal in Bailiff v R arose in completely different circumstances to those arising on the present application. However, the absurdity of the results to which the interpretation contended on behalf of Farhad Qaumi leads me to conclude that a judge who makes observations of the kind that I have made may take such observations into account as “evidence before the court”.
	
	
	The Judge confronted with such a situation should be, as I have been, particularly careful not to draw inferences upon their own observations unless those inferences are clear and rational inferences. The Judge should also be conscious of the fact that there is a possibility of their observations being affected by the background. By that last sentence, and in the context of the present case, I refer to the fact that the observations that I have made and noted were made following an earnest application on behalf of the prosecutor and Mr Kalal. Accordingly, I was attentive to the juror’s conduct and I allowed for the possibility that the background may have had some influence on my perception of the juror’s conduct.
	
	
	I have also observed the conduct of the other jury members to see whether the juror’s behaviour is significantly different to theirs. I have no doubt that it is. Reference was made in argument to one of the juror’s glaring at the accused. I have observed the jury in question and have never observed such behaviour, although I have certainly observed that he looks at the dock from time to time. I have seen (and mentioned in one of the earlier arguments) that another member of the juror looked sternly at the dock earlier in the trial but I have not observed that conduct recently and the conduct was neither persistent nor furtive.
	
	
	The point of raising these matters is this: if it were the case that a trial judge observed conduct on the part of a juror that clearly demonstrated bias against an accused person, and if nobody else in the courtroom observed the behaviour and there was no “evidence” from a witness or an exhibit such as CCTV footage, the trial judge would be powerless to remedy the potential injustice on the construction urged by counsel for the Qaumis. This absurd result that would arise from an interpretation of the provision that excluded the court’s observation from the phrase “evidence before the court”. The Judge would be prevented from exercising their discretionary power on the basis that their own observations could not constitute evidence. Such an interpretation would serve to defeat the purpose of the provision and has a true capacity to result in serious miscarriages of justice.
	
	
	Further, it would have been possible to examine the juror and put to her my observations. The sole purpose of that process would have been to adduce evidence in accordance with my observations. Had the juror agreed that the she had engaged in the conduct that I observed, there would have been “evidence before the court”. However, the juror would most likely have been embarrassed and there would have been a risk process of examining her would have created a problem for her to continue to serve. If the observations were denied by the juror, another basis for discharging the juror may have arisen (misconduct by not being true to the oath or affirmation). While contending that the Judge’s observations were not evidence, Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi submitted that I should not call the juror to give evidence. [13] 
	
	
	My own observations in the present case would certainly provide support for the conclusion that I have otherwise reached under s 53B(b). However, as I have said, that conclusion was reached on the basis of material that was, without question, “evidence before the Court”.
	


Section 53B(d) of the Jury Act


	
	Based on the evidence and also my own observations, I am also satisfied that the provision in s 53B(d) is engaged. This provision refers to “any other reason” that may affect the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror that leads to a conclusion that “it appears” that the juror should not continue to act as a juror. While the facts and circumstances might lead to some cross-over between the various paragraphs in s 53B, the use of the word “other” in the phrase “any other reason” suggests that the reason must be something separate from those matters specifically dealt with in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). However, the paragraph is cast in deliberately broad terms. It may be that conduct that does not rise to the level of “apprehended bias” might be caught by the provision in sub-paragraph (d).
	
	
	Contrary to the Crown’s submissions, I am not satisfied that the juror disobeyed directions. The directions provided in 23 June 2016 [14]  stressed the seriousness of the decisions that the jury would be called upon to make and referred to “relationships formed across the courtroom”. However, I did not suggest that it was wrong to smile or to interact with the participants in the trial.
	
	
	Nevertheless, her inappropriate reactions to some of the evidence and her apparent distraction by her repeated attempts to gain the attention of the accused give rise to concerns as to her ability to perform the functions of a juror. In contesting the proposition that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias, counsel for Jamil Qaumi said that “one can't exclude the possibility perhaps her level of maturity might not be such that she was able to appropriately deal with that material when confronted with it”. As I said at the time that fact may give rise to questions under s 53B(d).
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi submitted that the juror appeared to him to be attentive to the evidence. Counsel for Mr Zarshoy observed that she had a number of pens and that she passed tissues to other jurors. Precisely what one can make of those matters is difficult to know. My observation is that she is attentive to the evidence some of the time but not others and her repeated attempts to interact with the accused, her inappropriate responses to parts of the evidence and directions, suggests a level of distraction that may compromise her ability to perform the task of a juror.
	
	
	It appeared to me that the juror’s conduct may affect her ability to perform the functions of a juror and that she should not continue as a juror.
	


Discretion


	
	Section 53B provides that the court “may” discharge the juror if any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) – (d) arise. Accordingly, the Court has a discretion as to whether the juror should be discharged. However, given the nature of the matters in (a) to (d) it would be unusual if the Court came to those conclusions but did not discharge the juror.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the section is discretionary and before discharging the juror a number of matters should be taken into account. In the present case, I have been particularly conscious of the importance that the selection of a jury in criminal proceedings must be random and that a judge should not lightly interfere with the randomness that is facilitated by the various ballots and procedures provided for by the Jury Act. It is also the case that there are still many weeks left in the trial and that the discharge of the juror would reduce the number of jurors down to thirteen. In R v Qaumi & Ors (No 36) at [62] I referred to the important observations of McHugh J in Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99 concerning the historical significance of an accused person being tried by a jury of twelve. Kirby J in the same case referred at [45] to the importance of the jury representing a cross-section of the community.
	
	
	These matters highlight the fact that a judge should not lightly exercise the discretion to discharge an individual juror. Even so, I was quite sure that the correct exercise of the discretion in the present case was to order that the juror be discharged.
	


Decision to Continue with a Reduced Number of Jurors


	
	Section 53C(1)(a) of the Jury Act provides that the Court must discharge the entire jury if it is of the opinion that a continuing with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. If satisfied that there is “no such risk” the court must order that the trial is to continue with a reduced number of jurors.
	
	
	I was satisfied that there is no such risk. There has been no indication from the jury that the juror’s conduct has impacted on their consideration of the evidence. While there has been interaction with other jurors during the course of the evidence, there is nothing to suggest that the other jurors have been distracted from their task or have lost focus on the evidence. On the contrary, the jury as a whole has appeared to be very attentive, responding appropriately to the evidence and communicating with the court to seek clarification of legal directions, disclose relevant personal matters or to access parts of the transcript.
	
	
	There has been no application for discharge of the whole jury based on the discharge of the individual juror although counsel for Mr Zarshoy raised some concerns. He said that there may be concerns:
	


“…if you have one juror who appears to be either not listening to what has been asked of the jurors and explained to them and told to them, or is showing a potential bias, what that effect is upon the others whom she has clearly been relating to, mixing to, socialising with since over four months now, and whether or not it can be said if she is such a person who should not be on the jury now, whether there are others who are contaminated by whatever view she may have or not and whether or not the whole jury in that circumstance needs to go because it is so late in the trial.

This has not happened a day or two in. Four months these 14 now have been together. They must know each, must have spoken to each other, must have said things, talked about things that are going on. So I say that. That is a worry as to where this goes to, where it leads to, if there is a dismissal of this particular juror alone.” [15] 


	
	In view of the substantial experience and wisdom of counsel raising those concerns, I gave consideration to the matters that he raised. However, I was firmly of the view that that there was no risk that continuing with the remaining thirteen jurors might lead to a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	


Orders


	
	It was for those reasons that I made the following orders:
	



	
	The individual juror be discharged.
	
	
	The trial is to continue with a reduced number of jurors (13).

		22 November 2016",2016-08-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2954556,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 55) [2016] NSWSC 1068,"Judgment


	
	This judgment exposes the reasons for a number of decisions made in the trial between Monday, 1 August 2016 and Wednesday, 3 August 2016. It also determines an application made by the learned Crown Prosecutor to restore the fixed glass or Perspex screen in front of the dock. All of the decisions made to this point, as well as the extant application by the Crown, arose out of an incident that occurred at 2-20pm on Monday, 1 August 2016.
	
	
	The incident involved two of the accused men (Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi) violently setting upon one of the other accused men (Mohammed Kalal). The incident was captured on the CCTV and a disk containing the footage captured by a camera located above the dock area was tendered on the voir dire as exhibit VD PPP. Having reviewed the CCTV footage, it appears that that the accused Mumtaz Qaumi attempted to use a pen as a weapon and struck a blow towards the upper body, neck or head of the accused Mohammed Kalal. He was almost immediately restrained by officers of the Department of Corrective Services. Jamil Qaumi followed Mumtaz Qaumi across the dock and, after Mumtaz Qaumi was removed, threw two or three punches at or towards the head of Mohammed Kalal. The accused Farhad Qaumi appeared not to be involved in the incident. While one of the Corrective Services Officers appeared to restrain him, he took no action in the course of the brief but violent confrontation. The accused Mohammad Zarshoy took little part in the incident. He was, and has been throughout the trial, sitting on the other side of Mohammad Kalal. It appeared towards the end of the incident that he may have attempted to kick Jamil Qaumi while the latter was being restrained by some of the Corrective Service officers.
	
	
	The incident occurred almost immediately upon the door being closed behind the jury and the Court Officer after the jury was permitted to disperse for the day and before a number of legal issues (objections to evidence) were to be ventilated. The timing of the incident, which took place in plain view of everybody in court including myself, appeared to be calculated to maximise the element of surprise while ensuring that the tribunal of fact was not present. While the incident was quelled quickly by the actions of Corrective Service officers (each of whom is to be commended for the promptness and courage of their actions) it was of an extremely violent and disturbing nature. A number of people in court, including myself, were shaken by it.
	


Background to the incident


	
	The background to the incident is somewhat complicated and, to a degree, unknowable. Animosity in the dock commenced earlier this year in the course of pre-trial hearings. At that stage there were six accused including a woman to whom I will refer as Witness M. In the first two months of the pre-trial hearings, Witness M moved around the dock, sitting with different accused, although she mostly sat with the Qaumi brothers. In the early weeks of the pre-trial hearing, all accused appeared to be getting on well together. At some stage after the summer break there seemed to be a rift between the various accused. After that, it seemed that Witness M mainly, or only, associated with Messrs Kalal and Zarshoy.
	
	
	On 12 February 2016 there was an incident in the dock which involved fighting between some of the accused. This occurred in my absence. After the accused were cleared from the dock, Corrective Services personnel located a razor blade: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 8) (Variation of Non-publication Orders) [2016] NSWSC 184 at [15] – [21].
	
	
	Subsequently, Witness M pleaded guilty and was sentenced for her involvement in various offences: R v AC (No 7) [2016] NSWSC 404. She became a Crown witness.
	
	
	Since then, and particularly since the empanelment of the jury in early April, the five remaining accused have sat in the same positions across the front row of the dock. The chairs in the dock are in two blocks separated by a small gap of about 1 metre. The dock is on the left hand side of the court room (looking from the back of the court towards the bench). The front of the dock runs perpendicular, more or less at a right angle, to the bench. All accused sit in the front row of the dock with a number of Corrective Services officers sitting in the rows behind them. Mr Zarshoy occupies the seat closest to the bench with Mr Kalal next to him. There is then the small gap. The three Quami brothers sit in three chairs on the other side of that gap. Mumtaz Qaumi is closest to, and – effectively, subject to that gap - next to Mr Kalal. Jamil and Farhad Qaumi sit in the next two seats.
	
	
	The accused Mohammad Kalal is mounting a defence of duress. This only became clear shortly before the empanelment of the jury: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 23) [2016] NSWSC 429; R v Qaumi & Ors (No 24) [2016] NSWSC 505. This involves adducing evidence of violence and intimidation perpetrated by or on behalf of the Qaumi Brothers, their leadership role in the group and specific threats allegedly made to him by the Qaumi brothers. The threats were said to have been uttered by Jamil and Farhad Qaumi but also in the presence of Mumtaz Qaumi. This has led to a degree of rancour, including (to an appropriate and understandable degree) between counsel, and to a number of legal issues, applications and objections: see, for example, R v Qaumi & Ors (No 39) [2016] NSWSC 797, R v Qaumi & Ors (No 42) [2016] NSWSC 887, R v Qaumi & Ors (No 43) [2016] NSWSC 889, R v Qaumi & Ors (No 44) [2016] NSWSC 936 and R v Qaumi & Ors (No 45) [2016] NSWSC 937.
	
	
	I have been made aware of a number of occasions when there has been harsh words exchanged between the accused. However, until Monday 1 August 2016, such actions had always taken place in my absence. When I entered the court after the short morning adjournment on 1 August 2016 there was shouting and abuse being exchanged by, seemingly, all of the accused. The shouting between Mumtaz Qaumi and Mohammad Kalal continued until I intervened. The transcript records me saying “everyone okay?” [1]  However the transcript does not record that those words were directed specifically to the accused who were in the process of shouting at one another.
	
	
	It is in that context that the incident that described above at [2] – [3] took place.
	


The First Decision: To proceed with legal argument in the absence of the accused on Monday 1 August 2016


	
	Immediately after the incident occurred the transcript records the following:
	


“IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURY

HIS HONOUR: It is 20 past 2.

CORRECTIVE SERVICES OFFICER: We will take them downstairs your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes. It is 20 past 2. There was an incident in the dock which we will discuss further in due course. At the moment the accused have left the courtroom and I propose to adjourn briefly. I will come back on at 2.30 probably in the absence of the accused.”


	
	On returning to the bench I received submissions as to whether it was possible or appropriate to continue with the legal argument in the absence of the accused. Counsel for each of the accused consented to continue with the legal argument that afternoon. [2] 
	
	
	All counsel agreed that the situation had been building up over some time. Counsel expressed the legitimate concern that bringing the accused back into the courtroom at that time would almost certainly result in further violence. All of the accused counsel accepted that it was appropriate to proceed to hear legal argument in the absence of the accused.
	
	
	Accordingly, with some misgivings based around decisions such as Jamal v R [2012] NSWCCA198 and Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 286, I accepted that it was appropriate to continue to hear legal argument for a short period in the absence of the accused. My reasons for taking that course included my concern over the smooth running of the trial, attempting to minimise the disruption to the jury, the personal safety of the accused, the personal safety of Corrective Services officers and the emotional well-being of those working in the court room who had been exposed to a brief, but extreme, moment of violence. I was guided by the sensible approach taken by experienced and diligent legal practitioners. It was important that the accused remained in the court complex and were available to counsel should instructions be required. That was unlikely because the detail and nature of the objections had been canvassed in the presence of the accused. The legal argument only concerned some of the accused and was relatively brief. [3]  No evidence was to be adduced and the jury was not present.
	


The Second Decision: To enclose the dock by putting in place a Perspex screen on 2 August 2016.


	
	The legal argument proceeded in the absence of the accused until around 4.30pm or so on 1 August 2016 and the matter was adjourned until 10.00am on 2 August 2016. Prior to arranging for the accused to be brought in court, I directed the officers of the Department of Corrective Services to put in place a Perspex screen which essentially creates an impenetrable, but transparent, wall between the dock and the courtroom. The courtroom in which the trial is taking place is purpose-built to allow for multiple accused in cases considered to involve security risks.
	
	
	Before the pre-trial hearings commenced in November last year, I was requested by the officers of the Department of Corrective Services to put the Perspex screen in place. I declined to accede to their request.
	
	
	After the incident on 12 February 2016, and the location of a razor blade in the dock, the question of putting the Perspex screen in place was revisited. Upon taking advice from one of the officers in charge of security in the dock, I determined to give the accused a further chance to conduct themselves in a civilised manner. I declined to order that the Perspex screen be put in place.
	
	
	Apart from some shouting, all of which has taken place in my absence, the accused have conducted themselves well for almost the entirety of the trial. I have previously commented on this: see, for example, R v Qaumi & Ors (No 8) at [20].
	
	
	However, having spoken to a number of people who (like me) were present in the courtroom at 2-20pm on 1 August 2016, I was aware that the violent confrontation that occurred at that time had caused distress to people working in the courtroom. Although there was no suggestion that the accused might attempt to leave the dock, the sound and sight of the violence was unnerving at best. I came to the view overnight that it was necessary, at least in the immediate term, to have the Perspex screen in place. I consulted counsel in chambers and put them on notice of my intention and invited submission as to whether the screen should remain in place for the remainder of the trial.
	


The third decision: To remove the screen when the jury, briefly entered, the courtroom on 2 August 2016


	
	The third matter that I had to decide was whether to have the Perspex screen removed for the purpose of allowing the jury to enter the courtroom and to disperse. It quickly became apparent on Tuesday, 2 August that the parties agreed that it was inappropriate to proceed with the jury trial that day. I accepted the assessment of counsel for the accused who had had the opportunity to test the temperature, as it were. It seemed that tempers were still running hot. In any event, there was a further, and potentially lengthy, legal argument to be considered and it appeared that the parties may reach some consensus in relation to large parts of the particular controversy: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 54) [2016] NSWSC 1067.
	
	
	Accordingly, it was necessary to have the jury into the courtroom to explain to them that they would not be hearing further evidence that day and allow them to disperse. Each of the accused mounted an argument that the Perspex screen should be removed at least for that purpose. I accepted their submissions that it was unlikely that the accused would engage in any violent or other reprehensible conduct in the presence of the jury. Any such conduct was likely to work adversely to their interests. I also took advice from the Corrective Services officer in charge of security.
	
	
	Accordingly I ordered or directed that the screen be removed when the jury returned to the court [4]  but, after the jury had dispersed, I directed the screen to be put back in place until I heard further argument as to what should happen for the remainder of the trial. [5] 
	
	
	The parties had fruitful discussions in relation to the remaining legal arguments and neither I nor the accused were in court during those discussions. The Court re-assembled shortly after 2.00pm. Over the course of the luncheon adjournment, I consulted the Corrective Services Officer in charge of security. He had spoken to each of the accused. As a result of that consultation, I determined to have the Perspex screen removed while four remaining legal arguments were mounted. [6] 
	


The fourth determination: To proceed briefly in the absence of the accused, to adjourn the trial and to build a barricade to separate the accused.


	
	On Wednesday 4 August 2016 a series of applications were made. The result was that I decided that it was necessary to build a wall within the dock area to separate two of the accused men from the other three. I also reserved my decision on an application by the Crown to put the Perspex barrier in front of the dock back in place. The accused were not present during these arguments and the jury was briefly brought into court and allowed to disperse until Monday 8 August 2016.
	
	
	Prior to Court, counsel asked to see me in chambers. By that stage (shortly before 10.00am) I understood that some or all of the accused had been brought into Court but then taken back to their cells. I was not told the reason for this but understand that animosity continued to be exhibited. I saw the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for each of the accused in chambers. I was requested to assemble the Court in the absence of the accused. Counsel for Messrs Zarshoy and Kalal indicated that their clients felt that they were not safe in the dock and intended to make an application that the trial not proceed until steps were taken to ensure their safety. All counsel agreed that the situation was such that the accused ought not to be brought into Court until the matter was resolved.
	
	
	It is necessary to observe that the change in approach between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning resulted from the fact that counsel had reviewed the in-court CCTV footage after the Court adjourned on Tuesday. It was only at that point that counsel realised that Mumtaz Qaumi appeared to have armed himself with a pen and attempted to use it as a “shiv”. This knowledge caused the parties, in particular, the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Zarshoy and Mr Kalal to reconsider their positions as to whether the trial could continue without further steps being taken to ensure the security of the participants.
	
	
	Again, I decided that it was necessary to proceed in the absence of the accused in order to take submissions as to how to proceed. Counsel for Mr Zarshoy and counsel for Mr Kalal made application to adjourn the trial to enable arrangements to be made which would ensure their client’s safety. [7]  Neither the Crown Prosecutor nor counsel for any of the three Qaumi brothers objected to this course.
	
	
	Since the incident occurred I have consulted with the Sheriff of New South Wales, the Sheriff Officer in Charge of Downing Centre Court complex, the Corrective Services officer in charge for the time being of security in the courtroom and other persons responsible for renovation of the courts and corrective services facilities.
	
	
	To ensure the physical safety of the accused and the emotional well being of those in the courtroom, it was clearly necessary to make some arrangement whereby the accused were separated into two groups. The alternatives were to attempt to set up an audio visual link (AVL), a kind of E-dock, or to create a physical barrier between the accused within the existing dock. Having consulted those responsible for facilitating and implementing those alternatives and taken the submissions of counsel, I concluded that the construction of the wall was the most practical and time effective solution.
	
	
	Using an AVL gave rise to a number of potential problems. Most importantly, it would be impossible on such short notice to guarantee that the facility was available all day, every day, for the remainder of the trial. The facility within the court complex is used in cases where child witnesses and other vulnerable persons give evidence from outside the courtroom. Those witnesses would, and ought properly to, take priority over the accused in the current trial. Use of the AVL facility was likely to give rise to significant delay in the trial. It was not clear that an alternative proposal of having an AVL to the gaol was feasible. Even if it were, the likelihood of technical glitches, or the unavailability of the facility from time to time, was likely to create delay and disruption to the proceedings. From whatever place the AVL was arranged, there would be practical difficulties in the legal practitioners consulting with their clients and there would be further difficulties if the accused elected to give evidence.
	
	
	Further, there was some debate about which accused should be in the courtroom and which should appear by AVL. Farhad Qaumi objected to being excluded from the courtroom. Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi objected to an AVL facility altogether and suggested that the appearance to the jury would be that some accused were being excluded for reasons that were not disclosed and that this may result in speculation that would give rise to unfairness. One possibility that was ventilated was that there be a rotation system in which Jamil and Mumtaz Qaumi and Messrs Zarshoy and Kalal appeared by AVL on alternating days. The egalitarian benefits of that option were outweighed by the practical difficulties to which it would give rise.
	
	
	Those responsible for the construction of the barricade assured me that the solution was feasible and that it was expected that the construction could be undertaken prior to Court commencing on Monday 8 August 2016.
	
	
	As the debate continued, all counsel agreed that the jury should be sent away until the matter was resolved. This meant that the jury would enter the courtroom in the absence of the accused for the first time. Consensus was reached as to what the jury should be told. The jury was allowed to disburse with the following directions:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Thank you once again for your patience, members of the jury. If you look across the courtroom, you will notice that the accused are not present here today. Other than in extreme circumstances that do not arise in this case, a criminal trial cannot proceed in the absence of the accused. Accordingly, once again, I am going to ask you to disperse.

For reasons that are not in any way relevant to the ultimate decision that you have to make, your deliberations or your verdicts, I have made certain decisions and given certain directions over the last couple of days and this morning about the configuration of the courtroom. You will see when you return the physical result of that.

However, carrying out the directions that I have made and will make is going to take a little time. The best estimate I am getting at the moment is a couple of days. I was being optimistic and hoping we could resume on Friday but realistically we won't be able to resume until Monday.

For that reason, I am going to allow you or ask you to disperse now with a view to returning and resuming the trial on Monday. I will, of course, recommend that you get paid for each and every day because obviously none of this is in any sense your fault.

I remind you of the directions I have given to you throughout the trial. Apart from the directions to which I have just referred, we have also in the last couple of days cleared out all of the remaining legal arguments touch wood and it is likely that the Crown case will proceed uninterrupted from when we resume, hopefully on Monday – I will [knock on wood] again – until Wednesday when the Crown case will conclude. There will, as I have anticipated, then probably be another gap where you will be asked to disperse for a few days but by that stage at least the Crown case will have come to its end.

So thank you once again for your attendance today and I will simply ask you to go with the court officer and look forward to seeing you on Monday. Thank you.” [8] 


	
	After the jury was sent away until Monday 8 August 2016, I accepted that the application by the accused Zarshoy and Kalal should be granted. Having considered all alternatives, I concluded that the least disruptive, fairest and most effective option was to direct that a barrier be constructed that separated Messrs Kalal and Zarshoy from the three Qaumi brothers. Accordingly, I made the following direction:
	


“I direct that the Sheriff of New South Wales, in conjunction with the Department of Corrective Services, erect a barricade or wall within the dock area in Court 3.2 of the Downing Centre so as to separate the dock into two separate spaces.”

Application to enclose dock with the Perspex barrier for the remainder of the trial


	
	The Crown Prosecutor applied to have the Perspex barrier that separates the dock from the courtroom reinstated for the remainder of the trial. Each of the accused opposed that course. I heard arguments and reserved my decision.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the conduct of the accused on Monday represented a substantial escalation in hostility that had been simmering and building over the last weeks and months. It was put that the security of the court and the safety and psychological well-being in of the participants was a priority. While the Crown supported the erection of the barrier to separate the accused, it was put that this may mean that the accused might attempt to leave the dock. Further, it was suggested that one or more of the accused might conduct themselves in such a way as to cause the trial to miscarry. The Crown relied on parts of a statement of Detective Inspector Browne dated 20 April 2014 in which there is evidence that the accused (Mumtaz Qaumi) said that he “wanted to delay the proceedings as long as possible” and that the prosecution would “lose some of its ‘roll over’ witnesses if he can delay it long enough.”
	
	
	The Crown relied on other evidence given in the trial and pre-trial hearing that supported the proposition that the accused, individually and collectively, were violent and dangerous men. There have been reports of threats to witnesses, investigators and other accused. In the courtroom, but in my absence, threats and abuse have been directed to police officers from the dock. I have observed some, albeit minimal, interaction between the accused and some of the informant witnesses. The violence that occurred on Monday in the presence of a judge and in the knowledge that the courtroom is monitored by CCTV cameras demonstrated that the trial has reached a point where the misconduct of the accused is escalating and unpredictable. The Crown also submitted that certain people in the courtroom would be trapped and have nowhere to flee if the accused left the dock. Although this thought was not articulated with more specificity, I take this to be a reference to the Court Officer, my Associate and the two Court Reporters. They sit immediately in front of me and the only exit from that location is via the well of the courtroom or via the bench, with access to those exits from a space around two metres from the front of the dock.
	
	
	Counsel for each of the accused opposed the reinstatement of the Perspex screen. It was submitted that the screen would give the impression that the accused were dangerous men and that the jury may become fearful of the accused and think that they (the members of the jury) are not safe in the courtroom unless the accused are locked in a Perspex box. This would add a layer of prejudice that is inimical to the fairness of the trial. Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi made the point that the threats to delay the trial and the veiled threat to influence the witnesses (or worse) “have never come to fruition” and were “consistent with examples of grandiose comments that are more in the nature of hot air.”
	
	
	There are at least two cases in Australia where similar applications arose. In each of those cases, the application was for a screen to be removed rather than for one to be introduced after an incident of violence. Each of the cases was a terrorism trial.
	
	
	In Regina (C'Wealth) v Baladjam & Ors [No 41] [2008] NSWSC 1462 Whealy J said:
	
	
	74 My general view is that the presence of the fixed screen will make it more difficult for the accused to get a fair trial. I consider that the sense will inevitably be conveyed to a jury of 15 that these men do represent in fact a risk to the community, to people in the courtroom and perhaps to national security itself. The screen plainly separates them from the jury and everybody else in the courtroom. Images of other trials in far distant countries will inevitably present themselves to members of the jury when they first see the situation of the accused behind a fixed screen. The problem caused by the presence of the fixed screen will be exacerbated by the secondary problems arising from the difficulty of communication between client and lawyer. This will inevitably lead to an observation by the jury that, on a very regular basis, communication is significantly limited by the presence of the screen. Observations of this kind are likely to feed into the overall sense, principally caused by the presence of the screen, that these are dangerous people.
	
	
	78 In my opinion, the presence of the glass screen is but one more layer of prejudice (perhaps one that is more significant than any of the others), and it is an aspect of prejudice that can be avoided altogether by relatively simple and comparatively inexpensive means.
	
	
	In R v Benbrika & Ors (Ruling No 12) 2007 VSC 524, Bongiorno J said (at [28]):
	
	
	“As far as the screens themselves are concerned, I am satisfied that they have the effect contended for by Mr McMahon. They cut the accused off from the courtroom in such a way as to render the accuseds' presence hardly more real than if they appeared by a video link. The presence of the computer monitors also does not assist in this regard, although it is really the Perspex screens themselves, which create the effect. Although I am satisfied that the accused can generally hear the proceedings going on in the courtroom, their capacity to communicate with each other is severely restricted and they cannot communicate with their lawyers unless those lawyers actually enter the dock area. As far as the presence of the prison officers is concerned, the perception created by such a large number of them is that the accused are people who warrant being guarded in such a fashion to prevent their escape or to prevent other undesirable activity.”
	
	
	In Baladjam, Whealey J referred to the judgment of Bongiorno J at paragraph [33]:
	
	
	“Bongiorno J held that the situation was such as to materially diminish the accuseds' right to the presumption of innocence. His Honour considered that the situation could only be improved by the removal of the Perspex screen surrounding the dock and by a restriction of the number of uniformed prison officers in the courtroom at any one time.”
	
	
	While I agree with the sentiments expressed by both Whealy J and Bongionro J, those cases involved applications at the commencement of a trial. There had been no incidents of actual violence. That is a significant feature that distinguishes those cases from the circumstances with which I am now confronted. In this case, there have been two significant incidents of violence within the dock. There have also been occasional incidents of verbal abuse between the accused as well as abuse shouted from the dock to people in the back of the Court.
	
	
	It is true that the incidents have been intermittent and that the occasions of actual violence were separated by a period of over four months. It is also true that opinions offered in affidavits filed on behalf of the Police Commissioner that that the accused would intimidate informant witnesses did not come to pass. Contrary to the evidence received on those earlier applications, the accused have generally behaved well. However, their behaviour has been far from perfect and I accept the Crown’s submission that the most recent incident represents an escalation of violence that warrants serious consideration of the appropriate steps to protect the process and the participants in the courtroom.
	
	
	To this point, there has been no suggestion that the accused would attempt to leave the dock or to escape. Given the security in and around the court complex any attempt to escape would appear to be destined to fail.
	
	
	In terms of the physical protection of the Court Reporters, Court Officers and my Associate, I liaised with Corrective Services officers immediately after the incident. Since that time there has been an officer sitting between the dock and the entrance to the area where my Associate, the Court Reporters and Court Officer are located. That situation will prevail until the conclusion of the trial.
	
	
	As to the suggestion that the accused may attempt to cause the trial to miscarry, a number of observations may be made. The first is that the accused’s behaviour to this point in the trial gives no indication of such an intention. The incident that gives rise to the current application occurred in the absence of the jury. The second observation is that any violence or misbehaviour emanating from the accused at this stage of the trial is unlikely to result in a discharge of the jury. Any application would be treated seriously and on its merit but a calculated attempt to cause the trial to miscarry is unlikely to succeed. The third observation is that it is difficult to perceive any rational motive in the accused to attempt to abort the trial at this stage. The trial is delicately poised and there have been successful attacks on the credibility of critical witnesses. Misbehaviour in front of the jury may diminish the prospect of the accused achieving an acquittal on some or all of the charges. While I accept that the accused’s behaviour is unpredictable and that the trial has reached a point where stress and tension may override rational thought, I do not consider that it is likely that the accused will deliberately try to abort the trial. In any event, even if one or more of the accused became determined to disrupt the proceedings, the Perspex screen will do little to prevent them from attempting to do so.
	
	
	Like Whealy J and Bongiorno J, I am troubled by the appearance that the accused are so dangerous that they are required to be confined in the courtroom behind an impenetrable Perspex wall. I am concerned that this may give rise to a deal of prejudice to the jury. While direction could probably cure any such prejudice I have decided that, for the time being and dependent on the accused’s conduct, the Perspex barrier will be removed while the jury is presence.
	
	
	However, such considerations do not arise when the jury is not present. I propose to direct the Corrective Services officers to enclose the dock with the Perspex screen whenever the jury is not in the courtroom. This will create no prejudice to the accused and will ensure that those in the courtroom are not again exposed to any repeat of the violence that disrupted the proceedings last Monday.
	
	
	For those reasons I make the following orders:
	



	
	Direct that the Perspex screen in front of the dock be closed when the jury is not present in the courtroom.
	
	
	Direct that the Perspex screen in front of the dock be open when the jury is present.

		22 November 2016",2016-08-07 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2954557,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 41) [2016] NSWSC 857,"Judgment


	
	On 22-23 June 2016, the prosecution made an application under s 53B of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) seeking an order that one particular juror be discharged. The basis of the application is that provided for by ss 53B(b) and (d) of the Jury Act. I refused the application. These are my reasons.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in the individual juror. Simply put, the Crown’s application was based on observations made by a number of participants in the trial that, from time to time, the particular juror has smiled at one or more of the accused and that the accused have smiled at her. At first blush, that is not a particularly compelling basis upon which to assert that the juror is demonstrating behaviour that might cause an objective observer of the proceedings to believe that she (the juror) might not bring an impartial mind to bear upon the issues in the trial. However, the evidence that I accept demonstrates that the interactions between the juror and the accused have occurred on a number of occasions over the last several weeks of the trial.
	
	
	Four of the accused (Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi, Jamil Qaumi and Mohammad Zarshoy) oppose the application for the discharge of the particular juror. The fifth accused (Mohammad Kalal) does not oppose the application. In argument, he actively joined in and supported the application.
	
	
	A second aspect of the application was based on the contention that it appeared that there is another reason “affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror”: s 53B(d). That other reason is that an inference is available that the juror disobeyed directions that she should not to discuss the case with a juror who was discharged under s 53B(b) on 6 June 2016 (“the discharged juror”): see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 36) [2016] NSWSC 718.
	
	
	However, in spite of the suggestion that the juror may have disobeyed directions, the Crown did not assert that the juror had engaged in misconduct that would result in her mandatory discharge pursuant to s 53A of the Jury Act.
	
	
	It is not necessary to set out the principles that apply when an application such as the present is made. Those principles are set out in a little detail in the judgment known as R v Qaumi & Ors (No 36). In that judgment, I explained my reasons for granting a similar application by the Crown (strongly opposed by all five of the accused) for the discharge of an individual juror who the evidence demonstrated had some acquaintanceship with a future witness. The principles applying to assertions of apprehended bias are set out at [53]-[70]. I will not repeat the analysis of section and relevant cases here but the reader should be aware that I applied those principles to the resolution of the present application.
	
	
	I accept, based on transcripts provided by the learned Crown Prosecutor, that there have been at least two previous occasions in New South Wales where a juror has been discharged because of behaviour in court considered to be inappropriate. On one occasion a District Court Judge discharged a juror because the evidence supported a finding that the behaviour of the juror was considered to be flirtatious. It involved smiling, nodding and flicking of the juror’s hair. The conduct seemed to emanate from the juror herself. On the other occasion there was a joint (or unopposed) application for the discharge of a juror at the very outset of a murder trial in the Supreme Court. I will not refer to the names of those cases because there appears to be a question mark over whether non-publication orders were made or remain in force. The reasons for Judgment were not provided in either case. However, I accepted that the existence of such cases demonstrates the correctness of my observation earlier in the trial that there is a line to be drawn between “conduct that would justify a discharge and conduct that would not”. [1] 
	
	
	On the other hand, I also accepted the submissions of extremely experienced counsel (Mr Stratton SC, Mr Young SC and Mr Driels) that applications based on matters such as these are exceedingly rare. I do not understand the Crown Prosecutor to gainsay that proposition.
	
	
	I have already referred to “the discharged juror”. To understand what follows, I will identify by description the three jurors who were mentioned in the evidence. The first juror is the subject of the present application. I will refer to her as the “young juror” because it appears that she is the youngest of the female jurors. The second juror has changed the colour of her hair during the course of the trial. I will refer to her as the “juror with different coloured hair”. The third juror wears a “Boston” [Red Sox] jacket from time to time. I will refer to her as the “Red Sox juror”.
	
	
	Pursuant to an order made under s 19(2) of the Jury Act, a jury of fifteen was empanelled. The trial has been proceeding for around 12 weeks. The arguments on the present application were made on 23 June 2016, being the 52nd day of the trial. On the 38th day of the trial the discharged juror was discharged. Prior to that the four jurors described above sat in the back row (of two rows) in the four seats closest to the public gallery. The discharged juror sat between the young juror and the juror with different coloured hair. Since the discharged juror was released, the Red Sox juror has moved one seat closer to the public gallery. This means that the three jurors are sitting in the back row in the three seats closest to public gallery. The juror with different coloured hair occupies the seat closest to the public gallery, the young juror sits next to her and the Red Sox juror sits in the third seat from the gallery.
	
	
	The remaining eleven jurors generally sit in the same places although there has been some movement from time to time. In particular, the jury seems to have a rotation system in relation to their representative or foreperson. Every two weeks or so a different juror enters the court room last and takes the position in the front row closest to the bench.
	
	
	In the process of determining that the discharged juror should be discharged it emerged in evidence that she had become “Facebook friends” with three or four of her fellow jurors. At that stage, it was not suggested that the jury should be prohibited from having contact with the discharged juror although the jury was reminded that she had become a person with whom they could not speak about the case.
	


Evidence and other material leading to the application that the young Juror be discharged


	
	The application has its genesis in observations that were first brought to my attention on 24 May 2016 when the Crown Prosecutor asked that I direct the Sheriff to maintain and download a copy of the in-court CCTV footage because somebody in the prosecution team had noticed what they believed to be flirtatious behaviour between two of the accused (Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi) and two or three members of the jury. [2]  I so directed the Sheriff. The downloading was a time consuming exercise and the CCTV footage was provided to me on a hard drive on 8 June 2016. I notified the parties of its arrival and the disc was marked for identification. [3]  The Crown did not seek access to the hard drive until 24 June 2016 [4]  and does not rely on any material captured on the court CCTV footage in the present application.
	
	
	However it does rely on observations made by a senior DPP solicitor  who is instructing the Crown Prosecutors. Earlier in the trial, at the request of counsel for the accused, the senior DPP solicitor provided particulars of the conduct which prompted the application to obtain the in-court CCTV footage. Farhad Qaumi tendered this document on the Crown’s application to discharge the discharged juror. [5]  The basis upon which the document was tendered on that application was that it was suggested that it demonstrated an improper purpose in the Crown’s application. It was submitted that the true motivation for seeking the discharged juror was to rid the jury of any juror who showed any empathy to the accused. [6]  A similar submission was made in the course of the present application. It is unnecessary to deal with the submission further other than to say that I do not accept that the Crown’s applications were based on an improper purpose.
	
	
	In any event, the senior DPP solicitor's particulars were before me as part of the evidence upon which the current application was based. The senior DPP solicitor gave evidence and confirmed that the note reflected her observations on 17 May 2016 and 23 May 2016. The note is in the following terms:
	


“17 May 2016

11:50 FQ smiling and looking side on towards the corner of the jury.

Look over to women in back row on the right. Lady with coloured hair was smiling at him and then looking down shyly, the lady with dark long hair next to her was smiling at him as well.

Looked at Farhad, and he noticed that I was watching him. He immediately changed his facial expression and focused on the witness.

12:10 Lady in white hooded jumper, 3rd from right smiling and looking at Farhad Qaumi.

12:29 Farhad Qaumi smiling and pursing his lips while looking at the three women. Whispers something to his brothers who all turn and look at the 3 women. Mumtaz Qaumi looks over at the women and smiles.

12:31 Farhad smiling and looking down, making eye contact with jurors and then looking away (appears to be flirtatious??), hiding behind his hand. Mumtaz smiling at the three jurors in the back right of the jury.

12:34 lady with coloured hair speaking to lady next to her, looking at Farhad, smiling at him and then pulling map up to hide face (map just been tendered as exhibit)

2:37 girl in white hoody (3rd from right) smiling at Farhad

2:51 Farhad Qaumi smiling and looking at corner where 3 women are. Says something to Jamil and he looks over as well.

3:12: Farhad bit his lip and lifted his head up to nod at the back right corner of the jury box whilst making eye contact with one of the female jurors in the right back corner.

3:12 Farhad smiling and leaning head on closed fist looking sideways at jury (back right corner again)

3:19 smiling at jury (Farhad)

23 May 2016

12:29 3rd girl from right in back row smiled in direction of FQ 3:30 girl third from right back biting right index finger and looking at Qaumis 3:07: Farhad pushing tongue against side of mouth and looking at girls Mumtaz smiles at girls when leave room.”


	
	The references to the juror in the white hooded jumper and to the “3rd girl from right in back row” are references to the young juror. These observations occurred before the discharge of the discharged juror.
	
	
	Statements of four police officers of their observations on various days were also tendered on the voir dire. [7]  Each officer also gave evidence.
	
	
	Detective Inspector Marks referred to an incident on 9 May 2015 when he saw two female jurors smile in the direction of Farhad Qaumi, who also smiled back and raised his eyebrows. Detective Inspector Marks believed the interaction to be “a little inappropriate”. On returning to his office he made a note of the incident. His observation related to the discharged juror and the juror with different coloured hair. They did not relate to the young juror.
	
	
	Detective Inspector Patton also referred to an incident involving the juror with different coloured hair. He has been in and out of the court room since he gave evidence on 17 May 2016. Since the discharge of the discharged juror he had not noticed any conduct on the part of the juror with the different coloured hair. However, he has observed the young juror smile and look in the vicinity of the accused on not less than six occasions. On all but one of those occasions he observed that Mumtaz Qaumi was looking towards the jury box smiling. His observation is that this has occurred on occasions when the jury enters the court.
	
	
	Detective Senior Constable Veness gave evidence that she saw the young juror smile and look in the vicinity of the accused Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi between 10.30 and 10.33am on Monday, 20 June 2016. She observed Jamil Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi to be smiling at the same time. She made a note and informed the senior DPP solicitor. Shortly after 10.00am on 21 June 2016 she saw the same juror “staring in the direction of the Qaumi brothers and smile”. She said that the smile was brief but the juror continued to look in the direction of the dock for about 20 seconds. She spoke to Inspector Brown about the incident, and he said that he had observed Mumtaz Qaumi smiling back at the juror. Both detectives made notes of the incident.
	
	
	Detectives Inspector Brown also gave evidence of his observations of that incident on 21 June 2016.
	
	
	During the course of a judgment in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 36) I noted the suggestion of interaction between two of the accused and some members of the jury and said “I have not observed any interaction that I consider to be inappropriate or improper”. However, on 14 June 2016 I advised the parties as follows:
	


“I just wanted to let counsel know that it came to my attention that there was an interaction between the accused Farhad Qaumi and two members of the jury this morning when the jury first came into the courtroom. I then observed both the jury and the dock. At some time around 5 past 10 or 10 past 10, I observed what I would describe merely as smiling between Farhad Qaumi and one of the members of the jury. That is why I viewed the CCTV footage at lunch time.

The only view that I observed [on the CCTV footage] was one angle of the dock. There is more than one. There are other angles showing the jury box. I have not observed those.

The footage that I observed is insufficiently clear in terms of the direction in which Mr Qaumi is facing at various relevant times. I would rely on my own observations. Those observations are not sufficient to warrant a discharge of the individual juror, although there is probably a fine line between what conduct would justify such a discharge and what would not.

I raise it, obviously enough, in the context of the concerns that have been raised by the Crown Prosecutor in the description of behaviour as flirtatious. I simply raise that for counsel's consideration.” [8] 


	
	The matter came to a head when the discharged juror attended court and sat in the public gallery on Wednesday 22 June 2016. She arrived shortly before the scheduled luncheon adjournment and immediately before rising I said:
	


“I observe, for no other reason than to bring it to everyone’s attention, that our discharged juror has joined us this afternoon and is in the back of the court.”


	
	In addition to the evidence to which I have already referred, Inspector Browne gave evidence of observing the discharged juror smile in the direction of both the jury box and the dock.
	
	
	Detective Veness gave evidence of observations that she made at traffic lights near the court complex during the luncheon adjournment. She saw the discharged juror and the young juror together. She observed them together for around thirty seconds.
	
	
	The senior DPP solicitor also gave evidence of seeing the discharged juror with the young juror on the street near the court complex during the luncheon adjournment. She noticed that the Red Sox juror and the juror with different coloured hair were very close-by – perhaps no more than 1 metre. It appeared to the senior DPP solicitor that the four women were all together. The senior DPP solicitor was close enough at one stage to hear a snippet of a conversation. She immediately recorded it as a note on her mobile telephone. The note was made at 1.22pm. The note recorded what she heard the young juror say:
	


“Yep, and I looked over and he smiled at me so I smiled back.”


	
	I should interpolate here that when the juror was discharged, an issue arose as to whether those members of the jury who had become friends (or at least “Facebook friends”) could maintain contact with the discharge juror. The parties agreed that there was no need to prohibit contact altogether provided that there was no discussion of the case. Accordingly, the jury was directed that while they could have contact with the discharged juror, they could not talk about the case with her. [9]  The significance of this is that the meeting between three of the jurors and the discharged juror was not a breach of any direction. However, the Crown submits that I would infer that the words heard by the senior DPP solicitor related to smiling at one of the Qaumi brothers and that this may have indicated a disregard for the directions not to discuss the case.
	
	
	To complete this survey of the factual material upon which the application was based, it is necessary to refer to two matters that were brought to my attention in chambers and then shared with the parties. First, the Court Officer provided an account of observations that he made. I disclosed this information to the parties as follows:
	


“HIS HONOUR: It has been brought to my attention by my associate that the court officer wanted to speak to me after this issue arose. I think I need now to tell you what he said and then seek your submissions as to how I should deal with it.

What he told me concerned his own observations. The first concerned something that happened at morning tea today when he saw two jurors sitting in the back row in the furthest seats from me smiling and laughing and saw, when he turned to the dock, Jamil Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi smiling and laughing at more or less the same time. He then noticed that the learned Crown Prosecutor and his junior were at that time looking at the jury.

On 15 June at 11.49am according to the note he took at the time, he saw the juror second from the end in the back row smiling and Farhad Qaumi smiling at the same time. His impression was they may have been smiling at one another.

At 12 noon on the same day, he observed the same juror smiling from time to time, especially when the person he describes as the ""lady homicide police officer"" attended the courtroom.

At 12.20 ‑ I think this may have been in the cross‑examination of Mr Driels ‑ because when the words ""you were a dog"" were uttered, he observed the same juror and Farhad Qaumi smiling at about the same time.

He hastened to say in respect of each of those observations that they were fleeting moments. He also told me, although I suspect it is irrelevant but I should tell you what he has told me, that on 20 June in the jury deliberation area, he was asked by one of the female jurors, and he cannot say which, whether or not it would be possible to have their telephones during the longest morning tea adjournment of the week and that was a request that he denied.

He also asked me if I wanted information about his observations in the jury room which I take to mean when he is taking them to and from the jury room and I said that I did not. I just thought I should bring that to your attention. We are not going to sit much longer today but I am just not sure what I should do in terms of dealing with what is information that has come to my attention which is obviously relevant to the kinds of things that I have heard evidence about this afternoon. I will simply leave that to you to consider.” [10] 


	
	Finally, I drew to the party’s attention the fact that I was informed by one of the Corrective Services Officers that other officers had observed the group of jurors at lunch at a local restaurant. [11] 
	


CROSS-EXAMINATION AND FINDINGS


	
	Counsel for the accused cross-examined the senior DPP solicitor and each of the police officers. That cross-examination appeared to be designed to achieve at least three purposes.
	
	
	First, counsel sought to establish that the layout of the court room, the positioning of the dock and the jury box relative to the seats from which various observations were made, meant that the observations of the police officers either could not have been made or their view must have been obscured to some degree. As a result of that cross-examination, I undertook what was described as the “shortest view in the history of the Supreme Court”. I sat in a number of the seats from which observations had been made. In doing so, I announced from the back of the court which of the accused I could see, and whether I could observe the three jurors (three of the legal practitioners having volunteered to sit in the position in the jury box where the three jurors have been sitting for most of the trial). [12] 
	
	
	Having undertaken that view, I was satisfied that each of the police officers was in a position to make the observations in relation to which they have given evidence. While they may not have been able to see all of the accused at all times, I was satisfied that the observations to which the police officers attested were capable of being made in spite of layout of the court room and various obstacles that exist. I believe that those observations were made.
	
	
	The second objective of the cross-examination was to undermine the objectivity of the witnesses. It was suggested – at least implicitly, and in some cases directly – that the witnesses were biased and inclined to give evidence that suggested either misconduct or (the appearance of) a lack of objectivity on the part of the juror because that was the position that suited the police and prosecution purpose. That purpose, as put by Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi, involved an attempt “to eliminate from the jury any member of that jury who seems to be showing some empathy towards the accused”. [13] 
	
	
	While there was nothing inappropriate or improper in that cross-examination, I was satisfied that the implication behind the cross examination and the submissions that followed should be rejected. I found the evidence of each of the witnesses to be straightforward and clear. I did not get any sense that they were exaggerating what they saw. I accept that each of the witnesses made the observations of which they gave evidence. I also accept that they were genuinely concerned about the propriety or appropriateness of the interactions that they observed.
	
	
	However, I accepted that the perceptions of the significance of the interactions may be coloured, unwittingly and sub-consciously, by the interest that the observer has in the case. This is not a criticism. Rather, it is a consequence of human nature.
	
	
	To take that matter one step closer to the decision that I was called upon to make, the objective, fair-minded observer of the proceedings is disinterested in the outcome of the proceedings. That person might observe a juror smiling in the direction of the dock or at one of the accused but, unlike a police officer who has spent many hours investigating the case and putting together a 50,000 page brief, not consider the interaction to be inappropriate. Similarly, what may be perceived as “flirtatious” to an interested party might be considered nothing more than ordinary human interaction by the disinterested, fair-minded observer of the proceedings.
	
	
	I accept the observations of the various witnesses, which align with observations that I have made and also observations that the court officer has made. I accept that there have been a number of occasions where one or two of the female jurors have smiled in the direction of the accused and that the accused have smiled at them. Specifically, and relevant to the application that she be discharged for apprehended bias or on similar grounds, I accept that the young juror has smiled at one or other of the Qaumi brothers on something like six occasions in the last six to eight weeks of the trial.
	
	
	I also accepted the senior DPP solicitor’s observations, noted in Ex VD 36, as to the conduct of Farhad Qaumi. This included observations that he was “pursing his lips”, biting his lip and “pushing his tongue against the side of his mouth”. Those specific observations occurred at 12.29pm and 3.12pm on 17 May 2016 and at 3.07pm on 23 May 2016. It is difficult to know the correct inference to be drawn from such conduct without knowing what was happening at the time of the action. Even if I accept (as I am inclined to do) that the accused’s conduct is inappropriate, the fair-minded observer would not rationally conclude that this impacts upon the objectivity of the jury or any individual juror. Similarly, I accept that the senior DPP solicitor observed the young juror apparently “biting [her] right index finger” but I am unable to draw any conclusion from that action.
	
	
	This brings me to the third purpose of the cross-examination. That purpose was to undermine the suggestion that what the witnesses observed – that is, for the most part, smiling – constituted flirting or was otherwise inappropriate to a degree that the juror’s capacity to judge the case impartially might be considered (by the fair-minded observer) to be compromised. To put it as basally as did Mr Young SC while cross-examining Ms Veness on behalf of Mumtaz Qaumi:
	


“What is wrong with smiling?” [14] 


	
	I accept that each of the police officers who observed the smiling between the juror and the accused was concerned that the conduct may be inappropriate or formed the opinion that the conduct was inappropriate. I have no doubt about the good faith with which each acted.
	
	
	I make the same finding with respect to the material provided by the senior DPP solicitor. I accept her evidence without reservation and reject the implication in the cross-examination that her position as a solicitor appearing for the prosecution in the trial manifested itself in a biased account. I accept that the words she recorded on her telephone were the words that she heard, in spite of submissions that the street was busy and noisy. I accept that she has been, and remains, an astute observer of the proceedings – as she put it, “I watch everyone in the court room.” [15]  I note that her notes of the events of 17 May 2016 included “appears to be flirtatious??” [16]  The qualification on this observation provided by the question marks demonstrates both the integrity of the senior DPP solicitor's observations and also the fact that interpreting human interactions is fraught with difficulties and speculation.
	


A REASONABLE APPREHENSION OF BIAS?


	
	It is one thing to observe some human interaction between the accused and a juror (or for that matter between a witness or victim and a juror). It is another thing to conclude that a fair-minded observer of the proceedings might consider that the interaction is such that it might influence the juror in their final assessment of whether or not the accused is guilty of a crime as serious as murder, shooting with intent to murder and other extremely serious crimes.
	
	
	I am unable to accept that the fair-minded lay observer might come to that conclusion. The fair-minded observer would be aware that the trial has been proceeding for around 12 weeks with the jurors and the accused in relatively close proximity to one another and situated in such a way that their point of view or gaze is inevitably in the direction of one another. The fair-minded observer would know that there have been occasions of some levity in the course of the evidence. The observer would take into account that the juror who is subject of this application appears to be very young and, perhaps, a little bit silly. Her conduct may be the result of nervousness or shyness. She may return a smile to be polite. I am unable to conclude the fair-minded observer of the proceedings might, objectively and reasonably, conclude that the interactions are such that her impartiality might be compromised.
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor accepted in argument that it would not be appropriate to discharge an individual juror if a trial Judge observed a juror to scowl at the accused from time to time during the course of a trial of serious allegations of violence. It is common for jurors to display emotional reactions to evidence given in criminal trials. In the past, I have observed jurors to cry in the course of a victim’s evidence. I am aware that in a recent trial in the District Court a male juror was physically sick listening to the details of evidence of significant and distressing child sexual abuse. In each of those situations, ambitious counsel might argue on behalf of an accused person that the individual juror should be discharged. In one famous case a juror gave flowers to a relative of a homicide victim part way through a murder trial: see Webb and Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41. The High Court was satisfied that the irregularity could be cured by direction.
	
	
	Based on the transcript of proceedings (but without the benefit of the published judgment) I am aware that Judge Berman SC discharged an individual juror for what was perceived to be flirting between the accused and the juror, or perhaps more accurately flirting by the juror directed towards the accused. However, the observations that I have made and the evidence that I accepted did not satisfy me that there has been any conduct that could reasonably be described as flirtatious in any real or meaningful way.
	
	
	There have been occasions in the course of the trial when I have observed a juror or jurors look in the direction of the dock in such a way that a fair-minded observer might consider to be judgmental or stern. Should I discharge that juror on the grounds of apprehended bias?
	


THE POSITION TAKEN BY THE ACCUSED KALAL


	
	An important consideration is the position taken on behalf of the accused Mohammed Kalal. Mr Kalal did not initiate the application. However, once the matter was raised by the Crown, counsel for Mr Kalal indicated that he did not oppose the Crown’s application and, when pressed, indicated that he supported it. [17]  Rather poetically, Mr Clarke posed the question “what is in a smile?” and answered “it is a nothingness” but went on to submit that the problem is that the smiling is “persistent”. [18] 
	
	
	He emphasised the fact that there is no evidence that the juror ever smiled at Mr Kalal and reminded me that his client’s interests are different to those of the Qaumi brothers. Indeed, those interests are largely inimical to one another. Mr Kalal is running a case that includes a defence of duress and that involves disputed evidence of whether two of the Qaumi brothers made threats to him. If a juror is displaying a positive predisposition towards the Qaumi brothers, it is a “bad look” and “bad news for [Mr Kalal].” [19]  Mr Clarke submitted that the juror “has shown her hand already” and that a single smile in isolation would not be an issue but the persistent conduct suggested “engagement” and a “relationship developing”. [20] 
	
	
	Ultimately, it was submitted that the “positive predisposition” displayed towards the Qaumi brothers might lead the person sitting in the back of the court to conclude that the juror might not be able to give balanced consideration to the defence of provocation, particularly “if it becomes appropriate that there is a defence case”. [21] 
	


APPREHENDED BIAS: CONCLUSION


	
	The question is whether the fair-minded observer might conclude that the juror might not bring an impartial mind to a determination of the issues in the trial: Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; 201 CLR 488 at [11]. The possibility of a lack of impartiality must be real and not remote: Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; 205 CLR 337 at [7]. This involves two steps: an identification of the factors that might lead the tribunal to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits and an assessment of the reasonableness of the connection between the matter and the possibility of departure from impartial decision-making: Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy at [8]; CUR24 v DPP [2012] NSWCA 65 at [35].
	
	
	In the present case, the relevant factor is the interaction between the juror and the accused as the case proceeds. However, “there is no requirement for decision makers to be completely impassive or non-responsive during a hearing”: Avery v Registrar of Briths Deaths and Marriages (No 2) [2014] NSWCATAP 43 citing Johnson v Johnson at [13]. In that case, the suggestion that a decision maker had made eye contact and smiled at one of the parties was not sufficient to establish actual or apprehended bias.
	
	
	I do not accept that the smiling and other conduct of the juror, even if it is properly described as persistent and directed to two (or three) of the accused, provides a reasonable connection to the issues upon which the jury must make decisions. Nor do I accept that the fair minded observer might conclude that the juror might not apply an impartial mind to the questions that will be decided in the deliberations at the end of the trial. Those questions are of the utmost seriousness. They include whether three of the accused (the Qaumi brothers) acted reasonably in self defence (or defence of another) by being involved in the shooting of Mohammed Hamzy, whether those three accused were involved in directing the activities of other member of the Brother for Life Blacktown in carrying out subsequent shootings against a rival chapter of the Brothers for Life and whether the violent actions and threats of two of those three accused operated to cause Mr Kalal to act under duress by participating in two of the shootings.
	
	
	The fair minded observer would be conscious of the seriousness of those issues and aware of the directions that the jury has received, and will receive, as to the requirement to put aside emotions and to decide the case on the evidence in spite of any sympathy or prejudice created by the circumstances and the evidence.
	
	
	I am not persuaded that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias in relation to the case between the Crown and the accused or in relation to the issue of duress that arises in the case of Mr Kalal.
	


THE CONDUCT OF THE ACCUSED


	
	The focus of attention has been on the conduct of the juror. However, her conduct involved interactions with two or three of the accused (Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi). Accordingly, their conduct has also been subject of evidence and the consideration of whether the juror should be discharged.
	
	
	I have commented on a number of occasions that, for the most part, the accused have conducted themselves with dignity and in an exemplary manner throughout the trial. This is particularly so given the stress of the proceedings. However, there have been some notable exceptions to this.
	
	
	For example, there was an incident during the pre-trial hearing when some of the accused were involved in a physical fight with each other and a razor blade was subsequently located in the dock. [22]  More recently, on 16 June 2016, I observed Mumtaz Qaumi mouthing words at Witness I. [23]  On 22 June 2016 I became aware of an incident that occurred shortly after I left the bench in which Farhad Qaumi shouted threats at a police officer who gave evidence on the voir dire relevant to the present application. [24]  The evidence in the present application, and my own observations on 14 June 2016, suggests that the smiling of the young juror was responsive to conduct emanating from the accused.
	
	
	I have advised counsel that the Corrective Services officers requested that I permit them to close the Perspex screen that is capable of separating the dock from the court room. I declined that request. This decision can be revisited at any time if I form the impression that it is appropriate.
	
	
	An attempt by the accused to engage members of the jury in interaction is likely to be counterproductive. Decision makers generally react negatively to attempts by the parties to influence them. Further, any other member of the jury who observes such behaviour may consider such conduct to be unseemly and improper.
	
	
	Furthermore, if the interaction continues, the Crown may renew its application to discharge individual jurors. Needless to say, such an application will be determined on its merit but part of that consideration will be that the interaction has continued in spite of the concerns raised by the Crown and the comments that I have made in this judgment.
	


ANOTHER REASON AFFECTING THE JUROR’S ABILITY TO PERFORM THE FUNCTIONS OF A JUROR?


	
	I did not accept the alternative basis of the Crown’s application. This was based on s 53B(d) which provides:
	
	
	“The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:
	
	
	(d) it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.”
	
	
	This part of the Crown’s application involved the suggestion that the young juror acted contrary to directions not to discuss the case with people outside of the jury and, in particular, with the discharged juror. It was based on the words overheard by the senior DPP solicitor when she came upon the juror in the street near the Downing Centre: “Yep, and I looked over and he smiled at me so I smiled back.”
	
	
	There is some force in the submission that it is speculation to find that this snippet of a conversation related to the smiling between the accused and the juror that forms the primary basis of the application to discharge the young juror. Mr Stratton SC (on behalf of Farhad Qaumi) suggested that “for all we know, the juror might have been referring to the boy she met at the local dance hall last Saturday night.” It is difficult to know, from the snippet of conversation precisely what was being spoken about. However, the timing of the comment suggests that it may well have been a reference to something that happened in the court room a relatively short time earlier. However, even on the assumption that the comment related to a smile that occurred in the courtroom, it does establish to any relevant standard that the juror deliberately disobeyed directions.
	
	
	In coming to that conclusion, I considered the directions with which the jury was provided after the discharge of the juror on 6 June 2016. On that date the jury was directed that the discharged juror “now becomes someone that you can’t talk to about the case” and that they should “not disclose to her what is going on in the trial”. [25]  On 7 June 2016 one of the jurors raised (with a court officer) the possibility that the discharged juror may wish to attend the trial as a member of the public. [26]  At that stage I could see no basis upon which to exclude the juror from the courtroom. Having been discharged, she became a member of the public and the court is open to the public. The jury was advised accordingly, reminded of “the directions I have given you about communications about what is going on in the courtroom” and instructed that it is “vitally important that you not communicate with her about what goes on, particularly in the jury room”. [27]  At the end of the week I raised the possibility of contact with the discharged juror and directed the jury that “it is vitally important that you do not discuss the case with her.” [28] 
	
	
	I did not accept that the discussion of a smile that passed between the juror and somebody else in the courtroom (including one or more of the accused men) constituted a breach of those directions. The directions (and a number of directions given during the first several weeks of the trial) focused on discussions in the jury room and on the evidence. A direction not to discuss the “the case” and “what is going on in the trial” is unlikely to have caused the young juror to understand or believe that it was wrong to discuss some incidental interaction (that is, a smile) that passed between her and the accused.
	
	
	I was not satisfied that the juror deliberately disobeyed the directions. Nor was I satisfied that her ability to perform the functions of a juror was affected for the purposes of s 53B of the Jury Act.
	


CONCLUSIONS, DIRECTIONS AND POST SCRIPT


	
	It was for those reasons that I refused the application to discharge the young juror pursuant to s 53B.
	
	
	I came to the view that it was appropriate to revisit the question of contact with the discharged juror and to provide the jury with clear directions as to its role, the importance of the decisions it was called upon to make to both the accused and the community.
	
	
	I consulted the parties [29]  and provided directions to the jury before allowing them to disperse at the end of the day. The directions included a prohibition on further contact with the discharged juror, a reminder of the requirement not to discuss the case with anybody outside of the jury and clarification that this included communications in the jury room, the evidence given in the court room and “the things that happen incidentally in the courtroom as you are coming and going.” [30]  I also reminded the jury that the case must be decided on the evidence and that “when you come to consider your verdicts in the case, you have to put aside all of those emotions and mixed feelings you might have and prejudices and decide the case purely on the evidence”. [31] 
	
	
	The following morning I received a note from the jury (or a juror) in the following terms:
	


“Upon leaving the Court, without any plan, I happened to see the juror that has left and I have just told her that we are not allowed to have any kind of contact with her. It was a one minute conversation. We departed our own ways.” [32] 


	
	This note confirmed that the jury, both collectively and individually, understood the directions and was intent upon following them.

2954558,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 30) [2016] NSWSC 586,"Judgment


	
	This is not a judgment in the sense that in provides reasons for a decision that is binding upon the parties. Rather, it comprises remarks to explain a recommendation to those in the Department of Corrective Services responsible for the transport and conditions of incarceration of two accused men currently on trial before me. Those men are Mohammed Kalal and Mohammad Zarshoy. Both are remand inmates. Each is presumed to be innocent. Neither has been convicted of the offences with which they currently stand accused.
	
	
	The recommendation is not binding upon the Department or upon the particular units and individual officers within the Department to whom it is directed. The restraint with which the courts must approach any interference with the administration of correctional institutions, and the respect that must be paid to those with the responsibility of administering them, is well established. The Court should be cautious in interfering with the conduct of correctional institutions: see, for example, the authorities collected by McInerney J in Kelleher v Commissioner, Department of Corrective Services [1999] NSWSC 86 at [7], [11]. When judicial officers are presiding over trials, particularly long trials, and the accused person is in custody on remand, this restraint, respect and caution create tension and difficulties. The circumstances that I will presently describe are an example – perhaps an extreme example but by no means a unique example – of those tensions and difficulties.
	
	
	In making this recommendation, I am conscious of the limited resources available to the Department. However, as I will explain, compliance with this recommendation is likely to save costs in the long term. I make the recommendation having consulted with a number of senior Corrective Services officers who I will not name for privacy reasons. One is a senior member of the Extreme High Risk Transport Unit responsible for transport of three of the accused. Through the Chief Justice, I have previously commended him and his unit for their service to the Court in the course of this trial. The other officers were the Acting Area Manager and the Acting Officer in Charge of the cells in the Downing Centre Court Complex where the present trial is taking place. I am grateful to each of those officers for their concern for the inmates involved and the process of the Court. I value their insight into the kind of recommendation that might be practical, effective and cost effective.
	
	
	Both Mr Zarshoy and Mr Kalal are presently held at the Parklea Correctional Centre. Concerns for their safety means that they cannot be transferred to an institution that is closer to the Court, such as Silverwater MRRC or Long Bay. From time to time since the pre-trial hearing commenced, I have been told by counsel that the two men are being woken at 4.00am and do not get back to the cells until 9.00pm or later. Between 4.00am and 1.00pm the only food that they receive is a bowl of cereal at around 7.00am. Due to resource issues in the cells in the Downing Centre they do not receive sustenance at the short adjournment (taken at around 11.15am or 11.30am). The result, especially with Mr Zarshoy, is that they are noticeably drowsy and sometimes fall asleep. I have observed this and commented on it. I have made a number of recommendations with limited, if any, success. I have witnessed Mr Zarshoy fall asleep on more than one occasion. I will return to provide greater detail of the history of these matters presently.
	


RECOMMENDATION


	
	Having consulted with, and taken into account the opinions of, the officers to whom I referred in paragraph [3], and having considered the submissions of counsel, I make the following recommendation:
	
	
	I recommend that the accused Mohammed Kalal and Mohammad Zarshoy be provided with a direct transport to and from court. That is a transport, either by themselves or with other inmates, that travels directly from the Parklea Correctional Centre to the Downing Centre in the morning and directly from the Downing Centre to the Parklea Correctional Centre in the afternoon.
	
	
	I direct that these remarks be provided to:
	



	
	The Chief Justice of New South Wales.
	
	
	Mr Severin, the Commissioner for Corrective Services.
	
	
	The Officer in Charge of the Court Escort Security Unit of the Department of Corrective Services.
	
	
	The Correctional Officer in Charge of the cells at the Downing Centre Court complex.
	
	
	The Superintendent or Officer in Charge of the Parklea Correctional Centre.
	



	
	Confronted with a similar problem in a trial that is currently taking place in the King Street Court Complex, Johnson J discussed the important role of the Department of Corrective Services in R v Turnbull (No 8) [2016] NSWSC 714. I adopt his Honour’s words:
	


“5.   My principle concern is the proper administration of justice. The Department of Corrective Services, in all its forms and in all its functions, plays a fundamental part in the administration of justice. Its role, in the present respect, is to facilitate the functioning of the criminal Courts. Any step which may be taken in transporting the Accused which causes an adverse health outcome, and causes his trial to be interrupted (or even aborted), would constitute a direct interference with the administration of justice.

6.   I am speaking more plainly on this occasion because it does not seem that what I said a week ago has had any effect.

7.   I am not saying this because of any personal desire that the Accused be given special treatment. At the same time, everyone, including the Court and the Department of Corrective Services, must take into account his unusual circumstances. His age and his state of health are such that it must be obvious to all concerned that to treat him as an ordinary prisoner, to be transported from one place to another until he does not arrive at his present place of custody until late at night, is entirely wrong.”


	
	While the two accused in the present trial are not old and infirm, they are part of one of the largest and longest trials to have been held in this Court and anybody who has been present throughout the trial will have noticed the difficulties that each has had in participating in the proceedings. I am not making this recommendation to secure preferential treatment for the accused. I am making it to prevent further disruption to the trial, to save cost to the community that will arise from repeated adjournment of the proceedings and to ensure the integrity of the trial proceedings.
	


The background to this recommendation


	
	As I have said, there have been occasions during the course of the trial that the accused Mr Zarshoy has literally fallen asleep during the course of the evidence. I have observed this on more than one occasion. Mr Kalal has also, from time to time, bordered on somnolence. Both men have looked, more often than not, very tired.
	
	
	The matter was first raised by counsel on 24 November 2015. That was in the course of the pre-trial hearing. At that stage there was no jury and, because the issues ventilated were of a legal nature or involved pre-trial examination of witnesses, the accused consciousness was not as important as it is during the course of the trial proper. In any event, I was told:
	


“It is already very evident how onerous it is on particularly Mr Zarshoy who is brought from some distance and his days are going from 4.00 o'clock in the morning at the moment until late in the evening before he gets back to his cell and then cooking his own food and washing.

…

It is onerous and any lengthy trial will be horrendous for the people in the dock.

…

Certainly it works for the court time but for Mr Zarshoy it is a huge day. One look at him one can see at the moment he is a bit grey and he is tired. He is falling asleep whenever he gets the opportunity, and this has only been going for a couple of weeks. It's going to be terrible in front of a jury, if we get to that point.”  [1] 


	
	“That point” was reached around five weeks ago, a jury having been empanelled on 4 April 2016. Since the jury was empanelled the matter has been raised on a number of occasions and I have attempted to observe both Mr Kalal and Mr Zarshoy since that time.
	
	
	On 7 April 2016 Mr Driels advised me that an incident at the gaol resulted in his client not being returned to his cell until 10.30pm after being woken at 4.00am. He was then woken at 4-00am the following morning but “refused to get out of bed”. [2] 
	
	
	On 8 April 2016, having made some inquiries with the Department, I raised the possibility that the trial may be prolonged if it was necessary to adjourn early each day, or every other day, in order to allow Mr Zarshoy and Mr Kalal to get some sleep. [3] 
	
	
	On 11 April 2016 I was advised by counsel that applying for a transfer to a gaol close to the Court complex was not a practical solution. The solicitor for Mr Zarshoy had been advised that “his life is in danger” if transferred to Silverwater. By that stage, I had been observing the two accused during the course of the trial and put on the record that “they are looking a little drowsy”. Mr Driels asked that Mr Zarshoy be given a cup of coffee at the morning adjournment. My staff had organised to obtain sealed packs of biscuits with the idea that the Court – that is, my staff – may be permitted to provide the accused with biscuits delivered in sealed packets to provide the accused with a “sugar hit” during the short adjournment. It was hoped that this might sustain the accused until the luncheon adjournment. I indicated that I intended to raise this possibility with those in charge of the cells in the Downing Centre but noted that there may be “real difficulties with providing sustenance from outside”. [4] 
	
	
	As a result of those events, the corrective officers in court brought to my attention the Standard Operating Procedures for the Downing Centre cells. On 13 April 2016 I brought this to the attention of the parties:
	


“Biscuit-gate - I was provided with a copy of the Downing Centre standard operating procedure. It tells me at 5.11 that:

‘No food or medication is to be received by inmates, only water given by the court officer is allowed. If a judge or Magistrate orders such prohibited items to be given to an inmate, the officers will express their reservation to the Court and the officer in charge of the cells is to be called in immediately.’

I note that from time to time the officers in court have complied with that standing operational procedure by expressing their reservations and I took the liberty of contacting the officer in charge of the cells myself to save them from having to panic and do so. She tells me that the offer of supplying biscuits essentially from the Bench is not possible. Coffee at morning tea is not possible but that the sandwiches will be distributed more evenly through the day so that the accused will receive sustenance at morning tea of some kind.

I am afraid, as far as I can tell, absent some application and submissions that address the various restrictions placed on courts interfering with the administration of prisons, of which there are a number of authorities and they don't all speak with one voice, I think I have reached the limits of what I can do. So I'm sorry about that, but so it is.”


	
	On 26 April 2016 the matter reached a critical moment when Mr Driels invited me to “look at [his] client”. Mr Zarshoy had his eyes closed with his head slumped. As I looked at him, he literally fell forward into somnolence. Falling forward in the dock woke him and he looked up, surprised to see all of the lawyers looking at him. Mr Driels submitted that “he needs a different regime” and made an application that:
	


“The trial be stopped until he can come to court and in a position where he is not sleep deprived to the point of constantly falling asleep.”

and

“The trial not proceed until he is in a fit state to present himself before his jury.” [5] 


	
	I asked the Crown whether the accused should be required to stand trial for murder in circumstances where his conditions of incarceration meant that he could not stay awake and how this was consistent with the treatment of inmates in a civilised society. The Crown did not wish to say anything against those propositions behind those questions but did not agree that the proceedings should be stayed. He agreed with the proposition that before I could take any action staying the proceedings I would need a formal application supported by affidavit evidence. The learned Crown Prosecutor observed that the situation, as I described it, was such that “a person [that is, Mr Zarshoy] is not able to be a participant, or on the verge of potentially not participating, in [his] own trial.” [6] 
	
	
	Later that day, Mr Clarke (who appears for Mr Kalal) raised the possibility that his client might travel with another inmate currently standing trial in the city who is also housed at Parklea. Following discussions, [7]  I made the following observation and recommendation:
	


“The accused Mr Zarshoy and the accused Mr Kalal (I am told) are both currently incarcerated at the Parklea Correctional Centre and at least on many days, if not all days, they are being woken at 4 o'clock in the morning and not getting back to the gaol until after dark, possibly sometimes until nine. The result is that they are both struggling to maintain focus during the course of the hearing.

Mr Zarshoy in particular is noticeably falling to sleep, and Mr Kalal is showing signs of fatigue as I observe each of them from the bench. All of that information at this stage comes from the bar table and I have no doubt reflects the instructions taken by both Mr Driels, who appears for Mr Zarshoy, and Mr Clarke who appears for Mr Kalal.

Various solutions have been contemplated and spoken of. But the situation is, as I expressed this morning, I am getting to a point where it may be necessary to take action which will be extremely expensive. That action would be to adjourn the trial for a period or to sit shorter sitting hours simply because two of the accused are having difficulty focusing on proceedings of the utmost importance to each of them.

As I understand it Mr Zarshoy's lawyers are in the process of formulating some form of application and putting together evidence to support that. But in the meantime Mr Clarke, who appears for Mr Kalal, has asked me to make a recommendation to those who are responsible for transporting him from Parklea to this centre every day. Whether the solution proposed is a practical one is impossible for me to say. Whether or not it is a solution that can be acted upon by the Department of Corrective Services, again it is impossible for me to say. But it is known that another remand inmate by the name of Glen Patrick McNamara is being transported from Parklea to the city each day for his trial, which is a proceeding before Justice Bellew in one of the courts in King Street.” [8] 


	
	Counsel has told me that this recommendation was acted upon – at least on those days where it was practical – and the situation with Mr Kalal has improved. He has been noticeably more alert and engaged. I express the Court’s sincere gratitude to those in the Department of Corrective Services who are responsible for acting on this recommendation.
	
	
	On 28 April 2016 the transcript records the following:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Before I adjourn I just want to raise and place on the record that I think on four occasions this morning I looked at the dock and both Mr Kalal and Mr Zarshoy appeared to be asleep and I just wonder whether or not anything had happened in relation to the recommendation of travelling with Mr McNamara which is Mr Kalal's situation Mr Clarke.

CLARKE: Not at the moment. I think it's back to the old regime. I thought there was a slight improvement last week but it seems to have lapsed back to the up early and return late.

…

HIS HONOUR: I must say my observations of Mr Zarshoy have been that he seems to have been asleep on a number of occasions. It's just that this morning I thought they might end up in one another's laps.

CLARKE: Thank you for that your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Can I recommend to the officers who have custody of Mr Zarshoy and Mr Kalal during the morning adjournment that steps be taken to provide them with a cup of coffee if they would like one, otherwise [I am] going to stop the trial and this is going to end up being a far more expensive undertaking for the Department of Corrective Services than it will be otherwise. I'm not having people charged with offences of this nature falling asleep in the courtroom consistently. So if it's possible for them to be provided with refreshments that will enable them to be more alert, I would be very grateful. I realise that I'm possibly stepping on toes, but in the end I can only control the courtroom and if that means sitting for half an hour a day that's what will happen, and then Corrective Services will be transferring them for months and months longer than needs to be.” [9] 


	
	On 2 May 2016, the situation with Mr Zarshoy again disrupted the trial. First thing in the morning counsel brought his client’s fatigue to my attention:
	


“DRIELS: Transportation problems, if I may raise them. Apparently, Mr Zarshoy came in the long way this morning as opposed to Mr Kalal who came with Mr McNamara and was here at 8 o'clock. I am informed Mr Zarshoy arrived here about 10 o'clock this morning. He has been in holding cells since 5.30, 6 o'clock this morning and in backs of trucks until he got here now. So he is not faring the best.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

DRIELS: If he is forced to take some time out, he has had the opportunity to wash his face before he came into Court, but if he does need some time I will be seeking it during the day, your Honour. Sorry.

HIS HONOUR: You will just have to let me know when it arises. I do note the recommendation I made in relation to the use of Mr McNamara's transport was confined to Mr Kalal because he was the only one who asked for it.

DRIELS: As I said the other day, they both came together but maybe then for completeness, your Honour, if I could ask at this time that a recommendation be made to the transport section of the Department of Corrective Services that Mr Zarshoy be afforded the opportunity to travel with his co‑accused to Court here.” [10] 


	
	Around an hour later, Ms Carroll (counsel for a co-accused, Jamil Qaumi) raised an objection and asked to be heard in the absence of the jury. The following exchange is recorded:
	


“CARROLL: I might say this, I probably interjected a little early only because I did observe Mr Zarshoy to be completely asleep and I just thought it better sooner rather than later to object.

HIS HONOUR: I think I should put on the record that I nearly called stumps before this witness was called for the same reason. I think the situation is reaching a point where there just may have to be something extreme done.” [11] 


	
	At the conclusion of the legal argument, I made the following request:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Mr Zarshoy can perhaps get some refreshment during the morning adjournment. I don't know what is possible. The officers earlier in the trial at one stage when I made what I gather to be an outrageous suggestion that the accused receive some refreshment at morning tea, someone was kind enough to provide me with the protocol or standard operating procedures for the cells in this centre. I have mislaid my copy and I wonder whether it would be possible to get from the Officer in Charge downstairs a copy of those. I would also like to know whether there are cells immediately behind the courtroom, holding cells, and I would like to inspect those at some stage today. I think you are all aware, I know one officer has taken steps to try to keep Mr Zarshoy awake, I am grateful for that. I'm sure you're all aware of the problem that is developing in the trial and we're going to have to do something about it during the course of the day. If you could tell the officer in charge downstairs that I expect that to happen. Thank you.” [12] 


	
	During the short adjournment the (Acting) Officer in Charge of the cells and the (Acting) Area Manager of the Department of Corrective Services spoke to me in chambers. As I have said, the information provided to me was extremely helpful and both officers demonstrated sensitivity, professionalism and pro-activeness in an attempt to find a solution to the problem. I take the opportunity to commend both officers.
	
	
	I was made aware of the problems that confronted the staff in the Downing Centre cells and provided with information about a volunteer organisation called “Prison Fellowship Australia” which might be in a position, subject to Departmental approval, to supply a cup of tea or coffee to inmates before Court. We also had useful discussions about the kind of recommendation that might not only alleviate the problems in the present trial but also assist in clearing the cells in the Downing Centre more quickly in the afternoon each day (particularly on Thursdays and Fridays when the number of inmates increases because the District Court lists large numbers of sentencing matters).
	
	
	After the short adjournment, there was further discussion about the matter:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I have it in mind to tell the jury that the Court will adjourn until Wednesday for their purposes. Mr Driels, I am not sure how Mr Zarshoy is now. You have just spoken to him, I see. Is there anything you want to say about that?

…

HIS HONOUR: I must say, the reason that I said what I said when I walked on to the bench was (1) because I had just had some communication and I thought I might be able to make a useful recommendation that might actually have some effect and (2) because my observations of Mr Zarshoy this morning were such that I thought the trial perhaps shouldn't continue.

DRIELS: Yes.

HIS HONOUR: Three, because I thought I had another objection to rule on and rather than have the jury waiting around for an indeterminate amount of time. But if he is okay to go on then I think we should go on.

DRIELS: As I said, he is okay there at the moment, talking to him. He is pale, as you can see, as well as being tired. I am keeping an eye on it. I would ask maybe if we could finish off Ms Brown and do all those other things it might be a reasonable time. It is midday now.

…

HIS HONOUR: What are you thinking about all this, Mr Crown. You have got eight eyes or so in court. I am sure you are conscious of the fact that one of your accused is, a lot of time or some of the time, not conscious.

CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY: Clearly it is a concern that is concerning the Court and it must be clear that he is participating in the trial, not not participating.” [13] 


	
	Subsequently, I made the following recommendation:
	


“HIS HONOUR: … I recommend that the recommendation that I made in respect of Mr Kalal being transported with Mr McNamara also apply to the accused Mohammad Zarshoy.” [14] 


	
	After making that recommendation I noted that it was a short-term solution because the McNamara trial was in its final weeks. I also provided the parties with an update concerning my conversation with the two corrective services officers. [15]  The record again reflected that Mr Zarshoy had fallen asleep in the course of these discussions:
	


“HIS HONOUR: I will just wait to hear from you and we will monitor the situation in the meantime, noting Mr Zarshoy is presently apparently asleep. Can you just keep me informed as to whether the McNamara option is working.” [16] 


	
	I have been told that both accused have been transported with McNamara since that time. This means that they have been transported directly from Parklea to the city and directly back again, the only stop being at the court complex where the McNamara trial is being conducted. Both accused have been observably more alert and engaged in the trial since this arrangement came into operation. However, as has been noted, it is a short-term solution because the McNamara trial is expected to come to an end in about one month.
	
	
	On Thursday 5 May 2016 I met with two volunteers from the Prison Fellowship of Australia. This meeting was organised after the Officer in Charge of the Cells at the Downing Centre provided their telephone numbers. They provide lunches and refreshments to inmates in the cells a couple of times per month. Having heard of the difficulties in the present trial, they are going to attempt to provide inmates with coffee or tea before court or at the morning adjournment on a more frequent basis. I notified the parties of this meeting and made the following recommendation:
	


“Secondly, I would make a recommendation that the Officer in Charge of the cells and the Department of Corrective Services do everything that they can to facilitate the offer made by the Prison Fellowship of Australia to provide refreshments to the inmates at the Downing Centre cells before Court or if practicable at the short adjournment, and I will order that this part of the transcript be taken out and provided to the people to whom the recommendation is directed and to the Prison Fellowship as well.” [17] 


	
	I understand that this will take some time, because it requires approval. I hope that something will happen, but in the meantime merely observe that it seems incompatible with modern notions of human rights that remand prisoners receive no sustenance between 4.00 am (or 6.00am) (when they are woken up) until 1.00pm (when they receive lunch in the cells) apart from a bowl of cereal for breakfast. A similar observation might be made in relation to what counsel described as “sleep deprivation” arising as a result of being woken up at 4.00am and not returned to their cells until 9.00pm or later.
	


The potential impact on the trial and potential economic cost to the Department and to the Community


	
	At this stage, there has been no application to discharge the jury although on 26 April 2016 Mr Driels asked for the trial to be stopped until there was a change of Mr Zarshoy’s regime. The problem has resulted in a significant amount of wasted court time due to the need for counsel to inform me of the difficulties. On one occasion it was part of the reason the jury was asked to disperse early and the Court did not sit beyond the luncheon adjournment.
	
	
	If the situation continues, or returns to the state of affairs that existed before the accused began to be transported with Mr McNamara, there are likely to be further and significant disruptions to the trial.
	
	
	In R v Feili [2013] NSWSC 492 an argument was advanced that the fact that the accused was sleeping at times during the trial meant that he was not fit to be tried. While that argument was rejected, [18]  there is little doubt that the inability of an accused to participate in the trial (as it was put by the learned Crown Prosecutor in this case) as a result of somnolence may affect the fairness of the trial. This can occur for a number of reasons. First, an accused may not be in a position to provide their lawyers with instructions. Mr Driels has indicated that this occurred on one afternoon in the present case. Secondly, an accused may not hear or understand important evidence about which they may need to provide instructions. Third, the appearance in front of the jury is bad.
	
	
	It has not been suggested that the jury be informed of the reason for Mr Zarshoy’s sleepiness. Doing so could cause prejudice to the accused in that there would then be no doubt in the jury’s mind that he is in custody. It could also cause prejudice to the prosecution because explaining the unsatisfactory nature of the accused’s custodial regime may cause sympathy to the accused.
	
	
	The situation has not reached the stage, or even come close to the stage, where it could sensibly be argued that the trial proceedings are unfair or have miscarried. However, if the situation were to continue for the remaining several months of the trial, such an argument might be advanced in support of an application to discharge the jury, or for a temporary stay of the proceedings or in the course of an appeal against any conviction that might follow the jury’s deliberations.
	
	
	If any of those applications or arguments met with success, the trial may be extended for a substantial amount of time or, if such an argument succeeded on appeal, there would be a re-trial.
	
	
	If any of these things occurred the total costs of transporting the inmates would be far greater than the cost involved in organising a special or direct transport.
	
	
	None of this should be seen as suggesting that the two accused should receive some preferential or special treatment. However, the fact is that they are involved in an extremely long and expensive trial and that their conditions of incarceration are such that the proceedings have been, and may continue to be, disrupted. In the worst case, those conditions may bring into question the integrity of the trial proceedings.
	
	
	I call on those with the power to make appropriate arrangements to alleviate this situation to do so.

		23 November 2016",2016-05-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2954560,R v AC (No 7) [2016] NSWSC 404,"Judgment


	
	On 3 March 2016 the offender pleaded guilty to two offences namely:
	



	
	Accessory before the fact of the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy on 29 October 2013.
	
	
	Accessory before the fact of the offence of discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Abdul Abu-Mahmoud on 7 November 2013.
	



	
	The first count is charged under ss 18 and 346 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The second count is charged under ss 33A(1)(a) and 346 of the same Act and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. In each case, the maximum penalty is created by the section creating the substantive offence (ss 18 and 33A respectively). Section 346 of the Crimes Act provides:
	


“Every accessory before the fact to a serious indictable offence may be indicted, convicted, and sentenced, either before or after the trial of the principal offender, or together with the principal offender, or indicted, convicted, and sentenced, as a principal in the offence, and shall be liable in either case to the same punishment to which the person would have been liable had the person been the principal offender, whether the principal offender has been tried or not, or is amenable to justice or not.”


	
	The offender also asks that an offence of participating in a criminal group (s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act) be taken into account in sentencing the offender for the first count. I have done so in accordance with well-established authority.
	
	
	There is some small controversy over whether the standard non-parole periods that apply to the principal offences (20 years and nine years respectively) apply to offenders charged as accessories before the fact. There is some tension in the authorities. The learned Crown Prosecutor conceded that the standard non-parole periods do not apply. Whether that concession is legally correct is not a matter of great moment in the circumstances of the present case. The standard non-parole periods demonstrate the seriousness with which the legislature treats the principal offences. In sentencing an accessory before the fact, it provides some guidance (a ""yardstick"") in assessing the objective seriousness of the offending. However, there are many reasons in the present case why the standard non-parole period would have little relevance even if, technically, it did apply. These include the plea of guilty, the offer of assistance and other matters relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence and the personal circumstances of the offender. In coming to what I consider to be a just and appropriate sentence, I take into account the fact that there are standard non-parole periods for the principal offences in that limited way.
	


Discounts for plea of guilty and assistance


	
	Until the plea of guilty was entered, the offender was one of nine, then eight, and finally six, accused on trial for a large number of offences arising from their membership of, or association with, a group known as the Blacktown Chapter of the Brothers for Life (BFL Blacktown): see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) (Severance and Separate trials) [2016] NSWSC 15.
	
	
	The case was subject to a lengthy pre-trial hearing, canvassing a number of issues, in this Court. This commenced with a directions hearing on 27 July 2015. On that date, the offender was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. A series of pre-trial applications commenced on 2 November 2015. This included the ""Basha"" interrogation of a number of informant witnesses: R v Qaumi (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1715. The offender did not participate actively in the pre-trial hearings. The offender’s counsel (not the same barrister who appears on sentence) did not apply for the witnesses to give evidence on the Basha inquiry and did not ask any questions of the witnesses. Nor did the offender seek separate trials or severance or make submissions on the other pre-trial issues. The offender sought variations of her bail from time to time but the Crown was always put on notice of those applications and each was dealt with by consent and expeditiously. She also made an application under s 45 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) but her part in that application took very little of the Court's time. These matters are relevant to the utilitarian value of the offender's plea of guilty and the degree to which or the manner in which she conducted the case facilitated the course of justice: see ss 22-22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Act”) and the guideline judgment on pleas of guilty published in the year 2000.
	
	
	On the other hand, these are extremely belated pleas of guilty. After she was committed for trial, the offender applied to have the order refusing to allow cross-examination at the committal hearing, and the committal order itself, quashed: C v DPP (NSW) [2015] NSWSC 747. [1]  The pleas of guilty were entered after the 36th day of the pre-trial hearing. Further, the trial proper was scheduled to commence on 29 February 2016. The plea came after that date. The trial date was postponed until 14 March 2016. The plea came just eleven days before the revised trial date and, along with a belated application for a trial by judge alone by the remaining accused, caused the trial date to be postponed again, this time until 4 April 2016.
	
	
	However, to the offender’s credit and with the diligence of her legal representatives, the sentencing hearing was able to be conducted with a minimum delay. In spite of the amount of work involved, the hard and prompt work of her lawyers has enabled me to impose sentence a little over one month after the plea of guilty was entered.
	
	
	The utilitarian value of the plea can only be regarded as minimal. The extent to which it has reduced the length of trial is difficult to assess but I operate on an assumption that it has saved some court time. I have reduced the sentence by around 5% on account of the plea of guilty. I am unable to accept the submission made on her behalf that the plea should result in a reduction in sentence of 10-15%. However, the manner in which she conducted the trial also entitles the offender to a small reduction from the sentence pursuant to s 22A of the Sentencing Act. In total, the reduction for these matters (ss 22 and 22A) will be 7½%.
	
	
	Another “discount” to which the offender is entitled arises from the assistance that she has, and will, provide to police and the prosecution. Section 23 of the Sentencing Act provides:
	


“23 Power to reduce penalties for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities

(1) A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.

(2) In deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty it imposes, the court must consider the following matters:

(b) the significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered,

(c) the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender,

(d) the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance,

(e) the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(f) any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(g) whether the offender will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(h) any injury suffered by the offender or the offender’s family, or any danger or risk of injury to the offender or the offender’s family, resulting from the assistance or undertaking to assist,

(i) whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence,

(3) A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

(4) A court that imposes a lesser penalty under this section on an offender because the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities must:

(a) indicate to the offender, and make a record of the fact, that the lesser penalty is being imposed for either or both of those reasons, and

(b) state the penalty that it would otherwise have imposed, and

(c) where the lesser penalty is being imposed for both reasons-state the amount by which the penalty has been reduced for each reason.

(5) Subsection (4) does not limit any requirement that a court has, apart from that subsection, to record the reasons for its decisions.

(6) The failure of a court to comply with the requirements of subsection (4) with respect to any sentence does not invalidate the sentence.”


	
	I have taken into account the matters set out in s 23(4) and, adopting the paragraph numbering of that sub-section, record the following findings:
	



	
	Taking into account the evaluation made by Detective Inspector Brown and Detective Superintendent Willing, the assistance is useful and significant.
	
	
	The evidence to be provided is, as far as I am able to assess it in advance of cross-examination by counsel for the accused in the trial, generally truthful, reliable and complete. However, my assessment is that the offender attempted to minimise her role and this will diminish her credibility once she is exposed to cross-examination.
	
	
	The nature and extent of the offender's promised assistance is substantial.
	
	
	The offer of assistance, for the most part, is not timely. Like the plea of guilty, it was provided very late in the course of the proceedings. However, one aspect of the assistance (disclosure of information alleging threats to police officers) was made promptly.
	
	
	The offender has not gained any other benefit by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist.
	
	
	It is expected that the offender will be in strict protective custody for most, if not all, of her sentence. The evidence shows that she will have less opportunity for human interaction with other inmates, less opportunity for visits by friends and relatives and less access to courses available to prisoners in the ""main"" parts of the gaol system. Of particular significance is the fact that her ability to interact with other women is likely to be extremely limited.
	
	
	On the basis of the evidence and what is known of, and alleged against, those against whom she is to give evidence, the offender and her family is at risk of injury or reprisal as a result of her assistance.
	
	
	The assistance relates both to offences for which she is to be sentenced but also offences with which she is not charged. This includes a murder charge against two of the co-offenders which is best described as a cold blooded, contract killing.
	



	
	Like the pleas of guilty, the offer of assistance came very late. By the time of the offer, all of the co-offenders had been charged on the basis, amongst other things, of the evidence provided by other informant witnesses. They were all in custody by that time. In relation to the statements that relate to the present back-to-back trials, I am unable to see how there is any basis upon which the offender is entitled to anything more than a relatively small discount for ""past assistance"" or, in the terms of s 23 of the Sentencing Act, the extent to which she ""has assisted"" law enforcement authorities. However, one of the statements related to threats against two police officers. That statement contains details such as the residence of one of the officers. This statement was both timely and important, in terms of past assistance. The offender provided six statements between 10 to 29 February at a time where there was some danger in doing so. I propose to reduce her sentence by 12½% for past assistance. If some consider that reduction to be generous, it probably is. However, there is a policy reason to provide the offender with a significant reduction for making the statements. A failure to do so would discourage people in her position from co­operating with law enforcement agencies.
	
	
	By contrast, the offender’s undertaking to assist the prosecution – her ""future assistance"" – is very valuable. Her evidence is likely to be important and add strength to the prosecution case. A cynical observer might think that the offender has minimised her role. Indeed, I believe that she has. Further, a great deal of the evidence that the offender will give is already in the possession of the prosecution. It is also true that there are inconsistencies in the detail of her account and those provided by other informant witnesses. However, her evidence will provide important, and direct, evidence against men who (according to the police and prosecution) are the true leaders of a period of bloody lawlessness perpetrated by the BFL Blacktown.
	
	
	In my estimation, her future assistance entitles the offender to a reduction in her sentence of 30%.
	
	
	Accordingly, the total discount for the plea of guilty (5%), facilitating the course of justice (2½%), her past assistance (12½%) and future assistance (30%) will be 50%.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the offender’s submission that she should receive a total discount of, or approaching, 60%. In rejecting that submission I have considered (and accept) Mr Dhanji’s SC submission that, because of the “ceiling” created by s 23(3) of the Sentencing Act, there is a “diminishing return” in cases where an offender provides extensive assistance. As Mr Dhanji SC put it, it is not “a linear process”. Thus, there will be cases where an offender attracts no discount for a guilty plea, and yet will be entitled to a discount for assistance of 50-60%. The best explanation of this practical application of relevant principles, and the interplay between mathematical reductions in sentence for these various factors and the principle of proportionality enshrined in s 23(3), may be found in the judgment of Simpson J in R v Lenati [2008] NSWCCA 67 at [35]-[39].
	
	
	There are two other matters that I should mention in relation to the reduction of the offender’s sentence for her plea and assistance. The first is that, while I have taken into account the extremely onerous conditions of her incarceration in assessing the appropriate discount in accordance with s 23(2)(g), I will also take the matter into account when I consider the question of “special circumstances” under s 44 of the Sentencing Act. I do not consider this to constitute what is sometimes, inelegantly, described as “double counting”. It is a matter that is relevant both to the total sentence, but also whether there should be some reduction in the non-parole period. In assessing the total discount to be applied to the individual total sentences, I bear in mind that I also intend to reduce the length of the non-parole period.
	
	
	The second matter is that, having determined that the offender is entitled to a combined discount of 50%, I have taken a step back at the end of the process to ensure that I have complied with s 23(3) of the Sentencing Act. That is, I am concerned to ensure that the discount will not result in a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the gravity of the offence. I emphasise the word “unreasonably”. I am satisfied that it does not. The sentence to be imposed is certainly disproportionate to the offender’s criminality, but it is not unreasonably so.
	


THE FACTS OF THE OFFENCES AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE OFFENDER’S CRIMINALITY


	
	As is often the case, there is an element of artifice in assessing the facts of the offences and the role of the offender. In the course of the pre-trial hearing, I heard a great deal of evidence concerning the offender's criminal behaviour. I am required to, and have, put that evidence out of mind and will sentence the offender on the basis of the facts that are agreed between the parties. With one exception - the degree of duress - there is no dispute as to the facts. The facts are set out in a document styled ""Agreed Facts"". It includes a good deal of background information concerning the Brothers for Life (BFL) and the circumstances in which the offender came to be involved with that organisation.
	
	
	The BFL was formed by Bassam Hamzy (a notorious criminal and prison inmate) with his cousins Ghassan Hamzy and Mohammed 'Hamoudie' Hamzy (also known as “Little Crazy” and “LC”). The offender met Bassam Hamzy around 15 years ago. According to the agreed facts, she was ""dating him while he was in custody"". (The precise nature of the ""dates"" was not disclosed in the evidence). The offender's evidence was that she dated him before he went into custody and that she did not know at that time the nature of the offences with which he was to be charged. These included murder. She broke up with Bassam Hamzy (or ""Bass"" as she called him in the course of her evidence) and they were not in contact for many years.
	
	
	In early 2013, the offender was employed by a firm of lawyers engaged by Bassam Hamzy and, in that role, she used to visit him in prison. According to the agreed facts, she used to perform tasks for Bassam Hamzy, one of which resulted in her meeting Mohammed 'Hamoudie' Hamzy and Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	However, the offender's evidence suggested a somewhat different series of connections. As I understood it, she became involved with Farhad Qaumi when he called her work telephone (provided by a solicitor to whom I will refer as “MC” [2] ) seeking advice in relation to a possible action against the police for false imprisonment or malicious prosecution.
	
	
	The offender’s evidence concerning her employment with MC had a number of very peculiar features. For one thing, it seemed that MC rang and offered her a job with his law firm even though she had no legal training and had not applied for a position. She said that this was because Bassam Hamzy recommended her, in circumstances where (according to the offender) she had not seen or heard from him for a number of years. She then worked, completely unpaid, for a period of three to six months. MC had no office (although it seems he borrowed one ""if you can call it that"" occasionally) and the offender was provided with a telephone and given instructions as to what to do from time to time. Her work days and hours were sporadic. She attended gaol visits, including to Mr Hamzy. It was the context of this rather odd legal job that she received the call on her work ‘phone from Farhad Qaumi. As I followed her evidence, this was purely coincidental in terms of the connection, as it existed or developed, between Farhad Qaumi and two other people that she had known for many years - Bassam and Mohammed Hamzy.
	
	
	The offender was involved in passing messages between the Hamzys and Farhad Qaumi. Why this was necessary was difficult to discern. In any event, the offender undertook the task even though she must have known that she was passing messages between men involved in serious criminal activity. Farhad wanted the approval of the Hamzys to set up a chapter of the BFL. Mohammed Hamzy insisted that he restrict his activities to the area between Granville and Blacktown. The offender knew that the activities involved drug dealing. There was tension between the groups due to the failure of Mohammed Hamzy to deliver on a promise to provide guns when Farhad Qaumi set up the BFL Blacktown. The offender said that she thought that Farhad Qaumi needed guns “to scare people”.
	
	
	I formed the view that the offender was minimising the extent of her knowledge of the activities of the people with whom she was mixing. I found parts of the offender's evidence difficult to accept. However, it was mostly in accordance with the agreed facts and received support in one important respect from her mother and, in others, from the psychiatric and psychological evidence called on her behalf.
	
	
	By 2013, Farhad Qaumi was the leader of the Parramatta Chapter of the BFL(later to become the BFL Blacktown). Over time, a ""turf war"" developed between the BFL Blacktown and the BFL Bankstown (run by the Hamzys).This culminated in a number of shooting offences, including a murder offence, said to have been committed at the direction of Farhad Qaumi. At times, members of the BFL Blacktown were beaten and threatened by, or on the orders of, Farhad Qaumi.
	


Count 1 - The Murder of Mahmoud Hamzy


	
	On 28 October 2013, the offender spoke privately to Farhad Qaumi and told him that she had heard that Mohammed ""Hamoudie"" Hamzy was planning to""get"" Farhad. She had heard this information from her ex-husband. Farhadsaid, ""I was going to get him anyway but this has given me the excuse"". At Farhad's request, in the course of meetings over the next few hours, the offender repeated what she had heard to other members of the BFL Blacktown. She also told Farhad what she knew of Mohammed Hamzy's bail conditions, namely that he was required to be home before midnight. Themembers shared their knowledge of the appearance and whereabouts of Mohammed Hamzy and a plan was hatched to shoot him at his home. Theoffender knew where the target lived and was instructed by Farhad Qaumi to drive the shooters to his house. He said ""You're going to fucken drive cause you're the one that told me [about Hamzy's plan to kill Farhad]”. He also said ""this will make sure you don't tell anyone."" In the course of meetings at othervenues, the plan was developed further. Those offenders who were directed to carry out the killing were instructed not to take their telephones and an attempt was made to set up a false alibi by attending a hotel where a security officer knew them.
	
	
	The offender drove the three shooters to the victim’s home at Revesby Heights. At around midnight, the offender arrived outside the premises along with Jamil Qaumi, Mohammed Zarshoy and a man now known as witness L. They waited to ensure that Mohammed Hamzy would be home. Jamil Qaumi ""directed"" [3]  the offender to ""stay here, keep the car running, when you hear the shots drive up to us"". The three men, armed with firearms and wearing balaclavas and gloves, entered the premises. They ran into the garage and opened fire. Mohammed Hamzy and another man escaped but Mahmoud Hamzy (who looks similar to Mohammed Hamzy) was killed and Omar Ajaj suffered gunshot wounds.
	
	
	It is important to remember that the offender is not charged with any offence relating to the wounding of Omar Ajaj. There is no evidence that she knew that he would be present and no intention that anybody, apart from Mohammed Hamzy, would be shot. Jamil Qaumi then shot Mahmoud Hamzy in the head at close range. The three shooters then ran from the premises and got into the car, which was waiting outside with its engine running.
	
	
	The events that followed do not form part of the objective facts of the offence to which the offender pleaded guilty in count 1. In an assessment of the criminality of this particular count, they are to be disregarded. However, they form part of the overall criminality and are encompassed by her participation in the criminal group. They also provide insight into the offender's state of knowledge of the extreme nature of the group's activities when she became involved in the shooting at the Chokolatta Cafe.
	
	
	The offender drove the shooters from the scene. As they made their escape, both witness L and Jamil Qaumi boasted that they had shot ""LC"". Jamil Qaumi said, ""I killed him, I killed LC, did you see all the blood coming out of his head, he is dead for sure, I think the other one is dead too."" The group separated for a time and regrouped later. The offender took the weapons and returned them to Jamil Qaumi at a later meeting. The car used to execute the killing, which was a hire car, was burned. Later, the group (including the offender) reported back to Farhad Qaumi. Jamil Qaumi told his brother ""We got him, we got LC"" and said that he was sure that he was dead because ""I shot him in the head."" The offender drove Farhad Qaumi away from the meeting. At one stage, police stopped the vehicle and spoke to the offender and Farhad Qaumi. The offender and Farhad Qaumi told the police that they were going to McDonalds but were lost. Nothing was located in a search of the vehicle, the guns having been taken from the scene by other members of the group.
	
	
	Ballistics examination established that three weapons were used. These were a 0.38 Smith & Wesson ""special"" revolver Model 36-1, a 0.38 Smith & Wesson Model 10 and a 0.45 ACP.
	
	
	Omar Ajaj and Mahmoud Hamzy were taken to hospital. Ajaj was treated for gunshot wounds to his knee, thigh and abdomen. Mahmoud Hamzy died of gunshot wounds. The post-mortem examination showed three wounds to the head as well as wounds to the scrotum, base of the spine and left leg.
	
	
	The shooting at Revesby Heights was a callous, carefully planned and well executed crime. It represents criminality of the highest order. One man was killed and another suffered serious injuries. The two victims just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The offence involved the use of three dangerous weapons. The planning included the setting up of a false alibi, the use of gloves and balaclavas and the use of a hired getaway car that was later burned. All of this was designed to avoid detection.
	
	
	In assessing the criminality of the offender in resect of count 1, I must disregard the shooting of Omar Ajaj, her actions in helping the offenders to flee the scene, her involvement in disposing of the weapons and her assistance to Farhad Qaumi in avoiding detection.
	
	
	The offender's role was an important one. Whatever her motivation was, it was the offender who provided Farhad Qaumi with the final excuse to put into place his plan to murder his rival. It was the offender who drove the shooters to the scene and waited while they executed the wrong man. While her action in helping them to escape cannot form part of the role she played as an accessory before the fact, it cannot be ignored as it demonstrates the extent to which she participated in the criminal group, conduct that is caught by the offence on the Form 1. Even allowing for the fact that she was following directions, her role was an active one. She participated knowing that the intention of the BFL Blacktown was to take human life in what can only be described as an execution, albeit that the wrong Hamzy was killed.
	
	
	However, the offender’s role arose by chance when she happened upon Farhad Qaumi when she was driving, with her mother, to a barbecue on the afternoon that the shooting took place. This chance meeting occurred near a gym in Parramatta that was on the offender’s route to the barbecue. It was not a place that Farhad Qaumi was generally known to frequent. Farhad Qaumi told her to take her mother to the barbeque and return. She did so and from that point events developed rapidly. There was little time for calm consideration of what she should do. Later, her mother thought that the offender was acting differently – “she wasn't herself, she was upset”.  [4]  It was not until almost the last moment that Farhad Qaumi instructed her that she was to be the driver.
	
	
	Whether her objective criminality is diminished because she was acting under duress is a matter that will be considered separately.
	


Count 2 - The Chokolatta Cafe Shooting


	
	A few days after the Hamzy killing, Farhad Qaumi left for Thailand. Before departing he told the offender that he wanted to ""get"" Michael Odisho, Masood Zakaria, Mahmoud Sanoussi, Abdul Abu-Mahmoud (known as ""Abs"") and Mohammed Hamzy's brothers. The offender considered most of these men to be her friends. There were two shootings, directed at Michael Odisho and Masood Zakaria, the details of which are known to me because of evidence given in the pre-trial hearing. Those shootings form no part of the case presented against the offender. There is no evidence on sentence that she was aware of those incidents or played any role in them.
	
	
	However, on 6 November 2013 police observed the offender meeting with Jamil Qaumi. According to the offender (and the agreed facts on sentence), Jamil asked her whether she had information about the ""lebos"" and what they were saying about the Hamzy killing. Meetings of other members of the BFL Blacktown ensued. Later that night, the offender met with some of these people, including Mumtaz Qaumi. Mumtaz said that he had heard that ""Abs"" may be obtaining, or able to obtain, the home addresses of Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi. The offender told Mumtaz that Abs had a friend in real estate and he could easily obtain such information. Mumtaz said that ""they were going to get Abs"". The offender then attended the location of the intended shooting (the Chokolatta Cafe) with the group that intended to carry out the crime. She identified the proposed target - Abdul Abu-Mahmoud (the aforementioned ""Abs"") - and his car. The agreed facts assert that ""one of the Qaumis said that the target will be shot tonight"". The offender provided information about the closing time of the cafe.
	
	
	I formed the strong impression that, in giving her evidence, the offender attempted to minimise the importance of her role. She claimed that the principals already knew the information that she provided. It is difficult to reconcile this with the agreed facts. For example, the offender gave the following evidence:  [5] 
	


""Q. You were involved in driving to the Chokolatta cafe?

A. Yes.

Q. You pointed out the person you know as Abs?

A. No. Jamil pointed him out and said, ‘That's Abs,’ and I said, ‘Yes.’ ‘Is that

Abs?’ and I said, ‘Yes.’ I agreed.

Q. I am sorry, you agreed. In doing so was that well, let me ask you this: Was it information that you believed, well, that they didn't already have?

A. No, they all knew Abs. They used to have meetings at Abs's cafe and the Bankstown unit that Farhad originally wanted as the drug unit was right across the road from the cafe and Witness I’s brother lived in that unit at some stage so Witness I knew, Jamil knew, I didn't know what he saw, so I don't know if he knew. That was the first night I had met him.

Q. What about identifying the car?

A. They knew what he drove too.

Q. Why were you asked in relation to that?

A. I don't know if Jamil knew.""


	
	The agreed facts simply asserted:
	


""About 8.24pm, Jamil Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi, Witness I, Witness D and the offender drove to West Terrace, Bankstown to view the location for the intended shooting. The offender drove past the Chokolatta cafe where the 'target', Abdul Abu-Mahmoud was sitting. The offender pointed him out and his vehicle (parked in the driveway) to Witness I and Witness D.""


	
	At around 11pm that night three members of the BFL Blacktown attended the cafe and conducted a final reconnaissance. Mr Abu-Mahmoud and two others were seated in a blue BMW sedan. The perpetrators parked their car in a position where the BMW could not back out of its parking spot. Two of the group then approached the car and discharged their firearms (a 0.38 calibre revolver and a pump action shot gun). Mr Abu-Mahmoud suffered shotgun wounds to the right shoulder, back, neck, scalp and right hand. One of other men escaped serious injury while the third man received shotgun wounds. (The offender is not to be sentenced for the shooting of, or injuries sustained by, the other men. She is not charged with any offence relating to them.)
	
	
	The motive for this shooting is rather bizarre and its execution lacked rigour. Nevertheless, it was pre-meditated, involved some planning and was carried out in a public place with disregard to the safety of the public. Two dangerous weapons were deployed. The offender identified the victim and his car to the perpetrators and provided information (the closing time of the cafe)that facilitated the commission of the crime. I do not accept that she only told the group things that they already knew. There is no reason that they wouldhave involved her at all if they were already in possession of all of the information that they needed to execute their somewhat idiotic plan. I am unable to accept the submission that they involved her merely to ensure that she remained engaged with the group and thus would not break the silence surrounding the events that had transpired over the previous week or so.
	
	
	My assessment is that her role was quite important in the planning stages of the crime. The case represents a relatively serious example of an offence ofaccessory before the fact of discharging a firearm with intent.
	


The Form 1 Offence: Participating in a Criminal Group


	
	In sentencing for count 1, I take into account the offender's commission of a third offence, namely participating in a criminal group. The Form 1 document indicates that the offence took place over a six month period from 1 July 2013 to 8 January 2014. However, the agreed facts suggest that her active participation occurred in late October to mid November 2013.
	
	
	As I have said, this charge is capable of capturing aspects of the offender's role in the Hamzy killing that occurred after the event. However, once again, there is an element of artifice in this exercise because the offender is not to be sentenced for being an accessory after the fact to that murder, an offence that carries a greater maximum penalty (to the offence on the Form 1).
	
	
	The Form 1 offence also encompasses a third shooting incident where a man called Mr Elkadi was shot. The offender's role was to provide details of the residence of the mother of Mohammed Hamzy knowing that Farhad Qaumi was determined to commit a shooting to avenge violence that had been perpetrated on members of the BFL Blacktown. She also drove the shooter to and away from the scene. The victim suffered a bullet wound to the foot or ankle.
	
	
	Taking this offence into account gives rise to some complexity and requires a nuanced approach to the important principle that the offender must not be punished for an offence with which she is not charged. The facts before me suggest that she was, at least, an accessory to this shooting. But she is neither charged with that offence, and nor does that offence appear on the Form 1. Rather, it is simply part of what she admits was her participation in the criminal group known as the BFL Blacktown.
	
	
	The offence also captures her role as a conduit between the Hamzys and Farhad Qaumi in their agreement as to the division of territory in which they might conduct their criminal activities.
	
	
	It is a serious example of an offence under s 93T of the Crimes Act but it is only to be taken into account in a particular way.
	
	
	In sentencing for the first count, I will give greater weight to personal deterrence and to retribution. While I accept that the offender has distanced herself from the group by becoming a Crown witness, I do not accept the submission that this results in a ""limited need for specific deterrence"". On the other hand, the length of the sentence that must be imposed for the two counts on the indictment will have a salutary affect on the offender. Inevitably, the Form 1 offence means that the sentence for count 1 will be greater and the overall sentence will be longer. However, it will be nowhere near as long as it would have been if the s 93T offence had been separately charged, let alone if the offender was charged as an accessory to the Elkadi shooting offence or if it that offence that was specified in the Form 1.
	


Duress


	
	An important part of the assessment of the offender's objective criminality concerns a consideration of the extent to which she was acting under duress. Mr Dhanji SC submits that duress is a significant factor and diminishes her criminality by a substantial degree. The Crown takes a more circumspect approach.
	
	
	Duress is what might be described as a relative factor. In some cases it can provide a complete defence to a crime. In others, where the nature and extent of the duress does not completely excuse the crime at law, duress is an important mitigating feature. This has always been the case at common law and s 21A(3)(d) of the Sentencing Act makes specific provision that duress if a mitigating feature. However, the extent to which duress mitigates the objective criminality varies from case to case.
	
	
	I accept that the offender was out of her depth and fearful and I accept that she was intimidated by Farhad Qaumi. I also accept that she was acting under some degree of duress. The extent to which that is so, is difficult to assess. The evidence of duress largely comes from the offender and the independent evidence cuts both ways.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence that Farhad Qaumi often threatened her. These threats were both explicit threats against her life and that of her family (specifically her mother) but also implied threats whereby Farhad would remind her that he knew where her mother lived or, at times when she was avoiding contact with him, turn up unannounced outside of her mother’s house. The offender gave evidence that on four occasions, he forced her to have sex with him against her will.
	
	
	She gave evidence that “[h]e told me that if I told anyone, he would kill me. Um, if I went to the police, he'd kill me and my family”. [6]  She also gave evidence of an occasion when he arrived at her house:
	


“He was going off at me, why am I ‑ why did I disappear. Why aren't I answering his calls. Threatening me again. He said, ‘Look how easy it is for me to come to your house’.”  [7] 


	
	In relation to whether she received any direct threat that caused her to participate in the Hamzy shooting, the evidence is inconsistent. In evidence, the offender gave the following evidence:
	


“He said that I have to drive, urn, that that way I can't roll on them because if I do, I'll get charged for murder too and that it would be Witness L, the other guy, and Jamil and me, and that I would have to drive and that if I didn't drive, that he would feed me to the sharks.

Q. What did you say?

A. I said ‘No, I'm not driving.’

Q. Where was your mother at this time?

A. In the car. I said I had to go, my mum's sick, I have to take care of her.

Q. What was said in relation to that?

A. He said that my mum won't have a daughter, he's going to feed me to the

sharks.” [8] 


	
	By contrast, in paragraph 28 of her statement of 10 February 2016, specifically relating to the Hamzy murder, she said:
	


“28. Farhad said make sure you fucken don’t tell anyone and was very angry. He then asked me for the name of the street where LC lived. I told Farhad that I didn’t know the street name. Around this time, Musti told Farhad that he didn’t want to drive and I could see that he looked really scared. Musti said, ‘She knows where he lives, why don’t you get her to drive (referring to me)’. I said, ‘I can’t drive, I’ve got my mum with me and I have to go’. Farhad and Mumtaz walked off talking privately for a while and then Farhad came back and said to me, ‘You’re going to fucken drive cause you’re the one that told me.’ He then said something to the effect of, ‘This will make sure you don’t tell anyone.’

29. I was petrified as Farhad was so angry and he had threatened my mother and me earlier that night. Farhad has also threatened me on previous occasions that if I told anyone about anything that he does he would, ‘Kill me or feed me to the sharks’. I had also seen Farhad beat members of his own group and he had bragged to me about pulling guns on his own gang members. I was also aware that he had shot Mustafa Shanaza. After his arrest, Farhad’s own wife, Mariah Hussein, told me that Farhad had previously pulled guns on members of his own family. Mariah also told me that Farhad had once beaten his brother Mumtaz to a pulp for some reason. He had also pulled a gun on his own father.”


	
	When I raised this inconsistency in the course of argument, Mr Dhanji SC submitted that there was no real inconsistency because “she is stating this is a repeated refrain uttered by Farhad Qaumi”. It was put that I should not focus on the small details and inconsistencies (of which there are a number). Rather, I was exhorted to approach the matter in a more global way:
	
	
	“Ultimately, what your Honour does in this exercise is determine, irrespective of exactly what was said and exactly when, whether duress was an operative force. In that sense, in my submission, your Honour needs to take a step back and look at the big picture because when you look at the big picture, in the absence of duress, there is an absence of any rational explanation …” [9] 
	
	
	It was submitted that the offender’s evidence of duress receives some support from her mother, Detective Inspector Browne and by the expert opinion of Dr Furst and Mr Borenstein.
	
	
	Another part of the evidence that is difficult to reconcile with the proposition that the offender was acting under duress comes in the form of text messages and letters written by the offender to the Qaumi brothers in late 2013 and early 2014.  [10]  On 20 December 2013 the offender sent a message to Farhad saying “I missed ya. Please tell [Mum]taz I say hi too”. On 1 January 2014, she texted “Inshallah this year is a better year for all of us. The only good thing about last year was meeting you and your brothers because now I have three new brothers. Sweet dreams”. The letters, on their face, are worse. The first letter (undated) commences with the words “Babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy I missssssssssssssss youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu L like crazy” and concludes with “Sweet dreams Gorgeous XOXO wallah I love you so much Farhad you have no idea how much. Inshallah you get bail and are out to be with your kids and the new baby too. And of course me J. Love Always and Forever.”
	
	
	Subsequent letters were in similar, sickly sweet, terms. For example, to Farhad she wrote:
	


“Babe I fukn miss you so much.”

“Sweet dreams gorgeous.”

“Love always and forever.”


	
	She also wrote to Jamil and Mumtaz Qaumi at around the same time. Those letters were also in highly affectionate terms. At first blush, this is difficult to reconcile with the offender’s case that she was acting under duress.
	
	
	Against that, the letters demonstrated that the offender continued to do Farhad’s bidding. She said that she was communicating with solicitors to attempt to arrange bail, visiting other members of the BFL Blacktown and that she talked to Farhad’s wife “all the time and I always check on her and the kids and ask if they need anything.” She offered to bring Jamil Qaumi “more socks and undies”. She put her mobile telephone number on Jamil’s gaol account so that he could call her.
	
	
	The letters also contain deliberate falsehoods. For example, there was a repeated refrain that the Qaumi brothers were innocent and she claimed (falsely) that she had a “broken bone in her leg”. That last piece of misinformation is significant because it reflects a telephone call that occurred on 20 December 2013 that was covertly recorded by investigating police.  [11]  In that call, recorded before Farhad went into custody, she told Farhad “I’ve fractured two bones in my leg” and that she was “on crutches … and in a ‘[moon] boot’”. The offender says that she perpetrated this lie in an attempt to avoid contact with Farhad Qaumi. This is supported by his response: “It doesn’t explain why you didn’t answer my messages”.
	
	
	Both Dr Furst (a forensic psychiatrist) and Mr Borenstein (a clinical psychologist) gave evidence that supported the offender’s evidence. Each considered that she exhibited symptoms of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Each made a diagnosis to that effect. Even in the face of the text messages and letters to which I have referred, both experts maintained their opinion. At one stage in his evidence Dr Furst acknowledged that some of the language employed “on the face of it, would appear to be inconsistent with her being fearful” but he went on to explain “unless she's wanting to go along with someone and trying to convince them that she still sees them in a positive way or wants to please them in some way.” In this regard, there remained a prospect that Farhad Qaumi or his brothers would be released on bail and, as the offender told Mr Borenstein in terms of her current predicament, “he has got people everywhere”. [12]  The correct approach to such expert evidence was explained by Allsop P (as his Honour then was) in Devaney v R [2012] NSWCCA 285 at [88]:
	


“88. It is one thing to discount admissible statements made to a psychiatrist or psychologist if the offender is not prepared to give evidence to the same effect; … it is quite another to lessen the effect of the opinion of a professional psychiatrist, without cross-examination, when that opinion is based on history. In most cases, a psychiatrist will form a diagnosis from what is said to her or him; that is the very nature of the professional expertise being deployed. Part of the professional skill of the psychiatrist is the assessment of the history - how it accords with hypothesised and formed views of the professional. To say that the applicant was manipulating the psychiatrists is to criticise the professional opinions of the psychiatrists and should be put to them.”


	
	Nevertheless, it is for me – not the experts – to assess all of the evidence to determine whether I accept that the offender acted under duress and, if so, the extent to which that factor should operate as a mitigating feature.
	
	
	The offender’s evidence also receives support in the evidence of Detective Inspector Browne. Mr Browne emphasised the pattern of behaviour exhibited by Farhad Qaumi including his use of threats and intimidation to get people to follow his directions and orders.
	
	
	I must take into account the fact that there seems to have been no complaint to anybody that she was under threat from Farhad Qaumi or that he sexually assaulted her. Of course, her fear and PTSD may explain an absence of complaint. It is well recognised that victims of sexual assault are often reluctant to complain and that delay in complaint is a neutral factor in assessing the credibility of such an allegation. When the pre-trial hearing commenced, my observation of the offender in the dock was that she was quite affectionate and friendly towards the Qaumi brothers. This observation is confirmed in one of her statements where she said she was on “reasonably good terms” with them and “mainly sat with the three Qaumi brothers”. [13]  This is not consistent with the evidence that she now gives.
	
	
	Mr Dhanji SC submits that, in the absence of duress, there is simply no other explanation for the offender’s behaviour. She had nothing to gain from being involved and the targets of the crimes were people that she considered to be friends. Further, in spite of her ongoing contact with people involved in criminal activity (her brother, his friends, the Hamzy family), until her involvement with Farhad Qaumi she had never committed any serious offence. It was submitted that the evidence of the “fondness” and affection disclosed in the letters should be treated with caution because, to accept it, I “would have to get to the point where [I accepted that the offender was] lacking all humanity to remain on fond terms”. [14]  The difficulty with this submission, and a number of other submissions concerning an assessment of the offender’s state of mind (duress) and character, is that it proceeds from an assumption that people are either one thing or the other. It is couched in absolute terms. This is contrary to my understanding of the complexity and contradictions of human nature. As Callinan J observed in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 “[c]haracter is not, as has been observed, a one-dimensional feature of any person”. Based on all of the evidence, I have concluded that the offender’s feelings towards Farhad Qaumi and his brothers were complex and contradictory.
	
	
	But even allowing for that conclusion, and after considerable hesitation, I have concluded on the balance of probabilities that the offender took part in the crimes with which she is charged while acting under a degree of duress. In reaching that conclusion, I have considered all of the evidence and the careful and persuasive submissions of senior counsel. I accept that a number of threats were made against the offender and her mother. I accept that Farhad Qaumi showed up, unannounced, at her house and reminded the offender of how easy it was to find her. I accept that he used intimidation and fear to create in the offender a feeling of helplessness. She was out of her depth. On the day of the Hamzy killing, events unfolded quickly and – from the offender’s perspective – unexpectedly. When she acted as an accessory to the shooting of Mr Abu-Mahmoud, she was fearful that a failure to co-operate with Jamil and Mumtaz Qaumi would get back to Farhad, and that his repeated threats remained a significant factor operating in her mind.
	
	
	In reaching those conclusions, I am influenced by the supporting evidence of the experts and Detective Inspector Browne as well as the fact that, before 29 October 2013, the offender had never been involved in such activities. I accept the evidence of Mr El Cheikh that the conduct was out of character and that, before her relationship with Farhad Qaumi, the offender had “nothing serious” in her criminal history and that, when she was involved in the offences, she was “way out of her depth”.
	


An Assessment of the Objective Criminality After Taking Into Account the Duress


	
	The finding that the offender was acting under duress is an important factor in assessing her objective criminality. However, the offences remain extremely serious. It cannot be forgotten that one human life was taken and another was targeted. Nor can it be forgotten that the offender knew this and could have been under no illusions of the seriousness of the crimes that she was facilitating.
	
	
	Further, as the learned Crown Prosecutor submitted, the offender allowed herself to remain involved with the BFL and Farhad Qaumi in spite of knowing that they were involved in serious gangland activity. She knew they were involved in drug supply. She knew that they had reached agreement as to the areas in which such drug running would be conducted. She knew that they used guns and that Farhad Qaumi had previously shot and killed two people, albeit that the offender believed that he did so in self-defence; and so found a jury.
	
	
	In the end, even allowing for the finding of duress, the offender’s criminality in respect of each of the offences was significant. In each case, there is a significant aggravating feature arising under s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act. In the Hamzy shooting, the principal offence took place in the home of the intended victim, Mohammed Hamzy. The offender knew that this was so and was chosen to drive because she knew the location of the residence. That is an aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(eb) – “the offence was committed in the home of the victim or any other person”. I appreciate that the offender’s actions occurred outside of the home but, whether the precise terms of the section are engaged or not, this is a matter that aggravates the objective criminality of count 1. Similarly, the Chokolatta Café shooting was committed “without regard for public safety”: s 21A(2)(i). In each case “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”: s 21A(2)(n). I take that into account in assessing the criminality for the second count. However, in relation to the first count, that aspect of the criminality is caught by the offence on the Form 1 and that has resulted in some (relatively small) increment in the sentence. The application of s 21A(2)(n) should not result in that aggravating feature receiving further attention in an assessment of the criminality in count 1.
	
	
	Insofar as it is useful and convenient to use relative terms in such assessments, I consider that her objective criminality in being an accessory before the fact to the Hamzy murder was in the mid-range of objective seriousness contemplated by such offences. In the shooting of Mr Abu-Mahmoud, her criminality was below the putative and hypothetical mid-range. In adopting such terminology, I should not be understood to be engaging in any way the provisions relevant to the standard non-parole period. I am merely recording my assessment of where the offences fall relative to the wide range of offences and conduct that might be caught by offences charged under s 346 in combination with ss 18 and 33A of the Crimes Act.
	


thE OFFENDER'S PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, prospects of rehabilitation and contrition


	
	The offender was born in 1982 and will shortly turn 34 years of age.
	
	
	She has a criminal record of no real relevance in the context of her present legal troubles. A charge of possessing a weapon was dismissed without conviction in 2001. She was fined for assaulting a police officer in 2003, placed on a bond for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2008 and fined for possessing drugs in 2007. Even though the assault occasioning bodily harm carries a maximum penalty of 5 years and is, by definition under the Sentencing Act, a ""serious personal violence offence"", I do not consider that her record is an aggravating feature: cf s 21A(2)(d). I take the view that she does not have a significant record of previous convictions and that, while she is not entitled to the kind of leniency given to a first offender, she is entitled to a degree of leniency. It is, to that extent, a mitigating feature: s 21A(3)(e). On the other hand, her minor criminal history, her participation in a criminal group for six months, her long-term relationship with a notorious criminal (Bassam Hamzy) and her willingness to accept the role as a conduit between Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi mean that, in spite of the positive accounts of the referees, I am not satisfied that that the offender was a person of good character in the time leading up to the offences.
	
	
	Apart from the experts, two witnesses were called on behalf of the offender. Both of them were impressive and I believed their evidence.
	
	
	The first was her mother. She gave evidence that confirmed aspects of the offender’s account of her involvement in the Hamzy murder. The offender is the youngest of her children and she has been, for many years, her mother’s carer. The mother suffers from a number of illnesses that mean that she needs significant assistance in day to day living. She expressed surprise that the offender became involved in offences as serious as these even though she knew of her daughter’s relationships with others involved in criminal activity.
	
	
	The second witness was Omar El Cheikh. Mr El Cheikh was in a relationship with the offender for some time and has remained her friend since that time. He was aware of her relationship “with criminals” but did not believe that she was involved in criminal activity herself. He believed that she would not be in the trouble that she is in if it had not been for the job offer from MC and the renewal of her association with Bassam Hamzy and her subsequent involvement with Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	I have also considered the positive references provided by Saha El-Cheikh, David McDonald, Lisa McCarthy and Robert Melham. They describe her as honest, reliable, good natured, and a loving and caring daughter. The referees found it difficult to understand how the person that they knew could be involved in such serious offences.
	
	
	As I have said, Dr Furst and Mr Borenstien were of the opinion that the offender suffers PTSD and had that condition when she committed the offences. While I accept the diagnosis, my view is that the matter has little impact on a proper assessment of the offender’s moral culpability or objective criminality. Nor do I accept that the condition impacts on the weight to be given to general deterrence. I do accept that it will make her condition of incarceration more onerous and I take the matter into account in assessing the appropriate length of the sentence.
	
	
	The offending occurred in the context of the offender’s interaction with both sides of the gangland turf war that was played out between the rival chapters of the BFL. Because a member of the Hamzy family was killed and because she is giving evidence against members of the BFL Blacktown, her ties to criminal underworld appear to have been severed. Material in the confidential evidence confirms that. In view of her lack of serious criminal offences, the length of the sentence to be imposed and other aspects of her character, I am satisfied that she is “unlikely to re-offend” and that she has “good prospects of rehabilitation”. [15] 
	
	
	As to remorse, I am unable to come to a positive finding on the balance of probability. I did not find her evidence on this subject, and generally, to be particularly persuasive. Where I have made findings in her favour, I have done so because her evidence receives support from other evidence. I accept Mr Dhanji’s submission that it is not necessary for the offender’s evidence to be corroborated, but her account is self-serving and her demeanour was not convincing.
	
	
	Her evidence in relation to remorse was elicited as follows:
	


“Q. And in relation to the first of those shootings, it resulted in the death of Mahmoud Hamzy?

A. Yes.

Q. What can you say about your responsibility for that crime?

A. With Mahmoud?

Q. Mahmoud Hamzy.

A. Can you ask me again? Like I don't understand.

Q. How do you feel about what you have done?

A. I'm devastated.

Q. Is there anything that you would like to say about what you have done?

A. Um, look honestly, nothing I say is going to bring the guy back. He was a good friend of mine. He wasn't a trouble maker. He was innocent. Nothing like that should have happened to him and obviously I've had time to reflect on everything. I didn't want to do it in the first place. I was forced to do it. And I'm going to have to live with that for the rest of my life. I'm sorry for what I've done to his family because I put myself in their position and if someone had done anything like that to my nephew or someone like that that I love, I don't know how I'd cope. Just extremely sorry and if I could go back in time, I would change it. I would have gone to the police straight away.

Q. What about the fact that you then continued on and involved yourself in those two further shootings?

A. I don't think you understand exactly what was happening to me. Like I'm a girl. I've got all these guys with guns threatening me, threatening my family. And I'm extremely sorry for everything that happened, all the innocent people that got hurt.”


	
	As this evidence was given, I was not persuaded that the offender either appreciated the gravity of the crime or that she had truly accepted responsibility for her actions. On this issue, I am not assisted to any real degree by the evidence of others (the experts, the referees, her mother or Mr El Cheikh). Because it came so late, her plea of guilty (and offer of assistance) is equivocal on the issue. [16]  Particularly in view of the restrictive way in which the statute allows remorse to be considered to be a mitigating feature, [17]  I am unable to find that the offender is remorseful. Even in the absence of the statute, I would not have been satisfied on this issue.
	


PARITY AND PROPORTIONALITY


	
	Principles of equal justice require that I consider the sentencing outcomes in some other cases in order to ensure that the sentence that I impose does not engender a justifiable sense of grievance in the offender. There must be due and proper proportion between the sentences imposed on offenders who are sentenced for their participation in the same offences. This principle applieswhether the offenders are charged with the precisely the same offences orwith different offences arising from the same or related circumstances. It isnot a matter to be approached technically, let alone mathematically. Rather, it is an important principle to be applied pragmatically and with a sense of fairness and justice, giving effect to relevant similarities and differences between the cases.
	
	
	The sentences imposed on three co-offenders have been drawn to my attention. One of these is relevant to the Hamzy murder while the other two relate to the shooting at the Chokolatta Café.
	
	
	Reference was made to the sentence imposed on NK: R v NK (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 125.  NK was sentenced for being one of the shooters in the Hamzy murder but, for reasons best known to the parties, his plea of guilty under s 33 of the Crimes Act was accepted. There were two counts arising out of that incident encompassing the infliction of grievous bodily harm (with intent) of both Mahmoud Hamzy and Omar Ajaj. The maximum penalty for each count was 25 years and there was a standard non-parole period of 7 years. This is to be compared with the maximum penalty of life imprisonment that applies to the present offender. NK's case raised issues of totality because he was charged with a number of other serious offences including an allegation of specially aggravated breaking and entering (maximum penalty 20 years), the large commercial supply of drugs (maximum penalty of life imprisonment) and, most significantly, the cold blooded contract murder of a man called Joseph Antoun. I was not satisfied that duress was a prominent feature of his involvement in the Hamzy shooting, although I did conclude that he was acting under substantial duress when he shot Mr Antoun in the presence of the victim's wife and the close proximity of his young twin daughters. His assistance and plea of guilty warranted a reduction in sentence of 60%. NK presented a moving personal case, the relevance of which is explained in the judgment on sentence.
	
	
	I imposed an aggregate sentence of 21 years with a non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months. That sentence, arrived at after the application of the 60% discount, encompassed all of the criminality in the five counts, noting that there were other offences taken into account in sentencing on some of the counts. In imposing that aggregate sentence, it was necessary to indicate the sentence that would have been imposed on the individual counts. The indicative sentences were themselves affected by the application of the totality principle.
	
	
	Relevantly, for the count relating to the shooting of Mr Hamzy, I indicated a sentence involving a starting point of 12 years. After the application of the 60% discount, the indicative sentence was 4 years and 10 months. Because a standard non-parole period applied, it was necessary to specify an indicative non-parole period (3 years and 7 ½ months).
	
	
	Two men (known as MM and WK) were sentenced on 17 March 2016 by Judge North in the District Court in relation to their involvement in the Chokolatta Café shooting.
	
	
	MM was sentenced in relation to a number of other offences and received an aggregate sentence. In relation to the Chokolatta Café incident, he pleaded guilty to an offence under s 33A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, that is the principal offence in relation to which the present offender pleaded guilty to being an accessory before the fact. Judge North indicated a starting point of 10 years. After the application of a 55% discount, a sentence of 4 years and 6 months was indicated.
	
	
	WK was sentenced in relation to six offences, three of which arose out of the Chokolatta Café shooting. Judge North indicated a starting point of 10 years in respect of each of those offences. WK received a total discount of 60%, resulting in an indicative sentence of 4 years for each of the three counts.
	
	
	As with the sentencing of NK, there are complications arising from the fact that the principle of totality had a significant role to play and there was an imposition of an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	While the Crown Prosecutor informed me that there was to be an appeal against the asserted inadequacy of the sentences imposed on MM and WK, it is unclear whether the grounds of that appeal will impeach the starting point with which I am dealing. In any event, the Crown accepts that those indicative starting points remain extant and must be used in the application of equal justice principles.
	
	
	Needless to say, it is difficult to apply principles of parity and proportionality in the circumstances of the present case. One common feature of the sentencing of both NK and the present offender is the degree of artificiality that arises as a result of the particular offences with which each is to be sentenced. The offender is to be sentenced for her role in the taking of human life, and for an offence that carries life imprisonment. That was not the case with NK (at least in relation to the Hamzy murder). As to MM and WK, their roles were (self-evidently) more substantial than the offender’s role in the Chokolatta Café shooting. There were also differences in the personal cases presented on behalf of the co-offenders. NK’s subjective case was particularly compelling.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, as well as the finding of duress and relevant personal features of the cases, I intend to impose a sentence on the offender that is in due proportion with the sentences that were indicated in respect of her co-offenders. My aim is to ensure that she is not left with a justifiable sense of grievance arising out of a comparison between the sentences.
	


IMPACT ON THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES


	
	Section 28 of the Sentencing Act provides for the provision of victim impact statements and the method in which they are to be used by a sentencing court. Section 28(4) provides:
	


“(4) A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community.”


	
	No victims' impact statements were provided in this case. All I know is that one man was killed and that another suffered serious injuries. I assume, and proceed on the basis, that the provision in s 28(4) does not mean that the taking of human life in the present case is to be treated less seriously than it would be in a case where family members provided evidence pursuant to the section. [18] 
	
	
	To the family and friends of Mahmoud Hamzy, I express the Court’s deep sympathy.
	


GENERAL SENTENCING PRINCIPLES


	
	In determining the appropriate sentence, I have taken into account the purposes of punishment set out in s 3A of the Sentencing Act as well as the established principles of sentencing at common law. The offender must be adequately punished and made accountable for her actions and her conduct must be denounced. The sentence must protect the community from the offender and attempt to prevent crime by deterring her and others from committing similar offences. I must do more than pay lip service to these concepts. The penalty actually imposed must reflect those purposes.
	
	
	At the same time, I must attempt to promote the rehabilitation of the offender. Her plea of guilty and offer to assist the authorities is a significant first step in this process. Her involvement in the killing of Mahmoud Hamzy has decisively ended her relationship with those members of the Hamzy family who are involved in criminal activity. Similarly, her relationship with the Qaumi brothers has been terminated by her offer to give evidence against them. Her involvement in such serious offences arose because of these connections, all of which have now been severed seemingly once and for all.
	
	
	I have paid careful attention to the maximum penalty in relation to each offence and have considered the standard non-parole periods that apply to the principle offences in the limited manner that I have articulated above.
	
	
	I have synthesised the diverse and countervailing considerations in determining what is an appropriate punishment for these extremely serious offences whilst also taking into account the unique circumstances of this individual offender.
	


PARTICULAR FINDINGS RELEVANT TO SECTION 21A.


	
	Section 21A(2) of the Sentencing Act provides a list aggravating factors whiles sub-section (3) provides a list of mitigating factors. In spite of those provisions, remarks (or judgments) on sentence should not become a check list. [19]  However, I suppose it is appropriate to indicate (or re-state) my findings especially in relation to matters where controversy might attend my remarks. Where the factor is clearly not relevant, I will not make reference to the particular paragraph of the relevant sub-sections.
	
	
	In terms of aggravating features referred to in s 21A(2), and adopting the paragraphs numbers therein:
	



	
	(b) Violence is an inherent part of both offences and this factor does not further aggravate the objective criminality.
	
	
	(c) The use of weapons is not uncommon in murder cases but it is not an element of the offence and the number of weapons employed in count 1 is a matter of some significance in an assessment of the gravity of the offence. Categorising it as “aggravating” under the section is not a particularly helpful exercise. The use of a weapon is an inherent feature of the offence in count 2.
	
	
	(d) As I have explained, I do not consider that the offender’s record of convictions to be an aggravating factor.
	
	
	(e) Any offence of accessory before the fact necessarily involves more than one offender. Each of the principal offences was committed in company and that forms part of my assessment of the objective criminality. However, I do not consider that this fact aggravates the offence within the terms of the section.
	
	
	(ea) The fact that count 1 was committed in the home of a person other than the victim is an aggravating feature.
	
	
	(f) There is no evidence of gratuitous cruelty.
	
	
	(g) There is no evidence that the injury, emotional harm etc is beyond that inherent in each of the offences charged. Clearly the injury is substantial in each case but that is in the very nature of the offences.
	
	
	(i) The disregard to public safety involved in count 2 is an aggravating feature in relation to that count.
	
	
	(n) While the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity, that fact is encompassed in the offence on the Form 1. I have not treated it as a further aggravating feature in respect of count 1. The planning in relation to both counts has been considered in assessing the objective criminality.
	
	
	(o) There is no evidence that the offence was committed (by the offender) for financial gain.
	



	
	In terms of the mitigating features in s 21A(3):
	



	
	(d) I have found that the offender was acting under duress.
	
	
	(e) I have found that the offender does not have a significant record of previous conviction.
	
	
	(f) I am not persuaded that the offender was a person of good character.
	
	
	(h) I am satisfied that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	(i) I am not satisfied that the offender is remorseful.
	
	
	(j) While I accept the evidence that the offender was suffering from PTSD, I do not accept she was not fully aware of the consequences of her actions.
	
	
	(j), (k) and (l) I have dealt with the offender’s plea of guilty, willingness to facilitate the course of justice and assistance elsewhere in this judgment.
	


COMPARATIVE CASES AND STATISICS


	
	The statistical database maintained by the New South Wales Judicial Commission discloses only one offence of accessory before the fact to murder. That offence attracted a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and six months. Little is known of the circumstances of that case apart from the fact that it was a plea of guilty to one offence (with matters on a Form 1) and the offender was older than 50 years.
	
	
	However, the diligence of Senior Counsel for the offender has uncovered two cases considered by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal: Kanaan & Ors v R [2006] NSWCCA 109 [20]  and Aoun v R [2007] NSWCCA 292.
	
	
	I accept Mr Dhanji’s submissions that each of those offences involved greater criminality than the present case. Neither involved a finding of duress and each of the offenders pleaded not guilty. The sentences imposed in those cases (respectively, 22 years with a non-parole period of 16½ years and 17 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 13 years) demonstrate the seriousness with which the offence of accessory before the fact to murder is to be treated. However, in each case, the starting point is substantially higher than that which is appropriate in the present case. The role of the offender was less significant, her involvement (in the Hamzy shooting) extended over a limited period of time and she was influenced by duress.
	
	
	I have considered the sentencing outcomes in these cases but, ultimately, the present case must be determined by reference to its own peculiar factual circumstances.
	


Accumulation, concurrence and totality


	
	The offender accepts that there must be a degree of accumulation between the sentences. While the two offences were connected, they involved two discrete and serious crimes committed around a week apart. There were separate victims, one of whom was killed and one of whom was seriously injured. The actions of the offender that constitute her offence of being an accessory before the fact were different, separate and distinct. While the principle of totality and the obvious connections between the offences require a degree of concurrency, there must be a substantial degree of accumulation.
	


PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY, “QUASI CUSTODY” BY “HOUSE ARREST” AND THE Commencement date OF SENTENCE


	
	The offender’s sentence should be back-dated to take into account the 38 days that she spent in custody in the early days of her remand period. [21]  The offender went into custody on 29 March 2016 at the conclusion of the evidence adduced on sentence. [22]  Accordingly, based on 38 days of custody before that date, the parties agree that the commencement date of the sentence would be 20 February 2016. [23] 
	
	
	It was submitted that the offender’s bail conditions constituted a form of “quasi custody” such that it may be appropriate further to back-date the sentence by taking into account, on a pro-rata or proportionate basis, the time that she has been subject to what has been, in effect, a form of house arrest or, as one of the referees put it, home detention. An analogy is drawn with cases where a similar approach has been taken when an offender has been required by her bail condition to remain in a secure drug rehabilitation facility: see for example, R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243, R v Eastaway (unreported, NSWCCA 19 May 1992) and Hughes v R [2008] NSWCCA 48.
	
	
	In R v AC (No 3) (Detention application) [2016] NSWSC 209, I refused the Crown Prosecutor’s detention application after the offender entered her pleas of guilty. Up until that point she had been on bail, subject to the following conditions imposed by Campbell J on 27 November 2014:
	


“1. To be of good behavior.

2. Report to Marrickville Police daily between 8:00am and 8:00pm.

3. Surrender passport to Parramatta Court Registry by 4:00pm on 27 November 2014 (noted this has already been complied with from an earlier occasion).

4. Not to approach any points of international departure and not to apply for any travel documents.

5. Reside at 89 Wardell Road, Dulwich Hill NSW 2203.

6. Not to associate or contact by any means any relative of any alleged co-offender.

7. Not to go within 1km of any correctional facility.

8. Not to attempt to contact any Crown witness by any means including any telecommunication device.

9. Acceptable person to enter into agreement to forfeit the sum of $1,400,000.00 if the accused fails to comply with the bail undertaking

10(1). Not to leave residential premises for any reason except to report to the police.

station and to attend court and to do so by the most direct route;

10(2). To attend legal appointments as arranged by Mr Khatiz details of which are to be provided to Det Sgt Glen Browne or his delegate.

10(3). To attend hospital in case of emergency or doctor's surgery - evidence to be provided to D/Sgt Glen Browne or his delegate.

10(4). To possess or use one mobile telephone - the telephone number of which is to be provided to D/Sgt Glen Browne or his delegate within 24 hours of purchase. Any breach to result in an automatic revocation of bail

11. Not to associate with any person(s) included on a list of names which may be provided by the OIC or his delegate

12. Not to contact any inmate in a NSW Correctional Centre.”


	
	There were variations to these conditions from time to time. For example, her residence was changed at one stage to an address elsewhere in Sydney. However, the condition set out at 10 above (that is, the house arrest condition) remained in place until I relaxed it on 9 February 2016 during the course of the pre-trial hearing. From 9 February, until she entered her plea, she remained subject to an onerous curfew condition.
	
	
	I accept that these conditions amounted to a form of house arrest and that they were very onerous. I have taken those conditions into account in determining the appropriate sentence.
	
	
	However, generally speaking, the authorities in which there has been a specific back-dating of the sentence are those where an offender is required to live in a residential rehabilitation programme. As onerous as the conditions were, the offender was able to live in her family home for a period and then at another residential property of her choosing. There is no suggestion that any request for variation was refused or opposed or that the conditions of her bail involved the kinds of strictures that apply to patients at rehabilitation centres such as Odyssey House, The Glen or Bennelong Haven. Further, even in such cases, there is no requirement for the sentence to be back-dated. In R v Sullivan [2004] NSWCCA 99, Bell J (as her Honour then was) said:
	


“66. The applicant relied on R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 at 258-9. In that case the Court took into account a period of eight months spent by the applicant under the supervision of the Australian Federal Police while he was assisting them with their inquiries. His living situation was described as one of quasi-custody and he was given credit for 75% of that period. Reliance was also placed on R v Eastway (unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 May 1992. The respondent to the Crown appeal in that case had spent a period of 14 months at Odyssey House. The primary judge allowed approximately a 50% deduction in recognition of the time spent at Odyssey House. The Court did not consider that the judge erred in approaching the matter on that basis and the Crown appeal was dismissed.

67. Neither Cartwright nor Eastway require that a sentencing judge quantify a discount in relation to the period spent by an offender in a residential treatment program or the like. The circumstance that the applicant had spent a period of ten months in what the Judge characterised as a quasi-custodial position was a factor that he took into account.”


	
	I do not propose to back-date the sentence by reference to a mathematically calculated percentage of the time spent on bail conditions that might be described as “quasi-custodial”. However, the onerous nature of those conditions and the applicant’s strict compliance with them is relevant to the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion in a number of ways. First, as she put it, her life was on hold for that lengthy period. Second, her opportunities for recreation in the community were severely constrained. Third, her compliance with the conditions speaks eloquently of her prospects of rehabilitation. Accordingly, I have given this matter some weight in determining an appropriate sentence.
	


special circumstances


	
	Pursuant to s 44 of the Sentencing Act, I am satisfied that there are special circumstances justifying a reduction of the portion of the sentence that should be spent in custody. That is, I will reduce the non-parole period for each sentence below 75% of the total sentence imposed for each offence.
	
	
	The special circumstances include the onerous conditions of her present and future custody, noting that this matter was part of an assessment of the discount for assistance but also noting that it has particular significance to an assessment of the non-parole period: cf, for example, Bugmy v The Queen [1990] HCA 18;169 CLR 525 at 533 (Mason CJ and McHugh J, dissenting in the outcome), Griffiths v The Queen [1989] HCA 39; 167 CLR 372 at 379 (Brennan and Dawson JJ), R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 at 116 (Samuels JA); and see R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 at [48], [51] (Basten JA). Secondly, after a lengthy period of time in such custodial conditions, the offender will need a substantial period on parole to assist in her re-integration into the community. Finally, in finding special circumstances, I also take into account the partial accumulation of the sentence and the fact that the adjustment of the non-parole period for the individual sentence will be diminished by the accumulation of sentence.
	
	
	I am conscious of the fact that the partial accumulation of the sentence will result in a total non-parole period that is around 68.5% of the total sentence. Any further reduction in the non-parole period would result in a period spent in custody that is unreasonably disproportionate to the gravity of the crimes for which the offender must be sentenced, even allowing for her entitlement to a substantial discount.
	


sentence


	
	For the offence of being an accessory before the fact to murder, the starting point for the sentence will be 16 years. Applying the discount of 50% results in a sentence of 8 years. I find special circumstances and adjust the non-parole period while noting that the conditions of incarceration have already played a role in the assessment of an appropriate discount for assistance. The non-parole period will be 5 years.
	
	
	For the offence of being an accessory before the fact to the shooting with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, the starting point will be 9 years. Applying the discount of 50% results in a sentence of 4½ years. With a finding of special circumstances the non-parole period will be 3 years.
	
	
	There will be accumulation between the sentences to the extent of 18 months. This will result in a total effective sentence of 9 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months.
	
	
	I will now formally impose sentence:
	



	
	For the offence of being an accessory before the fact to discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (Count 2) you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 20 February 2016 and expiring on 19 February 2019. There will be a balance of term of 1½ years expiring on 19 August 2020.
	
	
	For the offence of being an accessory before the fact to murder (Count 1), and taking into account the offence of participating in a criminal group (Form 1), you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing on 20 August 2017 and expiring on 19 August 2022. There will be a balance of term of 3 years commencing 20 August 2022 and expiring on 19 August 2025.
	
	
	You will be eligible for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period on count 1.

		23 November 2016",2016-04-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2954561,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 14) (Judge alone application) [2016] NSWSC 274,"Judgment


	
	By separate notices of motion each of the accused applies for a “trial by judge order” under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (“the Act”). The general ground upon which each accused relies is that a trial by judge alone “is in the interests of justice”: s 132(4).
	
	
	The major factual circumstance upon which that ground is founded concerns the prejudice that will arise if the trial is conducted before a jury. That prejudice arises in a number of ways. First, the case has been subject to considerable pre-trial publicity and much of this has been sensational, emotive and lacking in balance and objectivity. That pre-trial publicity also disclosed previous offences committed by some or all of the accused. The prejudice also arises from the fact that the prosecution proposes to elicit a body of evidence of uncharged criminal acts to establish that each of the accused participated in a criminal group. That body of evidence, or parts of it, may also be relied upon in other ways including as evidence of a tendency in one or other of the accused men to act in particular ways or to have a particular state of mind: see s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions does not agree to a “trial by judge order”: s 132(2). Accordingly, it falls to me to determine whether or not it is in the interests of justice to make the order sought. The Crown Prosecutor relies on the fact that a number of factual issues that are likely to arise in the trial will require “the application of objective community standards”: s 132(5).
	
	
	The principles to be applied, and the matters that might go to a proper consideration of where the interests of justice lie, have been considered in a number of cases in New South Wales: see, for example (in the Court of Criminal Appeal) R v Belghar [2012] NSWCCA 86; 217 A Crim R 1, R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 and Redman v R [2015] NSWCCA 110; (in the Supreme Court) R v King [2013] NSWSC 448, R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661, R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729, R v Gittany [2013] NSWSC 1503, R v Villalon [2013] NSWSC 1516, R v McKnight [2014] NSWSC 398, R v Trawin-Hadfield [2014] NSWSC 591, R v Farrow [2014] NSWSC 1781, R v Simmons; R v Moore (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 259 and R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357; (in the District Court) R v Markou [2011] NSWDC 25, R v GSR (No 3) [2011] NSWDC 17, R v FH [2012] NSWDC 283 and R v Tasich [2012] NSWDC 261. Similar provisions have also been considered by the courts of other States: see, for example, Arthurs v Western Australia [2007] WASC 182, Coates v Western Australia [2009] WASCA 142 and R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317.
	
	
	I reviewed the authorities in R v Simmons (No 4). I do not propose, in the course of the present judgment, to restate the various principles which are at play in an application under s 132. Reference should be made to the discussion in R v Simmons (No 4) to understand the legal landscape in which the present decision is made. Where appropriate, I will identify the areas where there is some controversy in the law and explain the approach that I take to those controversies.
	
	
	Having carefully considered the arguments of counsel and the particular facts and circumstances of the present case in the context of the law as I understand it to be, I have concluded that it is not in the interests of justice to make an order for a trial by judge alone. These are my reasons for that conclusion.
	
	
	As a result of the timing of the application, and consequent urgency with which this judgment has been prepared, my reasons may not be as comprehensive (or indeed as coherent) as they might have been if I had more time to prepare and review the judgment. To understand the factual and evidentiary matrix with which this decision is made, it is necessary to refer to my earlier judgment on severance and separate trials (R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 15) as well as some of the rulings on the admissibility of some parts of the evidence (R v Qaumi & Ors (No 4) [2016] NSWSC 114, R v Qaumi & Ors (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 113 and R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 115). Further, this judgment is to be delivered at the same time as two judgments relating to applications by some of the accused for non-publication and suppression orders and for “take down orders” compelling certain items to be removed from the internet: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 15) [2016] NSWSC 318 and R v Qaumi & Ors (No 16) [2016] NSWSC 319. Those judgments required consideration of a number of related issues, and some of the same authorities, in the context of the exercise of different statutory and inherent powers and discretions. The three judgments should be considered in conjunction with one another in order to appreciate the overall legal and factual landscape in which the decisions are made.
	


The Timing of the Applications and the Requirement for Leave


	
	The first occasion when the possibility of an application for trial by judge alone was indicated was when the matter was before the list Judge during a series of call overs. On 3 July 2015 when the list Judge indicated that I was to conduct the pre-trial hearing. At that point, Mr Young SC who appears for Mumtaz Qaumi indicated that there may be an application for trial by judge alone. Whilst that sequence of events may be seen to indicate what is often described as “judge shopping”, I accept that, in fact, Mr Young SC was merely complying with certain remarks that I made in R v Simmons (No 4) when I was critical of the tardiness of the application that was made in that case (at [24]-[25]:
	


“24. On 3 March 2015, Senior Counsel for the accused indicated that he had instructions to make an application for a judge alone trial. He indicated that he would formally make the application by notice of motion the following day although he doubted that ‘it actually needs a couple of pieces of paper to galvanise the Crown into action in the circumstances’. On 4 March 2015, Senior Counsel had in his possession the formal documents but did not seek to file them until he had taken further instructions:

‘I’m going to give my client one further opportunity to consider his position, having heard your Honour’s judgment.’

25. This was a reference to my judgment in R v Simmons (No 2), handed down earlier in the day and in which I made certain remarks about Mr Simmons’ conduct, character and willingness to engage in criminal activity of a large variety of kinds (see for example at [142]-[149]). The appearance, if not actuality, was that Mr Simmons was basing his decision around things I had said earlier in the day. This was a perfectly sound and proper forensic exercise and an appropriate discharge of counsel professional responsibility to his client. However, as I said in the course of the argument, it was an ‘unedifying spectacle’ from the point of view of appearances. It would not have occurred had the application for a judge alone trial been made in advance of the trial and in a timely fashion.”


	
	Further, the list Judge did not indicate that I was to be the trial Judge but rather that I was to case manage the matter in circumstances where it had been indicated that there were a large number of pre-trial issues to be dealt with.
	
	
	The matter first came before me on 27 July 2015. On that date, nine accused, including the remaining five accused, were arraigned. Since that time, four of the accused have ceased to take part in the proceedings for various reasons. First, one of the accused (Nazir Akbari) indicated that he wished to plead guilty and his matter was remitted to the District Court. Then, on 3 February 2016, I made an order granting two of the accused (John Bishop and Mohammed Nasiri) separate trials. Those matters were also remanded to the District Court. Finally on 3 March 2016, an accused (Witness M) entered a plea of guilty and her matter was stood over for sentence.
	
	
	I set out that chronology because it is relevant to the circumstances in which the applications for trial by judge alone have been made, seemingly, at a very late stage.
	
	
	On 27 July 2015, I made a number of case management orders. They included an order that the pre-trial hearing would commence on 2 November 2015 with the trial (or trials) to commence on 15 February 2016. The pre-trial hearings were much more complicated and lengthy than was originally anticipated. As a result, on 12 February 2016 I re-fixed the trial date so that it was scheduled to commence on 14 March 2016.
	
	
	After Court on 18 December 2015 my Associate was told by counsel that all eight accused intended to make an application for a trial by judge alone. Up until that point, I had been told that one of the accused (Witness M) did not consent to a trial by judge alone but that the remaining accused did. Over the January vacation only one accused (Farhad Qaumi) filed any notice of motion indicating that an application was to be made. Then on 3 February 2016 I was told by Mr Stratton SC (appearing for Farhad Qaumi) that two of the accused did not consent to a trial by judge alone. Section 132A(2)(a) of the Act provides that an application for a trial by judge alone “must not be made in a joint trial unless all other accused person apply to be tried by a judge alone”. This meant that the accused were prohibited from making an application for a trial by judge order until all of the co-accused applied for such an order.
	
	
	Farhad Qaumi filed a notice of motion for a trial by judge alone on or around 15 January 2016. Mumtaz Qaumi filed a notice of motion seeking an order for a judge alone trial on 28 January 2016. Each of those applications were within the 28 day time limit provided by s 132A of the Act, which is in the following terms:
	


“132A Applications for trial by judge alone in criminal proceedings 

(1) An application for an order under section 132 that an accused person be tried by a Judge alone must be made not less than 28 days before the date fixed for the trial in the Supreme Court or District Court, except with the leave of the court.”


	
	Jamil Qaumi filed a notice of motion seeking a trial by judge alone on 2 March 2016. Mohammed Kalal filed a notice of motion seeking a judge alone trial on or about 3 March 2016. Mohammad Zarshoy filed his notice of motion on 7 March 2016. At the time that those notices of motion were filed, the trial was listed to commence on 14 March 2016. Accordingly each was outside of the 28 day time limit provided by s 132A of the Act. It was conceded by counsel for Mohammed Zarshoy and Jamil Qaumi that leave was required.
	
	
	Counsel for Mohammad Kalal made the somewhat surprising and inventive submission that leave was not required because, since the notice of motion was filed, the trial date had been adjourned so that we are now scheduled to commence the trial (either with or without a jury) on 4 April 2016. Accordingly, it was submitted that the application was filed within time because it was filed more than 28 days prior to the revised trial date. That is a surprising submission given that one of the reasons that the trial date was vacated and rescheduled was the fact that the applications for trial by judge alone came at such a late stage. The postponement of the trial also arose because of the changed plea of Witness M. Nevertheless at the time the notice of motion was filed, it was out of time. I agree with the position taken by counsel for Jamil Qaumi and Mohammed Zarshoy that they require leave to pursue the application.
	
	
	However, little time needs to be spent on the question of leave because the learned Crown Prosecutor concedes that leave should be granted in the circumstances. I agree with that concession. First, the provisions of the Act to which I have referred disentitled the accused from making an application unless or until all of them made it. Until such time as Witness M (and the other unedified dissentient) finally indicated their consent to a judge alone trial, any application under s 132 was destined to fail. Accordingly, there is a clear and valid explanation for the lateness of the applications. Further, it could not be suggested that the applications are made lightly and the basis upon which the applications are made concern matters of substance.
	
	
	Accordingly, I grant leave to Mohammed Zarshoy, Mohammad Kalal and Jamil Qaumi to make an application under s 132 of the Act.
	


Some uncontroversial Principles and their relevance to the application in the present case


	
	The cases to which I have made reference establish a number of clear principles of general application when an application is made for a trial by judge alone under s 132 of the Act.
	
	
	First, there is no presumption in favour of a trial by jury: see R v Belghar. While there may be an evidentiary onus upon the accused, there is no legal onus on an accused person who seeks an order under s 132 of the Act; R v Simmons (No 4) at [57]. The accused have satisfied that evidentiary onus and the decision must turn upon a consideration of the interests of justice. There is no onus on either party.
	
	
	Next it has been held and accepted that “an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone for the asking”: R v Stanley at [42] (Barr AJ). As I said in R v Simmons (No 4) at [58]-[59]:
	


“58. In R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 Barr AJ held that “an accused cannot have a trial by judge alone for the asking”. However, the Queensland authority relied upon in support of that proposition appeared to take the view that the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld) was not “neutral” and that trials by judge alone were “exceptional”: R v Fardon [2010] QCA 317 at [81]. It is difficult to reconcile that position with the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in R v Belghar. His Honour at [96] referred to the comments in R v Fardon as obiter and rejected the proposition that the New South Wales statute required “weight to be given to the fact that, absent an application for a judge-alone trial, the trial will be with a jury”.

59. However, it must be correct that the accused has no right to demand a trial by judge alone.”


	
	On the other hand, the fact that an accused person has decided on legal advice to seek an order for a trial by judge alone is a relevant matter to be considered in determining where the interests of justice lie. Similarly, the concerns expressed by an accused through his legal representatives that he will be prejudiced in a jury trial and that he will not receive a fair trial before a jury is a factor to be taken into account. While it was held in R v Stanley at [42] that there must be more than “a mere stated apprehension without supporting evidence”, the material tendered in the present case establishes that the concerns expressed by the accused in the present case are supported by the nature and extent of the pre-trial publicity.
	
	
	This is a particularly significant factor in the present case where five separate accused, represented by five experienced and capable legal teams, seek to relinquish their right to a jury trial and, in various ways, implicitly or explicitly, expressed concerns as to the capacity of a jury to provide them with the fair trial, free of prejudice, to which each of them is entitled. I have taken their wishes and expressed concerns into account.
	
	
	The efficiencies of a judge alone trial, over a jury trial, is a matter that may form “part of the mix of issues” to be considered in a particular case: see R v Belghar, McClellan CJ at CL at [110]. However, his Honour went on to say at [111]:
	


“111. However, I would not accept that the interests of justice in s 132 can be informed by considerations of the overall efficiencies in the operation of a court which may be available from a judge-alone trial. No doubt they are important issues for the administration of justice and may ultimately lead to further legislative intervention but, as the majority determined in Pambula Hospital v Herriman (1988) 14 NSWLR 387, they are not relevant to the interests of justice in the particular case.”


	
	As I noted in R v Simmons (No 4) at [69], an example of a case where the length of the trial was a relevant consideration was the case of R v Gittany, in which the accused was unable to fund his legal team for a trial of significant length. There was evidence in that case that the trial would have been substantially longer had it been conducted before a jury. This was one of the factors which persuaded McCallum J to order a trial by judge alone. There has been no evidence in the present case, and no submissions have been made, pressing questions of efficiency as a significant factor.
	
	
	However, some counsel have expressed the concern that the nature of the evidence to be called by the Crown including the evidence of some twelve or so informant witnesses, may result in the jury being discharged due to prejudicial evidence being produced. Further, the publicity surrounding the trial may lead to similar applications for discharge of the jury. Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi pointed to a recent example: see, for example, R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357, R v McNeil (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 757.
	
	
	I have taken into account the difficulties that will attend the conduct of a jury trial and in particular the concerns expressed by counsel that prejudicial evidence and publicity may lead to applications for discharge. However, ultimately I am confident that the learned Crown Prosecutor and his team will do everything possible to ensure that no evidence beyond that which has been held or agreed to be admissible will be led. This may require particular witnesses to be kept on a tight rein and will no doubt require careful explanations to the witnesses as to areas that have been ruled or agreed to be inadmissible. While the possibility of applications for discharge can never be ruled out in a trial of such length and involving such subject matter, and while I have taken this concern into account in my overall assessment of where the interests of justice lie, I do not consider this to be a major factor in the resolution of the current dispute.
	
	
	It is generally accepted that one of the advantages of a judge alone trial is the requirement for a judge to give reasons for their decision. By its nature, nothing is known of a jury’s deliberations or reasons for its verdict. This has been held in some cases to be an important factor militating in favour of a trial by judge alone. Counsel for Mohammad Zarshoy submitted that this is a relevant factor in the present case when a jury’s verdict is likely to be delivered many weeks or months after some of the critical informant witnesses have given their evidence. Counsel for Mr Zarshoy suggests that it is next to impossible to accept that a jury will be able to remember the witnesses over such a lengthy period of time, whereas a judge would be required to give reasons why they accepted or rejected a witnesses evidence based on matters concerning their credibility. I accept that this is a factor militating in favour of an order for a judge alone trial and have taken it into account. However, it is a relatively small factor given the magnitude of the concerns expressed in relation to questions of prejudice which form the cornerstone of the application in respect of each of the accused.
	
	
	It has been held that some cases involve significant complexity such that it is more appropriate for a trained judge, rather than a lay jury, to be the tribunal of fact: see Kingswell v R [1985] HCA 72; 159 CLR 264 at 302-303 (Dean J), R v Simmons (No 4) [71]-[72]. This is particularly the case in relation to complex scientific or expert evidence. None of the accused in the present case has contended that any of the expert evidence which is expected to be adduced in the trial is of such complexity that it is a relevant consideration in an assessment of the interests of justice in the present case.
	
	
	However, a number of the accused submitted that the trial itself will be both complex and long and that this complexity is a matter to be taken into account because a jury may not be able to follow the evidence given its length and the fact that parts of the evidence will be admitted against one or other of the accused and not against the balance of the accused. While I accept that the matter has a certain complexity, there have been many cases in New South Wales where jurors have been called upon to sit in trials over many, many months involving multiple accused and where the separate bodies of evidence and separate consideration had to be given in respect of not only the individual accused but also the individual charges. There is nothing before me to suggest that the present case is of such complexity that a jury will not be able to understand the evidence as it is adduced or follow the directions as to which parts of the evidence may be used in respect of individual charges and individual accused. In coming to that conclusion, I indicate that I am greatly comforted by the fact that I have two experienced Crown Prosecutors and five experienced defence counsel each of whom is charged with responsibility to ensure that it is clear both as the evidence is elicited, and at the conclusion of the case, what parts of the evidence are to be used in respect of the individual accused.
	
	
	While I have taken into account the submissions made in respect of the length and complexity of the trial, it is not a matter of significant weight in the circumstances of the present case.
	
	
	Finally, the provision of s 132(5) provides guidance as to one factor that might inform a consideration of where the interests of justice lie. However, two things can be observed about s 132(5). First, the list of examples of matters that “require the application of objective community standards” (reasonableness, negligence, indecency, obscenity and dangerousness) is not exhaustive but examples. This is entirely clear by the use of the expression in parenthesis (“but not limited to”). Secondly, and importantly in this case, the fact that a case may give rise to such factual issues does not disentitle an accused person from obtaining an order for a judge alone trial. Rather, it enlivens a discretion in the court – it “may refuse to make an order” on that basis. However, the ultimate question remains always that posited by s 132(4): is it “in the interests of justice” to make an order for a judge alone trial?
	


three Areas of Controversy


	
	On my review of the authorities and academic materials there are three areas of controversy surrounding the application of the section and the question of whether a judge or a jury is the more appropriate tribunal of fact. The first concerns the question of intention and whether that question is one that involves a question of fact that requires the application of objective community standards. The second is the question of whether a judge or jury is the better arbiter when questions of credibility are in issue. In relation to those first two questions, there is a divergence of opinion amongst the judiciary. The third question concerns the extent to which jurors are able to – and do – follow directions and put aside matters of emotion and prejudice. On that issue, judges generally speak with one voice while academics have raised questions over the approach taken by the courts.
	


Intention


	
	The first is the area of controversy concerns the question of intention. A number of judges have expressed the opinion that questions of intention may (or necessarily do) give rise to the application of objective community standards: see AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8 at [95] (Heydon J), R v Stanley [2013] NSWCCA 124 at [55]-[58] (Barr AJ, Macfarlan JA and Campbell J agreeing), R v Dean [2013] NSWSC 661 at [58] (Latham J), R v King [2013] NSWSC 448 at [52] (Bellew J) and R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357 at [88]-[98] (Johnson J).
	
	
	Other judges have expressed the opinion that whether a person formed a particular intention is a matter of fact that does not involve the application of community standards: see the analysis by Harrison J in R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729 at [73]-[77]. In R v Simmons (No 4) (at [64]) I set out the passage from the judgment of Harrison J in R v Abrahams and expressed my agreement with his Honour’s observations. My opinion, like that of Harrison J, was that “it is difficult immediately to accept that cases concerned with the assessment of whether or not a particular individual had formed or retained a particular intent … necessarily or even arguably ‘involve[s] a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards’”: Abrahams at [75].
	
	
	In deference to the subsequent judgment of Johnson J in R v McNeil, I have again considered the issue and the conclusions I expressed in R v Simmons (No 4). Having done so, I remain of the view that the question of intention is a question of fact and is not one that involves the application of community standards such as to attract the provision in s 132(5) of the Act.
	
	
	For that reason, insofar as questions of intention, including questions of specific intent, will be raised in the present case, I approach the matter on the basis that it is a neutral consideration. Both a judge and a jury are able to form assessments of that factual question based on inferences to be drawn from the actions of the individuals involved. Neither tribunal would be required to assess the matter by reference to some objective community standard.
	


Credibility issues


	
	The second area of controversy concerns the question of whether a jury is the better tribunal to determine issues of credibility. I explored this issue in R v Simmons (No 4) at [73]-[82]. This is an extremely important issue in the present case. While the Crown has a body of circumstantial and expert evidence that it will contend supports its informant witnesses, none of that evidence by itself would be capable of establishing any of the charges against the accused. It can safely be anticipated that the informant witnesses will be subjected to a significant attack upon their credibility. The result of the trial will depend on the tribunal of fact’s determination as to the substance of that attack and the credibility of each of the informants. Accordingly, this is a critical matter to be considered in the context of the present application.
	
	
	As I indicated in R v Simmons (No 4), I am of the view that an assessment of credibility is not a matter in relation to which either a judge sitting alone or a jury of twelve enjoys a clear advantage. It is, in my opinion, a neutral consideration in an application such as the present. As has been pointed out in the cases summarised in R v Simmons (No 4), each mode of trial has its own advantages. On the one hand, the unanimity required of a jury and the capacity of a group of people to consult with one another and to discuss and debate questions of credibility gives them an advantage over the lonely judge, sitting in chambers, attempting to make a decision. On the other hand, and this is particularly apposite in the present case, a judge is trained and expected to be able to put aside questions of emotions and prejudice. Further, as explained above, a judge is required to expose their reasoning for accepting or rejecting a witness and their credibility. This is an advantage of a judge alone trial when questions of credibility arise.
	
	
	I remain of the view that I expressed in R v Simmons (No 4). That view found favour with Adams J in Redman v R [2015] NSWCCA 110 at [14]-[15]:
	


“14. The supposition that a jury is a better arbiter of relative credibility than a judge is reflective of assumptions rather than experience and lacks sufficient substance to be placed in the scales. As Hamill J noted, there are a number of judicial statements commending the ability of juries to assess credibility and reliability of witnesses but ‘…it is difficult to discern a clear consensus in the Australian authorities in support of a proposition that where credibility issues are essential to a trial, that is a factor that militates strongly in favour of a jury trial’ (Ibid at 75). His Honour concluded –

[82] …[For] the most part, the fact that a trial involves issues of credibility is a neutral matter when it comes to determining whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order for trial by judge alone … [Each] mode of trial has its advantages and disadvantages, strengths and weaknesses. While a jury has the advantage of being able to discuss the issues and the requirement for unanimity provides strength to its decision, a judge has the training and experience of making difficult decisions on question[s] of credibility, putting aside matters of emotion, on an almost daily basis.

15. (I would add the additional consideration that, here, the effect of delay on the ability of the applicant to defend himself is a complicating feature.)”


	
	However, the other judges who sat on that appeal (Hoeben CJ at CL and R.A. Hulme J) did not need to consider the issue and the matter remains controversial. For example, Johnson J expressed the contrary view in R v McNeil at [102]-[105].
	
	
	I approach the present application on the basis that the fact that the trial will be determined largely on an assessment of the credibility of the Crown witnesses is not a matter that militates either in favour or against the making of the order sought by the accused. I do not proceed on the basis that there is some special advantage enjoyed by a jury in making assessments of credibility.
	


Do jurors obey direction and can they put aside matters of prejudice?


	
	There is a third matter of controversy, although, for the most part, judges have spoken with one voice on the issue. The issue here is the capacity of a jury to put aside prejudicial material and, more generally, to follow and obey judicial direction. The law proceeds on the basis that juries can put aside prejudicial material and do obey direction. However, some judges (including myself) have expressed some misgivings in relation to what is an extremely powerful (and, from my perspective, binding) line of the authorities. In addition to the occasional comment by judges, there is a body of academic study which places some doubt over the line of authorities to which I have just referred.
	
	
	In R v Simmons (No 4), I discussed this controversy at [83]-[92]. At [87], I referred to the questioning by academic writers of the “near heroic belief that jury directions can cure negative impressions formed about an accused”: see Mirko Bagaric, “The Community Interest in Bringing Suspects to Trial Trumps the Right to an Impartial Decision Maker – at least in Victoria” (2010) 34(1) Criminal Law Journal 5 at 8. On the hearing of the present application, Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi brought to my attention an article by Roxanne Burd and Jacqueline Horan entitled “Protecting the Right to a Fair Trial in the 21st Century – has a trial by jury being caught in the world wide web?” (2012) 36 Criminal Law Journal 103. I have taken into account the discussion by Ms Burd, particularly at pp 111-113. The authors raise significant questions over whether juries, as is assumed by judges at all levels, follow judicial direction. They raise an example of a case in Victoria called R v Benbrika [2009] VSC 142. In that case a trial judge “repeatedly and unambiguously told the jury that the case was to be decided on the evidence given in the court room”. In spite of those directions there was evidence that the jury had accessed “Wikipedia” via the internet as well as a dictionary. The authors concluded (at 113) that “it should not be assumed that jurors will follow judicial directions”. The authors also considered whether jurors can remain impartial in the face of extremely prejudicial publicity and discussed “the rise of the googling juror”. The authors concluded (at 117) that “juror misbehaviour in recent trials makes judicial faith in the jury following their ‘don’t search’ directions seems like mere rhetoric”. This is reminiscent of the academic comment in the articles I referred to in R v Simmons (No 4) that there was a deal of “judicial wishful thinking” in the approach taken by the Courts.
	
	
	Mr Young SC also referred to an academic article in support of the proposition that the circumstances of the present case are such that I should be wary in acting on an assumption that jurors will follow direction not to make any searches in relation to the accused. The article in question was called “Jurors’ Notions of Justice; An Empirical Study of Motivations to Investigate and Obedience to Judicial Directions” by Professor Jill Hunter of the Faculty of Law of the New South Wales University, published February 2014. The article reported on a study involving seventy-eight jurors who had participated in twenty trials. The study showed that a reasonably high proportion of the jurors felt some sympathy with a juror who had disobeyed judge’s directions and undertaken research to find out more about the accused. However, the overwhelming majority found private jury inquiry unacceptable but that the comments to the contrary were a matter of concern.
	
	
	I have some sympathy with the arguments being advanced by counsel. As I explained in R v Simmons (No 4), the assumption that jurors obey directions and are unaffected by prejudice is an assumption that can only be taken so far. There are a number of judicial remedies (such as discharging a jury, separating trials and counts, excluding prejudicial evidence etc) to which reference was made in R v Simmons (No 4) which demonstrates that the law accepts that such limits exist. Other judges have expressed similar views: see, for example, BC v R [2015] NSWCCA 327 at [28]-[30] (Adams J, dissenting), R v Debs [2011] NSWSC 1248 at [31]-[35] (RS Hulme J), Murphy v The Queen [1989] HCA 28; 167 CLR 94 at 101 and R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 at 614-615 (Brennan J).
	
	
	There have been a number of reported cases where jurors have disobeyed directions and undertaken their own research: see, for example, R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406; 59 NSWLR 431, R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; 60 NSWLR 86, Folbigg v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 371; R v Wood [2008] NSWSC 817; 186 A Crim R 454, R v Benbrika.
	
	
	However, the line of authorities to which I have previously referred is a strong and binding one. I must proceed on the general – but not, I think, absolute – assumption that jurors will be true to their oath or affirmation and that they will follow directions: see, for example, Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125; 293 ALR 384 at [62]-[63], R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258 at [19]. I must also assume that jurors will not be unduly influenced by matters of prejudice and are not (to quote the former Chief Justice) “exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice”: see John Fairfax Publications v The District Court of NSW [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at 103 (Spigelman CJ). In Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 McHugh JA said at [21]:
	


“Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.”


	
	The question for my determination, in the context of the arguments that have been made in the present case, is whether sufficient safeguards can be put in place to ensure that there is no jury misbehaviour and that the accused are able to receive a fair trial. I do not proceed on the unquestioning assumption that jurors are immune to prejudice or misconduct but I must, I think, proceed on an assumption that generally they will obey judicial directions. That is particularly the case when, as here, the jury will be directed that to undertake internet research as to the background of the accused is to commit a crime under s 68C of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) and that I understand that there is a deal of material on the internet that is unfair, misleading and untrue both to some of the witnesses and to the accused. Accordingly, the jury will be directed that not only will they be committing a criminal offence if they go searching for the material but they will also be responsible for a grave miscarriage of justice. My view is that the sense of decency and integrity which the overwhelming majority of people bring into the jury room is likely to overcome the inevitable temptation to become a “googling juror”.
	


The Pre-trial Publicity in the present case


	
	In addition to all of the evidence that has been adduced in the course of the pre-trial hearings (which is extensive and has been summarised in other judgments), the accused relied on the contents of three affidavits:
	



	
	An affidavit of Farhad Qaumi’s solicitor, Ms Gittani, dated 15 January 2016.
	
	
	An affidavit of Mumtaz Qaumi’s solicitor, Ms Sten, dated 28 January 2016.
	
	
	An affidavit of Jamil Qaumi’s solicitor, Ms Christinson, dated 2 March 2016.
	



	
	Each of those affidavits annex a number of newspaper articles and internet pages which demonstrate that the various accused have been the topic of significant media and internet attention. I have considered all of the material but will make reference only to parts of it.
	


Material annexed to Ms Gittani’s affidavit


	
	Annexure A to Ms Gittani’s affidavit shows the results of a Google search for the name Farhad Qaumi. It attracted 12,100 results on 5 January 2016. A related search for “Farhad Qaumi acquitted” is annexure B and showed 2,100 results. Looking at the items on the first page of these results demonstrates the flavour of the material on the internet. For example, there is a reference to “Farhad Qaumi: the rise and bloody fall of a brutal gangster”. Farhad is described as the “Brothers 4 Life gang ‘kingpin’”. Annexure B is more troubling because it shows that there is available on the internet a number of items which detail the fact that Farhad Qaumi has previously been acquitted of “two Sydney murders”. Evidence of him boasting about this to other members of the Brothers for Life at Blacktown has been subject to a pre-trial ruling and has been excluded from the trial: R v Qaumi & Ors  (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 115.
	
	
	Annexure C is the most recent article of significance. It followed the sentencing proceedings of a witness known as “L” in September 2015. An article online in the Sydney Morning Herald refers to a “mega-trial” of up to a dozen members of the Brothers 4 Life gang for a “series of murders, shootings, drug dealing extortions and bashings that terrorised western Sydney in 2012 and 2013”. Whether two murders could ever be accurately described as a series is one thing, but the fact is that the jury in the present case will only hear evidence in relation to one of the murders with which Farhad and Mumtaz have been charged.
	
	
	Annexure D is an article from 28 October 2014 which refers to the “$200,000 hit” and execution of Joseph Antoun. This unrelated charge of murder was separated from the current proceedings in one of my pre-trial rulings: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) (severance and separate trial) [2016] NSWSC 15.
	
	
	Annexure E refers to an incident in Court before the List Judge when the various accused were said to have been joking with one another via video link.
	
	
	Annexure F is an article from the Sunday Telegraph which provides significant detail concerning witness L and the evidence that he proposes to give. This article, published on 24 May 2015, but still readily available on the internet, refers to the execution style killing of Joseph Antoun and alleges that “Farhad and Mumtaz ordered the hit”. Similarly, there is reference to evidence proposed to be given by other former members including threats made by Farhad Qaumi to shoot various members and the extensive involvement of the group in drug dealing and gangland activity.
	
	
	Annexure G refers to the “rise and bloody fall of a brutal gangster” and specifically relates to Farhad Qaumi and refers to an attempt on his life that occurred some months after the events giving rise to the current proceedings.
	
	
	Annexure H is an article that relates to the earlier trial, back in 2009, when Farhad Qaumi was found not guilty of two murders as a result of successfully arguing that he acted in self-defence.
	
	
	Annexure I is a lengthy article from an on-line publication of the Daily Mail Australia. It was published on 22 July 2015 but was still available to be accessed on 5 January 2016. It is an article about the “supermax” prison in Goldman and refers to Australia’s worst and most notorious criminals being held there. This includes a number of convicted felons who have been responsible for some of New South Wales most atrocious and notorious crimes. Included in the article is a reference to the accused Farhad Qaumi and an incident that took place when he was held in supermax. The obvious inference to be drawn from this article is that Farhad Qaumi, like the notorious criminals mentioned in the article, forms part of the “worst of the worst” of criminals in this State.
	


Affidavit of Ms Sten


	
	Annexed to Ms Sten’s affidavit is similar material uncovered as a consequence of a “Google search” of the accused Mumtaz Qaumi. When the search was conducted it attracted some 45,100 results. A more recent search attracted around 51,000 results leading Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi to suggest that the amount of media is increasing and that more articles have been published. However, there is simply no evidence of any significant articles since the article of September 2015 which related to the sentencing of L. Some quite recent articles were tendered in evidence (Exhibit 21 and 22) but, by comparison they are largely benign. No counsel has brought to my attention any significant coverage since early September 2015.
	
	
	It is somewhat difficult to reconcile the 51,000 results thrown up by a search of Mumtaz Qaumi with the 12,100 results for Farhad Qaumi given that the latter is said to be the leader and has had a previously murder trial. It is important not to be unduly influenced by the sheer number of results as it is simply not known how many of those results have any actual relevance to the current proceedings.
	
	
	The material attached to Ms Sten’s affidavit demonstrates the extent of pre-trial publicity to which both the accused Mumtaz Qaumi and the Brothers for Life gang has been subjected. There is reference to the Antoun killing (see for example annexure F) as well as a number of tendentious factual assertions concerning the Brothers for Life. A great deal of the material concerns matters which, on my understanding of the case, will not be led in the trial. Further, far from representing objective factual reporting, the articles are largely sensational in their nature.
	
	
	There is some duplication between the material produced in the affidavit of Ms Sten and that of Ms Gittani but there are a number of additional articles and references. The significance of the separate affidavits is that the articles in question are thrown up by searches of different accused names.
	


Affidavit of Helen Christinson


	
	The affidavit of Ms Christinson provides an even more comprehensive annexure setting out the publicity that has surrounded the case between January 2014 and June 2015. There is some duplication of the material in the other affidavits to which I have referred but there are a number of additional articles which have been located by Ms Christinson. Again, the material includes reference to evidence that will not be included in the trial and includes material that on my understanding of the brief is not factually accurate and is properly described as sensational and tendentious.
	
	
	For example, in an ABC News article dated 12 December 2014, the accused Zarshoy (spelled incorrectly) is described as having “demonstrated a propensity for extreme violence” and as “having a vast criminal history”. In an article published by the Sydney Morning Herald on 9 January 2014, it is reported that “police say they know what occurred at almost every shooting in Sydney over the past 12 months” and that police had the “upper hand on Sydney’s gang violence following the arrest of three Brothers for Life leaders on Wednesday”.
	
	
	In referring to the so-called “mega-trial” reference is made to evidence that will not be adduced in the current trial either by agreement or as a result of evidentiary and other rulings made to ensure that the trial is a fair one. There are also blanket assertions of ballistic and other forensic links between the crimes, all of which are to be subject of evidence in the trial and may be subject to significant dispute.
	
	
	The foregoing is little more than an overview of the material. Time does not permit me to refer to all of the material. However, all that really needs to be said is that if a juror read all of this material, it is hard to imagine that they would not be influenced by it.
	
	
	As I have said, more recent articles (as recent as last Sunday’s Daily Telegraph) were tendered. This included an article about the retiring policeman Nick Kaldas and another relating to new procedures introduced into the Bail Court designed to create efficiency but portrayed as being introduced to reduce judge shopping. Each of these articles has some reference to the Brothers for Life gang. However, as I have said, relative to the historical material (and by historical, I mean material that is six months old and older) this recent material is unlikely to impact upon a jury even if it were brought to their attention directly.
	
	
	Apart from a decision of Woods QC DCJ in R v Reeves (No 3), counsel did not refer to any New South Wales case where it has been held that there should be a trial by judge alone as a result of pre-trial publicity. Indeed, as I wrote in R v Simmons (No 4), “overwhelmingly, it has been held that the prejudice identified in the application is capable of being overcome by direction to the jury”. I referred to the cases of R v Abrahams at [54]-[60], R v Dean at [65], R v King at [60]-[65] and R v McKnight at [31]. In R v King, Bellew J set out the general principles that apply at [62]-[64].
	
	
	The case of R v McNeil can now be added to the list of cases referred to in the last paragraph. McNeil was a one punch murder case which attracted significant publicity in the aftermath of the death of the victim. McNeil was charged with murder. Justice Johnson was asked to make an order for a trial by judge alone. His Honour set out both the nature and detail of the material from [52]-[62]. That description culminated in a fictional Facebook page wherein the accused was described as a coward and scum in the following examples of posts to the Facebook page:
	


“Feed the coward to the pigs. This scum is doing min 10 years if not I’m starting a riot on the streets.” (11 January 2014)

“Give him life in jail make the coward suffer. Death is the easy way out.” (12 January 2014)

“Fucking parasite loser piece of shit. Too scared to put his case to the people so hoping for some soft judge to let him off. Cunt.” (12 February 2015)


	
	Justice Johnson went on to set out the fact that there was also available to any juror caring to access it, comments by the New South Wales Attorney General relating to the case. His Honour then set out the relevant law from [64]-[69].
	
	
	By reference back to the description given by Harrison J in R v Abrahams to similar material, his Honour described the material on the internet as the “irrational and suspect musings of faceless people intent on mischief”. His Honour accepted at [72] that the material was “prejudicial to the applicant in a number of respects, including reference to his criminal history”. His Honour noted that the publication of the criminal history of an accused person has been held to attract the law of contempt but also observed that the publication on the internet of an accused’s criminal history “is not regarded necessarily as being sufficient to establish bias”. His Honour referred to R v K [2003] NSWSC 406; A Crim R 446 at [67] and R v King [2013] NSWSC 448; 228 A Crim R 406 at [60].
	
	
	Johnson J referred at [66] to the lapse of time between the media publicity and the trial itself and noted that it was a significant factor:
	


“66. In Montgomery v HM Advocate [2003] 1 AC 641, Lord Hope of Craighead said at 673:

‘Recent research conducted for the New Zealand Law Commission suggests that the impact of pre-trial publicity and of prejudicial media coverage during the trial, even in high profile cases, is minimal: Young, Cameron & Tinsley, Juries in Criminal Trials: part Two, vol 1, ch 9, para 287 (New Zealand Law Commission preliminary paper no 37, November 1999). The lapse of time since the last exposure may increasingly be regarded, with each month that passes, in itself as some kind of a safeguard. Nevertheless the risk that the widespread, prolonged and prejudicial publicity that occurred in this case will have a residual effect on the minds of at least some members of the jury cannot be regarded as negligible. The principal safeguards of the objective impartiality of the tribunal lie in the trial process itself and the conduct of the trial by the trial judge. On the one hand there is the discipline to which the jury will be subjected of listening to and thinking about the evidence. The actions of seeing and hearing the witnesses may be expected to have a far greater impact on their minds than such residual recollections as may exist about reports about the case in the media. This impact can be expected to be reinforced on the other hand by such warnings and directions as the trial judge may think it appropriate to give them as the trial proceeds, in particular when he delivers his charge before they retire to consider their verdicts’.""


	
	I should conclude my discussion of R v McNeil by observing that a jury found the accused not guilty of murder. He was convicted of manslaughter, an offence in relation to which he had entered a plea of guilty. See R v McNeil (No 4) [2015] NSWSC 1198.
	
	
	The decision of Judge Woods QC in R v GSR (No 3) concerned a most extraordinary case. The facts are more clearly and fully exposed in the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: Reeves v R; R v Reeves [2013] NSWCCA 34. The circumstances in which the trial Judge ordered a judge alone trial included that there were back-to-back trials and that the first trial had attracted enormous and extensive publicity. The judge described it as “poisonous and inflammatory”, “extensive and disturbing” and including some “very nasty epithets” such as “rogue doctor” and “Butcher of Bega”. The appeal judgment shows that the first trial (involving infliction of grievous bodily harm of a patient’s vulva) ended on 10 March 2011 and that the Judge alone trial followed almost immediately thereafter (judgment was delivered on 14 April 2011).
	
	
	I should also make reference to the decision of Arthurs v State of Western Australia [2007] WASC 182 in which Martin CJ granted a trial by judge alone based on prejudicial pre-trial publicity. The applicant was charged with murder as well as sexual assaults and the unlawful detention of an 8 year old. The case had attracted a great deal of publicity, the nature and extent of which is set out in the judgment at [6]-[32]. His Honour found that there were five features of the publicity that made it exceptional. First, an “exceptionally prominent” front-page article in the West Australian referred to communications between the newspaper and the accused and his mother and had a “number of unusual features”. Second, there was a “sensational and untrue” rumour that the accused had been “one of the two boys responsible for the death of James Bulger in Liverpool”. Third, that rumour persisted on the internet even after it was quashed in the “printed media”. Fourth, there was common reference to “the other matter”. Fifth, there was a television broadcast about the accused which gave rise “to an arguable case of contempt”. His Honour described the media publicity at [86] as “extensive, continuous and in some respects extraordinary” and also took into account at [88] the subject matter of the offences which was “likely to test the emotional strength and fortitude of any person required to consider it in detail”. His Honour concluded by observing at [93] that “it does not seem to me that in the particular circumstances of this case there are any particular factors which would support a trial by jury”.
	
	
	As sensational and unbalanced as the media coverage of the present case is, it is not as “extraordinary” as that involved in the cases of Arthurs and Reeves. Further, while the allegations of gangland violence and lawlessness are apt to arouse prejudice, the subject matter is not as emotive as that involved in the kidnapping, rape and killing of an 8 year old (Arthurs) or allegations of indecent assault and genital mutilation committed by a trusted gynaecologist (Reeves).
	
	
	Most of the media publicity surrounding the present case occurred at the time of the shootings and on the arrest of the accused, that is in late 2013 and early 2014. After the sentencing of witness L, there were a number of articles including, most recently, the article in September 2015. However, even that article will be around six months old by the time that the trial proper commences. It is unlikely that any juror who had been exposed to such material at the time would have anything other than a vague and general recollection of the details. Further, any juror who might have a more detailed recollection such that they felt that they could not bring an impartial mind to bear could be identified in the course of the pre-empanelment procedures in which the Crown Prosecutor will identify the nature of the charges and evidence and I will instruct the panel that if any individual has concerns as to their ability to bring an unprejudiced and impartial mind to bear upon the issues they should seek to be excused.
	
	
	I have made orders today that some of the more prejudicial material be removed from the internet: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 16) (Internet “Take Down” Orders). However, there will remain on the Internet a body of material that may be prejudicial to the accused. However, the concerns that the jury might access the material at this stage can be alleviated by two measures.
	
	
	First, at the conclusion of hearing arguments on the trial by judge alone application, I made orders (with the consent of the parties) that the names of the accused not appear in court lists between now and the commencement of the trial. That means that any potential juror who receives a jury summons will be unable to make any enquiry or Google search or similar internet searches between now and when they attend the Downing Centre. In particular, on the day that they arrive here they will not see a court list with the names of the accused. That will reduce or dispose of any real risk of a member of the jury doing research on the accused whilst awaiting empanelment.
	
	
	As to the 15 individuals who are sworn or affirmed as the jury, the risk that they might access such material during the currency of the trial can be dealt with by the clear and firm directions. Such directions will include reference to the provisions of s 68C of the Jury Act. The jury will be reminded that making any enquiries including internet enquiries for the purpose of obtaining information about the accused on matters relevant to the trial is a criminal offence carrying the possibility of imprisonment.
	
	
	Further, the directions will make it plain to the jury that the material that is known to be on the internet is both unfair and misleading. The jury will also be reminded that if they become aware of any other member of the jury involving themselves in internet research or similar they must bring such matters to my attention.
	
	
	I do not take lightly the material published on the internet or the earnest and convincing submissions made by counsel for the accused. However, I have concluded that a combination of safeguards as set out above is such that there is not a great likelihood that any member of the jury will be infected with the kind of prejudices about which the accused have expressed concern
	
	
	There have been many high profile criminal trials conducted in New South Wales in recent years. Whilst Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi suggested that a review of those cases shows that they almost universally result in convictions, the reality is to the contrary. Bell J (as her Honour then was) conducted a very similar case to the present trial in 2006. In spite of widespread publicity and highly prejudicial evidence about similar gangland conduct, the (alleged) leader of that criminal group was in fact acquitted of one of the principal charges: see Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [5]. This demonstrated the capacity of the jury both to distinguish between accused and charges and also to overcome matters of prejudice.
	
	
	Similarly, a recent trial conducted in this Court concerning a notorious murder resulting from an affray between rival bikie gangs played out at the Sydney Airport, resulted in almost all of the accused being acquitted: R v Hawi [2014] NSWSC 837.
	
	
	Finally, and most recently, Justice Fullerton presided over the trial of Robert Xie over many months last year. That trial involved the bloody killing of four of the accused’s relatives and was subject to intense pre-trial publicity. The reporting of the trial was both dramatic and prone to evoke strong emotional reactions. Nevertheless, the jury was discharged when it indicated that it could not agree upon its verdict.
	
	
	These cases demonstrate that, for the most part, judicial faith in the integrity and robustness of the jury system is well placed. The scepticism expressed by counsel, members of the academia and from time to time by judges like myself is a healthy part of the dialogue but the fact remains that the law provides a number of safeguards against a jury being influenced by prejudice and operates on the assumption that a jury will follow and comply with directions.
	


PREJUDICIAL MATERIAL TO BE ADDUCED IN THE CROWN CASE


	
	In addition to the prejudicial pre-trial publicity to which I have just referred, each of the accused points to evidence to be adduced by the prosecution that will prove (if it is accepted) that the accused was involved in criminal activities beyond those alleged in the individual counts in the indictment. The accused submits that, taken together, the prejudice created by this evidence and the pre-trial publicity is incapable of being overcome by direction. Accordingly, it is submitted that the interests of justice point in the direction of a judge alone trial.
	
	
	In R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3), I referred at [98]-[102] to the fact that the Crown intended to lead a body of evidence establishing a number of criminal acts on the part of each of the accused which are not subject to specific charges in the indictment. When the case management directions were originally made, one of the pre-trial issues that was identified was the question of the admissibility of such uncharged acts and, in particular, whether such evidence should be adduced as tendency evidence under s 97 of the Evidence Act. In the course of the arguments on separate trials and severance, all of the accused with the exception of Mohammad Zarshoy accepted that it was not necessary to determine the tendency issue in advance of the trial. Mr Zarshoy indicated that the matter should be resolved in order to determine the question of severance and separate trials. In my judgment on severance at [104], I indicated a preliminary or provisional position that the evidence sought to be led against Mr Zarshoy would not be admitted as tendency evidence. In relation to the remaining accused, the matter remained unresolved. However, I made it clear that the amount of evidence of this nature would be confined to that necessary to prove the particular counts:
	


“157. What I do not propose to allow is a trial in which wide-ranging evidence is adduced to establish the participation offences beyond that which is admissible to establish counts 11-29 and 32-34. If the Crown elects to limit the evidence to establish participation to those matters, I would not sever those counts. If the Crown elects to conduct the participation offences by reference to the full extent of the criminality that is disclosed in the various timelines and chronologies, I would be inclined to the view that the accused would be embarrassed or prejudiced in the conduct of their defence of the substantive charges.”


	
	After that judgment was delivered, counsel for each of the accused consulted over a number of days with the learned Crown Prosecutors. Those consultations enabled the parties to reach agreement as to the body of evidence that might generally be called evidence of “uncharged acts”. After many days of consultations, I understand that the parties reached agreement as to what parts of the evidence will, and will not, be adduced by the Crown. I have not been provided with all of the details but assume that the decisions that have been taken by those representing the accused have been taken advisedly and on a principled basis. At one stage I was provided with exhibit EE, containing a list of incidents or areas of evidence relevant to this question. In the course of argument on the present application, the Crown Prosecutor explained that he had abandoned a significant amount of the material enumerated in exhibit EE. In fact, he has abandoned reliance on all of the material in item 3 of that document “Extortions/stand over”.
	
	
	I am not privy to the precise agreements that have been reached between counsel. While the Crown has obviously made significant concessions, I understand that it remains the case that a body of evidence will be adduced that proves criminality outside of the substantive charges levelled against each of the accused. This includes evidence going to the membership, hierarchy and aims of the group, evidence relating to drug dealing and attempts to take over other dealer’s “runs”, evidence relating to the history and ownership of particular firearms and evidence of a number of assaults or threats directed by the leaders of the group (in particular, Farhad Qaumi) to other members of the group. Presumably, the agreements reached by counsel accord with the observations I made in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) and there has been no application to revisit the question of severance of the participation offences.
	
	
	This evidence may have relevance to the issues in a trial in a number of ways. First, it may be directly relevant to the Crown’s case in relation to the charges of participation in a criminal group. Next, parts of the evidence may have relevance in different, less direct, ways. For example, the evidence of assaults, threats and intimidation led against Farhad Qaumi has relevance to explain the context in which the events on the indictment occurred. In particular, it is conceded that the evidence is relevant to provide the jury with a proper understanding as to why the members of the group acted as they did, following directions, no matter how extreme. Finally, the evidence in some instances may be admissible as tendency evidence. As I have said, with the exception of Mohammad Zarshoy, the parties agreed that the evidence could be admitted in the trial with a decision taken later as to which parts, if any, of the evidence would be left to the jury as tendency evidence.
	
	
	On whatever basis the evidence is left to the jury, the accused contend that the nature and extent of the evidence of criminality outside of the specific counts in the indictment is such that it will be impossible to direct the jury in such a way that it will proceed in a dispassionate and unprejudiced way.
	
	
	I am unable to accept that submission. It is not uncommon for evidence of uncharged acts to be placed before a jury and there are many bases upon which that occurs. Provided the jury is given clear and careful direction as to the limitations of the use of the evidence, there is no real danger of the trial miscarrying.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi seeks to call into aid the decision in R v Simmons (No 4). He submits that the circumstances that led me to order a judge alone trial in that case are relevantly similar to the circumstances of the present case. An analysis of the circumstances prevailing in R v Simmons (No 4) and a comparison of those circumstances with those prevailing in the present case shows that this submission cannot be sustained. The cases are completely different.
	
	
	In R v Simmons (No 4), the accused made admissions to a number of undercover police officers that he had killed the alleged victim by pushing him from a cliff. He did so in circumstances where the undercover police had tricked him into believing that they were part of a criminal organisation into which he was to be recruited. All, or the overwhelming majority, of his admissions were recorded by surveillance (listening) devices in the course of his conversations with the undercover police officers. His defence was to embrace the things that he had said but to explain them away by indicating that he was a drug addict and a drug dealer who needed the kind of money that was being provided by the undercover operatives in order to feed his habit and maintain his business of drug dealing. He pointed to other admissions relating to an earlier assault on the same victim in which he (the accused) had plainly exaggerated his actions to sustain an argument that his admission to pushing the victim off a cliff was no more than a boast calculated to “big-note” himself in the eyes of the criminal gang into which he was seeking to gain entry: see generally R v Simmons (No 4) at [116]-[117] and R v Simmons (No 7) [2015] NSWSC 574.
	
	
	One critical feature was that the circumstances were such that the accused counsel was placed in a position where he was required to produce evidence of bad character in order to conduct the defence. In Redman v R Adams J at [16] noted:
	


“16. Important distinctions between prejudicial material proposed to be relied on by the Crown on the one hand and prejudicial material proposed to be introduced by an accused. It is an important principle of justice that an accused person be able to defend himself or herself by all forensically available means and should not, without good reason, be forced to make a choice between the risk that a jury will be unfairly prejudiced against him or her on the one hand and censoring his defence on the other.”


	
	The present case is very different. For one thing, I am not aware at this stage precisely what defence the accused intend to conduct. The Crown has postulated that the accused may be mounting “defence/s” including self-defence, provocation and duress. This is relevant in another way to this application but for present purposes it is simply worth noting that the situation in R v Simmons (No 4) was entirely different because it was clear, at the time of addressing the question of whether the trial should be by jury or judge alone, that the accused was placed in a position of accepting a large body of evidence not adduced as tendency but capable of being used in that way and forced to elicit evidence of his own bad character in order to mount his defence. While the general principles that I enunciated in the judgment in R v Simmons (No 4) are equally applicable to the present case, the factual circumstances and relevant considerations to the interests of justice under s 132 of the Act are completely different.
	


Application of Objective Community Standards


	
	Subsection 132(5) provides:
	


“Without limiting subsection (4):

The court may refuse to make an order if it considers that the trial will involve a factual issue that requires the application of objective community standards, including (but not limited to) an issue of reasonableness, negligence, in decency, obscenity or dangerousness.”


	
	The central argument underpinning the Crown Prosecutor’s objection to a trial by judge alone is that s 132(5) is engaged in the circumstances of the present case. The Crown Prosecutor submits that the conduct of the case to date suggests that some or all of the accused may be raising defences which give rise to the application of objective community standards. The Crown says that it may be inferred that some of the accused intended to raise a question of self-defence. In particular, based on the material before the Court and the enquiries made on behalf of some or one or more of the accused, it appears that the accused (or some of them) will contend that the shooting directed at Mohammed Hamzy resulted from information received from witness M that Mr Hamzy intended to execute Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	The Crown said that if it was not the case that the accused intended to raise the issue of self-defence, counsel should make that clear at this stage. He noted in written submissions that “on a number of occasions the Crown has mentioned in Court that such issues may arise in the trial and no counsel for any of the accused has risen to state otherwise”. In the face of that challenge, the accused did not eschew raising defences that gave rise to the factual issues requiring the application of objective community standards.
	
	
	In the course of argument, Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi acknowledged that he had “deliberately not” risen to eschew the issue of self-defence and agreed that I could “safely proceed on the basis that it is at least possible that those issues will be live ones in the trial” (T 1225). Mr Stratton SC was prepared to say that duress would not be an issue in Farhad Qaumi’s case (a concession that came as no surprise given the evidence in the case). However, that concession merely highlighted the Crown’s point that both self-defence and provocation may be raised by or on behalf of Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	When I raised with Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi, the fact that “I don’t know much about the defence case”, Mr Young SC said that “Mumtaz Qaumi is in exactly the same position as Farhad so far as what Mr Stratton SC told you is concerned.” (T 1245).
	
	
	Jamil Qaumi’s written submissions included at paragraph 5 that “[i]t is not disputed that the anticipated defences to be raised will contain matters that require the application of community standards” (emphasis in the original).
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Kalal said “I would concede at this point it would appear that an element of duress will be raised in the case in respect of Mr Kalal” (T 1234). However, Ms McSpedden submitted that this did not give rise to “a question of community standards”.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Zarshoy, in addition to raising the philosophical issue of whether “where we are and what we’re doing may all be an illusion” (T 1245), relied on the pre-trial publicity but made no submission as to what the issues might be in his client’s case. He neither confirmed nor denied that matters involving the application of community standards might arise.
	
	
	There was no discussion as to whether provocation may arise but no counsel refuted the suggestion, made in the Crown’s written submission, that provocation may be raised as an issue in the trial.
	
	
	Section 418 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) sets out the circumstances in which self-defence is available. It is in the following terms:
	


“418 Self-defence when available

(1) A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if the person carries out the conduct constituting the offence in self-defence.

(2) A person carries out conduct in self-defence if and only if the person believes the conduct is necessary:

(a) to defend himself or herself or another person, or

(b) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person, or

(c) to protect property from unlawful taking, destruction, damage or interference, or

(d) to prevent criminal trespass to any land or premises or to remove a person committing any such criminal trespass, and the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them.”


	
	Section 421 of the Crimes Act provides:
	


“421 Self-defence-excessive force that inflicts death

(1) This section applies if:

(a) the person uses force that involves the infliction of death, and

(b) the conduct is not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them, but the person believes the conduct is necessary:

(c) to defend himself or herself or another person, or

(d) to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty or the liberty of another person.

(2) The person is not criminally responsible for murder but, on a trial for murder, the person is to be found guilty of manslaughter if the person is otherwise criminally responsible for manslaughter.”


	
	These provisions make it clear that, if self-defence is an issue in the trial, the tribunal of fact will be called upon to determine whether the actions of the accused were a “reasonable response” to the threat that the accused perceived existed. The question of “reasonableness” is one of the specific matters referred to in s 132(5) that “requires the application of objective community standards”.
	
	
	Similarly, if the defence of provocation is raised, issues requiring the application of objective community standards will arise. Section 23(2)(d) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) requires a tribunal of fact considering a defence of provocation to determine whether the “conduct of the deceased could have caused an ordinary person to lose self-control to the extent of intending to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm”. It seems to me that a determination what an “ordinary person” might do in response to provocative conduct may be a matter involving an application of community standards. But even if I am wrong about that, it is nevertheless safe to proceed on the basis that a jury is the preferable tribunal to make judgments about the hypothetical reactions of the ordinary person.
	
	
	In the context of a decision under s 132 as to whether it is in the interests of justice to order that a trial be conducted by judge alone, the question of duress raises more complicated issues. The question of duress involves factual inquiries as to whether a threat was made, the nature of that threat and whether the accused acted as he did because of the threat. These are questions of fact and require a consideration of the subjective state of mind of the accused. However, the tribunal of fact must also consider whether “a person of ordinary firmness of mind and will, and of the same sex and maturity as the accused, would have yielded to the threat in the way that the accused did”: see R v Pimentel [1999] NSWCCA 401; 110 A Crim R 30 at 37. The precise content of this test was considered in R v Abusafiah (1991) 24 NSWLR 531 at 539-541 (Hunt J). His Honour noted that, like provocation, the defence “introduce[s] an objective test of reasonableness” (s 541A). However, he went on to note that “discussion of the objective test appears sometimes to have overlooked that what is involved is an evaluation of the behaviour of the accused by reference to a standard of reasonableness not a prediction as to the way in which particular individuals may behave” (s 542).
	
	
	Trying to fit the nuances and complications of the objective aspects of the defence of duress into questions raised by s 132(5) of the Act is a little like fitting the proverbial square peg into a round hole. I am not certain that s 132(5) is directly engaged in that the questions raised do not directly raise questions of objective community standards but, rather, give rise to issues around the possible reactions of a hypothetical person of reasonable firmness. However, even considered in that light, there is something to be said for the proposition that this is the kind of issue where the “interests of justice” militate in favour of judgment by a lay jury.
	
	
	However, the raising of duress by one of the accused is not a matter of great moment in an assessment of whether the overall interests of justice point towards a trial by jury. Apart from the question of whether duress raises questions of objective community standards, there is also a countervailing consideration. It could be argued (although it was not) that Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi’s case for a judge alone trial is stronger because of the prejudice that may arise if Mr Kalal calls evidence that he acted under duress as a result of their conduct.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, I have given very little weight to the fact that Mr Kalal may raise duress as an issue in the overall assessment of whether it is in the interests of justice to make an order for a trial by judge alone.
	
	
	I proceed on the basis that s 132(5) of the Act is engaged. I do not understand counsel to have submitted to the contrary. The fact that factual issues will arise requiring the application of objective community standards is a matter militating in favour of trial by a jury. However it is not determinative of the application and, as the opening words of ss (5) demonstrate, the prevailing question remains whether the Court considers that it is in the interests of justice to make an order for the accused to be tried by judge alone. Sub-section 132(5) provides some content to that question by providing a discretion (“may”) to refuse to make an order if it considers that factual issues in the trial will require the application of objective community standards. The provision makes it clear that if there is to be such an issue that is a matter that may influence the decision as to what is in the interests of justice. However, in a case such as the present, it is one matter to be taken into account along with a number of others.
	
	
	I have taken the matter into account in that way. The presence of such questions in the trial is an important factor militating against making the order sought by the accused.
	
	
	Further, as submitted by the Crown, the nature of the self-defence issue that is expected to arise is an unusual one. This is not a case that could be described as a typical self-defence case. Rather, the issue will arise in factual circumstances where one criminal group under perceived attack from another criminal group decided to make a pre-emptive strike against the attacking criminal group in order to protect itself and its leader. Was that a reasonable response to the threat? Was it a proportionate response? Those are questions that, in the absence of extremely compelling countervailing circumstances, ought to be determined by a jury randomly selected from the community.
	


Conclusion


	
	I have considered all of the matters to which reference has been made in the course of the above analysis. There are a number of compelling features of the case pointing in the direction of a trial by judge alone. These include the nature and extent of the pre-trial publicity, the complexity of the trial and evidence of criminal activity outside the substantive charges on the indictment and the fact that five individual accused, on the advice of experienced lawyers, believe that they cannot receive a fair trial before the jury.
	
	
	Against that, there are a number of safeguards that can ensure that the jurors will act in accordance with their oaths and affirmations and will not be influenced by matters of emotion and prejudice. The law generally operates on the assumption that the juries obey and act upon the directions provided by the trial Judge. Further, the body of evidence of uncharged criminal acts has been subject to lengthy discussion and agreement between experienced counsel and (no doubt) accords with the judgment delivered on the severance of counts on the indictment. Further, the most significantly prejudicial parts of this body of evidence will not be adduced by the Crown or have been excluded by ruling: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 4) and R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6). Finally, I consider that factual issues will arise that require the application of objective community standards.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account I have reached the conclusion that it is not in the interests of justice to order that the present trial to be conducted by judge alone.
	
	
	The application by each of the accused for a trial by judge order under s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) is refused.

2954562,R v Qaumi and Ors (No 11) (s 45 Crime Commission Act) [2016] NSWSC 211,"Judgment


	
	The accused Farhad Qaumi and Witness M (who was an accused person at the time but has since entered a plea of guilty) moved on separate notices of motion for orders pursuant to s 45(4) and 45(5) of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) (‘the Act’).
	
	
	Farhad Qaumi sought an order in the following terms:
	


“An order pursuant to section 45 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) that the Crime Commission makes available to the accused legal representative any evidence given for before the commission:

(a) relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun;

(b) relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy;

(c) relating to the conspiracy to murder Mahmoud Hamzy, or

(d) any evidence given by Mohammed Hamzy.”


	
	As a result of the order that I made severing the count on the indictment relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun (“the Antoun trial”), Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi did not press item (a) in the list of articles sought under the order. The Antoun trial is to proceed after the trial relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy and other related shooting offences (‘the current trial’) and whether the accused brings a separate application in relation to the Antoun trial will be a matter for him. Further, the call in relation to the evidence of Mohammed Hamzy was limited to evidence (if any) concerning the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy.
	
	
	The notice of motion on behalf of Witness M sought:
	


“An order pursuant to section 45 of the Crime Commission Act 2012 (NSW) that the Crime Commission makes available to the accused’s legal representative any evidence given before the commission by Mumtaz Qaumi and Mohammed Hamzy: –

Relating to the murder of Joseph Antoun;

Relating to the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy;

Relating to the conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy.”


	
	In the course of argument on 29 February 2016, the solicitor appearing for Witness M did not press the order in relation to evidence (if any) given by Mohammed Hamzy. Witness M then pleaded guilty on 3 March 2016. Witness M’s application was subsequently abandoned in the course of a detention application brought by the Crown following Witness M’s change of plea. [1] 
	
	
	Section 45 of the Act is in the following terms:
	


“45. Publication or disclosure of evidence

(1) The Commission may direct that:

(a) any evidence given before it, or

(b) the contents of any document, or a description of any thing, produced to the Commission or seized under a search warrant, or

(c) any information that might enable a person who has given or may be about to give evidence before the Commission to be identified or located, or

(d) the fact that any person has given or may be about to give evidence at a hearing,

must not be published, or must not be published except in such manner, and to such persons, as the Commission specifies.

(2) The Commission must give such a direction if the failure to do so might prejudice the safety or reputation of a person or prejudice the fair trial of a person who has been or may be charged with an offence.

(3) A person must not make a publication in contravention of a direction given under this section.

Maximum penalty: 100 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.

(4) If:

(a) a person has been charged with an offence before a court of the State, and

(b) the court considers that it may be desirable in the interests of justice that particular evidence given before the Commission in relation to which the Commission has given a direction under this section be made available to the person or to a legal practitioner representing the person and to the prosecutor,

the court may give to the Commission a certificate to that effect and, if the court does so, the Commission must make the evidence available to the court.

(5) If:

(a) the Commission makes evidence available to a court in accordance with subsection (4), and

(b) the court, after examining the evidence, is satisfied that the interests of justice so require,

the court may make the evidence available to the person charged with the offence concerned or to an Australian legal practitioner representing the person and to the prosecutor.

(6) This section has effect subject to section 45A.

(7) In this section:

""publish"" includes:

(a) disclose to a person, and

(b) in relation to evidence or a record of evidence-disclose any information directly contained in or implied from that evidence or record, except where the information could be obtained elsewhere.”


	
	With the exception of that part of the notice of motion purporting to catch evidence (if any) given by Mohammed Hamzy, the Crime Commission consented to orders pursuant to s 45(4) in relation to evidence (if any) caught by the Notices of Motion. In other words, the Crime Commission agreed that the material should be produced to the Court pursuant to a certificate that “the court considers that it may be desirable in the interests of justice that particular evidence given before the Commission in relation to which the Commission has given a direction under this section be made available to the person or to a legal practitioner representing the person and to the prosecutor” (my emphasis).
	
	
	In accordance with that concession I granted a certificate under s 45(4) on 24 February 2014. Pursuant to that certificate, and with the consent of the legal practitioners for Farhad Qaumi and Witness M, the Crime Commission agreed to produce to me in chambers the material (if any) caught by the notices of motion. Any such material is confidential.
	
	
	The Crime Commission objected to any orders under s 45(5) and read an open affidavit of Timothy James O’Connor (MFI 64). I also received, without objection, two confidential affidavits by Mr O’Connor. One was sworn on 29 February 2016 (confidential MFI 63) and the second sworn 2 March 2016 (confidential MFI 71).
	
	
	I note in passing that during the course of all of the argument in relation to these applications the learned Crown Prosecutor, his co-counsel and their instructing solicitors absented themselves from the court room. Transcripts of the arguments have not been provided to them. For those familiar with recent High Court authority, the reasons for this would be obvious: see X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 248 CLR 92, Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39; 251 CLR 196 and Lee v The Queen [2014] HCA 20; 253 CLR 455.
	
	
	I initially heard submissions in relation to the notices of motion on 29 February 2016. Those submissions were made in the presence of the accused and their lawyers. On 1 March 2016 I heard further submissions from Ms England who appeared for the Crime Commission. Those submissions were taken when the Court was completely closed both to the public and to the parties (a “fully closed court”). As undesirable as such a procedure may be, [2]  particularly given the seriousness of the charges faced by the applicants, it is a necessary if rarely invoked procedure where matters of state and matters involving a high degree of confidentiality are involved. Authority for such a procedure can be found, for example, in the case of R v Francis [2004] NSWCCA 85; 145 A Crim R 233 at 21.
	
	
	Further arguments were heard (in the absence of the Crown Prosecutor but in the presence of the accused and their lawyers) on 2 March 2016. I then heard further submissions in a fully closed court on Thursday, 3 March 2016 and Wednesday, 16 March 2016.
	
	
	I have considered the material in the confidential affidavit as well as the material (if any) produced by the Crime Commission.
	
	
	It is impossible, or inappropriate, to articulate the reasons for the conclusions I have reached in a judgment that is either published or made available to the legal representatives or the accused themselves. That is the nature of the application and because of the private and secretive nature of hearings and interrogations conducted by the Crime Commission. However, in order that this decision is amenable to appeal, I will record the reasons for the decision that are specific to this case in a separate and unpublished annexure.
	
	
	These more general observations are simply designed to indicate what I consider to be some of the relevant factors to be taken into account when considering an application under s 45 of the Act. 
	
	
	The first and perhaps most important consideration concerns the fundamental right of an accused to a fair trial. Dealing with relevantly identical provisions in Chapman & Anor v Gentle & Ors (1987) 28 A Crim R 29, Yeldham J said (at [32]-[33]):
	


“The words ‘the interests of justice’ and the expression ‘desirable in the interests of justice’ have in other contexts been considered from time to time. Plainly they are words of considerable width (See, for example, Herron v The Attorney-General & Ors, Court of Appeal, unreported, 21 May 1987 and The Queen v Horsham Justices ex parte Farquharson [1982] 2 QB 762.) As is made plain in those and in other authorities to which I was referred in the helpful written submissions put before me in the present case, the interests of justice incorporate as a paramount consideration that an accused person should have a fair trial. In a case such as the present, where so much reliance is placed upon the evidence of the witness Kron, and where he has on a prior occasion given evidence and made a statement concerning the same issues before the Commission, the only conclusion reasonably open to a Magistrate, to whom application is made under s13(10), is to order that the evidence before the Commission be made available to the Court. It is fundamental that if, but only if, that earlier evidence, when produced, could adversely affect the testimony given in the committal proceedings by the witness Kron, the Court should consider thereafter making it available. But in order to determine whether it could adversely affect the evidence of the witness as given before the Magistrate it must be inspected. Without an inspection, no decision as to the relevance or otherwise to the committal proceedings of what was said before the Commission can be made.

An order under s13(10) does not mean that the material is to be shown to the persons charged or their legal representatives. If, after inspecting it, the Magistrate concludes that it is of little or no relevance, in the sense that it is not in any real way different from the evidence already given by the witness before him, or if it is so highly sensitive because it reveals other inquiries concerning the accused or other alleged drug dealers that the interests of the community outweigh those of the accused in a particular case, then, no doubt, in such circumstances, no order under s13(11) would be made.”


	
	It is impossible to define in advance or with any degree of prescience or precision the matters that may be relevant to a determination of an application such as the present. Sub-section 45(5) requires the Court to make a determination of what “the interests of justice so require”. That is a quite stringent test but, in its context, the word “require” does not have the meaning of imperative as might often be the case. A similar approach was taken by Hall J in Muir v The Council of Trinity Grammar School [2005] NSWSC 555, a case involving a consideration of what the interests of justice required in determining whether a civil case should be heard by a jury. His Honour at [16] set out a series of dot-points including:
	
	
	“In context, the term require is not equivalent in, in my opinion, to necessity or the concept inherent in the word essential. It must be accepted that a judge alone is capable of hearing and determining any form of civil proceedings including, in particular, any common law claim. Accordingly s.85(2)(b) implicitly involves a broader concept than capacity to determine a claim and allows for the identification of particular matters that constitute a substantial reason or warrant for departing from the normal method or mode of trial.”
	
	
	However, the provision does set a relatively high bar for an applicant who seeks release of the material. This is so for a number of reasons, not least of which is the fact that the provision will only come into effect if the Commission has made a direction under s 45(1) that the relevant evidence must not be published. Accordingly, in any case where an application is made under s 45(4) or (5), the status quo will be that the evidence is not to be released. However, the section creates a proviso to that status quo which allows the Court to inspect the relevant transcript if it “may be desirable in the interests of justice” and then, if the “interests of justice so require”, the Court may make the evidence available to the legal practitioner representing the accused and to the prosecutor. The addition of the words “and the prosecutor” came in the aftermath of the decisions in X7 v Australian Crime Commission and Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission.
	
	
	The expression “interests of justice” is a phrase of very wide import which allows a wide number of considerations to be taken into account. In O'Hare v DPP [2000] NSWSC 430 in which O'Keefe J said at [47] - [49]:
	


“…the phrase in the ‘interests of justice’, has been construed in many contexts. Furthermore, it too is a phrase of wide impact which comprehends many factors. It is therefore undesirable, possibly impossible, to define it.

…

Since there will be a myriad of factual circumstances to which the phrase may be applied it is undesirable to limit by reference to a rigid definition what the interests of justice are.”


	
	Similarly, in Muir v Counsel of Trinity Grammar School, Hall J said at [10] that the expression “interests of justice” is a broad one and is one that enables all relevant factors to be taken into account. His Honour referred to the decision of the Full Federal Court in Acton Engineering Pty. Limited v Campbell [1991] FCA 469; 103 ALR 437 where s 44 of the Corporations Acts was under consideration. Black CJ said at 440:
	


“Section 44(2) will allow a wide range of considerations to be taken into account in deciding whether it is more appropriate for a proceeding to be determined in another court. The expression ‘the interests of justice’ is a broad one. Section 44(3) requires a court to have regard to the matters it specifies but it does not thereby limit the range of matters that fall for consideration under s44(2).”


	
	Davies J said further at 441:
	


“The term ‘interests of justice’ is a broad term which enables all relevant factors to be taken into account. Those factors include matters relating to the efficiency, including the economy and expedition, of litigation and matters of convenience having regard to the location of witnesses and records. The term would also encompass matters of policy relating to the administration of justice by the Federal Court and the State and Territory Supreme Courts.”


	
	As I have said, the interests of justice is not a phrase that can be defined by means of criteria in advance of any particular case. However, where the power under s 45(5) of the Act is invoked, there are a number of factors that may arise and might inform the exercise of the discretion granted to the court to make a determination as to what the interests of justice “require”. Without suggesting that the following is an exhaustive catalogue of the matters that might arise, the following are examples of the kind of factors pertinent to the determination under s 45(5).
	
	
	As emphasised in Chapman v Gentle the “paramount consideration” is that the accused person should have a fair trial. However, the Court will generally start from the proposition that the evidence was given in private and is subject to an order that the evidence must not be published. The witness who gave the evidence will probably have been told at the commencement of the hearing that the evidence that they give will not be published. That creates in the witness a reasonable expectation that the things that they say are said in private and that the material will not be published. That is a relevant factor in determining where the interests of justice lie.
	
	
	Next, it will be relevant whether the witness in question is likely to be a witness in the trial proceedings. That is an important factor but it is not determinative. For example, a Judge who inspects the material following the granting of a certificate under s 45(4) may become aware of the existence of a person who, while not a witness, may be in a position to give important evidence or provide important information either to the prosecution or to the defence. However, in cases where it is known that the witness at the Crime Commission is to be a prosecution witness in the trial, that will be a factor militating in favour of a finding that the interests of justice require the release of material. If the evidence before the Crime Commission is patently inconsistent with the evidence that is expected to be given by the witness in the trial, and the trial evidence expected to be inculpatory, that again will militate – in some cases, strongly – in favour of release of the material to be defendant.
	
	
	If a witness to the Crime Commission is not expected to be a witness in the trial but where their evidence may contain important exculpatory information, or give rise to theories of the case that may not be readily apparent to the defence or prosecution, that will be a factor militating in favour of release of the material.
	
	
	If the release of the material may place the witness in physical danger, that is a very strong factor militating against making an order under s 45(5). That is particularly important in cases where the witness may be seen to be an informant or has provided information inculpating known or suspected criminals. It is well known that such witnesses may be the target of reprisals. Expressions of fear by the witness in the course of their Crime Commission testimony will be a factor militating against the release of the material.
	
	
	Where it is known (and generally the transcript before the Commission will make this clear) that the witness has been compelled to give evidence over objection, there may be a greater reluctance to release the material. However, compulsion such as that is not an uncommon feature of Crime Commission evidence and it is not a determinative factor. Rather, it is another matter to be taken into account amongst the many other circumstances that might inform a proper and principled assessment of the interests of justice.
	
	
	It may also be that the Judge forms the view that the evidence is so fanciful or lacking in credit that its release to the defendant or the prosecutor will not be in the interests of justice. However, a Judge called upon to make a determination under sub-s (5) will be cautious in attempting to form such opinions based on the transcript alone.
	
	
	The more central to the facts and allegations to be litigated in the trial proceedings the more likely it will be that the interests of justice will require release of the transcript of evidence. Matters which are merely on the periphery of events are unlikely to overcome the potential damage that release of the material may do. That damage may come in the form of danger to the witnesses or in interfering with the processes of the Commission’s work. Where the subject matter of the testimony is central to an important issue in the trial, it is more likely that a Judge will form the opinion that the release of the material to the defendant and to the prosecutor is in the interests of justice.
	
	
	Another relevant factor is whether a witness who gave evidence before the Crime Commission consents to the release of their evidence. Such consent is not determinative as the Crime Commission may oppose the release of the material for reasons beyond the knowledge or care of the witness. Similarly, an objection by the witness to the release of the evidence is a relevant consideration but not a determinative one.
	
	
	The factor referred to in the preceding paragraph raises a practical consideration when an application under s 45(4) and s 45(5) is brought. A witness whose evidence is subject to such an application has a right to be heard, at least in opposition to an order under s 45(5). This raises practical problems because the accused may not be aware of the identities of witnesses who gave evidence before the Crime Commission. As I suggested in argument, one possible approach is for the Judge to consider the application on a preliminary or provisional basis and, if a view is formed that the material may be released, call on submissions from the witness.
	
	
	Those are the kinds of matters that might arise in any given case. Where relevant and applicable, I have applied that kind of approach and reasoning to a determination of the present application. However, it must not be assumed from anything that I have said that there is any evidence of the kind caught by the notice of motion. Such information will be made clear in the confidential annexure to this judgment. That annexure will be placed in a sealed envelope marked “not to be opened except by order of a judge of this Court or a judge of a higher Court” and kept with the file copy of this Judgment.
	
	
	For the reasons set out in the confidential annexure, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Subject to Orders 2 to 9 below, certain evidence given on 9 April 2014 to the New South Wales Crime Commission (‘the Crime Commission’) by the witness referred to in these proceedings as ‘Witness M’ is to be made available to:
	



	
	Mr Stratton SC, Ms Curry and Ms Gittani, the legal representatives for the accused Farhad Qaumi in these proceedings; and
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutors and solicitors acting for the Crown in these proceedings
	



	
	The Crime Commission is to produce to the Court the following documents on or before 30 March 2016:
	



	
	A copy of the transcript of Witness M’s evidence, in which the evidence that the Court has indicated ought not to be made available (in closed court on 16 March 2016 and in the Confidential Annexure to the Court’s judgment published on 21 March 2016) is highlighted; and
	
	
	A document reproducing those parts of the transcript of Witness M’s evidence that are not highlighted (‘the redacted transcript’).
	



	
	The documents produced in accordance with order (2) are to be held by the Court in a sealed envelope and marked “not to be opened except by an order of a Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales or higher court.”
	
	
	The evidence that is to be made available in accordance with Order (1) above is the redacted transcript.
	
	
	The redacted transcript is to be made available once the Court is satisfied that the redactions accord with the Confidential Annexure and matters raised in closed court.
	
	
	The redacted transcript is to be made available to the legal representatives specified in Order 1 above at the Crime Commission office at 453 – 463 Kent Street Sydney by appointment, such appointment to occur after Witness M has been sentenced for the matters to which Witness M pleaded guilty on 3 March 2016.
	
	
	The redacted transcript is not to be removed from the Crime Commission’s premises.
	
	
	No copy, photo or image of the redacted transcript is to be made other than by officers of the Crime Commission or the Crime Commission’s legal representatives.
	
	
	The legal representatives specified in Order 1 above are to retain in their possession all notes they make of the content of the redacted transcript.
	
	
	The Court notes that:
	



	
	On 24 February 2016, the Court gave the Crime Commission a certificate pursuant to subs. 45(4) of the Crime Commission Act.
	
	
	Pursuant to that certificate, the Crime Commission made certain evidence available to the Court on a confidential basis on 24 February 2016 (‘the evidence’).
	
	
	Pursuant to s. 45(5) of the Crime Commission Act, the Court is satisfied that:
	



	
	The applicant Farhad Qaumi is charged with offences before the Supreme Court;
	
	
	The evidence is subject to a non-publication order made by the Crime Commission pursuant to s. 45(1) of the Crime Commission Act; and
	
	
	The interests of justice require that the redacted transcript be made available to the legal representatives specified in Order 1 above, on the conditions set out in Orders 2 to 10 above

2954563,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 15) (Non-publication order) [2016] NSWSC 318,"Judgment


	
	In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd & Anor v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344, the New South Wales Court of Appeal quashed the decision of a District Court Judge who had ordered that there be no publication of the verdict in a case where the accused faced back-to-back trials and the second trial was to commence shortly after a jury had found him guilty of other similar offences. Spigelman CJ, with whom Handley JA and Campbell AJA agreed, discussed the tension and interplay between two fundamental principles guiding the administration of justice in a democratic society. Those principles concern the public interest in open justice and the principle that a citizen accused by the state of committing serious crimes is entitled to a fair trial free of prejudice. The Chief Justice said at [17]:
	


“As often happens in a context involving fundamental principle, two such principles are in conflict and a judgment must be made as to which principle is to prevail in the circumstances. The principle of open justice and the principle of a fair trial each inform and energise many areas of the law, as I have sought to show in extra-judicial addresses. (See, Spigelman, ‘Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice’ (2000) 74 ALJ 290, 378 and Spigelman, ‘The Truth Can Cost Too Much: The Principle of a Fair Trial’ (2004) 78 ALJ 29.)”


	
	His Honour went on to describe at [18]-[23] the two fundamental principles. His Honour said at [18]:
	


“It is well established that the principle of open justice is one of the most fundamental aspects of the system of justice in Australia. The conduct of proceedings in public including, relevantly, the taking of verdicts after a criminal trial, is an essential quality of an Australian    court of justice.”


	
	His Honour noted that “it is also well established that the exceptions to the principle of open justice are few and strictly defined.” His Honour then described the principle of a fair trial and emphasised at [22]-[23] that the High Court has characterised it in “the most forceful terms”:
	


“22. It has been described as ‘the central thesis of the administration of criminal justice’: McKinney v The Queen (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 478; as ‘the central prescript of our criminal law’: Jago at 56; as a ‘fundamental element’ or a ‘fundamental prescript’: Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 299, 326; and as an ‘overriding requirement’: Dietrich at 330. It is not a new principle. As Isaacs J put it in 1923 with reference to ‘the elementary right of every accused person to a fair and impartial trial’: ‘Every conviction set aside, every new criminal trial ordered, are mere exemplifications of this fundamental principle’: R v MacFarlane; Ex parte O’Flanaghan & O’Kelly (1932) 32 CLR 518 at 541-542.

23. There is no aspect of preparation for trial or of criminal procedure which is not touched by, or indeed determined by, the principle of a fair trial. As Lord Devlin once put it: ‘… [N]early the whole of the English criminal law of procedure and evidence has been made by the exercise of the judges of their power to see that what was fair and just was done between prosecutors and accuseds.” Connelly v Director of Public Prosecutions [1964] AC 1254 at 1347.”


	
	In the present case the interaction and conflict between these two core principles is as stark as one could imagine. Unlike the situation described by Lord Devlin, this is not a contest between the prosecutor and the accused. The parties to the trial present a strong and united position. However, an equally forceful position has been put by a group of the some of the great players in the Australian media. While the prosecutor and the accused advocate by reference to the principle of a fair trial, the great media interests advance their case by reference to the fundamental requirement of open justice and the desirability that criminal cases are subject to full and fair reporting.
	
	
	The question for the Court involves a consideration, in the light of the relevant law including the statutory embodiment of the principle of open justice in s 6 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (Court Suppression Act), of which principle should prevail and, if there is to be any restriction on the principle of open justice, what steps can be taken to ensure that those restrictions are as small as possible.
	
	
	The question is not one that is easy to resolve and I have deliberated and contemplated anxiously for some days before arriving at a decision.
	
	
	The dilemma arises in circumstances where two of the accused in a trial which is soon to commence (“the present trial”), seek orders pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression Act that there be a prohibition on publication of the evidence given in relation to the present trial for a nominated period. The basis upon which the application is made is that the two accused men are to face a separate trial scheduled to commence at the conclusion of the present trial and that publication of the evidence in the present trial would undermine their right to a fair trial in the subsequent proceedings because it would be impossible to secure a jury which was not influenced by the media publicity surrounding the present trial. In terms of the grounds provided for in s 8 of the Court Suppression Act, the accused submit that “the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice” and/or that “it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.”
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions supports the application.
	
	
	The media organisations submit that there are other means by which the fair trial of the two accused men could be secured and that, accordingly, it is not “necessary” (to adopt the words of both the common law and the statute) to make an order prohibiting publication of the whole of the evidence in the trial.
	
	
	The present judgment is one of a series of judgments that I have delivered in the course of a series of pre-trial hearings that commenced in November 2015 and which will conclude with the commencement of the trial on 4 April 2016. This judgment must be read in conjunction with other judgments that have touched upon the same principles and the same questions concerning the interaction of the criminal justice system, the protection of witnesses, the rights of the accused and the principle of open justice. In particular, the reader should be aware of judgments in which I have been called upon to make orders protecting the safely of informant witnesses (R v Qaumi & Ors (AVL) [2015] NSWSC 1711), orders that the accused be tried by judge alone (R v Qaumi & Ors (No 14) (Judge Alone) [2016] NSWSC 274), orders that certain organisations “take down” 25 articles published on the internet (R v Qaumi & Ors (No 16) (Take Down Orders) [2016] NSWSC 319) and an application by the Police Commissioner that the court be closed during the course of the evidence of some twelve witnesses (R v Qaumi & Ors (No 9) (Court Closure) [2016] NSWSC 171).
	
	
	The reader – upon consideration of those other judgments and apprised of the various applications and conflicting and contradictory principles – will more readily appreciate and understand both the difficulty of the decision that I am here called upon to make and the reasons that I have reached the decision that I have. Further, the reader will understand better the nature of the case confronting the accused by referring to the analysis of the facts and evidence undertaken in a judgment determining an application for severance of counts and separation of trials: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) (Severance and Separate Trials) [2016] NSWSC 15.
	
	
	Having considered all alternatives, I have reached the conclusion that orders restricting (by effectively postponing) the publication of the evidence and submissions in the present trial are necessary to ensure the fair trial of the accused and also to ensure that justice is not denied (by being unnecessarily delayed) to the accused, the witnesses and, perhaps most importantly, to the secondary victims of the murder that is the subject of the second trial to be held in this Court.
	


The criminal proceedings


	
	The background to the proceedings, and a more detailed summary of the facts and evidence, can be gleaned from my judgment in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3). When the matter first came before me in July 2015 there were nine accused facing 36 counts. Within most of those counts, several accused stood charged. Since that time, four of the accused have ceased to be parties to the proceedings. First, the accused (Nazir Akbari) entered pleas of guilty to certain charges and his case is to be (or has been) dealt with in the District Court. Then, on 3 February 2016, I made orders severing counts 1 to 10 and counts 30 and 31 from the original indictment. The result was that two further accused (John Bishop and Mohammed Nasiri) were remitted to the District Court for their criminal proceedings to be conducted in that Court. Most recently, on 3 March 2016, an accused (now known as witness M) entered pleas of guilty before me and indicated a willingness to give evidence against the remaining five accused. She is to be sentenced in the last week of March 2016.
	
	
	The first of the two back-to-back trials is due to commence on 4 April 2016. The present trial involves five accused charged with 24 offences. Those offences encompass five separate but related shooting incidents. The prosecution case is that those five incidents arose out of a “turf war” between two rival criminal groups known as the Brothers for Life Blacktown (including the current five accused men) and the Brothers for Life Bankstown (the targets of the five shootings). The first shooting incident (the Hamzy shooting) occurred on 29 October 2013 and resulted in the accused being charged with the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy, the conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy and the infliction of grievous bodily harm on Omar Ojaj (by shooting him) with intent. [1]  The next incident (the Odisho shooting) took place on 3 November 2013 and resulted in three of the accused being charged with solicit to murder Michael Odisho and shooting with intent to murder Michael Odisho. [2]  The third incident (the Zakaria shooting) occurred on 4 November 2013 and gives rise to charges against the accused (or some of them) of soliciting to murder and wound with intent to murder. [3]  The fourth shooting (the Chokolatta Café shooting) on 7 November gives rise to the accused being charged with soliciting to murder Abdul Abu-Mahmoud and shooting at Abdul Abu-Mahmoud with intent to murder him. There were two other named victims to that shooting. [4]  Finally on 29 November 2013 there was a shooting at Bankstown resulting in charges of shoot with intent to murder Anthony Elkadi. [5] 
	
	
	The present applicants for non-publication orders (that is, Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi) stand charged with each of the offences to which I have just referred. In addition, those two accused are also charged in the present trial with a number of other offences including possession of firearms, the commercial supply of drugs and participating in a criminal group known as the Brothers for Life at Blacktown. According to the prosecution case, the two accused were the leaders of that criminal organisation.
	
	
	The evidence that the Crown expects to adduce in the course of the current trial includes the evidence of some 12 or 13 informant witnesses, a number of whom have given evidence in the course of the pre-trial hearings. Their evidence will provide a narrative describing a period of significant violence and lawlessness orchestrated by Farhad Qaumi and, to a somewhat lesser degree, his brother Mumtaz Qaumi. There will be evidence of the killing of one man and the wounding of a number of others including an innocent young girl who received a large number of wounds when a shotgun was discharged in the course of the Zakaria shooting.
	
	
	The Crown will also lead a body of forensic and medical evidence in order to establish the fact of the killing of Mr Hamzy and the wounding of around 8 other persons. That evidence will be of a graphic and distressing nature. There will be other evidence upon which the Crown will rely in support of the informant witnesses including a body of evidence said to establish that Farhad Qaumi employed violence and intimidation to ensure that the members of the group obeyed his orders.
	
	
	The parties have indicated that they anticipate that the present trial will take something in the order of 4 months, although one counsel suggested it may last for as long as 6 months “including the jury’s deliberations”.
	
	
	As part of my judgment on severance of the counts, I ordered that the second trial of Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi is to proceed after the conclusion of the first trial. In that second trial, the Crown will allege that each of them is guilty of the murder of a man named Joseph Antoun. This was count 30 on the original indictment. However, I ordered the count should be severed from the indictment because it would be impossible for the accused to receive a fair trial if evidence in relation to all of these matters was received by the same jury. I took the view that it would be impossible to fashion directions to a jury that would overcome the prejudice inherent in a trial in which those two accused faced not only the Antoun murder charge but also the series of charges said (by the Crown) to have arisen in the course of the turf war between the Bankstown and Blacktown chapters of the Brothers for Life.
	
	
	It is the accused’s case on the current application that if the current proceedings are subject to extensive media coverage, it will be impossible to summon a jury pool that is not affected or influenced by the knowledge of these earlier incidents. They submit that the media coverage that can be anticipated during the present trial will render otiose the orders for severance and separation of the trials.
	


The evidence and earlier media coverage


	
	The applicants read an affidavit of Mumtaz Qaumi’s solicitor (Ms Sten) dated 2 March 2016 [6]  as well as affidavits filed in support of an application for a trial by judge alone. This included an affidavit of the solicitor for Farhad Qaumi (Ms Gittani) dated 15 January 2016 [7]  including annexures (A to I) comprising internet searches and material published at around the time of the shooting incidents and the arrests of the accused as well as more recent media coverage surrounding the sentencing of an offender known as Witness L in early September 2015. The material also included an affidavit of Ms Sten dated 28 January 2016 [8]  annexing (A to L) a number of searches and publications obtained by the solicitor on a search of the internet.
	
	
	The accused also tendered a newspaper article from the Sunday Telegraph dated Sunday March 6, 2016 entitled “Razor Blade Justice” and an editorial in the same paper which was related to the front-page item to which I have just referred. [9] 
	
	
	That was the evidence on the present application. The Intervenors did not adduce any evidence on this application.
	
	
	In the limited time available to prepare this judgment, I am unable to summarise individually the newspaper and other media items annexed to the affidavits. In the course of my judgment on the application for judge alone trial, I provided an overview of the material: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 14) (Judge Alone) at [50]-[68]. On one view, the previous newspaper articles and material located on the internet does little to establish, prospectively, the kind of prejudice that the accused men seek to establish in order to enliven the restrictive jurisdiction in ss 7 to 8 of the Court Suppression Act. However, I accept that the body of material that has been tendered on this application allows me to draw an inference both as to the nature and the extent of the media coverage that this trial is likely to attract: cf Mr C (1993) 67 A Crim R 562 at 565. I accept that the coverage is likely to be prominent, dramatic and sustained throughout the period of the trial. I further accept that the coverage is likely to be published in both the electronic and print media and that items published on the television, radio and newspapers will also readily be available on the internet. The Court is entitled to assume that the coverage will not be buried in the back pages of the newspaper if the front page Sunday Telegraph article “Razor Blade Justice” (MFI 84) is anything to go by. That article was published after I varied non-publication order over an incident that occurred in the courtroom to enable the article’s publication. In argument, it was submitted that the article would be “anodyne”. It was hardly that.
	
	
	I am comfortably satisfied that, in the absence of some form of restriction on the publication, a large sector of the public will become aware of the fact that Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi are alleged to have been the leaders of the group known as the Brothers for Life at Blacktown and directed the activities of that organisation and that those activities included criminality of the highest order. The public would be made aware that the criminality included a number of shooting incidents in which one man was killed and a number of others seriously wounded or injured. Included would be the allegation that an innocent child was injured when a shot gun was discharged in her home.
	
	
	There is little doubt that if a jury trying the Antoun murder case was aware of some or all of this material, it would be inimical to the accused’s right to a fair trial. It would make the orders severing the counts otiose and it would not be possible (as I made clear in my judgment on severance) to direct the jury in such a way as to overcome the prejudice.
	


The reluctance of the courts to interfere with the media’s right to report on court cases


	
	The law cherishes the principle of open justice and is strongly resistant to interference with the right and duty of the media to report what happens inside of our courts. The courts, particularly the superior courts, are armed with a number of weapons to combat the possibility that media coverage will prejudice the rights of accused persons to receive a fair trial. However, whether those powers are being exercised as a consequence of a superior court’s inherent power or as a result of the powers provided the Court Suppression Act, the authorities establish that a judge should be extremely hesitant before making orders that interfere with the important functions of the media. Before any order is made that interferes with the right to report court cases full and fairly, an applicant for such an order must establish that such an order is “necessary”. This has always been the approach taken by the common law: see, for example, John Fairfax Publications v District Court of NSW and John Fairfax v The Police Tribunal of New South Wales (1986) 5 NSWLR 465. In Nagi v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2009] NSWCCA 197 Basten JA (with whom Hulme and Johnson JJ agreed) said:
	


“31. Thus, that which is ‘necessary’ to achieve the due administration of justice is that which would prevent it being frustrated. To say that the order must be ‘really necessary’ is to emphasise the burden borne by the applicant for the order, rather than to create some different test.

32. Although reference was made in the course of submissions to various public interests sought to be protected by legislation, none was identified which directly involved any legislative modification of the open justice rule. Accordingly, the question must remain whether the order sought by the applicant was indeed necessary to secure the proper administration of justice in the proceedings before the District Court.”


	
	In John Fairfax v The Police Tribunal of New South Wales, McHugh JA (Glass JA agreeing) said at 476-477:
	


“The power to make orders binding outside the courtroom:

The fundamental rule of the common law is that the administration of justice must take place in open court. A court can only depart from this rule where its observance would frustrate the administration of justice or some other public interest for whose protection Parliament has modified the open justice rule. The principle of open justice also requires that nothing should be done to discourage the making of fair and accurate reports of what occurs in the courtroom. Accordingly, an order of a court prohibiting the publication of evidence is only valid if it is really necessary to secure the proper administration of justice in proceedings before it. Moreover, an order prohibiting publication of evidence must be clear in its terms and do no more than is necessary to achieve the due administration of justice. The making of the order must also be reasonably necessary; and there must be some material before the court upon which it can reasonably reach the conclusion that it is necessary to make an order prohibiting publication. Mere belief that the order is necessary is insufficient. When the court is an inferior court, the order must do no more than is “necessary to enable it to act effectively within” its jurisdiction. Courts have no general authority, however, to make orders binding people in their conduct outside the courtroom. Judicial power is concerned with the determination of disputes and the making of orders concerning existing rights, duties and liabilities of persons involved in proceedings before the courts. An order made in court is no doubt binding on the parties, the witnesses and other persons in the courtroom. But an order purporting to operate as a common rule and to bind people generally is an exercise of legislative — not judicial-power. Nevertheless, conduct outside the courtroom which deliberately frustrates the effect of an order made to enable a court to act effectively within its jurisdiction may constitute a contempt of court. But the conduct will be a contempt because the person involved has intentionally interfered with the proper administration of justice and not because he was bound by the order itself. I think that the above statement of the applicable principles is in accordance with the way in which this branch of the law has developed.”


	
	In Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 the House of Lords made enduring observations about these matters. The Lord Chancellor said (at 435-440):
	


“Whatever may have been the power of the Ecclesiastical Courts, the power of an ordinary Court of justice to hear in private cannot rest merely on the discretion of the judge or on his individual view that it is desirable for the sake of public decency or morality that the hearing should take place in private. If there is any exception to the broad principle which requires the administration of justice to take place in open Court, that exception must be based on the application of some other and overriding principle which defines the field of exception and does not leave its limits to the individual discretion of the judge.

…

In order to make my meaning distinct, I will put the proposition in another form. While the broad principle is that the Courts of this country must, as between parties, administer justice in public, this principle is subject to apparent exceptions, such as those to which I have referred. But the exceptions are themselves the outcome of a yet more fundamental principle that the chief object of Courts of justice must be to secure that justice is done. In the two cases of wards of Court and of lunatics the Court is really sitting primarily to guard the interests of the ward or the lunatic. Its jurisdiction is in this respect parental and administrative, and the disposal of controverted questions is an incident only in the jurisdiction. It may often be necessary, in order to attain its primary object, that the Court should exclude the public. The broad principle which ordinarily governs it therefore yields to the paramount duty, which is the care of the ward or the lunatic. The other case referred to, that of litigation as to a secret process, where the effect of publicity would be to destroy the subject-matter, illustrates a class which stands on a different footing. There it may well be that justice could not be done at all if it had to be done in public. As the paramount object must always be to do justice, the general rule as to publicity, after all only the means to an end, must accordingly yield. But the burden lies on those seeking to displace its application in the particular case to make out that the ordinary rule must as of necessity be superseded by this paramount consideration. The question is by no means one which, consistently with the spirit of our jurisprudence, can be dealt with by the judge as resting in his mere discretion as to what is expedient. The latter must treat it as one of principle, and as turning, not on convenience, but on necessity.

I think that if the principle in cases of secret process be what I have stated, it affords guidance in other cases. In Rex v. Clement, where under special circumstances it was held that daily publication of the evidence in a particular criminal trial in defiance of the judge had impeded justice, and was, therefore, an offence against it, we have a different illustration of a rule which may have manifold application, and may cover cases of the class before us in this appeal. But unless it be strictly necessary for the attainment of justice, there can be no power in the Court to hear in camera either a matrimonial cause or any other where there is contest between parties. He who maintains that by no other means than by such a hearing can justice be done may apply for an unusual procedure. But he must make out his case strictly, and bring it up to the standard which the underlying principle requires. He may be able to shew that the evidence can be effectively brought before the Court in no other fashion. He may even be able to establish that subsequent publication must be prohibited for a time or altogether. But this further conclusion he will find more difficult in a matrimonial case than in the case of the secret process, where the objection to publication is not confined to the mere difficulty of giving testimony in open Court. In either case he must satisfy the Court that by nothing short of the exclusion of the public can justice be done. The mere consideration that the evidence is of an unsavoury character is not enough, any more than it would be in a criminal Court, and still less is it enough that the parties agree in being reluctant to have their case tried with open doors.

…

In my opinion there was no valid reason for hearing the case in camera and the order was made in reality for the benefit of the parties who concurred in asking for it, and was therefore made under a mistaken impression as to the law. And if that be the substance of the matter it disposes of the appeal. The order was wrong, and it could not effect the abrogation of the prima facie right, excluded only in exceptional cases such as I have already spoken of, which the parties and the public possess to make known what takes place at the hearing and to discuss it.

Even if the order had been validly made by reason of the consent of the parties, it could have provided nothing more than an instrument for enforcing an agreement come to as to the mode in which the hearing should take place. A breach of the order would, therefore, have in substance been punishable only on the same footing as a breach of an ordinary order in a civil case for an injunction; and a punitive order made with reference to the breach falls, in such cases, outside the language of s. 47 of the Judicature Act of 1873, which provides that no appeal shall lie from a judgment of the High Court in any criminal cause or matter. If the principle which governs the jurisdiction of the Divorce Court to hear in camera is that which I have sought to explain, this conclusion is the only one which is consistent with the section and the decisions which interpret it.”


	
	As I observed in two of my earlier judgments, the principle of open justice is central to the existence of a functioning democratic society: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 8) (Variation of non-publication orders) [2016] NSWSC 184 at [22]-[26] and R v Qaumi & Ors (No 9) (Court Closure) [2016] at [19]-[23].
	
	
	The Court Suppression Act reflects the common law’s insistence on the principle of open justice and incorporates the test of necessity. It does this in two clear and distinct ways. First, s 6 is entitled “safeguarding public interest in open justice” and is in the following unambiguous terms:
	


“In deciding whether to make a suppression order or non-publication order, a court must take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice.”


	
	It also achieves its purpose by the terms of s 8 which provide the grounds upon which the powers vested in the court by the Court Suppression Act might be exercised. In each case the powers cannot be exercised unless it is necessary to achieve a number of clearly identified objectives. Section 8 provides:
	


“(1) A court may make a suppression order or non-publication order on one or more of the following grounds:

(a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice,

(b) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the interests of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory in relation to national or international security,

(c) the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person,

(d) the order is necessary to avoid causing undue distress or embarrassment to a party to or witness in criminal proceedings involving an offence of a sexual nature (including an act of indecency),

(e) it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.

(2) A suppression order or non-publication order must specify the ground or grounds on which the order is made.”


	
	Since the introduction of those provisions, the higher courts have emphasised that the test of necessity must not be in any way diluted or misunderstood. The meaning of “necessary” in the Court Suppression Act has been considered in a number of cases: see, for example, Reinhart v Welker [2011] NSWCA 403 at [27]-[31] (Bathurst CJ and McColl JA) and Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125; 293 ALR 384 at [8]–[9] (Bathurst CJ) and [45]-[51] (Basten JA).
	
	
	The Chief Justice and McColl JA said in Reinhart v Welker:
	


“Significantly, an order is not ‘necessary’ if it appears to the court ‘to be convenient, reasonable or sensible, or to serve some notion of the public interest, still less that, as the result of some “balancing exercise”, the order appears to have one or more of those characteristics’: Hogan v Australian Crime Commission (at [31]).”


	
	That passage is an important one and clearly distinguishes between a finding that an order is “convenient, reasonable or sensible” from a finding that an order is necessary. Further, it makes it clear, as was stressed by counsel for the Intervenors, that the decision to order non-publication or suppression of material is not to be undertaken by engaging in some form of balancing exercise in which the various interests are placed on either side of the scales. Rather, it is a matter of considering all of the evidence and interests and determining whether it is truly “necessary” to make the orders sought or some variation of those orders.
	
	
	While it is self-evident, it cannot be stressed enough that this is an exceptionally high test.
	
	
	In Fairfax Digital Australia and New Zealand v Ibrahim, Basten JA stressed that consideration must be given to the nature of the order under contemplation and the extent to which such an order interferes with the public interest in open justice. His Honour said at [51]:
	


“It is therefore desirable to distinguish between two kinds of constraint referred to above, namely constraints on publication of material disclosed in court proceedings and publication of material having no connection with court proceedings except its capacity to affect current or future proceedings. Because the orders in the present case do not fall within the first category they do not involve any constraint upon the principle of open justice; they do not impinge in any way on the rights of the applicants to publish what may happen at the trial. Rather they are limited to the pre-trial (and on-going) publication of material having a tendency to interfere with the fairness of the anticipated trial. An order designed to protect the proper administration of justice, without impinging upon the principle of open justice, may well be considered necessary so long as it is reasonably appropriate and adapted to achieve its perceived purpose: compare Hogan v Australian Crime Commission [2010] HCA 21; 240 CLR 651 at [31] (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ) and Thomas at [102] (Gummow and Crennan JJ).”


	
	Such considerations were at the forefront of my mind, when I refused the application (with one exception) to close the Court during the hearing of a large number of witness’s evidence: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 9) (Court Closure) at [19]-[23].
	
	
	Closing a court to the public or the kinds of alternative suggestions made in that application (for example, registering the names of members of the public who sought to enter the court room) is at the extreme end of interference with the public interest in open justice. An order prohibiting publication of all of the evidence and submissions in the courtroom is also a significant interference with the principle of open justice. That is particularly so if the order is to remain in force for an extended period of time. However, making such orders does not represent the same kind of interference with open justice principles as closing the court. The extent to which that is so will turn on the duration of the order.
	


Orders that have been made in other cases


	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi acknowledge the force of this line of authority and the imposing test provided by the case law and the terms of ss 6 and 8 of the Court Suppression Act. However, they drew to my attention a number of cases in which orders have been made in order to protect the integrity of forthcoming or upcoming court proceedings.
	
	
	For example in “Mr C” (1993) 67 A Crim R 562, the Court of Criminal Appeal determined that, in spite of the absence of a clear statutory power, the Court should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to protect the integrity and fairness of a future trial by referring to the applicant by a pseudonym. Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Smart and James JJ agreed) said at 565-566:
	


“The legitimate public concern in the identity of the particular convicted prisoner who is seeking leave to appeal in this case is not of such moment as to outweigh the interests of justice that the applicant's murder trial proceed without prejudicial interference. If the application is refused, the applicant will unnecessarily be given an arguable appeal point in the event that he is found guilty of the murder charge, and there may in any event linger an unfortunate public impression that his trial was not as fair as it should and could have been: cf Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 614; 60 A Crim R 18 at 33-34.”


	
	His Honour also made other observations in the case of Mr C which are relevant to the present applications. First, his Honour’s judgment demonstrates that it is legitimate to take into account the previous media coverage in attempting to discern the likely or probable nature of the media coverage that would attend the trial upon which I am about to embark. His Honour said at 565:
	


“The evidence in support of the present application includes the publicity already given to the applicant's committal proceedings on the charge of murder. That publicity was extensive, and I would certainly draw the inference from it that the media is unlikely to exercise any voluntary self-restraint in relation to any other matter in court in which the applicant is involved.”


	
	His Honour also referred to the possibility of delaying the murder trial in order to allow the publicity to abate. His Honour said at 566:
	


“There has already been a considerable delay in bringing the murder charge (through lack of any awareness by the authorities of the applicant's actions), and both the family of the deceased and the community generally are entitled to have that charge resolved as soon as reasonably possible.”


	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi next referred to the decisions in R v GSR (1) [2011] NSWDC 14, R v GSR (No 2) [2011] NSWDC 16 and R v GSR (No 3) [2011] NSWDC 17. That was a case involving a surgeon who was subject to a series of back-to-back trials. The media had styled him the “Butcher of Bega” and his trials and court proceedings had attracted significant media publicity. At the conclusion of the first trial, the District Court Judge presiding determined that the media coverage had been so extensive that the likelihood of obtaining an unbiased jury in the current climate was such that it was in the interests of justice to order a judge alone trial.
	
	
	Reference was also made to R v Abdallah (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 111 where orders were made to suppress the name and identity of a witness who was to give evidence in a trial and who had been charged with contempt for refusing to answer questions.
	
	
	In R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357, Johnson J made orders prohibiting publication of the pending trial of the applicant along with the use of a pseudonym in order to prevent the possible prejudice to the accused’s forthcoming murder trial. At the end of hearing arguments on the application for a judge alone trial, I made similar orders for the same reasons in order to protect the integrity of the present trial proceedings: see R v Qaumi and Ors (No 10) [2016] NSWSC 25. However, those orders do nothing to protect the two Qaumi brothers from prejudice in their conduct of the Antoun trial.
	
	
	Mr Stratton also referred to case where a judge sitting in the bail Court ordered non-publication in relation to the details of that case on the basis that failure to do so would interfere with the rights of that applicant for bail to a fair trial in the ensuing months: see JM v R [2015] NSWSC 978. That case is distinguishable because the bail judgment related to exactly the same charges as the trial that the non-publication order was designed to protect. Similar orders are often made in the bail Court and also in the Court of Criminal Appeal when an order for a new trial is made.
	
	
	The cases to which Mr Stratton SC referred provide some support for the proposition that a court may make orders which interfere to some degree with the public interest in open justice. However in none of those cases was an order made suppressing all of the evidence in a trial in order to protect a forthcoming back-to-back trial.
	


Back-to-back trials and the possibility of delaying the commencement of the Antoun trial


	
	Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi was able to identify one case in which such an order was made. However, that was a case of some significant antiquity and it is difficult to apply that case to the facts and circumstances that pertain in 2016. The case upon which Mr Young SC relied was the case of R v Clements (1821) 4 B & A 218; 106 ER 918 in which Abbott CJ made an order at the commencement of the trial of an indictment for high treason that there should be no publication of any of the proceedings until the whole trial (really a series of trials) came to a conclusion. The indictment had been found against a number of individuals. However, the charges had been severed and the accused were to be tried separately and sequentially. The Court of King’s Bench held that the order was properly made on the ground that the proceedings would not terminate until the last of the prisoners had been put to trial. Bailey J said (at 230) that the court “had authority to make any order which they might judge to be necessary, in order to preserve the purity of the administration of justice”. The foregoing is the summary provided by McHugh JA (as his Honour then was) in John Fairfax & Sons Ltd v Police Tribunal (NSW) at 477. McHugh JA noted that “the decision in R v Clement was approved by Viscount Haldane LC in Scott v Scott [1913] AC 417 at 438 and by Lord Atkinson (at 453-454).”
	
	
	However McHugh JA went on to doubt that R v Clements was authority for the proposition that such an order was “binding on members of the public”. The case was also considered by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd & Anor v District Court of New South Wales from paragraph [68]-[79] where the former Chief Justice concluded at [79] that it “is by no means clear to me that R v Clements is authority supporting a power to make orders directly binding upon the public at large, relevantly the media.”
	
	
	I accept that R v Clements provides some authority that there may be circumstances in which a court may suppress the publication of evidence in order to protect the integrity of other criminal proceedings. However, the case is of significant antiquity and was decided at a time when the average length of criminal proceedings was days rather than months. I confess that I am not greatly assisted by a consideration of the decision of an English court in the early part of the 19th century. Nevertheless I am grateful to Senior Counsel for having drawn the existence of the case to my attention.
	
	
	Returning to where I began, Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications v The District Court of NSW & Ors made important observations in relation to the circumstances of a back-to-back trials. His Honour’s comments at 360 are worth repeating in full:
	


“It is conceivable that media publicity may create a situation in which an accused will not be able to have a fair trial within a reasonable period or at all. In that circumstance an anticipatory non-publication order may be needed to ensure fairness to the prosecution. However, that exceptional case is so unlikely that it cannot form the basis for an implication of a power on a test of necessity. Applications for a permanent stay have failed in the most sensational of cases: Anita Cobby, Ivan Milat, Phillip Bell, the Childers Backpacker Hostel fire, Lucy Dudko, William D'Arcy, Bruce Burrell. (Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94; R v Milat (Court of Criminal Appeal, 26 February 1998, unreported); R v Bell (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 October 1998, unreported); R v Long (2002) 128 A Crim R 11; R v Dudko (2002) 132 A Crim R 371; R v D'Arcy (2003) 140 A Crim R 303; R v Burrell [2004] NSWCCA 185.)

If the truly exceptional case ever arises it can be handled by the exercise of the protective inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. In any event, I find it quite inconceivable that such a case could emerge from the publication of a verdict after anything like normal publicity of the course of a trial.

In civil proceedings, which were conducted in camera as they concerned a threat of disclosure of confidential information, a restriction on the publication of the order was found to have gone too far. In David Syme & Co Ltd v General Motors-Holden's Ltd [1984] 2 NSWLR 294 at 301D–F, Street CJ said:

‘… I find it almost inconceivable to contemplate a case in which there should be a total black-out upon the terms of the order. Important as it is that proceedings and reasons should be heard and stated in public, it is even more important that the solemn formality of a curial order should be capable of publication. To admit to exceptions to this requirement is a far reaching step. It affects not merely the individual against whom the order may be made. The public itself has a right to know what orders are being made by courts and it is incumbent on judges so to formulate their orders as to give effect to this right.’

I agree with Street CJ. The qualification in the word almost appearing before ‘inconceivable’ cannot satisfy a test of necessity.

There are situations in which back to back trials are desirable. The issue would arise most acutely in such a case. However, those situations encompass considerations such as the convenience of witnesses, the efficient deployment of prosecutorial resources, the effective management of a court's caseload. Considerations of convenience and efficiency are a wholly inadequate basis to justify the implication of a power to prohibit publication of a verdict. If such considerations are to operate as a qualification of the principle of open justice, express statutory authority is required.

I have not overlooked the fact that the ability of a stay or adjournment to ensure a fair trial has been substantially attenuated by the immediate accessibility of information on the internet with an efficiency that overrides the practical obscurity of the past. This accessibility poses significant challenges for the administration of criminal justice. (See HM Advocate v Beggs (No 2) 2002 SLT 139; Director of Public Prosecutions v Weiss [2002] VSC 153; R v McLachlan [2000] VSC 215; R v Long; R v Cogley [2000] VSCA 231 at [10]–[18]; R v K (2003) 59 NSWLR 431; R v Crowther- Wilkinson [2004] NSWCCA 249.)

Legislative intervention is advisable. (Section 69A of the Jury Act 1995 (Qld) prohibits inquiries by jurors, including by searching electronic databases.) In R v Burrell, I indicated that it may be desirable for the Crown to conduct searches in advance of a trial and, where necessary, request Australian-based websites to remove references to an accused for the period of a trial. In New South Wales the standard directions to a jury warn the jury not to access internet databases. In some cases it may be necessary to return to the past practice of sequestering the jury. In some cases a judge-alone trial may be appropriate.

The courts are still adapting to this new technology. However, nothing suggests that a power to order non-publication of a verdict is necessary to meet this challenge.”


	
	Three things must be remembered in applying the decision in John Fairfax Publications v District Court. First, the decision related to the powers that could properly be implied into the jurisdiction of a statutory court (i.e. the District Court of New South Wales). It was not concerned with the inherent power enjoyed by a superior Court. The power of this Court to make such orders was acknowledged when his Honour said “if the truly exceptional case ever arises it can be handled by the exercise of the protective inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court”. Second, the decision by the primary Judge was to order the verdict in circumstances where there had been no restriction on the publication of the evidence and submissions. Finally, it demonstrates that the anticipated publicity surrounding a trial and its likely interference in the process of justice must be extreme or extraordinary before such an order will be made, even by a Court with inherent jurisdiction to make it.
	
	
	Counsel for the Intervenors suggested a number of alternatives which were available and which demonstrated that the orders sought by the accused are not necessary in the relevant and restrictive sense contemplated by the authorities. In particular, he submitted that an adjournment of the Antoun trial was an available option and that the existence of that option meant that the orders sought are not necessary. In advancing this submission, he placed significant reliance on the observations of Spigelman CJ to which I have just referred.
	
	
	In response to the suggestion from the media that the second trial could simply be adjourned for a period to allow the media attention to abate, the Crown Prosecutor – who strongly supports the application made by the accused – made the following compelling and forceful submission:
	


“Your Honour would take into account other matters such as, well, these are murder trials, three murder trials and related offences. They do involve family and friends of deceased who have an interest in these matters proceeding as speedily as possible. Now, I should put first, of course, the accused have that interest and the Court should take great care in ensuring that their trials proceed as speedily as possible.

So there is the interests of those who are either victims or family or friends of deceased. There is, in this case, as I indicated, up to potentially five of the informer witnesses giving evidence in the Antoun matter and 12 or 13 in the first trial. There is an interest in our submission, both a public interest and in the administration of justice, that those in the position of an informer, that their evidence is taken on the relevant proceeding as soon as possible.” [10] 


	
	Further, the Crown Prosecutor was able to take me to a case in this Court where an order along the lines of that sought here was made. That was a decision of Hidden J in R v A, S and M [2005] NSWSC 478. That case received some notoriety and was subject to significant media attention. In the course of its progress through the courts, the accused were known by other pseudonyms: see R v MSK and MAK [2004] NSWCCA 308; 61 NSWLR 204, R v MAK; R v MSK [2005] NSWCCA 98, R v MAK; R v MSK; R v MMK [2005] NSWCCA 369 and Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd re MSK, MAK, MMK and MRK [2006] NSWCCA 386. The case involved a group of Pakistani brothers who were on trial for a series of sexual assault offences against young women or teenage girls. There were a number of similar features in the cases and they were to be tried in a series of back-to-back trials. In the present case, the learned Crown Prosecutor provided not only a copy of Justice Hidden’s decision but also the transcripts of the argument on 16 May 2005 and 21 July 2005. [11] 
	
	
	Unlike some of the cases to which I have been referred where non-publication orders were made in the absence of any contradictor or representative of the media, the decision of Hidden J was made in the face of strong opposition by counsel appearing for a media organisation (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation). The decision was made under s 292 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), as it was then formulated, but it is clear from the judgment that his Honour was guided both by the important principle of “open justice and the value to the community of fair and accurate media reporting of court proceedings” (at [3]) and ultimately by the question or test of necessity (see, for example, [5]). His Honour considered the various alternatives that had been put before him but concluded that it was necessary to make an order suppressing the evidence in the first trial in order to preserve the integrity of the subsequent trials.
	
	
	Plainly, the circumstances in every case are different and it appears that the case of R v A, S and M did not involve a suppression or non-publication order that would have effect for a number of months, as is the situation here. Still, the case provides some guidance as to the circumstances in which such an order might properly, and consistent with principle, be made.
	


Postponing, rather than prohibiting, publication


	
	There is no controversy in the present case that there is power in an appropriate case to make the kind of orders that he suggested. Counsel for the media very properly drew my attention to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in R v Horsham Justices, ex parte Farquharson & Anor [1982] 1 QB 762 where Lord Denning M. R. said at 791:
	


“It has long been settled that the courts have power to make an order postponing publication (but not prohibiting it) if the postponement is necessary for the furtherance of justice in proceedings which are pending or imminent.”


	
	His Honour went on to cite the decision of R v Clements to which reference has previously been made in the course of this judgment.
	
	
	Whilst it is clear that there is a power in the Court to make the orders sought, the real controversy in the present case is whether such orders are necessary or whether other alternatives are available. Central to the controversy is a series of cases concerning the robustness of juries in criminal trials and their capacity to obey judicial direction.
	


Submissions in relation to Juries


	
	In assessing the submissions of both the accused and the Crown Prosecutor to the effect that the anticipated media coverage of the current proceedings will impact upon the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial in the second trial, it is necessary to keep firmly in mind a series of propositions relating to the capacity of lay juries to put aside matters of prejudice and emotion and to obey directions given to them by the trial judge. A number of these propositions were helpfully set out in an annexure to the submissions of Mr Lewis who appeared for the Intervenors.
	
	
	The first proposition is that jurors are not considered to be “exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice”: see John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd & Anor v The District Court of NSW & Ors at 103 (Spigelman CJ).
	
	
	Secondly, the courts proceed on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath and comply strictly with the directions given to them by trial judges: see, for example, Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim at [62]-[63], R v Jamal [2008] NSWCCA 177; 72 NSWLR 258 at [19]. In Jamal Spigelman CJ said:
	


“The perspective that jurors properly perform their task, are true to their own oath and comply with the trial judge’s directions has repeatedly been applied in appellate courts over recent years.”


	
	In Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; 201 CLR 414 McHugh JA said at [31]:
	


“The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one – accused, trial judge or member of the public – could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials.”


	
	There have also been occasions when it has been held that pre-empanelment procedures can safeguard against the possibility that a juror prejudiced by pre-trial publicity will find their way onto the jury: see, for example Digital News Media Pty Ltd & Anor v Mokbel & Anor [2010] VSCA 51; 30 VR 248. In that case, which involved a notorious criminal defendant, Buchanan JA said at [92]:
	


“It then falls to the trial judge, after hearing submissions, to determine the seriousness of the risk to the trial process, and, where appropriate, to take steps to protect the process. There are many strategies available. These include postponing the trial and changing its venue. The judge may remind the jury panel before the jury is struck of their obligation to try the case only on the evidence to be presented and, having done so, enquire whether any member of the panel felt unable to discharge this obligation by reason of the pre-trial publicity. The judge will normally expect that the media will refrain from publishing prejudicial material, but, in the case where this is necessary, he or she may make an order with respect to the existing or future publication of such material.”


	
	Reference might also be made to the strategies and comments of Brennan J in The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 614 to 615, including his Honours remarks on the necessary reliance that courts must place on the integrity of jurors:
	


“Of necessity, the law must place much reliance on the integrity and sense of duty of the jurors. The experience of the courts is that the reliance is not misplaced.”


	
	While I will certainly proceed on the basis of the authorities to which I have just made reference, and while the robustness and the capacity of a jury generally to obey directions is not in doubt, the question here is whether the nature and extent of the anticipated publicity arising from the present trial will be such that it will be impossible to obtain an untainted jury panel for the Antoun trial. In other words, will the members of the panel called for the Antoun trial have been influenced to a degree that the accused’s trial would have to be postponed or where there is a real risk of a miscarriage if the case proceeds shortly after the present trial.
	
	
	In some respects the process is reminiscent of the comments of Basten JA in Commissioner of Police v Nationwide News [2007] NSWCA 366; 70 NSWLR 643 at [85]. His Honour said:
	


“An application, such as this, for non-publication of evidence given in Court engages an atypical aspect of the judicial function. At one end of a spectrum, the judicial function is concerned with establishing past facts and applying relatively precise rules or principles to those facts to reach a judgment. The present exercise involves the application of ill-defined and imprecise conflicting principles, on the basis of speculation as to future consequences.”


	
	His Honour went on to refer to the limits on the principle of transparency and open justice at [89]:
	


“Like all broad principles based on public policy, the principle of transparency has its limits. Critically for present purposes, it should not be allowed to operate in a manner which is self-defeating. Thus, it should not operate where the likely consequences are to diminish rather than enhance the operation of the judicial process and public confidence therein. The point at which that limit is reached in a particular case is beyond precise definition and is a matter of evaluative judgment.”


	
	In The Queen v Glennon at 611-612 Brennan J said:
	


“Another phenomenon which has contributed to the problem in recent years, especially in the media of television and radio, is the promotion of personalities who affect to convey the moral conscience of the community and to possess information, insights and expertise in exceptional measure. The image of some media personalities as informers of the public and moulders of public opinion is assiduously cultivated. When the belief is held that the public interest is served by publication of observations and opinions by media personalities on topics of contemporary relevance, publication may not always be restrained by the need to allow a fair trial for a person charged with the commission of crimes that have attracted public attention.

.........

The integrity of the administration of justice in criminal proceedings is of fundamental importance to a free society. Freedom of public expression with reference to circumstances touching guilt or innocence is correspondingly limited.”


	
	Having considered closely the evidence tendered on the application and the submissions of the parties, I have concluded that, unless there is some restriction or suppression on the publication of evidence in the present trial, it will not be possible to proceed with the Antoun trial for some significant time. In short, it is necessary to make some form of order to protect the integrity of the Antoun trial. It is not merely “convenient, reasonable or sensible”. It is necessary. Once that is accepted, consideration must be given to the form that such an order must take. In formulating the order, the test of necessity remains at the forefront of consideration and the order that is least intrusive upon the public interest in open justice is the order that should be made.
	


Alternatives proposed by the Intervenors


	
	Mr Lewis submitted that “there are alternative orders that would militate against any prejudice caused to the accused at the second trial, thereby rendering the relief sought in the applicant’s motion unnecessary (within the meaning of the Court Suppression Act).” He provided a number of alternative suggestions.
	
	
	The first proposition was that “rather than prohibit in any publication the fair reporting of the first and second trial, the second trial may be postponed for a reasonable time after the first trial concludes.” As I have said at [55] above, the learned Crown Prosecutor made a forceful submission against this proposal. As he put it, there are victims and informant witnesses who have an expectation that the Antoun trial will proceed as soon as possible. The family and friends of Joseph Antoun are entitled to see those accused of orchestrating his brutal killing brought to trial in a timely fashion. For a better understanding of the nature of the killing of Joseph Antoun, and its impact upon his loved ones, see R v NK (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1257 at [34]-[49] and [50]-[59]. The shooting, which took place in the family home and in the proximity of the victims’ young daughters, is a matter that is difficult to erase from the memory of the victim’s wife, who was present when the killing occurred.
	
	
	It is also the case that five (of the thirteen) informant witnesses are to give evidence in both trials. The sooner that they are able to complete this task, the sooner they will be able to move on with their lives, either by continuing to serve the sentences that they are serving or otherwise. The longer that the case remains before the Court, the longer these witnesses will remain the focus of attention, with the consequent danger to them.
	
	
	The accused are also entitled to a resolution of the charges in a timely fashion. Each of them are on remand, with bail refused, awaiting their trials. Each has entered a plea of not guilty. They have been in custody since 8 January 2014. In the event that either or both of them are acquitted in relation to the present trial, they would be entitled either to a speedy resolution of the Antoun trial or for serious consideration of their release on bail One can only imagine the media outcry if either of them was to be granted bail because the Antoun murder trial was postponed for a substantial period of time.
	
	
	I accept the learned Crown Prosecutor’s submission that postponing the Antoun trial, in order to give effect to the public interest in open justice, is not an appropriate solution in the circumstances.
	
	
	The second solution proposed by the Intervenors was that “consideration may be given to changing the venue of the second trial.” While this was a submission made in written submissions, it was not pressed on the hearing of the application. [12]  Changing the venue is not a viable option in the circumstances of the present case. The number of possible venues is geographically limited and there is also nothing to suggest that the kind of media coverage that is anticipated would not influence a jury elsewhere in New South Wales. Further, this is a Sydney case and it should be decided by a Sydney jury.
	
	
	The third solution suggested was that an order prohibiting publication of the pending second trial should remain in force until the trial commences. Such an order could be made in conjunction with a suppression order so that the applicant’s name would not appear in the court list. This, it was submitted, may prevent a reporting of the present trial triggering electronic searching by members of the public who may be members of the jury panel in the Antoun trial. Such an approach was taken by Johnson, J in R v McNeil [2015] NSWSC 357 at [84]. I made a similar orders in this case: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 10) [2016] NSWSC 252. This order was designed to ensure that members of the jury panel called for the present trial did not become aware of pre-existing publicity on the internet once they became aware of the names of the five accused men. It is not that concern to which the present application is directed. Rather, the concern is that the kind of media coverage that the present trial will attract is likely to infect the potential jury pool summonsed for the Antoun trial. This third solution will do little, if anything, to protect against that concern. While this third alternative has the capacity to protect the accused from what have been described as “googling jurors”, [13]  it does nothing to prevent the potential jury for the second trial being influenced by the media coverage relating to the first trial.
	
	
	The fourth alternative was to suggest that the Court might simply reverse the order in which the trials are conducted. In written submissions it was put in this way:
	


“To the extent that the first trial will be heard by a judge alone and the second trial will be heard by a jury, it may be possible to hear the second trial first in time.”


	
	There are a number of problems with this proposed solution. First, while the five accused applied for a judge alone trial, their application was refused: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 14). Second, the order in which indictments are presented is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the learned Crown Prosecutor. It is not a matter for the judge, let alone the media. The Crown Prosecutor made it plain in the course of argument that he proposed to run the present trial first. That makes sense given that three of the accused are in custody, with bail refused, largely (if not exclusively) in respect of the charges to be determined in the present trial.
	
	
	The fifth alternative proposed by the media interests is the most attractive and was that, “the court may order that the non-publication of the identities of the accused, or by pseudonym”. Orders of a similar nature were made on the application of the Crown in relation to the putative victim of counts 1-3, Mohammed “Little Crazy” Hamzy, who has a Supreme Court murder trial due to start on 14 June 2016: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 12) [2016] NSWSC 294. That application was not opposed by the Intervenors. An alternative along these lines was hinted at by Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi, and there was some suggestion in argument that alternative orders may be drafted. [14]  However, no such orders were ever provided and, for reasons to which I will return, Senior Counsel for both accused ultimately submitted that such a restriction would not achieve its purpose because there are too many “unique identifiers” that inevitably link the two cases.
	


Would a pseudonym or other order restricting publication of the identity of the accused prevent the prejudice to the proper administration of justice?


	
	The fifth alternative proposed by the media is the most attractive and the only possible solution that has any realistic prospect of working. At times during the argument, Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi seemed to accept that this may be a possible solution. However, the suggestion that he might draft some alternative orders was never taken up. He appeared to reach the conclusion that there was “real difficulty trying to fashion something that would work in the circumstances of this case.”
	
	
	Similarly, but more forcefully, Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi submitted that it was not possible to fashion orders of that kind that would protect the accused because there were “so many unique identifiers which, even if there was a suppression order, a jury would very easily be able to connect the two trials.” He referred to the common facts between the two trials including the names of the criminal organisation involved (Brothers for Life, Blacktown) the fact that the group were mostly Afghani, the identities of the co-accused and the inevitability of it emerging that most or all of the five informants were common to the two trials. This is but a small selection of the common features between the trials in terms of the evidence in the case. Senior Counsel also pointed to common features outside of the evidence, such as the Court, the Court complex, the identity of the lawyers and the trial Judge.
	
	
	In the course of determining a large number of pre-trial issues, I have become reasonably familiar both with the Crown case in general terms and also with the specific evidence expected to be given by the informant witnesses including witnesses L and M. While there was no request (and nor would it have been practical) for the Intervenors to be provided with all of the material that has been tendered in the course of the pre-trial hearing and sentencing hearings over which I have presided, variations were made to the non-publication orders attaching to the judgments to enable counsel for the Intervenors to understand the nature of the issues and evidence in the two trials. While the suggestion of a pseudonym order was made, there was no attempt to identify the precise form of order that might be effective in masking the identity of the two accused as being involved in both trials.
	
	
	I have contemplated whether orders could be made that would prevent a potential jury pool from being infected or influenced by the media coverage. Such orders would be calculated to ensure that the media coverage was restricted in such a way that there would be no publication of the accused’s names or material capable of identifying them. Such an order would necessarily involve specifications that would ensure that there be no link between the two sets of trials. In view of the evidence of witnesses L and M and the other informants along with a number of other features of the Crown case, I am unable to postulate or formulate a series of orders that would achieve that purpose. Witness L was sentenced by me in September 2015 and I heard him give evidence in the course of the pre-trial hearing in December last year. In the course of those proceedings I became familiar with 1-2 volumes of statements and interviews made by witness L. Similarly, witness M is to be sentenced before me and the sentencing proceedings are part heard. Again, I have read a number of statements provided by witness M (each of which was a confidential exhibit on sentence).
	
	
	Having considered the matter, including possible alternative orders, at some length, I find myself accepting the submission made by Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi. In both trials, witness L, and other witnesses to be called by the Crown, are expected to give evidence relating to the background circumstances and their involvement with the Qaumi brothers. This evidence will be elicited to explain why they conducted themselves in the way that they did. A significant part of the Crown case against Farhad Qaumi in both trials will be the evidence of a number of witnesses who (it is anticipated) will say that he used violence, threats and intimidation to ensure that they obeyed directions. A number of specific incidents will be relied on. As between the two trials, there is a commonality of the evidence and the incidents to which that evidence relates. It is impossible to imagine that the common features of that testimony would not be obvious to any member of the jury pool summoned in the Antoun trial.
	
	
	It is, in my assessment, impossible to predict in advance (and then to particularise and formulate an order) the precise content of each and every item of evidence that might lead a potential juror to realise that the two men said to have ordered the execution of Mr Antoun were also the leaders of the group of men subject to the twenty or so allegations in the first trial.
	
	
	For these reasons, I have concluded that it is not feasible to fashion orders that would be effective in hiding the identity of the two accused. If such orders were possible, it would not be necessary to make an order prohibiting (or, more correctly, postponing) publication of the evidence and submissions in the present trial. If my ultimate conclusion is wrong, I would certainly have been persuaded that some form of order designed to suppress the identity of the accused and links between the two trials should be made.
	


Delaying publication is the least intrusive option available


	
	As I have earlier indicated in the course of these reasons, it is well established that a judge has the power to delay publication of such material as opposed to prohibiting its publication altogether. That is the consequence of the orders that I propose to make. They will remain in force until a designated and nominated event, namely the conclusion of the Antoun trial or, alternatively, any order under s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act that the Antoun trial is to be tried by Judge alone.
	
	
	I accept that this is a significant intrusion into ability of the media to provide full and fair reporting of the case, particularly on a daily bais. However, it is far from an absolute one. The public, whose interests are to be protected by this order, will obtain full and fair reporting of what has happened in the trials, but it will receive the benefit of that media coverage after the trials have come to an end. That may entail a delay of something in the order of four to six months.
	


Business difficulties and the public interest


	
	One of the submissions put on behalf of the media in the course of oral submissions was this:
	


“Just on the practicalities of the length of trial, if an order was made preventing any of my clients from publishing anything to do with the evidence that would practically mean at least six months approximately based on the fact that the Antoun proceedings would directly follow whereby the public who have a right to be in Court will not know anything. And practically it is going to be difficult from a business end to provide a fair and accurate report of six months’ worth of trials. One might envisage the scenario where you might have a two page spread, as it might be called, or something similar, but it is very difficult from a journalistic point of view to provide a fair and accurate report in such circumstances. So the reality might be that the public would be told very little at all. I merely observe that from a practical level.” [15] 


	
	The “difficulties from a business end” were not more clearly identified and were not the subject of evidence. However, I assume that the problem is that it would not be “economic” (my word) for a media organisation to have a reporter in Court if it were not able to obtain the financial advantage of providing daily reports on the nightly news, the daily newspaper or regularly over the internet. However, there will be transcripts and exhibits available to those members of the media with a genuine interest in conveying the whole of the story and that story can be told at the conclusion of the trials (or if the Antoun trial is to be by judge alone, at the conclusion of the present trial). While I understand that such difficulties might have an impact on the amount of media attention that the case receives, I am not persuaded that this consideration has a substantial impact on the public interest in open justice and full and fair reportage of the things that happen in our courts. The business difficulties envisaged by Mr Lewis are not sufficiently identified to have any significant impact on the difficult decision that I am here called upon to make.
	


Conclusion


	
	For those reasons, and in the terms of s 8(1) of the Court Suppression Act, I am satisfied that:
	
	
	(a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice;
	
	
	(e) it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.
	
	
	One of the important “public interests” in terms of paragraph (e) is the interest in those accused of murder being brought to trial without undue delay and the public interest in the secondary victims of the Antoun murder seeing justice done as expeditiously as possible.
	
	
	An abiding consideration is that the effect of the orders that I will make is to postpone, not prohibit, publication of full and fair reports of the trial proceedings.
	
	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Publication of the evidence and submissions in the present trial is prohibited until the occurrence of one of the events specified in order (2) on the grounds that (a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice and (e) it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.
	
	
	For the purpose of s 12 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) the order is continued until the conclusion of the trial of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi in relation to the murder of Joseph Antoun (“the Antoun trial’), or until any order is made under s 132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) that the Antoun trial is to be tried by judge alone, or until further order.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 11 of the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), the order applies throughout the Commonwealth of Australia.

2954564,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) (Severance and separate trial) [2016] NSWSC 15,"Judgment


	
	Eight accused currently stand charged on a single indictment with a total of 36 offences said to have occurred between July 2013 and January 2014. The offences allegedly arose out of the activities of a criminal gang known as the Blacktown Chapter of the Brothers for Life (BFLBlacktown).Thirty three of the offences (counts 1-31 and 33-34) involve the possession, use and discharge of a number of firearms. Those offences include two charges of murder arising out of separate incidents on 29 October 2013 and 16 December 2013 (counts 11 and 30). Four incidents occurred in November 2013 giving rise to offences including shooting at nominated people with intent to kill (counts 14-28). Three incidents in July, August and October 2013 involve what might generally be described as extortion or intimidation offences in which firearms were discharged and/or used to threaten the victims (counts 1, 4 and 8).There are also charges of possession of various firearms and the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The counts name individual accused and combinations of the eight accused in relation to the different offences. Each of the accused also stands charged with an offence of participating in a criminal group (counts 35-36).
	
	
	By separate notices of motion and supporting affidavits, seven of the accused seek various orders whereby certain countswould be severed from the indictment or individual accused subject to separate trials. One accused, AC, makes no application in relation to the indictment. She is content to proceed with a joint trial of all accused and all charges.
	
	
	The matter comes before this Court in its present form as a result of a direction made by the Chief Justice under s 128 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW)on 18 June 2015. That direction permitted the prosecution to present an indictment in the Supreme Court against a number of the accused charged with offences other than murder. By this mechanism, a large number of the charges now on the indictment were brought up from the District Court, the court that ordinarily would exercise the criminal jurisdiction in relation to charges of that nature. However, in making the direction under s 128, the Chief Justice received a written undertaking from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) that if one or more counts on the indictment (excluding murder) were severed by the trial Judge “the Crown undertakes to withdraw any such matters from the Supreme Court and proceed to present an indictment on those counts in the District Court at Sydney.”At the time of the direction, the accused opposed the District Court matters being prosecuted in the Supreme Court and provided various submissions in that regard. The accused foreshadowed the kind of applications that are currently before me for determination. However, there was no full argument. The Chief Justice made no assessment of the merit of the Crown’s application to join all counts in the one indictment or the various defence applications to sever the indictment or separate the trials of the various accused persons. The Chief Justice made the s 128 direction in the knowledge that these applications would be dealt with by the trial Judge and it was on that basis that the undertaking by the DPP was provided.
	
	
	I have not been made aware of any case in which the Court was confronted with an application of such complexity. The complexity arises as a result of the number of charges and the fact that the various accused are charged with different offences within the 36 counts on the indictment. At one end of the spectrum, the alleged leader of the BFL Blacktown (Farhad Qaumi) is charged with 33 of the 36 offences. At the other, Mohammed Nasiri is charged with two offences, [1]  while Mohammed Zarshoy and John Bishop are each charged with three offences. As a result of the diverse nature of the legal predicaments facing each of the accused, their applications seek different orders in relation to separation and severance.At the most extreme (ultimately conceded by Senior Counselto be an “ambit claim”) the application calls for severance of each and every count on the indictment or, perhaps more accurately, in respect of each and every incident alleged within the indictment.
	
	
	The Crown relies on s 29(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act1986 (NSW) which allows the Court to hear and determine proceedings relating to two or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person where the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances, orthe offences form part of a series of offences of the same or similar character. The Crown also relies on s 29(2) which allows the Court to hear and determine offences alleged to have been committed by two or more accused persons where the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances or the offences form part of a series of offences of the same or similar character.
	
	
	The accused, in various ways and to varying degrees, rely on s 29(3) which provides that “proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice”.
	
	
	The accused also rely on the provision in s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) which provides a discretion to order a separate trial of any count or counts where an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment or where, for any other reason, it is desirable that the accused person be tried separately.
	
	
	The Crown submits that any prejudice or embarrassment that may arise by virtue of the trial being heard together can be cured by careful direction to the jury.
	
	
	A large amount of evidence has been tendered by the Crown on the application but, with the exception of counsel for the Crown and counsel for Mr Bishop, there has been very little attention paid to the evidence in the course of the otherwise helpful written and oral submissions. The Crown has also provided a number of useful summaries including:
	



	
	A Crown case statement.
	
	
	A chronology of events from July 2013 to October 2014 (when the last of the accused were arrested).
	
	
	A summary of the ballistics evidence.
	
	
	Charts relating to six of the firearms allegedly used in various offences.
	
	
	A “timeline” of events from 25 July 2013 to 3 January 2014 surrounding the 12 incidents out of which the 36 offences arise.
	
	
	A document in relation to each individual accused summarising the evidence of their participation or association with the BFL.
	
	
	A summary of the evidence to be given by 12 witnesses described as “informant” or “roll-over” witnesses.
	
	
	A summary of telephone intercepts acquired by policebetween 6 November 2013 and 9 January 2014.
	



	
	In addition to these summaries, charts, chronologies and timelines the Crown tendered six volumes compromised of statements and interviews made by the 12 informant witnesses, two volumes of statements of police officers who dealt with those witnesses and three volumes of miscellaneous material including statements made by various police officers, relevant electronically recorded interviews and transcripts of various recordings obtained by the use of listening devices. I have also received into evidence tendency notices served by the Crown in respect of each of the accused although the tendency case against Bishop has been abandonedand problems with the tendency notices were identified (and acknowledged) in the course of submissions.
	
	
	The accused each rely on affidavits of their solicitors. Generally, these contain relevant summaries of the Crown case and annex documents such as the Crown case statement. For the most part, the submissions of the accused and the analysis of the case is taken from the Crown case statement.
	
	
	In addition, Bishop relies on an affidavit of his solicitor that establishes, through enquiries made with a company called Complete Surrounds Landscaping, that a vehicle with the registration number CID975 was owned by the company and used by Stephen Dick in 2013 (a former employee of the company). The solicitor states her belief that Stephen Dick’s daughter is Maddison Dick, John Bishop’s girlfriend. The registration history is annexed to the affidavit. This was the vehicle Bishop was arrested in on 26 October 2013.
	
	
	Nasiri relies on an affidavit of his solicitor annexing two documents. Annexure “A” is a letter from Nasiri setting out the routine that applies when he needs to attend court. Annexure “B” is a custodial history that shows that he was in custody during the period of time in which charges 6-32 were allegedly committed.
	
	
	I was provided with written submissions by the Crown Prosecutor and on behalf of each of the accused and counsel made spirited and helpful oral submissions over the course of two days. With very few exceptions, counsel did not trouble me with references to the detail contained in theevidentiary materialeven though it seems to be agreed that the material is relevant to a determination of the present applications.
	


a summary of the incidents and counts


	
	The various incidents giving rise to the 36 charges are set out in a little detail in the Crown Case Statement and in the document entitled Timeline of Alleged Offences. Both of those documents are part of exhibit VD-A. It is unnecessary to set out all of the details of the allegations but it is important to summarise the incidents and counts, to identify which of the accused are charged with the individual offences and to identify which of the informant witnesses are said to be able to give relevant evidence in respect of those incidents.
	
	
	I will refer to the witnesses by the letters which were allocated to them in the course of an earlier application wherein it was proposed that they either be anonymisedor provided with a pseudonym: R v Qaumi &Ors (AVL) [2015] NSWSC 1711. In that judgment, I rejected the suggestion that the witnesses were entitled to anonymity (in particular from the accused) and the witnesses are to give evidence under their own names. However, non-publication and suppression orders remain in force.
	
	
	The BFL was originally formed by a prison inmate called Bassam Hamzy. While it was said to have some form of Islamic foundation, on the prosecution case it was really a criminal gang. By 2013 there were two main factions, being the chapters based in Bankstown and Blacktown. The Bankstown chapter was being run by a man known as “LC” or “Little Crazy”. His real name is Mohammed “Hamoudie” Hamzy. By the middle of 2013 the accused Farhad Qaumi (“Farhad”) had assumed leadership of the BFL Blacktown. The membership of the Bankstown chapter consisted mostly of people of Lebanese origin whereas the BFL Blacktown was predominantly made up of people of Afghan heritage.
	
	
	The BFL Blacktown had a clubhouse in Forge Street, Blacktown, said to be fortified and protected by CCTV surveillance cameras. Meetings were held on Saturday nights and members were required to pay a weekly fee of $50 for rent and maintenance of the clubhouse. The members of the BFL Blacktown were provided with a jacket which had a logo consisting of twocrossed AK-47 rifles and the words BFL and Sydney’s Southwest emblazoned on the chest and sleeves.
	
	
	The Crown alleges, based on the evidence of a number of the informant witnesses, that the activities of the BFL Blacktown were directed by Farhad Qaumi, sometimes in conjunction with his brother Mumtaz Qaumi. Throughout this judgment, I will refer to these two accused, and their brother Jamil Qaumi, by their first names and to the remaining accused by their surnames. All of the accused persons in the present trial and most of the informant witnesses were members of the BFL Blacktown. The only exception is AC who is said to be a close associate of Farhad. The Crown case is that the singular or predominant purpose of the BFL Blacktown was to make money out of the commission of crimes. Those crimes included drug supply and extortion.
	


Wentworthville Shooting (counts 1-3)


	
	Mustafa (“Musti”) Shanasa was a member of the BFL Blacktown for a short period in or around July 2013. He had received a “pound” of cannabis from Farhad and owed money for those drugs. It is alleged that the amount of the debt was $3,500 but that Farhad was seeking compensation of $15,000. This dispute over drugs and money is alleged to be the motivation for the shooting incident that forms the basis of counts 1, 2 and 3. It is alleged that an arrangement was made whereby Shanasa would attend the Wentworthville swimming pool. A number of the members of the BFL Blacktown were in attendance including Farhad. It is alleged that Farhad approached Shanasa, said something, pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at him. When Shanasa tried to flee Farhad fired four more shots at him.
	
	
	There is some ballistic evidence supporting this charge. Six 9mm cartridge casings were recovered from the scene of the shootingand each bore the Winchester head-stamp. Witnesses G, I and Jall had some involvement in setting up the shooting or were in attendance. Witnesses A,B and C maygive evidence at trial of things said by Farhad after the shooting which is said to provide some support to the Crown case.
	
	
	Counts 1 and 2 are allegations of discharging a firearm with intent and discharging a firearm in a public place against Farhad, Mumtaz andNazirAkbari. Count 3 is an alternative to count 1and alleges that Akbari was an accessory after the fact of the shooting offences.
	
	
	I should interpolate here that NazirAkbari has, since the commencement of these proceedings, been separately arraigned in the District Court and pleaded guilty to certain offences (I have not been told which ones) and the matter is proceeding in the District Court. As far as the prosecution is aware, Akbari will play no further part in the present proceedings.
	


Eagle Vale shooting (counts 4-5)


	
	It is alleged that Farhad called a meeting at the Blacktown BFL clubhouse on 1 August 2013. Present at the meeting were the accused Mumtaz, Akbari, Nasiri and Farhad himself. Also present were two other members (Boxmati and Shemaon) as well as witnesses A, B, C, G and J. The meeting was organised by witness I acting on Farhad’s instructions.
	
	
	Farhad told the group that drug dealers lived at certain premises in Eagle Vale. It is alleged that he directed some of the members of the BFL Blacktown to attend the premises and steal the guns, money and drugs that (he believed) were present there. He said to do this by intimidation including tying up the occupants and shooting them. Mumtaz gave further directions for the group to travel to the premises in three different vehicles. Farhad provided the group with an unregistered sawn-off “Mossberg” pump action shotgun which had been shortened at both ends. All of those who attended the meeting with the exception of Farhad, Mumtaz and witness G went to the Eagle Vale premises. A number of shots were fired by Shemaon and witness B kicked the door. Other members of the group banged on the windows and doors. It seems that the group did not enter the premises and the Crown case statement indicates that nobody was injured during the incident. It also seems that no property (money, drugs or guns) was acquired.
	
	
	On return to the clubhouse the “Mossberg” shot gun was returned to Farhad and was secured somewhere in the BFL Blacktown clubhouse. Police recovered the gun on 12 December 2013.
	
	
	It is said that Farhad was extremely angry about the failure of the groupto secure any property from the premises.
	
	
	As a result of this incident Farhad, Mumtaz, Akbariand Nasiri are charged with offences of attempting to break and enter the dwelling house at Eagle Vale in circumstances of special aggravation and firing a firearm at a dwelling house in the course of an organised criminal activity. These are counts4 and 5 on the indictment. It seems that witnesses A, B, C, G, J and I will be called to give evidence in relation to these offences.
	


Pendle Hill test firing of an assault rifle (counts 6-7)


	
	On 9 October 2013 Farhad together with witnesses I, J and C attended premises in Pendle Hill with a view to purchasing an AK-47 assault rifle. The house was the home of witness F who was to broker the deal or play some role in the negotiations. As things transpired the gun in question was not an AK-47 but rather an SKS assault rifle. After negotiations the purchase was completed and Farhad acquired the SKS assault rifle along with ammunition. It is alleged that he then test fired the rifle outside of the premises and neighbours who heard the shots notified the police. As police approached the vicinity, they saw two cars. One car was stopped and Farhad along with witnesses I and J were arrested. However witness C was driving a separate vehicle containing the SKS assault rifle and ammunition and he made his escape. The firearm in question has not been recovered.
	
	
	As a result of this incident Farhad is charged with counts 6 and 7 on the indictment. These are offences of firing a firearm in a public place and acquiring a prohibited firearm. None of the other accused are charged with these offences but it seems that witnesses C, F, I and J will be witnesses to the events giving rise to those charges.
	


Castlereagh shooting (counts 8-9)


	
	On 14 October 2013 witness E contacted Mumtaz and explained that he was having some difficulties with a person called Christopher Muscat in relation to the sale of a Range Rover motor car. WitnessE wanted to sell the car to Muscat for the sum of $50,000. Mumtaz told witness E to tell Muscat to get the money ready for the transaction. His intention was to steal the money.
	
	
	Later that afternoon witness E met up withMumtaz. An unknown male placed a gun into his car. They journeyed to the Blacktown BFL clubhouse where the gun was given to Farhad Quami. Present at that time were Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil, Bishop, witnesses I and L and other BFL members.
	
	
	Farhad is said to have pointed the gun at witness E and pulled the trigger on a number of occasions. Farhad then gave orders to Jamil, witness L, witness I,Bishop, another BFL member and witness E to go to the home of Muscat and “shoot him in the legs and get the money” (or words of similar import). The group travelled to the address in Castlereagh, entered the premises and witness L discharged the firearm. A dog was injured as a result. The victim was threatened but managed to escape by means of a ruse.
	
	
	Police attended the scene and conducted forensic and ballistics examinations. A number of fired cartridge casings were located along with the projectiles and these were said to be from a .38 ‘Special’ 36-1 revolver with serial number J117163. That firearm was recovered by police shortly after another shooting on 7 November 2013 (the Chokolatta Café shooting). Once again, this attempted extortion offence was botched and once again Farhad was extremely angry when he was told of its failure. He threatened to shoot E in the leg and directed other members of the group to assault him. There was then a plan to steal the Range Rover (which actually belonged to E’s father) but this plan also failed.
	
	
	As a result of this incident Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil and John Bishop are charged with counts 8 and 9 on the indictment being respectively a specially aggravated break and enter offence along with the possession of the weapon. Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil are also charged with demanding money with menaces arising from the attempt to obtain the white Range Rover.
	
	
	The prosecution anticipates that witnesses E, I, J and Lwill give evidence in relation to this matter.
	


The Hamzy murder and shootings at Revesby Heights (counts 11-13)


	
	It is the Crown case that on or around 28 October 2013 the accused AC approached Farhad and told him that she had become aware that Mohammed “Hamoudie” Hamzy of the Bankstown BFL planned to murder Farhad. Farhad brought this information to the attention of a number of the members of the BFL Blacktown. The conversations took place first at the Anytime Fitness gym at Parramatta and then at the Armani restaurant. In the course of the latter meeting the group began to plan the murder of Mohammed Hamzy. Those involved in the planning included Farhad, Jamil, AC and witnesses J and L. Later, witness A and the accused Zarshoy also became involved. Further meetings took place at various outdoor locations including a park in Granville.
	
	
	The planning meetings culminated in a group of men including Jamil, Zarshoy and witnesses L and J attending premises where it was believed that Mohammed Hamzy lived.
	
	
	AC drove Jamil, Zarshoy and witness L to the premises. They waited outside for a time and, after a number of people associated with the Hamzys left, the three men ran into the garage attached to the premises and began to fire their weapons. Witness L was armed with a .45 calibre firearm given to him by Farhad while Zarshoy and Jamil were each armed with .38 calibre revolvers.
	
	
	In the course of the shootings, Mahmoud Hamzy was killed. Mahmoud was a cousin of the intended victim, Mohammed Hamzy. Also shot in the course of the incident was a man named Omar Ajaj. He suffered gunshot wounds but did not die. After the shooting AC drove the perpetrators away from the scene. They successfully made their escape.
	
	
	Ballistics evidence will suggest that the .38 Smith and Wessonspecial assault revolver used in the shooting was also used by witness L in the incident at Castlereagh. The second .38 calibre handgun was subsequently recovered by police on 12 December 2013. Projectiles recovered from the scene at Revesby Heights indicate that the gun recovered in December was the gun used in the Revesby shooting. The .45 calibre pistol was not recovered.
	
	
	This incident gives rise to three of the counts on the indictment (counts 11, 12 and 13). Count 11 charges Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil, Zarshoy and AC with the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy. Count 12 charges the same five accused with an offence of causing grievous bodily harm to Omar Ajaj with intent to kill him. Count 13 charges Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil and AC with conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy.
	
	
	Witnesses A, J and L are likely witnesses in respect of these offences but other informant witnesses may give evidence of conversations that occurred afterwards and in preparation for the shootings that followed.
	


Winston Hills shooting of Michael Odisho(counts 14-16)


	
	On 2 November 2013, a number of members of the BFL Blacktown met at the Star City Casino. This included Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil, Zarshoy and witnesses A, C, D, I and L. Whilst at the casino Farhad was approached by two other men (known as “Glebe” and “Stretch”) and was told that it was known in the community that he (Farhad) was responsible for the shooting and killing of Mahmoud Hamzy.
	
	
	Thereafter Farhad told the rest of the gathered members of the Blacktown BFL that the Bankstown group would be “coming for them”. Once again, they decided to strike first.
	
	
	At a meeting in Merrylands,Mumtaz and Jamil told a group of Blacktown BFL members including witnesses C, D, I, J and L that the Bankstown BFL were coming for them and they needed to take them out. Witness C was told by Mumtaz that he was going to kill Michael Odisho, a member of the Bankstown BFL. There was then an attempt to steal a car and meetings were held at various parks during which Mumtaz and Jamil instructed witnesses C, D and I to shoot Michael Odishoat his house in Reilleys Road, Winston Hills. Witness C drove to Reilleys Road with witnesses D in the vehicle. Once they arrived, witnesses D and I got out of the vehicle carryingguns. Witnesses D and I went to the front door of the premises and when Michael Odisho came to the door the witnesses began firing.Ballistics evidence suggests that witnessD fired four shots from a shotgun and witness I fired 3 shots from a pistol. Medical examination showed that Michael Odisho sustained a gunshot wound to his left elbow, two wounds to his left thigh and one wound to the back of his left leg. Witnesses D and I ran back to witness C’s vehicle and they all escaped the scene.
	
	
	Counts 14, 15 and 16 arise out of the shooting of Michael Odisho. Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil are each charged with an offence of soliciting the murder of Michael Odisho, shooting at Michael Odisho with intent to murder and (in the alternative) discharging a firearm with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on Michael Odisho.
	
	
	Witnesses A, C, D, I, J and L are all likely witnesses in respect of these offences.
	


Shooting at Sunnyholt Road, Blacktown (counts 17-19)


	
	On 4 November 2013, the defensive but pre-emptive strike on the Bankstown BFL continued. The Crown alleges that Farhad gave instructions to Kalal and witnesses D and I to shoot another member of the Bankstown group, Masood Zakaria.
	
	
	Farhad and Mumtaz designed a plan whereby witness D would lure Zakaria out of his house whereupon Kalal and witness I would shoot him. Farhad allegedly told witnesses D and I that if they did not succeed in the plan they would be shot.
	
	
	Later, witnesses C, D and I, along with the accused Kalal, attended the premises at Sunnyholt Road, Blacktown. Kalal was armed with a shotgun and witness I with a revolver. Witness D approached the door of the premises and the door was answered by the proposed victim’s father. When the proposed victim came to the door the accused Kalal fired four shots from the shotgun into the area of the doorway. As it turned out a 14-year-old child (who I will call HZ) walked to the front door to investigate the commotion and received “over 300 pellet injuries to her kidney, throat, liver, spine and lungs”. It is alleged that the following day Jamil told witness A that members of the BFL Blacktown were responsible for the shootings of Michael Odisho and HK. He said that “F” (Farhad) wanted witness A to mind the group’s guns and drugs because they were fearful of a police raid.
	
	
	Ballistics examination suggests that the shotgun used was the “Mossberg” shot gun used in the incident at Eagle Vale (counts 4 – 5).
	
	
	As a result of the Zakaria shooting, Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil are charged with soliciting Kalal to murder Masood Zakaria (count 17). Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil and Kalal are charged with wounding HZ with intent to murder HZ (count 18) along with an alternative count (count 19) of causing grievous bodily harm to HZ with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm on Masood Zakaria.
	
	
	Witnesses A, C, D, I and L are all likely witnesses in respect of these offences.
	


Shooting at the Chokolatta Café, Bankstown (counts 20-26)


	
	Counts 20 to 27 on the indictment all arise out of an incident that took place at the Chokolatta Café in Bankstown on 7 November 2013. That incident involved witness D and Kalal shooting into or near a motor vehicle occupied by three men, Abdul Abu-Mahmoud, Khalil Khalil and Hassan Soueid. The planning for that shooting occurred on the afternoon of 6 November 2013 and involved Mumtaz, Jamil, AC, and witnesses I and L as well as the two shooters.
	
	
	There was some debate in the course of submissions as to the motivation for this shooting. The evidence of the witnesses suggests that the shooters were told by Jamil that the shooting was necessary to protect the leader of the group, Farhad. However, there appears to be no dispute that Farhad was overseas at the time of this incident.
	
	
	AC, Mumtaz and Jamil planned this incident. Witness L asserted in one of his recorded interviews with police that the motivation for shooting Abdul was that:
	


“AC he (sic) said he’s got the addresses and he’s gunna give it to the Bankstown boys. He knows where my brother and everyone lives in the Central Coast. The lebos are gunna come and get us, you know what I mean, so we’ve got to get him before he gives the addresses out.”


	
	In the time leading up to the shooting, AC and Mumtaz Qaumi told witness I and D that “Youse are gonna shoot that guy tonight”.
	
	
	At around 12:15 am on 7 November 2013 the three victims were seated in the blue BMW sedan parked outside the Chokolatta Café. Witness I drove a rented Mazda to a position which blocked the BMW. The accused Kalal was in possession of a .38 calibre revolver and witness D was in possession of a pump action shotgun. They approached the vehicle and fired a number of shots. Two of the victims received gunshot wounds and the third victim was not struck.
	
	
	Police intercepted witnesses I and D along with a man who apparently had supplied them with the weapons. They were arrested in the hired Mazda. Within the Mazda the police seized a shortened “Bentley” pump action 12 gauge shotgun and a .38 calibre Smith & Wesson revolver. They also located a number of fingerprints including those of the accused Kalal and fingerprints of witnesses C, D and I. Kalal’s DNA profile was also located on disposable gloves and a T-shirt located in the Mazda.
	
	
	Ballistics examination suggests that the shotgun was the same shotgun used in the shooting of Michael Odisho on 3 November 2013 and that the .38 calibre Smith & Wesson revolver was the same weapon used in the shooting at Castlereagh on 14 October 2013 and in the Revesby Heights shooting on 29 October 2013.
	
	
	As a result of the shooting at the Chokolatta Café, Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil and AC are charged with soliciting Kalal to murder Abdul Abu-Mahmoud (count 20).Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil, AC and Kalal are charged with shooting at Abdul Abu-Mahmoud with intent to murder him (count 21) and, in the alternate, discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to him (count 22).Similar offences are charged with respect Khalil Khalil (counts 23 to 24) and Hassan Soueid (counts 25 to 26).Mohammed Kalal is charged with possession of the .38 calibre revolver on the date of the Chokolatta Café shooting.
	
	
	The Crown expects witnesses C, D, I and Lto give evidence in respect of these offences.
	


Shooting at Greenacre Road (counts 28-29)


	
	Counts 28 and 29 on the indictment involve further shootings directed towards members of the Bankstown BFL. This incident is alleged to be a response to the shooting of Sina Mirzaei, a member of the Blacktown BFL.
	
	
	On Thursday 28 November 2013, police intercepted numerous calls from the mobile telephone services of Farhad and Mumtaz. At 6:56pm there was a call from Mumtaz to AC at 6:56 pm asking her to meet him at Thornleigh McDonalds. Farhad and Mumtaz collected witness L at 10:17pm and they travelled together to meet AC. During the meeting Farhad asked AC where “Little Crazy” (Mohammed Hamzy) lived and she offered to drive them there. Hamzy was in gaol at this time. Jamil was also in gaol. Farhad and Mumtaz believed that Hamzy bashed Jamil during this time. Farhad told AC and witness L that they were going to shoot Hamzy’s mother and sister as revenge for the shooting of SinaMirzaei and the bashing of Jamil. AC and witness L drove to Granville and again met with Mumtaz and Farhad. Farhad gave witness L a .45 calibre pistol and told him that it was “loaded and ready to go”. Witness L recognised it as the pistol he used during the shooting at Revesby Heights. Farhad instructed AC and witness L to shoot the mother and sister but if this was not possible they should perpetrate a “drive-by” shooting.
	
	
	AC and L drove to a block of housing commission flats on Greenacre Road. Witness L exited the car with the gun in his pocket and walked towards the building. He noticed families eating inside the flats and walked back to AC in the car and told her that people were eating and that he was not prepared to shoot women. They decided to do a “drive-by” instead. As they were returning to the units AC noticed several men including Hamzy’s cousin and friends standing outside and told witness L to go and shoot them. Witness L agreed and walked towards the men. He shot the window of a nearby car and five further rounds. One bullet struck the foot on Anthony Elkadi causing him to collapse onto the driveway. The four other bullets hit the driveway and surrounding walls. Later that evening AC and witness L met with Farhad and Mumtaz and witness L handed the pistol to Farhad.
	
	
	Ballistics examination of the material recovered at Greenacre Road suggests that the pistol was used at the Revesby Heights shooting.
	
	
	Count 28 on the indictment charges Farhad, Mumtaz and AC with discharging a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Anthony Elkadi or another person. Count 29 charges Farhad with the possession of the .45 calibre pistol used at the Greenacre shooting.
	
	
	Witness L is expected to give evidence in relation to these charges.
	


The Antoun Murder at Jersey Road, Strathfield (counts 30-31)


	
	On 16 December 2013 Joseph Antoun was murdered at his home in Strathfield.
	
	
	Some days prior to the murder Mumtaz and Farhad contacted witness L and said that he had to kill Joseph Antoun as they had accepted a $200,000 contract for his murder. Witness L was told that if he did not kill Mr Antoun, he and his daughter would be shot. One of the brothers handed witness L a .38 calibre revolver. On 16 December 2013 at 7:12 pm Mumtaz called witness C and arranged to meet. Farhad and Mumtaz met witness C in Blacktown and asked him to drive L to the address in Strathfield to “drop off a package”. Witnesses C and L then drove to Jersey Road. Witness L got out of the car and approached the house but returned to the car telling witness C that he didn’t think the victim was at home. Ten minutes later witness L approached the house, carrying a small manual in his hand. He then rang the doorbell. Mr Antoun’s partner called out asking who it was. He replied that he was “Adam” (an associate of Mr Antoun) and that he had a package for Mr Antoun. As Mr Antoun opened the door his partner shouted out “It’s not Adam, don’t answer the door”. At this time witness L fired five shots through the screen. Four shots entered Mr Antoun’s body and he died at the scene.
	
	
	On 3 January 2014 police executed a search warrant of witness C’s home and seized two mobile phones which have been identified as being in the area close to Jersey Road, Strathfield, at the time of the shooting. Later on 3 January, Farhad met with witness K and told him to go to witness L’s house to collect a .38 pistol. That same day police pulled over witness K and searched his vehicle. They recovered the pistol contained in several plastic bags. A ballistics examination of the pistol located in the vehicle of witness K matched the weapon used in the murder on Joseph Antoun. The plastic bags that the gun was in contained the fingerprints of witnesses K and L.
	
	
	Count 30 charges Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi with the murder of Joseph Antoun. Count 31 charges Farhad Qaumi with the possessionof the .38 calibre pistol.
	
	
	Witness C, K and L are expected to give evidence in relation to these counts.
	


Guns and Drugs (counts 32-34)


	
	Counts 32, 33 and 34 relate to the supply of a prohibited drug, namely, N-(2-methoxylbenzl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine (32) and possession of guns (33-34).
	
	
	On 5 November 2013 Jamil Qaumi met witness A at Lidcombe train station. Jamil requested that he purchase a sports bag from Big W or Kmart. WitnessA then drove with Jamil and witness L to a residential area in Lidcombe. Jamil told A that Farhad “said you need to take the guns and stash them somewhere because everyone’s house is getting raided.” Jamil told A that the bag contained two guns and some drugs. A said that he did not want to store the guns out of respect for his family.
	
	
	Jamil then called witness C and asked him to meet at witness L’s house. Once at his home, L placed a Smith& Wesson revolver as well as some pills and powder in the sports bag. A was then given the bag and it was placed in the back of witness C’s car. The group then travelled to a location near A’s house. After the group left, A threw the bag over a fence.
	
	
	A short time later, A decided that he did not want anything further to do with the BFL. He avoided contact with the group and travelled overseas. On 11 December A returned to Australia and contacted police the following day. He told the police about the contents of the bag and it was seized by police. The bag contained:
	



	
	1,894.4 grams of the prohibited synthetic drug, 25I-NBOMe. The street value of this quantity is estimated to be in the vicinity of $197,325.
	
	
	150.8 grams of Lignocaine.
	
	
	A shortened 12 gauge sawn off ‘Mossberg’ pump-action shotgun allegedly used in the Eagle Vale shooting and the Zakaria shooting.
	
	
	A .38 calibre ‘special’ Smith & Wesson revolver used at the shooting in Revesby Heights.
	
	
	Ammunition.
	
	
	One unknown manufacture detachable box magazine.
	



	
	Witnesses A, C, J and L are expected to give evidence in relation to these charges.
	


Participation in a Criminal Group


	
	Each of the accused was arraigned on a count of participating in a criminal group, an offence under s 93T of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).Nasiri was discharged of this count after his plea in bar of autrefois convict was sustained: R v Nasiri [2015] NSWSC 1649.
	
	
	Zarshoy, Bishop and Kalal are charged with an offence under s 93T(1) of the Crimes Act of participating in a criminal group, knowing it was a criminal group and knowing that his participation in that group contributes to the occurrence of any criminal activity. This is count 36 and the terms of the charge reflects those of the section. Nasiri and Akbari were included in this count but, as I have said, Nasiri was discharged on his plea of autrefoisconvict and Akbari has entered pleas in the District Court and the proceedings in this Court have been discontinued.
	
	
	By count 35, AC, Farhad, Mumtaz and Qaumi are charged with an aggravated form of the offence under s 93T(4A). This is a charge of of participating in a criminal group, whose activities were organised and ongoing, by directing some of the activities of the criminal group, knowing that it is a criminal group, and knowing that his or her participation contributes to the occurrence of any criminal activity. The aggravating feature is that they are alleged to have directed the activities of the criminal group.
	


are sub-sections 29(1) and (2) engaged?


	
	The first question to address before turning to questions of whether a joint trial is in the interests of justice and whether the accused would be prejudiced or embarrassed in such a trial, is whether s 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act1986 (NSW) authorises the court to conduct such a trial at all. Section 29 provides:
	


“29. When more than one offence may be heard at the same time

(1) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to 2 or more offences alleged to have been committed by the same accused person in any of the following circumstances:

(a) the accused person and the prosecutor consent,

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(2) A court may hear and determine together proceedings related to offences alleged to have been committed by 2 or more accused persons in any of the following circumstances:

(a) the accused persons and the prosecutor consent,

(b) the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances,

(c) the offences form or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character.

(3) Proceedings related to 2 or more offences or 2 or more accused persons may not be heard together if the court is of the opinion that the matters ought to be heard and determined separately in the interests of justice.”


	
	With the exception of AC, none of the accused consent to the conduct of the trial in the manner contended for by the Crown. Accordingly, neither s 29(1)(a) or 29(2)(a) are engaged.
	
	
	Most or all of the accused concede that counts 11-29 “arise out of the same set of circumstances”. That set of circumstances is what was described at one stage as the “turf war” between the BFL Blacktown and the BFL Bankstown. In his submissions in reply, Senior Counsel for Farhad said that the circumstances were not properly categorised as a turf war. Rather, the BFL Blacktown, having become aware of a plot by members of the BFL Bankstown to murder its leader, decided to take a pre-emptive strike in anticipatory self-defence. However the matter be classified and whatever nomenclature is employed, I am satisfied that counts 11-29 arise out of the same set of circumstances.
	
	
	There was some suggestion that the counts arising out of the Chokolatta Café shooting (counts 20-26) were of a different character (and not part of the same set of circumstances). This was on the basis that, unlike the earlier shootings, the plan was not simply to shoot members of the rival group. However, the recorded interview with witness L makes it clear that the Chokolatta Caféshooting was, as the prosecution submits, part of the same set of circumstances. The objective, however ill-considered and misguided, was to prevent the BFL Bankstown from obtaining the addresses of the members of the BFL Blacktown as part of the anticipated reaction by the Bankstown chapter to avenge the shootings of Hamzy, Ajaj, Odisho and Zakaria.
	
	
	I am satisfied that each of the offences charged in counts 11 through to 29 arose out of the same set of circumstances, namely the differences and violent animosity which existed between the Blacktown and Bankstown chapters of the BFL.
	
	
	The situation is more complicated in respect of counts 1 through 10 and counts 30 through to 36.
	
	
	The Crown submits that all of the offences charged arise out of the same set of circumstances and identifies that set of circumstances as the criminal activities of the BFL Blacktown between the dates particularised in the indictment (that is from July to December half of 2013). Further, it is the Crown’s submission that the offences were a part of a series of offences of the same or similar character.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused contend that the expression “same set of circumstances” ought not to be interpreted in such a broad fashion. It is submitted that the shootings at Wentworthville, Eaglevale, Pendle Hill, Castlereagh and the murder of Mr Antoun did not arise out of the same set of circumstances. It was submitted that, properly analysed, the only “set of circumstances” that can be described as“the same” is the violent conflict between the two rival chapters of the BFL. While that set of circumstances may apply to counts 11-29, it does not apply to the remainder of the counts. Some of the accused also submitted that becausecounts 1-9 were motivated by different and disparate things, it could not be said that they were offences of a similar character.
	
	
	I am inclined to accept the submission of the accused in respect of sub- paragraph (b). That is, I am not disposed to find that the relevant “set of circumstances” for the purpose of s 29(1)(b) and 29(2)(b) can be as loosely defined as the criminal activities of the BFL Blacktown. However, I am inclined to agree with the prosecution in respect of counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 and 30 that the offences were part of a series of offences of the same or similar character. Each of the counts that I have identified involved members of the BFL Blacktown discharging firearms in the course of the commission of serious criminal offences. Each involved members of the group acting at the direction of either Farhad or Mumtaz. My somewhat tentative view is that such similarities are sufficient to fall within the provision in s 29 (1)(c).
	
	
	As to count 32, which is the charge of supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs, I am inclined to the view that this offence did not arise out of the same set of circumstances and did not form part of a series of offences of the same or similar character to the other offences on the indictment.However, that count did arise out of the same set of circumstances as counts 33 and 34.
	
	
	The offences charged in counts 33 and 34 being the offences of possession of various weapons were offences that arose out of the same set of circumstances. That is particularly so where the gunparticularised in the relevant countsare (or may be) identified by witnesses or in the ballistics evidence as being a weapon used in one of the shooting counts.
	
	
	Counts 6 and 7, which arise out of the purchase of the SKS assault rifle and the firing of it shortly thereafter, stands in a different category again. There is no evidence of which I am aware that this rifle was used in any of the offences subject of the charges in the current indictment. Given the view that I have taken to the Crown’s contention that the set of circumstances for the purpose of s 29(1)(a) and 29(2)(b) can be cast as broadly as the criminal activities of the BFL at Bankstown and given that the purchase and firing of the gun is not an offence of the same or similar character to the offences involving shooting at people or using guns with the intention of intimidating people, I am inclined to the view that those counts are not captured by the provision in s 29(1) or s 29(2).
	
	
	As to the offences of participating in a criminal group (counts 35 and 36), I am inclined to the view that the offences can properly be categorised as arising out of the same set of circumstances as the other charges. Each of the other charges appear to have involved the activities of that criminal group as alleged by the Crown.
	
	
	In expressing my remarks in the preceding paragraphs, I have deliberately employed non-committal language. I have used expressions such as “inclined to the view” and “tentative finding” deliberately. Given that the contrary view is at least arguable in respect of each of the offences, the safest course is for me to proceed on an assumption – even in circumstances where I am inclined to the contrary view – that s 29 is at least capable of authorising a joint trial in respect of each and every one of the counts on the indictment.
	
	
	Making that assumption will allow me to address the ultimate questions that arise on an application such as the present. That is, where do the interests of justice lie and will the accused be prejudiced and embarrassed in the conduct of the trial in such a way that could not be cured by direction to the jury?
	


THE TENDENCY AND “CONTEXT” EVIDENCE


	
	The Crown has served tendency notices in relation to each of the accused. It has abandoned its tendency case in relation to Bishop. Various problems were identified with some of the other notices in the course of the submissions relating to the issue of severance of the indictment. The accused have indicated that objection will be taken to the tendency evidence.
	
	
	The parties jointly submitted that it was not necessary to resolve the tendency issue in advance of ruling on the question of severance and separate trials. However, somewhat incongruously, the parties agreed that the tendency issue was relevant to those questions.
	
	
	The accused took similar, but somewhat disparate, approaches to the tendency evidence. Senior Counsel for Kalal submitted that I should take a “realistic view of the Crown case”. [2]  I take this to mean that I should approach the question of severance on the basis that there will be a deal of admissible evidence which goes beyond the evidence that supports the individual counts in the indictment and some of this evidence may be admissible as tendency evidence. Other counsel suggested or implied that I should form some tentative or preliminary view as to the admissibility of the evidence either as tendency or “context” evidence but not make any final ruling until “all the evidence is before the jury.” [3] Mr Doyle (for Nasiri) identified deficiencies in the tendency notice served on his client and submitted that the tendency evidence would be rejected by a trial Judge. [4] Only Mr Driels (on behalf of Zarshoy) seemed to suggest that the tendency issue may need to be resolved (at least in his client’s case) in order to properly determine his application for a separate trial in respect of counts 11 and 12. [5]  The tendency notice served in respect of Bishop has been abandoned.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor agreed that the tendency issue did not need to be resolved in order to determine the questions of joinder, severance and separate trials. [6]  He acknowledged certain deficiencies in the notices that have been served to this point. However, he stressed that if the trials were separated or counts severed, there would be a body of evidence, or various pieces of evidence, relating to uncharged acts that may be relevant as tendency evidence or in order to place the events and the evidence of particular witnesses in context.
	
	
	In summary, the Crown will press for the admission of evidence said to place the events in context and will seek to rely on this evidence either to put the events in their true context or to establish a tendency on the part of the various accused. Each of the accused objects to the evidence or, at least, parts of that evidence and the use of the evidence to prove the tendency in the notices. With the exception of Zarshoy, and perhaps Nasiri, the parties agreed that the question of tendency should be decided after the application for separate trials and severance is determined. It will be necessary for the prosecution to reconsider its position on tendency in the light of the problems identified in the notices and the rulings that are made in relation to the joinder or severance of the counts. However, to determine whether 1-10 and 30-31 are properly joined or whether they should be severed, it is necessary to reach a conclusion as to whether evidence supporting those counts is admissible in relation to counts 11-29, 32-34 and 35-36.
	
	
	In the applications of Farhad, Mumtaz, Jamil and Kalal I propose to accept what is essentially a joint submission that the present application should be determined in the light of the likelihood that there will be a gooddeal of relevant and admissible evidence of criminal acts other than those charged in the particular counts and that some of that evidence may be admissible as tendency evidence.
	
	
	In the case of Zarshoy, I will proceed on the basis that the evidence identified in the tendency notice is not admissible as tendency evidence. This is my preliminary view based on the (possibly limited) material that I have seen and noting that he is only charged in relation to one of the shooting offences. There is no other evidence of a tendency on his part to use firearms or to involve himself in violent offending. However, it is open to the Crown to re-agitate the question of tendency in the light of the rulings that I make in respect of the present applications and once it is in a better position to determine “the other evidence to be adduced” (see s 97(1)(b) Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)).
	
	
	In the case of Nasiri, there are significant problems with the tendency notice as presently formulated. The notice identifies five tendencies in five dot points. The first dot point is of an extremely general nature (“to participate in the criminal activities of a criminal group”). In essence, the second dot point particularises the general assertion in the first dot point but contains particulars that appear to have marginal relevance to the crimes with which Nasiri presently stands charged (eg “drug supply operations” and “shooting of associates and members or associates of a rival group namely the BFL Bankstown Chapter.”) The third dot point asserts a tendency that “at the time of the shooting of members or associates of the rival group he had the intention that the target be killed”. None of the tendencies so far identified has significant probative value in terms of the facts in issue in Nasiri’s case. He is not charged with shooting a member of a rival group or with any offence involving an intention to kill. The specific incident in relation to which he is charged is the Eagle Vale shooting (counts 4-5), offences which involved an attempt to rob drug dealers using guns and intimidation. As presently advised, I would not allow the Crown to lead tendency evidence against Nasiri in relation to the matters identified in the first, second and third dot point in the tendency notice.
	
	
	The fourth and fifth dot points raise different considerations. They involve allegations in relation to which Nasiri has previously been sentenced on his pleas of guilty. These were an offence of demanding money with menaces and his participation in a criminal group (the BFL Blacktown). I leave open the possibility that evidence relating to those offences may be admissible as tendency evidence in the Crown case in relation to counts 4 and 5. However, the admissibility or otherwise of the tendency evidence does not affect the outcome of the present application insofar as Nasiri is concerned.
	


the informANT WITNESSES


	
	The Crown case relies substantially, although far from exclusively, on the evidence of twelveinformant witnesses. Most of these are former members of the BFL Blacktown. The credibility of all of these witnesses will be under substantial attack at the trial. Eight of the witnesses gave evidence in the course of the pre-trial hearings. Both the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Commissioner of Police sought orders calculated to protect the safety of these witnesses and evidence was tendered proving their vulnerability and the risks, expense and inconvenience involved in bringing the witnesses to and from court: seeR v Qaumi &Ors (AVL) [2015] NSWSC 1711.
	
	
	In considering the various applications for severance and separate trials, an important factor in an analysis of where the interests of justice lie is the desirability that these witnesses are not required to give evidence on multiple occasions.
	


the ballistics evidence


	
	One factor militating in favour of a joint trial is that ballistics evidence suggests that particular firearms were used in more than one of the shooting incidents. This creates a connection between the counts relating to those incidents. Separating the trials relating to these counts would result in some duplication and repetition of the ballistics evidence. Of the eight to ten firearms referred to in the evidence, five were recovered.
	
	
	Firearms that were recovered by police
	
	
	A .38 revolver (serial number J117163) was seized by police on 7 November 2013 from the rear right passenger foot-well of motor vehicle CPQ20C in Railway Street, Parramatta. This was shortly after the shootings at the Chokolatta Café. The prosecution says that the ballistics evidence will suggest that this gun was used in the Castlereagh incident (counts 8-10), the Revesby Heights shooting of Mahmoud Hamzy (counts 11-13) and the Chokolatta Café shooting (counts 20-26). Kalal’s fingerprints were located on this revolver and his DNA recovered from items located in the car.
	
	
	A Bentley sawn-off shotgun (serial number A548924) was allegedly used in the Winston Hills shooting of Odisho (counts 14-16) and the Chokolata Café shootings. This firearm was also seized by police on 7 November 2013 from the front passenger foot-well of motor vehicle CPQ20C in Railway Street, Parramatta. Jamil’s fingerprints were recovered from a purple plastic bag found underneath the shotgun.
	
	
	A .38 revolver (serial number D338749) was used in the Revesby Heights shooting and was later recovered in a bag of guns and drugs seized by police on 12 December 2013 (counts 32-34).
	
	
	A Mossberg sawn-off shotgun (serial number H416154) was used in the Eagle Vale incident (counts 4-5) and the Zakaria shooting (counts 17-19). It was also found in the bag of guns and drugs by police on 12 December 2013.
	
	
	A .38 Revolver (serial number 798127) was used in the murder of Joseph Antoun (count 30). This firearm was found in the possession witness K and seized by police on 3 January 2014 at Orchard Hills (count 31).
	


Firearms referred to but not recovered


	
	The firearm allegedly used in the Wentworthville shooting (counts 1-3) was not recovered. However, six 9mm Parabellum calibre fired cartridge cases were recovered from the scene and each bore a Winchester stamp. A ballistics expert is expected to give evidence that one impact damaged bullet recovered was .38 calibre bullet. The calibre of another bullet was unable to be identified.
	
	
	The SKS assault rifle allegedly purchased and test-fired at Pendle Hill (counts 6-7) was not recovered. However a shell casing located at the scene was identified to be a 7.62 x 39mm Calibre fired cartridge case. The expert evidence suggests that this type of ammunition is known to be used in SKS assault rifles.
	
	
	No .45 calibre pistol was recovered. However ballistics evidence concerning material recovered at the scene suggests that the same weapon was used in both the shooting of Anthony Elkadi at Greenacre Road (counts 28-29) and the Hamzy shooting at Revesby Heights.
	
	
	Witness I refers to possessing a .38 revolver in the course of the Odisho shooting at Winston Hills. It appears that this gun was not recovered.
	
	
	Witness I says he obtained a 0.38 Revolver for use in the Zakaria shooting at Winston Hills. However, that gun was not fired and appears was not recovered.
	


legal PRINCIPLES and an overview of the submissions


	
	The statutory tests are set out in ss 21 and 29 of the Criminal Procedure Act. I have already set out s 29 in paragraph [83] above. Section 21 relevantly provides:
	


“21(2) If of the opinion:

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.”


	
	The “interests of justice” in s 29(3) is an expression of very wide import and the provisions provide the Court with a wide discretion to make orders for the severance of counts and the conduct of separate trials of individual accused. The provisions, the cases decided under ss 21 and 29 and the common law which precedes them, require the court to bring to account a wide range of considerations and factual circumstances.
	
	
	In R v Symss [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [68] Sheller JA (with whom James J and Smart AJ agreed) said:
	


“The decision whether or not to grant separate trials involves a consideration of the interests of justice, including conserving costs, the avoidance of inconvenience to witnesses and the desirability of common enterprises being jointly tried so as to avoid inconsistent verdicts.”


	
	This is a particularly significant factor in the present case and both sides have mounted arguments based around such practical considerations. The prosecution has emphasised the fact that its case is reliant on the twelve informant witnesses. Because these witnesses require special arrangements to ensure their attendance and safety, there is a powerful reason to attempt to ensure that they are required to give evidence on one occasion or, if that is not achievable, on as few occasions as possible. On the other hand, a number of the accused point to the fact that they are charged with very few of the offences on the thirty six count indictment and that if the case proceeds as proposed by the prosecution they will be required – at great expense to the community via the NSW Legal Aid Commission – to sit through a trial that will last for many months when the evidence touching upon them will be in very short compass. This is a very potent consideration in the cases of Nasiri, Bishop and Zarshoy, each of whom is charged with two or three specific offences as well as the general offence of participation in the criminal group (and Nasiri has been discharged in relation to that offence). It is also a relevant consideration for Kalal and Jamil Qaumi, each of whom stands charged with far fewer offences than do Farhad and Mumtaz.
	
	
	In R v Assim (1966) 2 QB 249, Lord Sachs attempted (at 261) to describe a general principle at common law:
	


“As a general rule it is, of course, no more proper to have tried by the same jury several offenders on charges of committing individual offences that have nothing to do with each other than it is to try before the same jury offences committed by the same person that have nothing to do with each other. Where, however, the matters which constitute the individual offences of the several offenders are upon the available evidence so related, whether in time or by other factors, that the interests of justice are best served by their being tried together, then they can properly be the subject of counts in one indictment and can, subject always to the discretion of the court, be tried together.”


	
	The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal cited this passage with approval in R v Annakin&Ors(1989) 17 NSWLR 202; (1988) 37 A Crim R 131; and observed at 207:
	


“In the ultimate, each case must be dealt with according to the evidence and by reference to the considerations relevant to whether prejudice would be caused so as to prevent the accused being given a fair trial.”


	
	In Regina v Patsalis&Spathis (No 1) [1999] NSWSC 649; (1990) 107 A Crim R 432 at [6] Kirby J said:
	


“There is a rule, and a proviso to that rule. It is desirable, in the ordinary course, that all persons said to have been concerned with the one crime should be dealt with in the one trial. That rule is subject to the proviso that, if a joint trial would cause positive injustice to an accused, then a separate trial should be ordered (R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543).”


	
	In terms of separating the trials of individual accused, “separate trials may be appropriate where the evidence to be led against one accused is significantly different from that to be led against another”: Annakin at 139 citing Guldur (1987) 8 NSWLR 12 and The Queen v Darby[1962] HCA 32; 148 CLR 668. The principles were encapsulated in the following passage from Hunt J in R v Middis(Supreme Court (NSW), 27 March 1991, unrep) which is often referred to in later authorities:
	


“Briefly, the relevant principles are that:

1. where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him, and

2. where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him, and

3. where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material,

a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.”


	
	In R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190, Adams J discussed the term “immeasurably” stating (at [39]-[40]):
	


“Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, ‘immeasurably’ usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant ‘significant, though incommensurable’. The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to ‘positive injustice’. Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence.

I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant's case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender's case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused's case was weak, or weaker than the applicant's, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury's consideration of the applicant's case.”


	
	Spigelman CJ agreed subject to some additional remarks made by RS Hulme J. All three Judges were satisfied that the joint trial conducted in that case had miscarried.
	
	
	The existence of “cut-throat” defences is not generally a valid reason to order separate trials and may be a factor in favour of a joint trial: Webb and Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 per Toohey J (with whom Mason CJ and McHugh J agreed on this point) at [88]-[89], contra Deane J at [80]. However, in a number of cases separate trials have been ordered where one accused makes out of court statements implicating a co-accused: see, for example, R v Iskandar [2011] NSWSC 1192 (Davies J), R v Singh (Supreme Court (NSW), 10 November 2011, Fullerton J, unrep), R v Lu and Pham [2007] NSWSC 1141 (Price J) and R v Roff [2015] NSWSC 1853. These are not relevant considerations here as there is no indication that any of the accused propose to point the finger at the other or has made any statements to the police implicating their co-accused.
	
	
	There have also been many cases where consideration has been given to the principles and considerations relevant to the joinder of multiple counts in the one indictment. The Crown relied on the decision of Johnson J in R vKarimi; R v Khoury; R v Mir (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 156, where his Honour found that a number of counts (twelve) involving separate offences of robbery, murder, conspiracy to murder, possession of weapons and accessary after the fact (of murder) were properly joined. Applications for severance and separate trial were rejected. In particular, reliance was placed on his Honour’s observation at [32]-[34]:
	


“32. In circumstances where, within a period of days, it is alleged that persons were involved in planned criminal activities involving the use of weapons, including the .22 shortened firearm and the machete, and that there are links between these persons and weapons, I am satisfied that it can be said that the offences arise out of the same set of circumstances or are part of a series of offences of the same or a similar character. The linkage between persons and items and the readiness of members of the group, on the Crown case, to utilise these weapons are factors pertinent to this conclusion.

33. I do not consider that the Crown case is appropriately characterised as involving an attempt to rely upon tendency or propensity evidence. On the Crown case, there are direct links between persons, items and offences. Further, the evidence concerning the .22 shortened firearm and machete and their availability and use at the times of Counts 2, 3 and 6, are capable of bearing upon the state of mind of Karimi with respect to those counts.

34. I am satisfied that the requirements of s.29(1) have been met with respect to Counts 9, 10 and 11. I am not persuaded that the interests of justice require that these counts be heard and determined separately. The jury will be directed concerning the use of evidence adduced at the trial, by reference to the elements of the various offences charged in the amended indictment. I accept that the subject matter of Count 6 is capable of arousing strong emotions, however the jury will be given appropriate directions in that respect.”


	
	The Crown notes that these observations are relevant here where there are various connections between the weapons used in different counts and evidence of the “readiness of the group … to utilise these weapons”.
	
	
	Reference was also made to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Darwiche v R; El-Zeyat v R; Aouad v R; Osman v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 (Darwiche and Ors).That case had a number of features in common with the present case. In particular, the case involved multiple counts of murder and shooting with intent to murder. There were seven counts arising out of four shooting incidents that took place over a period of around four months. The offences arose out of animosity between two rival “families” each of which seemed to be involved in criminal activity including drug distribution and the use and possession of guns. The Crown noted that Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreed) concluded that the counts were properly joined and that the trial did not miscarry. In relation to the reasoning in that case, the Crown submitted: [7] 
	



	
	In relation to the appellant who faced all seven charges the court determined that of significance was the interrelationship between the various incidents giving rise to charges and the course of events which were said to link these incidents would have led to Crown adducing all such evidence from the relevant witnesses [256].
	
	
	Separate trials of counts against Darwiche would not have exercised any damaging pieces of evidence. The narrative relevant to the charges involved a continuum of events over a period of time [257].
	
	
	There existed ballistics evidence linking firearms used in the shootings [258].
	
	
	In relation to the appellants only charged with counts 6 and 7 the Court accepted that if the trials had been separated the evidence explaining the background of hostilities would have been admitted [261].
	
	
	Further, the Crown was entitled to adduce evidence as to the background to the crime for which they were charged and the relationship between co-accused and the informer witnesses to permit an assessment by the jury of the question “How is it that these co-accused came to act in this way, as the Crown alleges-how did it come to this?” [263]. (It is significant that the background evidence or context evidence included other uncharged criminal acts such as drug dealing and acts of violence).
	
	
	The ballistics evidence linking firearms was pertinent in a manner adverse to all the appellants [264].
	



	
	Apart from the number of charges and incidents, Darwiche and Ors had much in common with the situation prevailing here in respect of counts 11-25. The decision by Bell J (as her Honour then was) was challenged on an application under s 5F Criminal Appeal Act1912 (NSW) (Osman v R [2006] NSWCCA 196) as well as the appeal against conviction. An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed:El Zayet and Others v The Queen [2011] HCATrans 342. However, the case says little about the desirability of joining charges such as those contained in counts 1-10 and counts 30-32. Further, a number of other shooting offences and one of the same offences charged against a brother were subject to orders for separation or were not subject to joinder: see Aouad and El-Zeyat v R [2011] NSWCCA 61, R v Abdul Darwiche[2006] NSWSC 922 [8]  and R v Adnan Darwiche [2006] NSWSC 923.
	
	
	The Crown also took me to the case arising out of the “Snowtown murders” in South Australia:R v Bunting and others (No 3) [2003] SASC 251.This arose out of a question of whether there was any earlier case where two disparate murders were joined in the one indictment. This is particularly relevant to the situation in the present case with respect to the joinder of count 30 (the Antoun murder). That murder, only charged against Farhad and Mumtaz, is alleged to have been a contract murder and (as far as one can know) had nothing to do with the dispute between the two chapters of the Brothers for Life. In Bunting, three accused were jointly tried in relation to eleven counts of murder.There was a powerful underlying unity between a number of the murders and the jury was entitled or permitted to employ similar fact reasoning and were directed accordingly: R v Bunting [2005] SASC 45 at [16] and [20]. While the South Australian case provides authority that a trial of unrelated murders may be authorised by the relevantly similar statutory regime, the factual matrix and the evidentiary circumstances are very different from the present case.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused point to authorities that emphasise the potential, if not inevitable, prejudice involved in conducting a joint trial in relation to a number of different, even if related, criminal offences: see, for example, Sutton v The Queen [1984] HCA 5; 152 CLR 528at 541-2 (Brennan J) and De Jesus v The Queen [1986] HCA 65; 61 ALJR 1 at 3 (Gibbs CJ), 6 (Mason and Deane JJ) and Brennan J (7). Based on these authorities, the thrust of the defence submission is that unless the evidence proving one offence is admissible in proof of another, the counts should be severed because the prejudice cannot be cured by direction. This is put particularly forcefully in relation to the Antoun murder (count 30) but is also put in relation to counts 1-10 and the participation offences.
	
	
	I should emphasise that while there was a concession by some counsel that the prosecution’s position on joinder was stronger in respect of counts 11-29, it was not conceded that these counts should be heard together. The accused maintain that a trial encompassing all of the shootings (and related firearms offences) arising from the dispute with the Bankstown chapter would be unjustifiably burdensome on the accused and unduly confusing to the jury. The risk of impermissible use of the evidence and the prejudicial impact of the number of offences could not be cured by direction.
	
	
	In addition to the applications to sever the counts on the indictment, some of the accused sought to be tried separately from their co-accused. There were various bases for these applications.
	
	
	In particular, it was put that there is a real risk of the accused being found guilty “by association” because of their relationship with accused men such as Farhad and Mumtaz who stand charged with such a large number of extremely serious offences. It is put that direction cannot cure such prejudice.
	
	
	Some accused mounted an argument that the case against them was significantly weaker than the case against the others and that there was a risk that the prosecution case would be made (to adopt the language of Hunt J in Middis) “immeasurably stronger” because of the large body of evidence to be adduced in the trials of the co-accused. Again, it is put that even the strongest direction would be incapable of curing this prejudice.
	
	
	For those accused charged only with a small number of offences, it was put that the joint trial would constitute a physical and personal burden and result in a great and unnecessary expense to the community. Throughout the pre-trial hearings to date there have been a number of complaints that the transport arrangements necessary for such a large trial has meant that some of the accused (in particular Mr Zarshoy and Mr Kalal) have been required to wake extremely early in the morning (around 4am) and have not returned to their cell until late at night (around 9pm). While I have raised these concerns with the Department of Corrective Services, it seems from counsels’ reports (which I accept) that there has been little or no improvement in the situation.
	


Decision on severance


	
	I have concluded that counts 1-10 and counts 30-31 should be severed from the present indictment but that the remaining counts on the indictment are properly joined and that it is in the interests of justice for the trials on the remaining counts to proceed jointly. The trial is to proceed in relation to the Hamzy murder (counts 11-13), the other offences arising out of the dispute with the Bankstown chapter (counts 14-29), the offences of possession of the guns associated with those shootings (counts 33-34) and the drugs found with those guns (count 32).
	
	
	Subject to its election as to the particulars of the offences, I will permit the Crown to join counts 35-36 (the participation offences). Assuming the Crown so elects, the evidence will be limited to that which is admissible to establish the substantive charges. If the Crown seeks to conduct a more expansive trial in relation to counts 35-36, the decision on severance of those counts will be revisited.
	
	
	Finally, I have determined that Bishop should have a separate trial in relation to the participation offence, such trial to be held with his trial in relation to the present counts 8-9 subject to any order for severance made by the District Court.
	
	
	The trial in relation to the Antoun murder (counts 30-31) will commence at the conclusion of the joint trial. In accordance with the Director’s undertaking to the Chief Justice, the remaining counts (1-10 and, if the Director so elects, 35-36) will be withdrawn in this Court and the Crown will present indictments in the District Court.
	
	
	There are a number of reasons for reaching these conclusions.
	
	
	I am not satisfied that the evidence to be led in support of counts 1-10 or counts 30-31 is admissible in support of the counts that remain on the indictment. I adopt a similar process of reasoning as that disclosed in the judgment of Bell J (as her Honour then was) in R v Abdul Darwiche [2006] NSWSC 922 especially at [9], [22], [24]-[29]. The fact (assuming it to be) that Farhad and Mumtaz accepted a contract to arrange the murder of Mr Antoun in December 2013 does not illuminate the differences between the two chapters of the BFL that led to the shootings of those associated with the Bankstown chapter between October and November of 2013.
	
	
	Nor am I persuaded (on the limited arguments advanced) that the evidence of the earlier offences (counts 1-10) or the Antoun murder possess significant probative value as tendency evidence given the different nature of the events and the different tendencies involved in those events. Unless the tendency is cast as widely as a tendency to engage in criminal activity or a tendency to discharge firearms or something similar, the “extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue” [9]  is limited. While it has been held that tendency evidence under s 97 (unlike coincidence evidence under s 98 and similar fact evidence at common law) does not require there to be an “underlying unity” or “striking similarity” to be admissible, [10]  it has also been held that the more general the tendency asserted the less probative value the evidence is likely to have. [11]  Even if it is accepted that the evidence has significant probative value for the purpose of s 97, that probative value does not substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect that the evidence may have on the accused. [12] 
	
	
	I can envisage no direction that would engender confidence in the Court that a jury could put aside the relevantly prejudicial impact of conducting the two unrelated murder charges together, one involving what might be seen as a gangland war and the other that is cast as a contract killing. I have little doubt that any guilty verdict returned if these counts were run together in one trial would be tainted by the possibility that the jury was simply overwhelmed by the prejudice created by the joint trial. I have considered the Crown’s submission, based on the observations of Martin J in R v Bunting and Ors (at [409]), that the jury is entitled to “the full story” rather than a “fragmented and distorted picture”. However, such a submission might be made in any case. The essential questions in a case such as this are whether the evidence to prove one count is admissible to prove the other and whether the conduct of the trials jointly may be “productive of a miscarriage of justice”: cfMakarov v R (No 3) [2008] NSWCCA 293at [54], [73]-[82]. That is a question of judgment to be made in the circumstances peculiar to each case. There is a certain danger in applying the findings and language employed by a trial Judge in a case as extraordinary and extreme as that which confronted Martin J in Bunting and Ors.
	
	
	I have taken into account the fact that some of the ballistics links between the weapons used in earlier incidents and the shootings of the Bankstown BFL members will be lost. However, putting aside the testimony of the informants, these links for the most part concern the weapons rather than the accused. In any event, there will remain significant ballistics evidence relating to individual shootings and some links between the weapons used in the different counts. For example, the jury will have evidence that one of the guns used in the Hamzy shooting was also used the Chokolatta Café shooting and evidence that the shotgun used in the Odisho shooting was also used in the Chokolatta Café shooting. There will also be evidence that the other handgun and the shotgun used in the Hamzy murder was located in the bag of guns and drugs seized by police on 12 December 2013. The evidence will come from both the informant witnesses and witnesses with expertise in ballistics. One of the more significant pieces of evidence in terms of connecting the accused with relevant firearms is the seizure of the bag containing the guns and drugs. The counts relating to those guns (counts 32-34) will remain on the indictment and the evidence will be available for consideration by the jury. Other significant evidence connecting particular accused to the guns used in the offences that will remain on the indictment will be available to the jury. That will be in the form of fingerprint and DNA evidence.
	
	
	I have also taken into account the inconvenience and possible danger to the witnesses in being required to give evidence on more than one occasion. The orders I propose will require most, if not all, of the informant witnesses to give evidence on more than one occasion. I have given this matter anxious consideration and the orders I will make minimise or alleviate that concern as much as possible, within the overarching requirement that each of the accused receive a fair trial according to the law.
	
	
	Iconsidered, but rejected, the various applications for severance of counts 11 through to 29 from one another. I have contemplated various permutations and regimes under which this group of offences might be tried.
	
	
	In particular, I considered the possibility of separating the proceedings in relation to the Hamzy murder/Ajaj shooting (counts 10-13) from all the remaining counts. This is the principle application made on behalf of Zarshoy. [13] However, evidence of the Hamzy murder is admissible in proof of the counts that follow. It provides not only the background and context of the subsequent shootings but also the motivation for those shootings. The true narrative of events that commenced with the Hamzy shooting on 28 October 2011 and continued until the shooting at Greenacre Road a month later - a total of five shooting incidents comprising counts 11-29 - cannot sensibly and fairly unfold before the jury unless the whole story is told. The Odisho, Zakaria and Chokolatta Café shootings took place over just 5 days, commencing less than a week after the Hamzy murder.
	
	
	To employ the language of Johnson J in the binding authority of Darwiche and Others, if those counts were separated, the jury would be left to wonder “how is it that these co-accused came to act in this way?” and “how did it come to this?” [14] 
	
	
	Counts 33 and 34 involve the seizure by police on around 12 December 2013 of a bag containing drugs and guns. One of the guns seized was the Mossberg pump action shotgun (count 33) that was allegedly used in the Zakaria shooting (counts 17-19) as well as the earlier and unrelated Eagle Vale shooting (counts 4-5). The other gun was the Smith and Wesson .38 revolver(count 34) allegedly used in the Hamzy murder. These gun possession charges “arise out of the same set of circumstances” as the other charges surrounding the shootings directed at associates of the Bankstown chapter of the BFL. Proof of the circumstances of the seizure of these guns, and the evidence of the informants as to how those guns were transported from place to place and at whose direction, is relevant and probative of the charges in which the guns were allegedly used. It is in the interests of justice that those counts be joined and heard together. Most or all of the evidence admissible to prove those offences would be led in the trial in any event. I am not satisfied that any of the accused will be prejudiced or embarrassed in their defence by the presence of those counts on the indictment.
	
	
	I have considered severing count 32; the allegation of possession of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. However, the drugs were found in the same bag as the guns referred to in the preceding paragraph (i.e. counts 33-34) and severance of these three counts would create unnecessary expense and duplication. The same evidence to be led in proof of possession for the purpose of counts 33-34 will be adduced to prove that element of the offence charged in count 32. The remaining elements (whether the items are firearms or drugs respectively) are largely technical and unlikely to be in dispute. In view of the seriousness of the criminality involved in the counts that will run together and the fact that there will be at least some evidence of the group’s involvement in drug supply in any event, the accused will not be embarrassed or prejudiced in the conduct of their defence by the inclusion of this count. Any prejudice that might arguably arise can be cured by direction.
	
	
	I have considered whether the counts alleging participation ina criminal group (35 and 36) should be severed. My provisional view is that they should not, subject to the Crown making an election as the particulars of the offence. It may be that the matter requires further submissions and an understanding of the case that the Crown proposes to present in relation to those counts in light of my rulings in relation to the substantive charges. What I do not propose to allow is a trial in which wide-ranging evidence is adduced to establish the participation offences beyond that which is admissible to establish counts 11-29 and 32-34. If the Crown elects to limit the evidence to establish participation to those matters, I would not sever those counts. If the Crown elects to conduct the participation offences by reference to the full extent of the criminality that is disclosed in the various timelines and chronologies, I would be inclined to the view that the accused would be embarrassed or prejudiced in the conduct of their defence of the substantive charges. It would be impossible to fashion directions to overcome the prejudice of what would become an unmanageable and confusing contest as to the activities of the various accused both collectively and individually over a period of around six months. While the prosecution is unquestionably entitled to charge these offences under s 93T in view of the evidence available, I have some difficulty in identifying the forensic or legal necessity of doing so in light of the seriousness of the offences with which the accused are otherwise charged. However, that is ultimately a matter for the prosecution authority. At this stage I simply put the Crown to its election as to the nature of the case it seeks to run in the light of this judgment and these reasons.
	


SEPARATE TRIAL applications and other applications by individual accused


	
	In addition to the applications for severance, several of the accused seek to be tried separately from their co-accused.
	


Bishop


	
	As a result of the ruling that counts 8 and 9 are to be severed from the indictment, those matters will not proceed in this Court in accordance with the Director’s undertaking. Ms Evers invites me to make a ruling that he receive a separate trial in the District Court. That is, in addition to the ruling that counts 8 and 9 be severed from the present indictment, it is submitted that I should order that he be tried separately from his co-accused in respect of those counts (that is, Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi).
	
	
	While there is some force to Ms Evers submission on this issue, particularly her submission in relation to the relative strength of the case against each of the accused, I do not propose to rule on that application. It is a matter more properly disposed of in the court in which the trial is ultimately to proceed. It may be that the prosecution will decide to proceed separately against Mr Bishop for practical reasons.
	
	
	However, it is appropriate that I deal with Bishop’s application that he receive a separate trial from the co-accused in relation to the participation offence with which he is charged in count 36.
	
	
	I accept the submission of Ms Evers that the case against Bishop in relation to this offence is significantly weaker than that confronting the other accused. While official membership of the group is not a prerequisite for proof of the charge, the evidence demonstrates that the prosecution case against each of the other accused is significantly stronger because their names are contained on a list of names recording payments of fees for membership of the group. The cross-examination of relevant informant witnesses on the voir dire also demonstrated that the evidence of his membership of the groupis not particularly strong.
	
	
	It seems that the high point of the Crown case against Bishop is the evidence of his participation in the Castlereagh offences. I am not persuaded that the case in relation to those offences is as weak as Ms Evers portrays it, but it certainly has some difficulties. In any event, the counts relating to those events will be severed from the indictment so the existence of that evidence does not impact on whether Bishop should be tried separately.
	
	
	It would be a significant burden to require him to remain in the dock throughout what will be a quite lengthy trial in circumstances where the evidence against him is very confined. It would also involve a significant and unwarranted expense to the community.
	
	
	Finally, there is a real risk that he would be prejudiced and embarrassed in his defence if he stands trial with the co-accused in circumstances where they are charged with such a diverse range of very serious offences and where the case against them appears to be relatively strong.
	
	
	For those reasons I will make an order that Bishop be tried separately from his current co-accused.
	
	
	To be clear: this is not an order that the participation offence be severed from an indictment containing the aggravated break and enter and firearms offences charged in counts 8 and 9 of the current indictment or from any other offence charged in an indictment presented in the District Court. The form and content of the trial to be conducted against Bishop in the District Court will be a matter for that Court to determine.
	


Nasiri


	
	Because of the severance of counts 4 and 5, and his discharge on count 36, the matter of Nasiri will proceed in the District Court.
	
	
	As in the case of Bishop, any application for him to be tried separately from his co-accused in respect of those counts (Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi), and any application for severance in relation to any other count contained on an indictment presented, should be dealt with in the District Court. It may be that the prosecution will proceed against him individually while the more serious charges against Farhad and Mumtaz are resolved.
	


Kalal


	
	In addition to joining in the application for severance and adopting the submissions of Senior Counsel for Farhad in that regard, Kalal also seeks an order that he “be tried separately for all offences he is charged within the indictment”. [15] 
	
	
	Kalal is not charged with either of the murder offences and Mr Nicholson SC submits that a proper approach to the question of severance would result in all of the non-murder charges being returned to the District Court. That would remove Kalal, who is charged in relation to his involvement in the Zakaria and Chokolatta Café offences (counts 17-27), from the current proceedings. Insofar as this was an application for severance of counts, I have accepted some of these submissions but rejected others. However, it is also an application for a separate trial in relation to those offences and that application requires separate consideration.
	
	
	Kalal is charged in relation to the Zakaria shooting (count 18-19), the Chokolatta Café shooting (counts 20-26) and possession of the .38 revolver used in the latter shooting. It was submitted that there is incurable prejudice arising from the evidence relating to the events giving rise to counts 1-10 and the Antoun murder (count 30) and that the inclusion of the Hamzy murder “compounds the initial prejudice.” [16]  It was submitted that Kalal’s association with the other members of the BFL would create prejudice in that a jury would inevitably conclude that a person associating with such a group “must necessarily be a person of bad character, or more accurately, appalling character.” [17]  Emphasis was placed on the fact that the evidence is that Kalal did not join the group until August 2013.
	
	
	I accept that there is a risk of prejudice as submitted by Senior Counsel. However, a good deal of that risk is mitigated by the severance of counts 1-10 and counts 30-31. As to the inclusion on the indictment of the Hamzy murder, and the submission that Kalal should be subject to a trial separated from his co-accused who are also charged with that crime, it must be remembered that the offences with which he is charged are closely connected in time and content to the other shooting incidents that arose out of the pre-emptive strike on the Bankstown chapter. Even if he were tried separately, the Crown would be entitled to lead at least some evidence of those other shootings to establish the motive for the offences with which he is charged and the context in which they occurred. If it is able to, the prosecution is entitled to establish that Kalal knew the details of the Hamzy murder.
	
	
	There is no relevant or incurable prejudice or embarrassment in the fact that the jury would hear evidence of those other shootings in a joint trial. In coming to that conclusion, I have considered the evidence suggestingthat Kalal may have had some “unwitting” role in the lead up to the Hamzy shooting. [18] It will be necessary to direct the jury of the limited purpose of any such evidence in the case against Kalal and to provide other directions to protect him from unfair prejudice arising from his association with those accused of the Hamzy killing.
	
	
	It cannot be suggested that the case against the co-accused (Farhad and Mumtaz for example) is substantially stronger than the case against Kalal or that the evidence in each case is significantly different. The case against all of the accused is based largely, although far from exclusively, on the evidence of the informant witnesses. Further, in relation to counts 17-27, there is CCTV footage and fingerprint and DNA evidence that appears to connect Kalal to the Chokolatta Café shooting. Along with the evidence of the informants, the case against him appears to be a strong one.
	
	
	If the trial were to proceed on all 36 counts, there would be considerable force in the submissions made in relation to the prejudice that would be suffered by Kalal. However, most – not all –of that force evaporates once it is accepted that the first trial in this Court should be restricted to those counts arising out of the events surrounding the violent conflict between the Blacktown BFL and their Bankstown rivals (that is counts 11-29 and associated weapons and drugs charges). Direction to the jury is capable of ensuring that the evidence is used appropriately and that there be no unfair prejudice in the conduct of these counts together.
	
	
	For those reasons, I do not propose to accede to Kalal’s application that all of the non-homicide counts be severed or that his trial should be separated from the co-accused in relation to the counts with which he stands charged.
	


Zarshoy


	
	Zarshoy is only charged in relation to the Hamzy murder (counts 11-12).    He seeks an order that all other counts on the indictment be severed from the indictment. [19] I have considered his submissions based on the “sheer size” and length of the trial, the possibility of the confusion of the witnesses noting that there is “a limited number” of witnesses who give evidence in relation to the Hamzy murder and the risk of “guilt by association”.
	
	
	Mr Driels also emphasised that Mr Zarshoy, in spite of only being charged in relation to the one incident, is subject to a particularly onerous custodial situation and faces being “subjected to a long-term deprivation of sleep, no rest, no recreation for over six (6) months.” [20] The reference to the “six months” is predicated on all of the counts running together. The orders I propose will alleviate this concern to some degree. I expect, without having the benefit of estimate provided by counsel, that the first trial will be significantly shorter than six months. However, it will remain a lengthy trial and it is extremely troubling that Mr Zarshoy is in a position, through no fault of his own, that the transport arrangements are such that he is being denied a reasonable opportunity for sleep. I expect to be kept apprised of the situation and will deal with any application designed to reduce the burden if and when it is made. It is important that his physical and psychological health is not endangered by the process of the trial.
	
	
	I have considered whether Zarshoy should be tried separately in relation to counts 11-12 and 36 (although that is not his primary application). I have done so on the basis of the onerous conditions of his incarceration and transport arrangements and the possible prejudice arising from the admission of evidence against co-accused which is not admissible against him and may cause prejudice and embarrassment in the conduct of his trial. Any potential prejudice that arises from evidence of the events that follow the Hamzy murder can be cured by direction. The jury can be clearly directed as to what evidence is admissible against each accused and will be directed clearly and emphatically that the evidence of the other shootings is not to be used in support of the case against Zarshoy and that his involvement is limited to the events surrounding the Hamzy shooting.
	
	
	I am satisfied that it is in the interest of justice that he be tried along with those accused who are charged with the various shooting offences that give rise to counts 14-28. I am not satisfied that he will be prejudiced or embarrassed in the conduct of his defence or that the case against him will be made immeasurably stronger by the admission in his trial of evidence that might otherwise not be admissible against him. As I have said, any such prejudice can be cured by direction.
	


Jamil Qaumi


	
	Jamil’s submission is that there should be two murder trials in this Court and all other offences should be returned to the District Court. [21]  Mr Brewer emphasises the complexity of the trial proposed by the Crown and submits that it is unduly complex to realistically expect a jury to follow directions. He said it would create an unwarranted disruption to their lives.
	
	
	He emphasises that Jamil was overseas before 11 September 2013 and arrested on 7 November 2013. Accordingly, his involvement is limited to 2 months while the indictment spans a period of six months.
	
	
	For the same reasons that I have identified in respect of Kalal and Zarshoy, I am satisfied that Jamil should be tried together with the other accused charged in respect of the counts arising out of the shootings of people associated with the Bankstown chapter of the BFL (that is, Zarshoy, Kalal and AC).
	


ORDERS


	
	For those reasons I make the following orders
	
	
	Counts 1-10 inclusive and counts 30 and 31 are to be severed from the indictment.
	
	
	Reserve the question of whether counts 35-36 should be severed from the indictment.
	
	
	Direct the prosecution to indicate its election as to the particulars and basis upon which counts 35-36 are to proceed in the light of this judgment.
	
	
	Order that the accused John Bishop is to be tried separately from the other accused in relation to count 36.
	
	
	All remaining applications for severance and separate trials are refused.

2954566,R v Qaumi & Ors (AVL) [2015] NSWSC 1711,"Judgment


	
	The eight accused stand charged on an indictment containing 36 counts. The allegations include two counts of murder, several counts of shooting with intent to murder or conspiring or inciting murder, various offences involving attempts at extortion involving the use of guns, firearms offences and a serious drug offence. Some of the accused are charged with most of the individual offences. Others are charged only with a few of the offences. All of them (except for Mr Nasiri whose plea in bar was sustained [1] ) stand charged with an offence under s 93T Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of participating in a criminal group, namely the Brothers For Life (“BFL”). All of the offences arise out of the actions of that group and specifically what has been called the “Blacktown Chapter” of the BFL. It is the Crown case that all of the accused were members of the Blacktown BFL. On the prosecution case, nineteen of the charges (counts 11-29) arise out of a dispute between the Blacktown BFL and the “Bankstown Chapter” of the BFL. Members of the Bankstown BFL are said to be victims of five separate shooting incidents.
	
	
	The Director of Public Prosecutions seeks orders pursuant to s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW) (“AVL orders”) whereby 12 witnesses be permitted to give evidence by means of an audio visual link. The witnesses in question are described by the parties, variously, as “informant witnesses”, “roll-over witnesses” and “indemnified witnesses”. Ten of the witnesses are (or say that they are) former members of the Blacktown BFL. While their evidence may receive some support from other sources, it is fair to say that the evidence of these witnesses taken as a whole is critical to the case that each of the accused has to meet.
	
	
	The New South Wales Commissioner of Police, separately represented by the New South Wales Crown Solicitors Office, supports the Director’s application for the AVL orders. The Commissioner also seeks a number of other orders, some of which are related to the application for AVL and all of which are calculated to protect the safety of the witnesses, maintain the integrity of the process and maintain the public interest in encouraging witnesses to come forward and assist police in the prosecution of cases involving gangland violence.
	
	
	The Commissioner’s application was foreshadowed for the first time on the first day of the pre-trial hearing (2 November 2015). That date was set when the accused were first arraigned before me on 27 July 2015, that is to say more than three months ago. None of the accused was on notice of the application. The Commissioner was not ready to proceed by way of notice of motion or supporting evidence until 9 November 2015. On that date a notice of motion was filed in Court and part of the evidence ultimately relied on was read. Further evidence of some significance was produced the following day. The conduct of the application at such a late stage and in such a manner has caused a considerable delay in the proceedings and a waste of court and other resources.
	
	
	In any event, the orders sought can generally be described as follows: –
	



	
	Suppression and non-publication orders in respect of the witnesses’ names and material that may lead to their identification.
	
	
	In the event that AVL facilities are used with respect of any or all of the witnesses, orders that the AVL monitors be positioned in such a way as to prevent the witnesses being seen by the accused “and/or” members of the public for the duration of the testimony of the witnesses.
	
	
	If AVL is not used, an order that a screen or screens be used during the testimony of each of the witnesses to prevent the witness being seen by the accused persons “and/or” members of the public.
	
	
	If a screen order is made, an order that the Court be closed and the accused be required to leave the court room as the witnesses come and go from court.
	
	
	In the further alternative to orders 3 and 4 above, an order that the court be closed during the evidence given by the witnesses. That order would be subject to a number of obvious exceptions.
	
	
	Orders that the Commissioner be granted first access to material produced on subpoenas in order that redactions could be made of any information that might reveal the whereabouts or identification of the twelve witnesses. I have already made an order to this effect and it will remain in force.
	



	
	The notice of motion was supported by an open affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Peter Barrie, a confidential or closed affidavit of the same police officer and statements of 10 of the 12 witnesses named in the notice of motion expressing their preference as to the manner in which they might give evidence and the reasons for that preference. In addition, Ex VD-B on the voir dire is seven volumes of material comprising a large number of statements and interviews provided by the 12 witnesses subject to the proposed order. On the second day of the argument, a statement was tendered annexing a transcript of certain telephone intercepts involving some of the accused (Ex VD-K).
	
	
	Each of the accused, represented by counsel, opposes the orders sought by the Commissioner and by the prosecutor. In addition to the material tendered by the Crown, counsel brought to my attention an Instagram post by one of the witnesses in which he “posted” parts of the statements of two of the other witnesses (MFI 8) and a synopsis of a recording between three of the witnesses (Ex VD-3). Reliance was also placed on a document tendered by the Crown that sets out the various benefits that some of the witnesses have obtained by agreeing to give evidence (Ex VD-J).
	
	
	The following arguments were put by the prosecution and the Commissioner in support of the application:–
	



	
	The witnesses in question are informant witnesses and their safety is in danger. The danger to the witnesses comes in two forms. First, there is a risk that there will be an incident in or near Court which would result in harm coming to the witnesses. Secondly, if their identity is made public, they may be at risk of reprisal from people associated with the accused, the Bankstown BFL, others nominated as victims of the various crimes or people in the community who disapprove of people providing informant type evidence.
	
	
	The witnesses have expressed concern that if they are required to give evidence in the court room, and in the presence of the accused and members of the public, they will be unable to provide evidence to the best of their ability. This is based on fears they have of the accused and the anxiety that would be engendered in being in their presence.
	
	
	There is a public interest in protecting these particular witnesses because a failure to do so will discourage future witnesses from assisting in police investigations. In this respect the Commissioner relies on well-known principles concerning public interest immunity which arise and exist to protect informant witnesses.
	
	
	There is a concern expressed in the affidavit of Mr Barrie in relation to the use of police (and sheriff and corrective services) resources if the witnesses are required to give evidence in court. It is asserted that there will be significant additional resources and expenses resulting from the need to protect the witnesses as they travel to and from the courtroom.
	



	
	It is unnecessary for the purpose of this judgment to set out in great detail the allegations contained in the 36 counts. It is sufficient to note that the allegations include two counts of murder committed in extreme circumstances. The first of the murder charges involves a reasonably well-planned attack on a rival gang member resulting in one person being killed by gunshot wound and another being seriously injured by similar means. The second count of murder involved a cold-blooded execution by gun shot at the front door of the victim in circumstances where it will be alleged that two of the accused persons accepted a contract to carry out the killing.
	
	
	There are also a number of other shooting incidents (eight on a quick count). In a number of those, people (including a child) received gunshot wounds. Four of those incidents are closely related to the first murder offence. There are also three separate offences involving the use of firearms and their discharge in connection with the theft of drugs and a motor car by stand over tactics. Finally, there are a series of offences of supplying a commercial quantity of drugs, possession of a firearm and participation in a criminal group.
	
	
	In addition to the charges themselves, the Crown also seeks to lead evidence of tendencies on the part of the various accused. Within the volumes of statements and interviews made by the informant witnesses, there are numerous instances of BFL members being subject to brutal treatment by the alleged leaders of the group. This included being bashed by the group at the direction of the leader, being struck with a dumbbell and being shot or threatened with shooting. Further, the witnesses in various ways explain their fears of the alleged leaders of the criminal group and provide evidence that they remain in fear of him (or them) to this day.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to venture beyond that. If accepted, the allegations on their face establish the assertion by Mr Barrie that the Blacktown BFL operated on a regime of fear, intimidation and violence and have a “propensity for extreme violence and access to firearms”. While the accused each enjoy the presumption of innocence, for the purpose of an application such as the present, the seriousness of the allegations must be given significant weight.
	
	
	I accept that the evidence before me, which remains entirely untested, is sufficient to give rise to the fears expressed by each of the witnesses. The nature and extent of the criminality asserted also supports the fears expressed by Mr Barrie that the witnesses’ physical safety, if not their lives, are at risk if the court fails to make orders calculated to protect them.
	
	
	I also accept that if the Court fails to make orders designed to protect the witnesses, within the confines of providing a fair trial for both parties, the future investigation of criminal organisations may be jeopardised because informant style witnesses may be reluctant to come forward.
	
	
	It was put rather colourfully by Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi that informant witnesses in previous well-known and notorious trials, involving persons with reputations for violence as formidable as that of the Blacktown BFL, were “all out in the suburbs growing old with their mortgages and their ungrateful children”. It was put that those witnesses are just living normal lives and that the application had an air of melodrama and involved “crying wolf”.
	
	
	While the Crown and the Commissioner were unable to (or did not) put before me any evidence of an occasion when actual harm came to informant witnesses, it is a notorious fact that such witnesses are subject to significant discomfort, and often serious violence, while serving sentences.
	
	
	Furthermore, while it was subject to significant and well founded criticism in terms of its relevance and form, Ex VD-K demonstrates that Mumtaz Qaumi (at least) has contacts outside of the prison, the means to contact such persons and the motive and the will to perpetrate extreme violence to stop witnesses he considers might “snitch on us” from giving evidence.
	
	
	It should be stressed that it would only take one incident involving the killing or injuring of such a witness for the motivation for future informant witnesses to cooperate with the police to evaporate.
	
	
	For those reasons, I have no doubt that protective orders of some nature should be made. The question is largely one of considering and balancing the interests of both parties, the right of the accused to a fair (if not perfect) trial along with the interests of the witnesses and the public interest in their protection as I have already articulated it.
	


Suppression and non-publication orders


	
	Section 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (“the Act”) provides that suppression and non-publication orders may be made where:
	


“(a) the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice,

(c) the order is necessary to protect the safety of any person,

(e) it is otherwise necessary in the public interest for the order to be made and that public interest significantly outweighs the public interest in open justice.”


	
	I am satisfied that orders under the Act should be made. Those orders should include orders which prohibit the publication of any description or depiction of the physical appearance or other identifying feature of the witnesses. The order should be made throughout the Commonwealth and until further order. The orders sought in the notice of motion appear to be in appropriate form.
	
	
	In coming to that conclusion I have applied what is sometimes called the principle of “necessity” (inherent in the common law and in s 8 of the Act). I have also taken into account the provision in s 6 which requires me “to take into account that a primary objective of the administration of justice is to safeguard the public interest in open justice”.
	


hiding the identity of THE WITNESSES from the accused


	
	At the commencement of the pre-trial hearing, a number of counsel for the accused complained that the brief as served contained large amounts of redaction of material going to the identity of particular witnesses. Further, the witnesses’ names had been redacted and in their place pseudonyms, by way of letters A to L, had been put in place. As a result, it was at times very difficult to follow or understand the narrative.
	
	
	As I observed at the time, there was an air of unreality in the situation. The identity of the witnesses would be obvious to any and each of the accused by reference to the statements and interviews of the witnesses whose identities was masked. The absurdity of the situation was demonstrated when counsel for Mr Bishop handed up a document (MFI 1) which set out the names of the witnesses A through L (with one exception). She had been able to work out the names from her knowledge of the brief and the facts of the case. In a somewhat farcical moment, when the Instagram post (MFI 8) was handed up by Senior Counsel for Mr Kalal, I asked whether the account holder (Michael Odisho, the victim named in counts 14-16, who appears to have posted photographs of statements made by witnesses then named “A” and “D”) was expected to be a witness. One of the accused called out from the dock “he is witness H”.
	
	
	When the Commissioner eventually brought its notice of motion, each of the witnesses was identified in the notice of motion and no pseudonym order was sought. It became clear that witness H is, in fact, Michael Odisho and that counsel’s list of informant witnesses was accurate.
	
	
	There are cases where it has been held to be appropriate to hide the identity of particular witnesses even from the accused and their representatives: see, for example, BUSB v R [2011] NSWCCA 39, R v Hawi and ors (No 9) [2011] NSWSC 1655, R v Murphy [1990] NI 306; contra R v Davis [2008] UKHL 36. However, the idea that such a precaution was necessary in this case was misconceived and, eventually, not pressed. Large parts of the brief have now been re-served and my copy of those parts tendered on the voir dire have been replaced with unredacted (or less redacted) versions. I have no doubt that the redactions were made with the best of intentions but the fact of the matter is that it has resulted in significant doubling up of work and caused further delay.
	


RELEVANT PRINCIPLES, LEGISLATION AND CASE LAW


	
	Section 5B(1) of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW) (“AVL Act”) allows the Court to direct that evidence be taken by audio visual link from any place in or outside of Australia. Sub-section (2) prohibits the making of such an order in certain circumstances. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (d) are not applicable but paragraph (c) is relied on by the accused. It provides that an AVL direction must not be made if “the court is satisfied that the direction would be unfair to the party”. It is doubtful that “the party” in sub-s (c) is a reference to the accused. In any event, sub-s (3) provides:
	


“(3) In a proceeding in which a party opposes the making of a direction for the giving of evidence or making of a submission to the court by audio link or audio visual link from any place within New South Wales other than the courtroom or other place where the court is sitting, the court must not make the direction unless the party making the application satisfies the court that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for the court to do so.”


	
	The Crown and the Commissioner submit that it has been established that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order.
	
	
	In BUSB v R [2011] NSWCCA 39, Speigelman CJ pointed out at [83]:
	


“Furthermore, the prosecution, representing the community, is also entitled to a fair trial and, in that regard, can properly request steps for the protection of witnesses, including steps without which some witnesses would not be prepared to give evidence at all.”


	
	In Fairfax Digital Australia & New Zealand Pty Ltd v Ibrahim [2012] NSWCCA 125, the Court discussed the concept of the administration of justice in the context of suppression and non-publication orders:
	


“48. The broader concept of the administration of justice, including consequences not just for the present case but for future cases, including the supply of information from victims of unlawful conduct and the willingness of witnesses to give evidence, accords with the approach taken in this Court: see John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd (Receivers and managers appointed) v Local Court of New South Wales (1991) 26 NSWLR 131 at 161 D-E (Mahoney JA, Hope AJA agreeing), approved in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court at [47] (Spigelman CJ, Handley JA and MW Campbell AJA agreeing) and in R v Kwok [2005] NSWCCA 245; 64 NSWLR 335 at [13] (Hodgson JA), [34] (Howie J) and [38]-[40] (Rothman J); see also Batistatos v Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW [2006] HCA 27; 226 CLR 256 at [12]. Each of these cases was dealing with the implied power of courts, operating prior to the commencement of the Suppression Orders Act, and each involved orders which impinged on the operation of the open justice principle. Accepting that broad view, at least in some circumstances, the factors referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of s 8(1) may overlap with (a), because orders falling within those paragraphs might also be necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.”


	
	In R v Ngo; Dinh; Dao [2001] NSWSC 339, two witnesses were reluctant to give evidence in the presence, or in sight of, the accused. The trial Judge ordered that the evidence be taken by CCTV and that the screen be arranged so that the accused could not see the witnesses. Dunford J said:
	


“15. There may be some justification for the fears expressed by the witnesses, although there is no evidence that any of the occurrences giving rise to their fears are in any way referable to any of the accused. But irrespective of whether there is any cause or justification for their fears, I am satisfied that their fears are genuinely held and that they probably would not give the evidence if they were required to do so face to face in the courtroom in the presence of the accused. I am also satisfied that even if they did give the evidence, because of their fears, rightly or wrongly but genuinely held, they would not justice do to themselves as witnesses and it is therefore in the interest of the administration of justice to make the order.”


	
	However, his Honour went on to issue a note of caution as to the use of the procedure:
	


“26. Mr Cusack QC made a further submission to the effect that to allow this evidence to be given by video-link would ‘open the floodgates’ so as to permit any witness who was reluctant to confront an accused in person in the courtroom to seek to have a similar order made. I do not regard the provisions as being open to such a broad interpretation and the exercise of the power to order prosecution evidence in criminal trials to be given in this way must be carefully circumscribed. On the other hand, this trial has been described as ""high profile"". A politician was shot dead outside his home and the Crown allegation is that it was organised by the accused Phuong Ngo for his own political advancement. It is therefore most desirable that in a case such as this all available evidence is placed before the jury so that, so far as possible, the facts may be properly and correctly ascertained. I am satisfied that this was an appropriate case to make an order similar to that made by Wood CJ at CL on the earlier occasion.”


	
	His Honour’s decision was upheld on appeal: R v Ngo [2003] NSWCCA 82. The Court observed:
	


“78. The Crown makes the point that while it is a fundamental common law right of an accused to have the Crown case presented in his presence and hearing, a fair trial involves fairness to the Crown as well as to the accused, see McKinney v R (1991) 171 CLR 468 at 488 and R v Lowe (1997) 98 A Crim R 300 at 318 - 319. It was essential that the two witnesses be able to present their evidence to the best of their ability and not in circumstances where they would be too intimidated to do so. The trial judge recognised the risk of unfairness to the appellant and carefully considered all matters of fact and law raised in the application.”


	
	The Court examined overseas and Australian authorities from [82]-[102] and noted at [103] that “the Act does not seek to be the exhaustive provision for the means of taking evidence in proceedings.” The Court concluded:
	


“106. In our view, his Honour was entitled to conclude, given that the fears of the Ls’ were genuinely held, that they would probably not give evidence if required to do so face to face with the appellant in the courtroom. Although sub-para (d) is a pre-condition to the exercise of the power, it involves a discretionary assessment. His Honour saw and heard the evidence on the voir dire and was in a much superior position to this Court to make the necessary assessment. The nature of the subject matter, whether the Ls’ genuinely held fears for their safety and that of their family would prevent or impede them from giving adequate evidence in court, is pre-eminently one for a trial judge and this court would not interfere unless the principles enunciated in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504 – 505 were breached. No such breach is apparent.

107. Accordingly, we may proceed to subpara (c), which is critical. There are some tensions between this clause and s 5B(3) but we think that they dissolve if the Court entertaining such a direction, on its own motion or on application, first considers whether the preconditions under s 5B(2) are satisfied. It is only if they are satisfied that the court visits s 5B(3).

108. Making a direction that the evidence of an accusing witness be received by audiovisual link external to the courtroom must, by its very nature, involve unfairness to an accused because it deprives him or her of a face-to-face confrontation with the witness. The provision cannot mean any unfairness, however small. The Court must consider the degree and effect of the unfairness. In a criminal trial, the best measure is whether the making of a direction will cause the trial to be an unfair one to the accused. An accused person has the fundamental right to a fair trial. A direction should not be made if it would mean that an accused could not have a fair trial.”

…

124. This means that we can now address the requirements of s 5B(3). Where a party opposes a direction being made, the court ‘must not make the direction unless the party making the application satisfies the court that it is in the interests of the administration of justice for the court to do so’. This places an onus on the prosecution, which made the subject application, to so satisfy the Court. The phrase, ‘in the interests of the administration of justice’ is a broad one and not susceptible to precise definition. The particular context of the use of the phrase will provide assistance as to its content. In the subject context it must include the impact on the parties and the trial of making or not making the direction. This involves assessing the impact on the fairness of the trial for the accused. It also involves the issue of the fairness to the witnesses and to the Crown. There may be many things which can be said to be relevant to the interests in the administration of justice. Some will be interests of the accused, some of a witness, some of the Crown and some of the general community or the public interest in a fair and efficient system of criminal justice. However, what appears to be required is a balancing of these interests.”


	
	Reference was also made in argument to R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 587. That case concerned the provisions in s 15YV of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) in s 15YV. That provision places the onus on the accused to satisfy the court that “it would be inconsistent with the interests of justice for the evidence to be given by video link”. The legislation governing the present application does not cast the onus on the accused. On the contrary, it is for the party seeking to use the AVL facility to satisfy the Court that it is in the interests of the administration of justice to make the direction.
	
	
	The Court is to consider the wide variety of matters that inform the concept of “the interests of the administration of justice” and fairness to each of the parties. As the Court pointed out in R v Ngo at [108] “making a direction that the evidence of an accusing witness be received by audio visual link external to the courtroom must, by its very nature, involve unfairness to an accused because it deprives him or her of a face-to-face confrontation with the witness”. On the other hand there would be unfairness to the prosecution, and the community it represents, if the witnesses were unable to give a proper account of themselves as a result of intimidation, fear and anxiety.
	
	
	R v Hawi & Ors was a notorious trial arising out of an affray and murder which occurred when two rival motorcycle gangs came into confrontation at the Sydney domestic airport. The Commissioner of Police sought orders for pseudonyms to be provided to 149 witnesses described as “innocent bystander witnesses”. The identity of the witnesses was to be hidden from the accused. The application was that “the true names of bystander witnesses are not to be produced in evidence or otherwise disclosed in the course of these proceedings”. In R v Hawi and Ors (No 2) [2011] NSWSC 1648, RA Hulme J held at [15] that the legal basis of the application was not limited to s 130 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) but “under the common law concerning public interest immunity”. His Honour made reference to the balancing exercise described by Spigelman CJ in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344 at [17] – [23]. The Chief Justice pointed out that “two such [fundamental] principles are in conflict and a judgment must be made as to which principle is to prevail in the circumstances”. I am guided by the helpful analysis contained in the judgment of RA Hulme AJ in Hawi (No 2) because, although it was concerned with a different application, the factual background giving rise to the application had much in common with the present case.
	
	
	The Commissioner’s application in Hawi (No 2) was based on the fact that the rival motorcycle clubs (the Comancheros and Hells Angels) were regarded by police to have been involved in acts of violence and intimidation including the use of weapons. There were examples in previous cases of witnesses “abruptly withdrawing their cooperation or failing to appear at court”. For present purposes it is unnecessary to go into the evidence given in that case, other than to note that “none of the witnesses were crucial” but that the body of evidence presented by the collection of civilian witnesses was crucial (see [108]). His Honour was not satisfied that there was any specific or known forensic disadvantage to the accused but accepted that there remained the possibility of some disadvantage which was not able to be identified. His Honour concluded that “the evidence presently available is insufficient to establish that the making of a pseudonym order is necessary to secure the administration of justice”. While there was a consistent theme in the material provided by the witnesses, that “is not sufficient to justify making an order that extends to every witness, regardless of whether they have said anything or not, and, if something has been said, regardless of precisely what is served.” His Honour refused the application, concluding at [117] that:
	


“[T]he public interest in the accused having a fair trial in accordance with open justice principles is not outweighed by the public interest in preserving the anonymity of all of the “innocent bystander witnesses. The evidence in support of the latter is insufficient to tip the scale favour.”


	
	Later in the trial, the application was renewed in respect of twenty of the “innocent bystander witnesses”: R v Hawi & Ors (No 9) [2011] NSWSC 1655. His Honour analysed the evidence and finally concluded that the application for pseudonym orders should be granted in respect of 5 of those 20 witnesses. There was an “additional element” in respect of those five witnesses and they were “particularly vulnerable because of circumstances personal to them” ([33]). The reasons for those conclusions were not disclosed as they were based on material in the confidential affidavit of the Deputy Commissioner.
	
	
	Hawi (No 9) demonstrates that it is necessary to consider the position of each of the individual witnesses rather than approaching the matter in a global way even though, in many respects, the evidence touching upon the application is common to each of the witnesses.
	
	
	In R v Darwiche & Ors [2006] NSWSC 926, Bell J (as her Honour then was) made orders pursuant to s 5B of the AVL Act in relation to two witnesses (“W” and “X”). The order was made following a heated exchange in court between W and the accused. The exchange was precipitated when the accused yelled “bullshit” and then made remarks “predominantly in Arabic”. X was called to give evidence but refused to be sworn. He expressed a fear for his life and fainted after he left the courtroom. He struck his head and an ambulance had to be called. It was the fact of the actual incident in the courtroom and the “anxiety attack” (my expression) that led her Honour to make the order.
	
	
	The other relevant matter arising from R v Darwiche and Others is the fact that the evidence in question was to be taken on the voir dire. As her Honour put it at [22]:
	


“There was no prejudice to the accused arising from the evidence being given by audio visual link at the voir dire. No question of assessing the credibility of the witnesses arose and there was no need to address considerations of any adverse inference being drawn by reason of the evidence being taken in this way.”


	
	Her Honour felt that “the risk of an outburst, such as the earlier one, was greater at a hearing in the absence of the jury than may be the case at a trial, where there is an incentive to the accused to exercise self-control”. Her Honour noted that the order did not infringe the rights of the accused to “confront one’s accuser in open court”. Her Honour concluded at [25]:
	


“I considered that Mr W and Mr X each held fears about giving evidence in the presence of the accused. I was mindful that their evidence was being taken on a voir dire and that they would be required to give evidence again at the trial. I considered the interests of justice included ameliorating the strain imposed upon each of them in being required to give evidence in these proceedings on more than one occasion.”


	
	Neither the learned Crown Prosecutor nor the Commissioner’s representative was able to point to any case where an AVL direction was made in the absence of any actual incident in the courtroom, clear evidence of potential for harm or where the witness had not indicated that they would not be prepared to give evidence unless via AVL or in circumstances where they were screened from the accused. In this regard, the caution expressed by Dunford J that the exercise of the power in criminal trials “must be carefully circumscribed” appears to have been followed.
	


the STATEMENTS of the witnesses


	
	I will refer to the witnesses by the letters attributed to them in the statements. As I have said, ten of the twelve witnesses made statements indicating a preference as to the manner in which they give evidence.
	
	
	Witnesses F and H did not provide statements. There is no direct evidence as to their preference and no direct evidence that they would have difficulties giving their evidence in the courtroom. The indirect evidence in the open affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Barrie is in the most general terms and does not refer to F and H specifically. The remaining witnesses, except for witness E, expressed a preference to give evidence by AVL. Witness E expressed a preference to give evidence behind a screen.
	


Criticisms of statements and witnesses


	
	Senior Counsel for Mr Kalal was critical of the way in which the statements were obtained. He noted that all of the statements were obtained in a two week period between 25 September 2015 and 7 October 2015 and that there was common terminology between the statements. In written submissions it was asserted that “the statements appear orchestrated by police intervention” and that there was “an obvious conflict of interest” in the police because they might see “the court processes as mechanism of vindication for their arrests and charges laid against accused persons”. It was put that the witnesses should have been provided with the services of “some independent agency – such as the Prison Legal Service.” It was submitted that the application was “fostered and developed by police, whether of their own motion or at the direction of the Crown is a matter of speculation.”
	
	
	I reject these submissions. There is nothing to support any impropriety on the part of the police or the prosecutor. The fact that the witnesses were approached by the police and informed of the AVL facility and other methods by which the evidence could be given is transparent and clear on the face of the statements. It seems that two of the witnesses chose not to provide statements. One expressed a different preference as to the manner by which he would give evidence. The witnesses expressed themselves in different ways and with varying degrees of reticence. None suggested that they would not give evidence if required to do so in the courtroom. Further, I can see no conflict in interest in the Commissioner bringing this application or in having his officers take statements from the witnesses relevant to this issue. The Commissioner has an interest, if not a duty, to protect these particular witnesses. He also has an interest in ensuring that ongoing and future investigations are not prejudiced by similar witnesses being discouraged to give statements.
	
	
	On the other hand, counsel has pointed me to the fact that each of the witnesses was criminally involved in serious offences and, on their own accounts, have engaged in serious acts of violence. Evidence was adduced of a recorded conversation that showed three of the witnesses (I, G and L) discussing giving false evidence and obtaining substantial reductions in their sentences. The evidence also showed that witness H had posted parts of the statements of witnesses A and D on Instagram. These matters, as well as the well-known issues surrounding evidence given by informers, mean that the evidence should be treated with a degree of caution.
	


The individual statements


	
	Witness A indicated a preference to give evidence by AVL and explained that he had been “exposed to numerous acts of violence at the hands of Farhad Qaumi and members who act on his behalf”. He acknowledged that he had taken part in some of those incidents himself. He expressed a concern that the accused “could bash me or kill me” and said that “I know that if I have to appear in court there will be police and sheriffs there to protect me that I would not feel safe being in the same room as them.” He went on to say that “unless you have been around the Qaumis and BFL you don’t understand how crazy they are” and that if they decided they wanted to “jump out and stab me they would”. He said that he would not feel comfortable that the police and sheriffs can keep an eye on all of the accused as well as members of the public who were described as “their friends, family and other gangsters there supporting them”. He expressed a concern based on things that he had heard that there was a contract out for him to be bashed or killed. He also expressed a concern of reprisals taking place outside of the courtroom.
	
	
	Witness A was concerned that if all of the accused were staring at him he “might get too nervous or scared to say what I know about them.” And “if I have to give evidence in front of them I will do my best but I will be doing it with the back of my mind telling me the whole time watch out for Farhad, watch out for people in the public area, watch out for the other BFL, guys that do whatever Qaumi tells them to do.” He said he would be worried about who is going to follow him home and said he would find it very hard to give evidence like that.
	
	
	Witness B described the accused Farhad Qaumi as unpredictable and spoke of incidents of violence and boasting about other incidents of violence. He is concerned that “Farhad and Witness M and the others will want to kill me or intimidate me into not giving evidence so that they can get off”. He said that if he had to give evidence in court he would be “petrified” and would be concerned that someone would follow him out of court. He said he has been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with ""post-traumatic stress disorder, severe anxiety, depression, Bi-Polar and sleep disorders"" as a result of his involvement in the Blacktown BFL and from making statements. He said: “I don’t know if I would be able to talk properly.” He said that he would be anxious and would feel less intimidated if he gave evidence by AVL. He said he wanted to give evidence without worrying about his safety and being intimidated.
	
	
	Witness C was also frightened of the intimidation and anxiety that he suffers and would suffer if he gave evidence. He said that “I am most probably prepared to give evidence in court but I don’t think this would be the best way possible.” He said it would be “hard to concentrate sitting in front of all the accused.”
	
	
	Witness D said he was “still wanting to give evidence in court but I am more than very worried about my safety.” He said if he gave evidence he will have anxiety, his blood will rise and he won’t be able to breathe. He said “I can’t think properly when I’m like that. I just think like people attacking me.” He was worried that the accused would hit him as he walked past the dock. Witness D was also worried about people from the Bankstown side of the BFL and noted that apart from Massoud (Zachariah), the Bankstown BFL members did not know him. If he was in court there was a risk that they would see more of him. He described troubles sleeping and said he had been given ""anti-depression pills"" by a doctor.
	
	
	Witness E expressed a preference for giving evidence behind some form of screen where no one “especially members of the public will see his face” if that happened he could concentrate on the questions people were asking him. Witness E said: “if I was walking down the street I don’t think they would recognise me now and I want to keep it that way. I am very worried that if I have to give evidence in person in court they will know what I look like and be able to come after me”.
	
	
	Witness G also spoke about the violence that he was aware that certain of the accused were capable of. He has been called a dog and a snitch and received messages that he should not give evidence or there would be consequences. He said “I am prepared to give evidence in court about the statements that I have made but I think when Farhad and the others see me give evidence and realise they are not getting out of gaol they will try to hurt or kill me”. He said he did not want to give evidence in court in front of Farhad Qaumi and the other BFL members. He said if he had to sit in court in front of Farhad and the others he would not be able to think clearly about his evidence. He would feel “much more comfortable and safer” if he was able to give evidence by AVL and this would enable him “to concentrate and give the best evidence I can”.
	
	
	Like the rest of the witnesses who made statements, witness I described acts of violence and his fear of the accused and in particular Farhad Qaumi. He had been told by Qaumi “Australia’s too small don’t think I can hide”. He was aware of an incident involving one of the other witnesses when threats were made during his sentencing proceedings. He expressed fears for his safety based on family members of Farhad Qaumi having access to guns. He said he would much rather give evidence by AVL because he would feel safer and calm and “will have my head in the right place to give better evidence that way.” He also indicated if there was any attempt by the accused to escape from the dock and attack him he “wouldn’t want to risk it and come again”.
	
	
	Witness J said that he has been diagnosed with “anxiety as a result of my time being involved with the BFL”. This has led to an autoimmune disease that makes his hair fall out. He said he grew up watching Farhad Qaumi hurt people. He holds a genuine belief that Farhad wants to kill him for making statements against him. He said “I am still willing to give evidence in court. If it comes down to having to actually attend court to give evidence I don’t know if I able to. I do get very nervous, very paranoid.” He also expressed a concerned that if he walked past the dock, the accused may attack him. For these reasons he expressed a preference to give evidence by AVL.
	
	
	Witness K also expressed similar fears based on his knowledge of the violent acts of Farhad Qaumi. He said “I truly fear that if I am to sit before Farhad Qaumi and his brothers that my fears will significantly impact upon my ability to give accurate evidence. I honestly believe that the physical and psychological impacts of being face-to-face with Farhad Qaumi and his brothers may cause me to pass out.” He said that the fears that he holds about giving evidence are such that it makes him feel “physically sick”.
	
	
	Witness L also said he would like to give evidence by AVL. He said:
	


“I don’t feel safe when I’m in court. The last time I was at court I was threatened both days. One day the brother of Antoun [the murder victim of count 30-31] said ‘I am going to kill you’ and on the other day a bikie in the gallery called Abuzar Sultani (I think he is in the Rebels) pointed his finger at me like a gun. Nothing happened to them when they did that.”


	
	L expressed a concern that there would be insufficient security in the courtroom to protect him noting that Farhad “will have 8 other guys in the dock with him” he said “if they all jumped out of the dock to get me there is no way the sheriffs and the police could stop them all”. Witness L indicated that he would do his best if required to give evidence in court but that he would be thinking about his safety and would not be able to concentrate in the way that he would if he gave evidence via AVL.
	
	
	Each of the witnesses, in various ways, described the extent of the violence to which they had been exposed while being involved with the accused and the Blacktown BFL. I have also considered the extensive material in the statements and interviews (Ex VD-B) which, if accepted, provides ample justification for the fears and trauma described by the witnesses. I note that while there are many inconsistencies in the detail of the evidence in the brief, the general thrust of the material with which I have been provided presents a generally consistent body of evidence establishing a culture of intimidation and violence.
	


THE OPEN AFFIDAVIT OF THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER


	
	Mr Barrie described in general terms the “regime of fear, intimidation and violence” and the influence (“absolute control”) that Fahad Qaumi exercised over other members of the Blacktown BFL. He drew a comparison between the structure of the group and “outlaw motor cycle gangs” and went on to give examples of such gangs accessing confidential information from government and police computers. I note that there is no evidence that the BFL have access to such information and no evidence of any attempt to obtain the personal information of any of the witnesses. However, I take into account the Deputy Commissioner’s stated concerns.
	
	
	The affidavit detailed the criminal histories of the accused (although I rejected the evidence concerning Mr Bishop). He referred to an incident in court when Farhad Qaumi was on trial for murder and yelled aggressively to a witness who was giving evidence. He referred to intelligence suggesting that the accused (and in particular Mumtaz and Farhad Qaumi) had contraband mobile telephones while in custody and were able to contact people outside of gaol. He referred to a conversation between a senior investigator and Mumtaz Qaumi which could be taken to imply that there was some threat to witnesses – it is alleged that Mumtaz said that he planned to delay the trial by sacking his legal team and that witnesses “would become unavailable”. Senior Counsel for Mumtaz said that this conversation was denied and there is no evidence before me that the accused sacked his lawyers and, since I took over case management of the trial, there has been no attempt to delay the proceedings.
	
	
	Mr Barrie referred to the considerable expense of the investigations and that if harm were to befall any of the witnesses the remaining witnesses would be unwilling to attend or assist further.
	
	
	The affidavit of Mr Barrie noted that at paragraph 46: –
	


“The witnesses believe that they have not been seen by the accused persons for a number of years. Their appearances have changed, in some circumstances considerably so. Exposing the witnesses to the accused persons and/or to the public gallery increases the risk to their safety by enabling the accused persons, and/or their associates who might be in or around the court to better identify the current appearances of the witnesses.”


	
	One of the difficulties I have with the evidence in that form is that it is unclear to me which of the witnesses’ appearances have changed and to what extent. One of the exhibits tendered by the accused shows that a photograph of witness L remains readily accessible on a media web-site. The events giving rise to the charges occurred in the middle of 2013 and the beginning of 2014. Accordingly, it would seem that the accused have seen the witnesses in the last 2 years. While I expect that their appearances have changed to a degree the evidence is insufficiently particular for me to make any meaningful assessment of the matter. Witness E said that he does not believe that the accused would recognise him and wants to keep it that way. The basis of his belief is not explained.
	
	
	Mr Barrie says that the “physical attendance of the witnesses at Court is considered to be a high-risk activity” and would involve a “complex and significant protection operation by Corrective Services and police, both in terms of source and cost”. He also refers to the costs to the Sheriff’s office in deploying officers around the court complex. He says that “Police have concerns regarding the available level of security at the Court complex” and that “it may be that the NSW Sheriff’s Office resources will be stretched.”
	
	
	I interpolate here that after the first day hearing of the Commissioner’s application, I received a telephone call from the NSW Sheriff in charge of court security. He had been approached by the police with a view to providing evidence on the matters referred in the last paragraph. He expressed a neutral view as to the application. I also note that at the commencement of the pre-trial hearing, I was approached by the Corrective Services Officer in charge of the security surrounding transporting the accused to and from Court and the custody arrangements while in the court complex. I was told that the dock can be cut off from the court by means of a large Perspex sliding window but I indicated my preference that this not occur unless the Corrective Services Staff considered it necessary. I was told that the Sheriff was taking legal advice and that the Department of Corrective Services and Sheriff’s office may bring or support the application. Neither has done so.
	
	
	The most significant part of the open affidavit concerns the role of Crown witnesses and their importance to the administration of justice. The affidavit says that:
	


“If it became known that Crown ‘informer’ witnesses were not afforded sufficient protection by the authorities and/or the courts, the willingness of such persons to come forward and give evidence for the Crown would diminish or cease. This would significantly prejudice the administration of criminal justice and therefore be contrary to the public interest.”


	
	I am extremely conscious of those considerations. I also fully expect that those charged with the responsibility of providing security for the Court and the witnesses, as well as those guarding the accused, will maintain the extremely high level of diligence that I have observed in the Police, Sheriff and Corrective Services Officers over many years. Those organisations can be justifiably proud of the fact that neither the Crown nor the Commissioner has produced any evidence to suggest that any incident has ever occurred that is capable of supporting a finding that the witnesses will be in actual physical danger coming into and out of the court room or while giving their evidence. I note that none of the witnesses will enter the court through the public areas and all will have an “escort” of some kind or another. None will come within the immediate physical presence of the accused. They will enter a door on the opposite side of a very large court room and give their evidence from a witness box just near that door.
	


CONSIDERATION

Audio Visual Link


	
	I accept that the accused have the motive to do the witnesses harm and indeed to kill them. They are charged with offences which, if proved, could result in a total sentence of life without parole. Based on the untested material that I have read, they also have the propensity to commit extreme acts of violence including murder. In spite of its inadequacy in some respects, I find that the telephone intercepts of conversations involving Mumtaz Qaumi show a willingness to arrange for the murder of informer witnesses. I also accept that the accused have the means to contact people on the outside, some of whom probably have access to guns.
	
	
	However, there is no direct (or indirect) evidence that the accused or their associates are aware of the current whereabouts of the witnesses or of any intelligence suggesting that these particular witnesses will be in danger if they attend court. Nor is there any evidence that the attendance of the witnesses at Court will give rise to such information becoming available. I am not satisfied that the attendance of the witnesses at Court will give rise to any actual physical danger to the witnesses.
	
	
	I accept the genuineness of the fears expressed by the witnesses but find that some of their stated concerns (such as being attacked with knives in the courtroom or struck as they pass by the dock) are extremely unlikely to be realised given the security that exists in Court. In that regard, I note that Corrective Services have arranged for extra staff to be in the dock and the Court room to ensure the security of the Court and to minimise the risk of an incident. I also note that the Corrective Services staff have my permission to close the Perspex screen if there is any suggestion of trouble.
	
	
	I accept that the witnesses have a preference to give evidence by AVL and that they are, in varying degrees, genuinely anxious about being confronted by the accused, and in particular it seems Farhad Qaumi. While I accept that they believe they would give a better account of themselves if they gave evidence by AVL (or behind a screen) whether that is actually the case is a matter of speculation.
	
	
	I have taken into account the fact that the evidence at this stage is to be received in the absence of the jury and that issues of demeanour are not as important as they will be in the trial proper.
	
	
	I have also considered the material in the closed affidavit of Deputy Commissioner Barrie.
	
	
	Except in the case of four witnesses, I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that the Crown and the Commissioner have established that “it is in the interests of the administration of justice” to direct that the evidence be given by AVL. The exceptions are witnesses A, B, J and K and, at this stage, the exceptions apply only to evidence expected to be given on the “Basha inquiry” or voir dire.
	
	
	In the case of witnesses A and K, I have concluded that it is in the interests of the administration of justice that each gives any evidence on the voir dire by way of audio visual link. The reasons for that conclusion arise from material in the closed affidavit of Mr Barrie and it is inappropriate that they be articulated further. The reasons would be obvious to the Commissioner and any appellate Court with access to the confidential material.
	
	
	In the case of witnesses B and J, I consider that the evidence of their anxiety and the potential psychological impact of appearing in court is far more compelling than in the case of the other witnesses. B says he has been diagnosed with a variety of illnesses including Bi-Polar disorder and PTSD. J says that he has consulted a psychologist and psychiatrist and has been diagnosed with some form of anxiety disorder. This has manifested itself physically (his hair falls out). These assertions should have been supported by medical evidence but for the purpose of the evidence to be given on the voir dire I am prepared to act on the statements. Apart from the assertion made by one barrister that the whole body of evidence was “orchestrated” (a submission that I have rejected), there has been no factual challenge to the evidence. J has expressed a concern that he may faint if in the presence of Fahad Qaumi and is not sure if he will be able to give evidence in his presence. B said ""I don't know if I would be able to even talk properly."" For those reasons, I am satisfied that it is in the interests of the administration of justice that witnesses B and J give any evidence on the voir dire by way of audio visual link.
	
	
	Accordingly, and at this stage only in respect of the pre-trial evidence, I will make a direction under s 5B of the AVL Act in respect of witnesses A, B, J and K.
	
	
	Otherwise, and in respect of all of the other witnesses, I decline to make the orders sought in prayer 1 of the Crown's notice of motion and prayer 10 of the Commissioner's notice of motion.
	
	
	I should indicate that if there is any incident in court or any attempt to intimidate the witnesses who are to give evidence in court, the question of witnesses appearing by AVL will be reconsidered and the Perspex screen in front of the dock may be closed for the duration of the trial. I should also indicate that if the issue is pressed with respect to the evidence to be given by witnesses A, B, J or K at the trial proper, clearer evidence and further submissions will be required. On the material presently before me, I am disinclined to make an AVL direction in relation to evidence to be given before the jury.
	


Screening or otherwise hiding the witnesses from the view of the accused


	
	The Commissioner submitted that the Court room should be set up with screens so that the accused persons could not see the witnesses. This was said to be necessary (or desirable) in order to minimise the risk of the accused persons becoming aware of the contemporary appearance of the witnesses and thereby acquiring information that would enable them to instigate reprisals. In the open affidavit, Mr Barrie said that the witnesses “have not been seen by the accused persons for a number of years” and indicated that “their appearance have changed, in some circumstances considerably so.” One of the witnesses (E) expressed the opinion that the accused would not recognise him.
	
	
	Because one of the accused is on bail and the evidence that the accused who are in custody are in contact with persons outside the gaol, the Commissioner submitted that if the accused see the witnesses in the courtroom, they will be able to pass on descriptions to those on the outside who might seek to do harm to the witnesses or attempt to influence them to change their evidence.
	
	
	It is only around two years since the accused last saw the witnesses. They were, to varying degrees, well known to one another and spent a deal of time together. This is particularly so in relation to the ten witnesses who were part of the Blackton BFL. I accept the submissions made on behalf of the accused that it is very unlikely that the accused would not be able to recognise the witnesses and, in the absence of clear and specific evidence relating to the individual witnesses, I am unable to accept that the appearance of the witnesses will have changed significantly in such a relatively short space of time. I also find it difficult to accept that seeing the witnesses now will assist in arranging for persons outside of prison to visit harm, or attempt to influence, the witnesses. Mr Hill (for the Commissioner) conceded that knowing what a witness looks like is not likely to assist in determining their whereabouts. Counsel for Mr Zarshoy put into evidence an article currently available on the internet (although subject to a pending application for a ""take down"" order by one of the other accused), which depicts the appearance of witness L.
	
	
	Balancing the relevant considerations, including the safety of the witnesses and the public interest in encouraging future witnesses to come forward, I am unable to see any significant utility in screening the accused. If such a procedure were adopted in the presence of a jury, it would be difficult if not impossible to cure the inevitable prejudice by direction. In the absence of much clearer evidence, I would be most disinclined to make such an order in the course of a jury trial. That being so, there is little if any utility in making a screening order during the pre-trial evidence.
	
	
	I decline to make the order in prayer 11 of the Commissioner's notice of motion.
	


Suppression and Non-publication orders


	
	As I have indicated, I accept that there should be suppression orders to protect the safety of the witnesses, to maintain the integrity of the process and to encourage other witnesses in future cases to come forward in the knowledge that their identity will be protected. Accordingly, I will make orders in accordance with prayer 5-9 of the Commissioner’s notice of motion.
	
	
	I will also continue the non-publication order concerning the evidence and submissions made on the voir dire. This order is necessary to protect the integrity of the process, noting that it is anticipated that (subject to any application for an order for a trial by judge alone) the trial will proceed by jury commencing in late February 2015.
	


Closing the Court


	
	Prayer 13 of the Commissioner's affidavit seeks that the court be closed for the duration of the evidence given by each of the witnesses. In considering this application, I start from the proposition that it is a fundamental part of our system of justice that the courts are open to the public other than in exceptional circumstances: see, for example John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; 61 NSWLR 344.   
	
	
	An order that particular evidence be heard in closed court must only be made if it is considered to be necessary in the public interest.
	
	
	There are three bases upon which it might be considered necessary to close the court during the witnesses' evidence. First, if the court is open, associates of the accused who do not otherwise know the appearance of the witnesses might be in a position to see them and, subsequently, identify them if an attempt is made to seek reprisal or to influence them. Secondly, people associated with the victims may also seek reprisal because the witnesses were involved in the commission of the subject crimes. In this regard, particular concern has been expressed by one or more of the witnesses that members of the Bankstown BFL (the victims of counts 11-19) might be in a position to identify the witnesses. Thirdly, one of the witnesses (L) was subject to intimidation from the public gallery during the course of his sentencing hearing. As the sentencing Judge of L, l am aware of the incident of which he complains: R v NK (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1257 at [109].
	
	
	Again, the Commissioner relies on the administration of justice both in relation to this particular case and in the broader sense discussed in Fairfax Digital v Ibrahim. In other words, failing to protect the witnesses in this case may discourage witness in future cases (or current ongoing investigations) from coming forward.
	
	
	In addressing the test of necessity, a difficulty in the present case is that the body of evidence comprised by the 12 informant witnesses makes up a substantial part of the narrative. If the Court is closed during their evidence, it will be difficult for the public to be made aware of the nature of the offences allegedly committed by the accused (and by the witnesses) or to understand the nature of the case that the Crown seeks to make against them. It may be that media organisations may seek to be heard in relation to the order generally or to argue that certain accredited journalists be excepted from the order.
	
	
	I am satisfied at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, where there is a non-publication order in existence in any event, that it is necessary and appropriate to close the court during the witnesses' evidence. However, I will seek further submissions if there is any application for the order to remain in existence during the trial proper. I will also ask that relevant media organisations be notified of any such application to provide them with an opportunity to be heard. At least two of the major media organisations are appearing on 19 November 2015 and I propose that they be advised of the content of this order.
	
	
	I will make the order sought in prayer 13 of the Commissioner's notice of motion but only for the purpose of the pre-trial hearing.
	


The names of the witnesses


	
	As I have said the idea that the trial might proceed without the accused knowing the identities of the witnesses was abandoned. However, prayer 4 ofthe Commissioner's notice of motion seeks orders that would result in them being referred to by what the Commissioner submitted were ""the names by which they were known to the accused at the time of the alleged offences.”
	
	
	I do not understand these orders to be opposed and for the same reasons that I will close the court and make suppression orders and on the basis of thematerial in the affidavits of Mr Barrie, I will make the orders sought in prayer 4.
	


ORDERS


	
	For those reasons, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Each of the persons known as witnesses 'A', 'B', 'J' and 'K' be permitted to give their evidence at the pre-trial hearing by audio visual link pursuant to the provisions of s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW).
	
	
	Otherwise, the applications for directions under s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW) are refused.
	
	
	For the purposes of these proceedings, including any other or further interlocutory applications conducted in connection with these proceedings, the proposed Crown witnesses who have given statements under the identifying pseudonym letters ""A"" to ""L"" inclusive (collectively ""the witnesses""), shall each be referred to by the name recorded hereunder beside each said pseudonym letter (""collectively the witnesses' names""):
	



	
	Witness A
	
	
	Witness B
	
	
	Witness C
	
	
	Witness D
	
	
	Witness E
	
	
	Witness F
	
	
	Witness G
	
	
	Witness H - Michael Odisho
	
	
	Witness I
	
	
	Witness J
	
	
	Witness K
	
	
	Witness L
	



	
	The interim suppression and non-publication orders made on 2 November 2015 are revoked and the following orders are made.
	
	
	Except for the purposes of issuing subpoenas, the names of the witnesses referred to in Order (3) be suppressed until further order of the Court pursuant to s 7 of the Court Suppression and Non-Publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW) (“the Act”), together with any evidence, submission, discussion, document or information that might facilitate the identification of the witnesses names, on the following grounds:
	



	
	the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice;
	
	
	the order is necessary to protect the safety of the witnesses;
	
	
	the order is necessary in the public interest.
	



	
	Except for the purposes of issuing subpoenas, publication of the witnesses' names be restricted until further order of the Court, pursuant to s 7 of the Act, to the respective pseudonym letters allocated to each witness in Order 3 (a) to (I) above, on the grounds set out in Order 5 (i) to (iii) above.
	
	
	Without limiting the generality of Orders 5 and 6 above, any description or depiction of the physical appearance or other identifying feature of any or all of the witnesses be suppressed until further order of the Court, pursuant to s 7 of the Act, except as might be necessary for the proper conduct of the proceedings, on the grounds set out in Order 5 (i) to (iii) above.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 7 of the Act, and until further order, there is to be no publication of the evidence, information given about the evidence or submissions made in the pre-trial hearing on the ground that the order is necessary to prevent prejudice to the proper administration of justice.
	
	
	Orders 5, 6, 7 and 8 above are to apply throughout the Commonwealth of Australia, pursuant to s 11 (2) of the Act.
	
	
	The Court is to be closed for the duration of the evidence given by each of the witnesses referred to in Order (3) in the pre-trial proceedings, such closure of the Court being subject to the following persons being permitted to be present in the Court while those witnesses give evidence:
	



	
	The legal representatives of the accused persons;
	
	
	The legal representatives of the Director of Public Prosecutions;
	
	
	Legal representatives for the Commissioner of Police;
	
	
	Staff of the Department of Corrective Services and Sheriff’s Office;
	
	
	Court staff; and
	
	
	Officers of the NSW Police Force involved in arrangements for the protection of the witnesses.

	On 27 July 2015 Mohammed Nasiri was arraigned along with seven other men and one woman on an indictment containing 36 counts. Because of the number of accused persons, I will simply refer to him by his surname. Nasiri was charged with three of the offences on the indictment. In counts 4 and 5 he was charged with offences arising out of an incident at Eagle Vale on 2 August 2013. Count four alleges that Nasiri, along with three other accused, committed an offence of break, enter and steal in circumstances of special aggravation namely being armed with a firearm. Count five alleges that “in the course of an organised criminal activity, did fire a firearm at a dwelling house with reckless disregard for the safety of another person.” I will refer to these as “the Eagle Vale offences”.
	
	
	The other offence with which Nasiri presently stands charged is count 36 which is in the following terms:
	


“Between 1 July 2013 and 8 January 2014, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did participate in a criminal group, knowing that it was a criminal group and knowing that his participation in that group contributes to the occurrence of any criminal activity.”


	
	I will refer to the charge in count 36 as “the second participation offence”. By Notice of Motion dated 20 October 2015, Nasiri seeks that proceedings on count 36 “be permanently stayed on the basis of autrefois convict”. In the alternative, he seeks the same order (a permanent stay of count 36) on “the basis of a plea in bar” or because the count “is an abuse of process”.
	
	
	Nasiri relies on the fact that he was convicted and sentenced in the District Court on 27 June 2014 in respect of the following offence (R v Akbari; R v Nasiri (District Court (NSW) Zahra J, 27 June 2014, unrep):
	


“That between 13 July 2013 and 27 August 2013 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did participate in a criminal group known as “Brothers for Life” knowing that it was a criminal group and knowing, or being reckless as to whether his participation in that group contributed to the occurrence of any criminal activity.”


	
	I will refer to this as the “first participation offence”. Nasiri submits that count 36 is “substantially the same offence” for which he has already been sentenced. He relies on the decision of the High Court in the cases of Li Wan Quai v Christie [1906] HCA 42; 3 CLR 1125 and Pearce v The Queen (1998) HCA 57; 194 CLR 610 and the tests stated in those cases. He also relies on the decision of Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Dodd (1991) 56 A Crim R 451. His counsel referred me to a number of other cases relevant to the plea in bar and autrefois convict.
	
	
	The Crown opposes the orders sought and put into evidence the transcript of proceedings before Judge Zhara on 5 June 2014 as well as the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision known as Akbari v R; Nasiri v R [2015] NSWCCA 240. The Crown “accepts the authorities relied on by the accused however submits the case does not fall within the type of cases considered in the authorities cited”. The Crown submits that the two offences are different because the particulars of participation in each charge are different. No authority was cited in support of this proposition.
	


CHRONOLOGY


	
	To understand the arguments advanced on each side, it is helpful to set out a short chronology of the events leading to the present trial.
	
	
	Between 13 July 2013 and 27 August 2013, Nasiri was involved with another man (Nasir Akbari) in an attempt to extort money from a man known as MM. I will refer to this as the “demand money offence”.
	
	
	On 2 August 2013 it is alleged that there was a shooting incident at Eagle Vale. This incident gives rise to counts 4 and 5 on the present indictment, that is the Eagle Vale offences.
	
	
	Nasiri was in custody from 20 September 2013. It appears that this related to a breach of parole and the Crown accepts that he was in custody from that date. The Crown also says that the second participation offence does not encompass any activity after that date even though the range of dates in the indictment extends to 8 January 2014. In respect of the “participation” relied on for count 36 the Crown Prosecutor indicated that the only acts relied on are those acts constituting the Eagle Vale offences. Other matters will be relied on to prove that the Brothers for Life are, in fact, a criminal group and to prove Nasiri’s knowledge that it is a criminal group.
	
	
	On 27 December 2013, a witness (currently referred to as “A”) provided a recorded interview to police concerning the Eagle Vale offences. He did not nominate Nasiri as one of the participants. I was told that other witnesses (“B” and “C”) implicated Nasiri in the Eagle Vale offences.
	
	
	On 21 March 2014, Nasiri was charged with the demand money offence and with the first participation offence.
	
	
	On 5 June 2014, sentence proceedings were held before Judge Zahra in relation to the demand money offence and the first participation offence.
	
	
	On 27 June 2014, Judge Zahra imposed an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). For the purpose of s 53A(2)(b), his Honour indicated a sentence of 12 months for the first participation offence. His Honour also indicated that the sentence would be (but for the imposition of an aggregate sentence) partially accumulated on the sentence for the demand money offence.
	
	
	On 24 October 2014, the accused was charged with the second participation offence. It was included (as sequence 3) on the original Court Attendance Notice created on 21 March 2014.
	
	
	On 27 July 2014, the accused was arraigned. While he entered a plea of not guilty to count 36, counsel notified me that there would be a plea in bar or a plea of autrefois convict and, if necessary, an application for a permanent stay of the proceedings against Nasiri on count 36.
	
	
	Written submissions were exchanged and filed and the matter was argued on Thursday 5 November 2015.
	


THE LAW OF AUTREFOIS CONVICT


	
	The plea in bar “is a rule against repeated prosecution for a single offence”: Pearce v The Queen at [26] (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ). While the rule has been loosely stated as being a rule against “double jeopardy” and one that can be invoked when the two offences are “substantially the same”, the focus of inquiry is whether the elements are the same: Pearce v The Queen at [20]-[21]. It protects against “two types of abuse, ‘multiple punishment’ for a single offence and ‘successive prosecution’ for the same offence”: Pearce v The Queen at [66] (Gummow J, referring to the protection in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution). While other remedies, such as a stay based on an abuse of process might also arise, the plea in bar is a “right … recognised by the common law as a protection of the subject against the executive and it should not be watered down”: R v Dodd at [57] (Gleeson CJ).
	
	
	The test has been stated in various ways. In Li Wan Quai v Christie, Griffith CJ said at 1131:
	


“In order that a previous conviction or discharge should be a bar, the charges must be substantially the same. The true test whether such a plea is sufficient bar in any particular case is whether the evidence necessary to support the second charge would have been sufficient to procure a legal conviction upon the first: See R v Drury, 18 LJ M.C. 189, and other cases cited in Archbold's Criminal Pleading (21st ed).”


	
	That test has been cited in a number of authorities: see, for example, R v Dodd at 455 (Gleeson CJ) and Island Maritime v Filipowski [2006] HCA 30; 226 CLR 328 at [49] (Gummow and Hayne JJ).
	
	
	The plea in bar is “not confined to cases of identical charges”: Island Maritime v Filipowski at [49]. For example, it has been successfully invoked where an accused charged with supplying drugs had previously pleaded guilty to possession of the same drugs: R v Dodd; cf R v Stone [2005] NSWCCA 34; 64 NSWLR 413. Similarly “if the prosecution chooses only to charge an accused with an indecent assault where the facts would support a charge of rape or unlawful carnal knowledge” he would, if convicted of the indecent assault, have available a plea in bar if subsequently charged with the more serious offence based on the same facts: Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21; 172 CLR 1 at 13. In Saraswati, Dawson J said that in such a case, the plea is:
	


“not strictly a plea of autrefois convict because he would not have been convicted of the offence in the form charged, but based upon ‘the well-established rule at common law that whenever a person has been convicted and punished for an offence by a Court of competent jurisdiction, transit in rem judicatam – that is, the conviction shall be a bar to all further proceedings for the same offence, and he shall not be punished again for the same matter; otherwise there might be two different punishments for the same offence’: Reg v Miles (1890) 24 Q.B.D. 425 at 431, per Hawkins J quoting from Blackburn J in Wemyss v Hopkins (1875) L.R. 10 Q.B 378 at 381.”


	
	In Pearce v The Queen, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at [20]-[21] that the test stated by Griffith CJ in Li Wan Quai v Christie:
	


“[a]t first sight this might suggest that it is appropriate to consider what witnesses would be called and what each of those witnesses could say about the events which gave rise to the charges. Closer examination reveals that the enquiry suggested is different; it is an enquiry about what evidence would be sufficient to procure a legal conviction. That invites attention to what must be proved to establish commission of each of the offences. That is, it invites attention to identifying the elements of the offences, not to identifying which witnesses might be called or what they could say. It is only if attention is directed to what evidence might be given, as opposed to what evidence was necessary, that the enquiry begins to slide away from its proper focus upon identity of offence to focus upon whether the charges arise out of the same transaction or course of events.

Further, when it is said that it is enough if the offences are ""substantially"" the same, this should not be understood as inviting departure from an analysis of, and comparison between, the elements of the two offences under consideration.”


	
	The plurality in Pearce v The Queen concluded at [28]:
	


“Inevitably, any test of the availability of the pleas in bar which considers the evidence to be given on the trial of the second prosecution except in aid of an enquiry about identity of elements of the offences charged would bring with it uncertainties of the kind identified by Scalia J. The stream of authorities in this country runs against adopting such a test and there is no reason to depart from the use of the test which looks to the elements of the offences concerned. Each of the offences with which the appellant was charged required proof of a fact which the other did not. It follows that no plea in bar could be upheld.”


	
	In Pearce v The Queen the two offences in question were maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent to inflict GBH and break, enter and commit a serious offence (infliction of GBH). The first charge required proof of specific intent, an element absent in the second charge. The second charge required proof of breaking and entering, an element absent in the first.
	
	
	It is well established that for the plea in bar to apply, the accused must truly have been “in jeopardy” on the first occasion. For example, if the first charge could not have succeeded by operation of the relevant statute (Island Maritime v Filipowski) or where a plea (to possession) was entered and sentence deferred and the more serious charge (supply) was subject to an ex officio indictment (R v Stone), the plea could not succeed. See also Richards v The Queen [1993] AC 217.
	
	
	There is no doubt in the present case that the accused was “in jeopardy” in the relevant sense. He was convicted and sentenced. The question here is whether the two participation offences, and the elements required to be established in each, are relevantly the same.
	


The “participation” charges


	
	Nasiri submits that the first and second participation offences are substantially the same charge and that the “proofs” required for the two charges are the same. Significant reliance was placed on what the High Court said in Pearce v The Queen in rebutting the Crown’s suggestion that I should look to the evidence of the particulars of each offence to determine whether they are the same.
	
	
	The prosecution says that the charges are not the same because the particulars relied upon in each case are different. It is submitted that Judge Zhara was only concerned with participation in the criminal group which encompassed the demand money offence whereas count 36 is, or will be, particularised as only encompassing the criminality in the Eagle Vale offences. That is to say, the participation in the criminal group upon which the Crown will rely in the present trial is comprised by the actions of Nasiri and others on 2 August 2013 at Eagle Vale. On the other hand, those matters were not before Judge Zahra and the transcript and judgment on sentence show that Nasiri was not punished for his participation in a criminal group arising from his involvement in the Eagle Vale offence. It is submitted by the Crown that these differences in particulars mean that these offences are not the same offence.
	
	
	Section 93T(1) provides:
	


“93T Participation in criminal groups

(1) A person who participates in a criminal group is guilty of an offence if the person:

(a) Knows, or ought reasonably to know, that it is a criminal group, and

(b) Knows, or ought reasonably to know, that his or her participation in that group contributes to the occurrence of any criminal activity.

Maximum penalty: Imprisonment for 5 years.”


	
	Section 93S defines “criminal group”. In both the first and second participation charge, the “criminal group” alleged by the Crown is an organisation known as the “Brothers For Life”.
	
	
	In his judgment in sentencing Nasiri (and in the proceedings on sentence), Judge Zahra was concerned to identify what was alleged in relation to the first participation offence. In an attempt to articulate the gravamen of the offence and to determine the basis upon which Nasiri was to be punished, his Honour considered the terms of the Second Reading Speech made when the provision was introduced into the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). His Honour then said:
	


“It would appear from the second reading speech that there is conduct represented in the offence of participate in a criminal group committed by the offenders which is not subsumed or represented in the conduct engaged in by the offenders in the commission of the offence of demand property in company with menaces.

The offence of participate in a criminal group includes actual knowledge or recklessness as to the fact that their actions, in participating in the criminal group, contribute to criminal activity of the criminal group 'Brothers For Life'.

The second reading speech notes the offence targets a range of activities and people who work with criminal organisations.

The difficulty in assessing the culpability of the offenders for their participation in the criminal group is in understanding the range of ""activity"" that the criminal group 'Brothers For Life' was involved in over and above the particular offending for which the offenders face sentence here.

No evidence is before me as to what ""activity"" the criminal group 'Brothers For Life' were engaged in. In assessing the criminal activity of the particular group, an issue arises as to how a sentencing judge informs himself or herself of the nature of the criminal group, here, as the charge reads ""...a criminal group known as ""Brothers for Life"""". The difficulties are heightened by the reference to the particular group the offenders were participating in during the proceedings on sentence as the ""Blacktown Chapter"" of the 'Brothers For Life' group - a concept that is not further explained.

The sentence to be imposed on the count of participate in a criminal group must reflect the additional criminality in the offenders participating in a criminal group knowing that it was a criminal group and knowing, or being reckless as to whether their participation in that group contributed to the occurrence of any criminal activity.

I propose to partially accumulate the sentences to be imposed, mindful of the principles of totality and ensuring that the sentences imposed comprehend the total criminality.

In the absence of any further material being provided to me since the proceedings on sentence, the assessment of the additional criminality represented in the offending the subject of the count of participate in a criminal group must proceed only on the basis of the agreed statement of facts.”

Determination of the plea in bar


	
	The Crown submits that the facts before the Sentencing Judge did not include reference to the Eagle Vale offences and that the “particulars” of the two offences are different. Accordingly, the offences are different and the elements of the offences are different. I am unable to accept this submission.
	
	
	The elements of the offence created by s 93T were identified by the Crown in its written submissions as follows:
	



	
	Participate in a group.
	
	
	The group was a criminal group as defined.
	
	
	Knowing it was a criminal group.
	
	
	Knowing or being reckless as to whether his participation in that group contributes to the occurrence of any criminal activity.
	



	
	The “additional criminality” to which Judge Zhara referred in sentencing for the first participation offence may not have encompassed the facts of the Eagle Vale offences, but it certainly encompassed the elements of the second participation offence. That is, the additional criminality was the participation in the criminal organisation and his knowledge or recklessness that his participation may “contribute to the occurrence of any criminal activity”.
	
	
	Put in the terms of Sir Samuel Griffith, as explained by the plurality in Pearce v The Queen, the evidence necessary to prove the elements of the second participation offence would have been sufficient to secure a legal conviction upon the first participation offence.
	
	
	In the absence of authority, the learned Crown Prosecutor argued by way of analogy. It was put that it is not uncommon that an offender might be charged with two sexual offences within the same time frame. Again, it was put that an offender might properly be charged with two assaults that occurred on the same day. In each of those examples, the form of the charge would be identical but there would be no plea in bar. The problem with those analogies is that, in each case, the two charges relate to different and distinct offences. Here, the charge is one of participation in a specified criminal group, the Brothers For Life. It is for that offence that Nasiri was sentenced by Judge Zahra.
	
	
	Obviously it would be possible for a person to be charged with participation in two different criminal groups at the same time. In such a case, there could be no suggestion that the offender could raise a plea in bar. The offences would be different. However, the fact that the prosecution seeks to particularise differently the nature of an offender’s participation in the same criminal group during more or less the same time period, does not mean that it is alleging two different offences. In passing, I note that the “participation” that will be particularised in the present trial is the involvement in the Eagle Vale offences. They occurred on 2 August 2013. That is within the date range (13 July 2013 and 27 August 2013) particularised in the first participation offence.
	
	
	The plea in bar is established.
	


FORM OF ORDER


	
	The Notice of Motion seeks an order for a permanent stay of the indictment. In R v Dodd, Gleeson CJ emphasised the difference between the raising of a plea in bar and a motion to quash an indictment or an application for a permanent stay of proceedings. His Honour said that the correct procedure on the raising of a plea in bar was set out in The King v Gamble [1947] VLR 491.Gamble was decided at a time when “the truth of any such plea must be tried by a jury” (at 493). Gavan-Duffy J indicated that the plea in bar should be determined first and if resolved unfavourably to the accused “go on with the general evidence” (at 493). Where there were co-accused, the plea in bar should be determined first and by a separate jury (at 494). The verdict entered in that case – essentially on the direction of the trial judge – was that the plea was “not sustained”. The legal reasons provided by the trial judge were held to be erroneous but the decision was not amenable to prohibition or certiorari and the decree nisi was discharged. Gavan-Duffy J did not criticise the form of the verdict.
	
	
	R v Dodd was decided in 1991. In 1999, the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) was amended so that the issue of autrefois convict “is to be determined by the court without the presence of the jury”: now see s 156(2). However, in R v Stone (decided in 2005) Hunt AJA said at [25] that “the appropriate course when raising either autrefois issue is to enter a plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict (which is dealt with as a matter of right) rather than to apply for a stay of the proceedings (which is discretionary)”. His Honour referred to the observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Dodd. 
	
	
	It may be that the correct procedure in the present case would have been for Nasiri to raise his plea in bar on arraignment rather than to plead not guilty and to proceed by way of Notice of Motion. However, no point was taken to suggest that I should not deal with the plea on its merits. In R v Stone, Hunt AJA said at [18]-[20] that the plea in bar could not be entered “if the plea of not guilty remained standing on the record”. His Honour referred to the observations in The King v Kent-Newbold [1939] HCA 37; 62 CLR 398 where a similar situation had developed. His Honour said at [20]:
	


“The double pleading point was not taken at the trial; if it had been taken, the matter could easily have been resolved. The same situation arose in The King v Kent-Newbold. In that case, Latham CJ expressed the view (at 406-407, 409-410) that, if the point had been taken at the trial, an application to withdraw the plea of not guilty to enable the plea in bar to be considered on its merits would have been successful provided that the plea was a good one. Such a course would ordinarily be followed by any judge where the point is taken at the trial.”


	
	To ensure compliance with what Hunt AJA referred to as “a well-established rule of criminal pleading”, on 9 November 2015 I granted leave to the accused to withdraw his plea of not guilty and arranged for him to be re-arraigned. The learned Crown Prosecutor very fairly took no objection to this course. Nasiri then entered a plea of “autrefois convict” which I took to encompass the more general plea in bar.
	
	
	The common law distinction between an application for a permanent stay and the raising of a plea in bar (or a plea of autrefois convict) was not affected by the abolition of trial by jury on the issue. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to order a permanent stay of the proceedings based on the accused raising the plea in bar or the plea of autrefois convict. Based on the form of order in R v Gamble, as approved by Gleeson CJ in R v Dodd, it seems that the appropriate order is that the plea in bar is “sustained” whereupon the accused will be discharged in respect of count 36. In R v Stone Hunt AJA referred to the plea in bar being upheld.
	


ABUSE OF PROCESS?


	
	The accused also seeks a permanent stay based on an abuse of process. The facts behind that application are fundamentally the same as those that ground the plea in bar. That is, the accused complains that it is an abuse of process to subject him to successive prosecutions for what is essentially the same offence.
	
	
	However, the abuse of process case also raises different considerations. These include the fact that the prosecution was in possession of the information relating to the Eagle Vale offences since December 2013 and elected not to include them in the facts relating to the first participation offence. There is also an issue arising from the Crown’s intention to lead tendency evidence to establish (amongst other things) Nasiri’s “participation in the criminal activities of a criminal group”. This will include (if permitted) the facts of the demand money offence and the fact that the accused pleaded guilty to the first participation offence.
	
	
	It is unnecessary to come to any conclusions as to whether these and other matters raised by counsel for the accused constitute an abuse of process or to determine whether there is any remedy other than the granting of a permanent stay of the proceedings on count 36. The plea in bar having been resolved favourably to the accused, the question of a permanent stay and the discretionary considerations relating to such a remedy do not arise. As Gleeson CJ said in R v Dodd at 457:
	


“There will be cases where the facts do not fall squarely within the principles that give rise to a plea in bar, and the accused must rely on wider discretionary considerations relating to oppression and abuse of process: cf Humphrys [1977] AC 1. However, this case is not materially different from other cases in which it has been held that the prosecution is barred, and I consider that the matter should be dealt with as one of right rather than as depending upon an exercise of discretion. The right is one recognised by the common law as a protection of the subject against the executive and it should not be watered down.”

ORDERS


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	The plea in bar raised by the accused Mohammed Nasiri in respect of count 36 is sustained.
	
	
	The accused Mohammed Nasiri is discharged with respect to count 36.

		23 November 2016",2015-11-08 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2954568,R v NK (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 1257,"Judgment


	
	At about 9:30 on the evening of 16 December 2013 Joseph Antoun was shot dead in his home in front of the woman he planned to marry and in close proximity to the couple’s twin 6 year old daughters. This tragic and despicable event was the execution of a contract which had been taken out on the life of Mr Antoun. The motivation of the person who took out the contract is not known to me but that person agreed to pay the sum of $200,000 to Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi who were, at the time, the leaders of a criminal group known as the Brothers for Life Blacktown Chapter (BFL Blacktown).
	
	
	Neither Farhad nor Mumtaz Qaumi were present at the time of the shooting. Rather, they arranged for one of the members of BFL Blacktown to carry out the execution. That member was the offender, NK. He was not to share in the profits of the contract and was threatened that if he did not perform the heinous task he and his partner’s young child would be killed.
	
	
	NK has now pleaded guilty to the murder of Mr Antoun and he stands before me to be sentenced for that crime. He is also to be sentenced for two other shooting incidents, one of which involved a home invasion and the other caused the wounding of two men. A fifth offence involved him knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug called N-(2-methoxylbenzl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine.
	
	
	In addition to the 5 offences to which he has pleaded guilty, NK also asks that I take into account a number of other offences in relation to which he admits his guilt. [1]  In relation to the first charge on the indictment, he asks that I take into account an offence of causing suffering to an animal, demanding property with menaces and using an unauthorised pistol. That first count is an allegation of breaking and entering a dwelling house in circumstances of special aggravation, that is being armed with a dangerous weapon. That is an offence contrary to s 113 (3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. In sentencing for that offence I will take the three other offences into account and will increase the weight that would otherwise be given to sentencing principles of specific deterrence and retribution. [2] 
	
	
	In respect of the fourth count on the indictment (which is the drug offence) NK asks that I take into account his admission to the commission of offences of possession of an unauthorised prohibited firearm, possession of an unauthorised pistol, possession of a restricted substance, possession of ammunition and participating in a criminal group. Once again, in sentencing for count 4, I take those other offences into account and, in doing so, increase the weight which I would otherwise give to specific deterrence and retribution. The drug offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment [3]  and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. [4] 
	
	
	Counts 2 and 3 are each charged under s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carry a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. [5] 
	
	
	By far the most serious offence, in an indictment alleging five very serious crimes, is the murder of Mr Antoun (count 5). It carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment [6]  and a standard non-parole period of 20 years. [7] 
	


The case viewed from various perspectives.


	
	Judges and lawyers like to say that particular cases represent “difficult sentencing exercises”. It is a much overused expression, although in most sentencing cases Judges are confronted with factors and principles that are apparently contradictory. However, the expression is particularly apt in the present case. As the evidence unfolded before me I was confronted with the tragedy that the case represents from every conceivable viewpoint. As I considered the submissions of counsel, I found that the sentencing principles that must be applied pulled in opposite directions. There are at least three perspectives from which one might view the sentencing exercise in the present case.
	
	
	From the perspective of the family of Joseph Antoun, it is difficult to imagine that any sentence that I impose (even life without parole) would satisfy their need or desire for a just and retributive response to a premeditated, callous and senseless act of violence. I have not lost sight of their suffering and the impact that the murder of Mr Antoun has had upon his family, friends and loved ones.
	
	
	From the perspective of the offender and those who care about him, it might be considered that his present predicament is the result of a life of tragedy, dislocation and alienation. This culminated in his membership of the Brothers for Life in circumstances where he seemed to have nowhere else to turn. He was then exposed, not for the first time in his life, to acts of violence which led to him involving himself in a series of serious criminal offences and being subject to threats and duress which led him to commit the murder of Mr Antoun. From that perspective, the sentencing exercise should be moderated with a significant degree of compassion and mercy.
	
	
	From the perspective of the average member of the community and the police officers charged with the responsibility of protecting them, there are matters which pull in two directions. On the one hand, the community is entitled to expect that those who involve themselves in the kinds of systematic and brutal crimes committed by the present offender should be met with extremely severe punishment. The community would be entitled to think that any other response would bring the system of justice into disrepute. On the other hand, the community is entitled to expect that the courts will act in a way that is designed to bring the activities of gangs such as the BFL Blacktown to an end. To achieve this, it is necessary to encourage offenders to take the courageous and dangerous step of assisting police in the investigation and prosecution of those involved in, and at the head of, such criminal organisations. There is a particularly stark example of that consideration present in NK’s case. There is a body of material which satisfies me that his interactions with the police have played a substantial role, and will continue to play a substantial role, in the shutting down of the criminal organisation known as the BFL Blacktown.
	


The offences


	
	The facts of the offences were set out in an agreed statement of facts tendered as part of the prosecution’s case on sentence. [8] 
	


Count 1


	
	Count 1 had its inception in an attempt by a witness (referred to as “E”) to sell a Range Rover motor car to the victim Christopher Muscat. The car belonged to E’s father. E told Mumtaz Quami that he wanted to sell the vehicle for $50,000. What followed appears to have been an attempt to rob Mr Muscat of that $50,000. Mumtaz Qaumi told E to tell Mr Muscat to have the money ready. There was then a meeting of the group during which Farhad Quami pointed an unloaded .38 calibre 5 shot Smith & Wesson pistol at E and pulled the trigger a number of times. He then gave orders to the offender and others to go to the home of Mr Muscat and “shoot him in the legs, get the money and tie him up”. The group went in two cars to Mr Muscat’s address. They entered the premises and a confrontation ensued. By that stage the offender was in possession of the (now loaded) pistol. [9]  In carrying out the threats and in the course of the confrontation, the offender discharged three shots from the weapon, one of which struck Mr Muscat’s dog. One of the other men involved attempted to stab Mr Muscat in the chest. Mr Muscat told the group of offenders that he had money buried in the backyard. When they allowed him to go outside to locate the money he ran from the scene and into nearby bushland. The offenders did not obtain any money but took a trail bike.
	
	
	When the group returned to the BFL clubhouse and explained what had happened, Farhad Qaumi became enraged at the failure of the plan. He shouted at E, blaming him for what had occurred. E was then assaulted by Mumtaz Qaumi who slapped him in the back of the head. Farhad Qaumi then directed other members of the group to hit E. He was assaulted by a number of men in turn. E was then told “well get me the car then” (being a reference to his father’s Range Roger). Farhad also pointed a weapon at E’s leg and threatened to shoot him. He told E that “I’ve killed people for less than this”.
	
	
	Attempts by the group to obtain the Range Rover were unsuccessful due to concerns that E’s father would call the police.
	


Count 1: assessment of objective seriousness


	
	By the time of the commission of this particular offence, the offender had been a member of the Brothers for Life for some period of time. The evidence establishes that the nature of the group changed when the Quami brothers took control. As a result, the offender was under the impression that he would be punished in some way if he failed to carry out the orders of Farhad Quami. That provides a degree of mitigation in an assessment of his objective criminality. However, at the time of the offence charged in count 1 (that is, 14 October 2013), I am unable to accept that there was any significant duress operating on the offender’s mind. He joined the group voluntarily and did not make any serious attempt to leave when its nature changed and the group was carrying out criminal activities.
	
	
	The offence is a very serious one, carrying a maximum penalty of twenty years. It was part of a pre-meditated plan to stand over the victim by means of violence in an attempt to obtain $50,000. The offence was carried out in the company of a number of men and involved the use of a loaded firearm. The gun was discharged in the course of the dispute. The offence was committed in the victim’s home and must have been a frightening experience for him. The offence was committed when the offender was on parole for a similar offence (robbery in company) committed in 2010.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account, the criminality in relation to count 1 is high. However, the definition of “circumstances of special aggravation” includes cases where an offender intentionally or recklessly wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon a victim. [10]  As a general, although not universal, rule those aggravating features are more serious than that which applies here. In the present case, perhaps fortuitously, the only injury was to the dog who mercifully survived. In spite of its obvious seriousness, and even taking into account the matters on the Form 1 and the breach of parole, the case falls well below the higher end of offences contemplated by the section.
	


Counts 2 and 3


	
	Counts 2 and 3 are offences involving the unlawful wounding of two men who were members or associates of the Brothers for Life Bankstown Chapter.
	
	
	There are a number of offences allegedly committed by various members of the BFL Blacktown which arose as a result of a “turf war” between the Blacktown and Bankstown chapters of the Brothers for Life. It is not necessary for me to go into great detail of the splintering of the Brothers for Life, or to analyse the inception of the conflict which arose between members of the group. It seems that there may have been a split between the chapters based on ethnic or national lines but the conflict was about money and the profits to be made by the commission of criminal offences such as drug trafficking. These organisations were not about culture, ethnicity or religion. They were certainly not about Islam. They were about greed. One way or another, the Qaumi brothers were concerned that the Bankstown chapter was coming after them and decided to strike first.
	
	
	As a result, Mahmoud Hamzy was shot and killed at his cousin’s home in Revesby Heights. A number of people have been charged with his murder and are due to stand trial later this year and early next year. In the same incident, Omar Ajaj was shot at least three times. He had two wounds to his leg and one to his abdomen.
	
	
	The statement of facts asserts that the plan was to execute Mohammed Hamzy. It appears that his cousin Mahmoud (who was killed) and Mr Ajaj were in the wrong place at the wrong time. On the facts presented, the offender might properly be convicted of the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy. However, those facts are derived from an interview with the offender in relation to which he was provided a certain inducement to speak. [11]  The inducement was that nothing he said would be used in evidence against him in a prosecution for homicide arising out of the incident at Revesby Heights. The prosecutor acknowledges that the offender cannot be sentenced on the basis that he is complicit in or guilty of the homicide of Mahmoud Hamzy. This gives rise to a particularly artificial exercise in approaching the facts upon which the offender is to be sentenced. [12] 
	
	
	After setting out the background to the dispute between the two chapters of the Brothers for Life, the agreed facts go on to outline events resulting in the unlawful wounding:
	
	
	“The shootings at 28 Bardo Circuit, Revesby Heights:
	


96. At about 11:30pm on 28 October 2013 Mahmoud HAMZY and Omar AJAJ visited their cousin Mohammed 'Hamoudie' HAMZY at his residence at 28 Bardo Circuit, Revesby Heights. They socialised inside the garage area of the residence with Mehmet YARAR Ahmed ALI, Ziad HIJAZI and Khaled SOUEID.

97. At about 12.30am on 29 October 2013, Witness M drove the white Nissan Tiida into Bardo Circuit. HIJAZI, SOUEID & ALI left number 28 in a white Kia Cerato near the same time. A CCTV camera located at the front of 46 Bardo Circuit captured the white Kia Cerato driving out of Bardo Circuit after leaving number 28. As the Kia Cerato rounded the corner at the bottom end of Bardo Circuit, they swerved to miss the white Nissan Tiida which was being driven up the 'one way' street in the wrong direction. That vehicle still contained Witness M, Jamil QAUMI, ZARSHOY and the offender.

98. The Nissan Tiida then waited near Mohammed 'Hamoudie' HAMZY's house at 28 Bardo Circuit. CCTV captured the Nissan Tiida stopping in a turning area at the front of number 46 before three people dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas, alighted from the vehicle and started walking up the street towards number 28. These three people were Jamil QAUMI, ZARSHOY and the offender. As they walked up Bardo Circuit, they were followed by the Nissan Tiida which was being driven with its lights off by Witness M.

99.Mohammed 'Hamoudie' HAMZY, Mahmoud HAMZY, Omar AJAJ and Mehmet YARAR were still socialising in the garage of number 28 at this time. Mahmoud HAMZY and Mohammed 'Hamoudie' HAMZY are similar in appearance and Mahmoud HAMZY was wearing a black baseball cap at that time.

100.When Jamil QAUMI, ZARSHOY and the offender reached the front of number 28, they ran into the garage and began firing their firearms. As they did this, Mohammed 'Hamoudie' HAMZY and Mehmet YARAR ran for a door leading into the house and they escaped unscathed.

101. Both Mahmoud HAMZY and Omar AJAJ both fell to the ground after being wounded by bullets.

102. Jamil QAUMI then approached Mahmoud HAMZY and fired at least one bullet into his head from close range.

103. Jamil QAUMI, the offender and ZARSHOY then ran back out to the white Nissan Tiida which was waiting at the front of the house. Jamil QAUMI got back into the front passenger seat, the offender got into the rear left hand seat and ZARSHOY into the rear right hand seat. Witness M then sped off in the vehicle. As the vehicle was driving off, ZARSHOY fired at least one further shot from the vehicle in the direction of the house as they left.

104. Witness M drove the white Nissan Tiida to the Penshurst Railway Station. As they were driving away, the group removed their gloves and balaclavas and placed them into a plastic bag and handed it to the offender. They wiped their fingerprints off the firearms and placed them in another bag that was given to Witness M. At the Penshurst Railway Station, Witness M stopped the vehicle and got out. As she walked off, Jamil QAUMI instructed the offender to follow her to see where she was going. The offender tried to do so, but lost sight of her. When he returned to where the white Nissan Tiida had been parked, it was gone.

105. The offender then walked into the train station and got onto the next train. He quickly discovered that this train was heading in the wrong direction. He was captured on CCTV at this location. He got off at the Hurstville Railway Station and received some assistance from a station staff member to catch a taxi to the Coolabah Hotel at Merrylands. The purpose of this journey was to meet up with Farhad and Mumtaz QAUMI, as they had indicated earlier that was where they would be.

106.When the offender arrived at the Coolabah Hotel, he spoke with Mohammed ATAI and was informed that Farhad and Mumtaz QAUMI had left. After unsuccessfully trying to locate them by borrowing ATAI's mobile telephone and making a phone call, he got back into the waiting taxi and went home.

107. During this period, Jamil QAUMI and ZARSHOY drove the white Nissan Tiida to the Jamieson Reserve at Penrith where they set fire it causing it to be completely destroyed.

108. Not long after arriving home, Farhad and Mumtaz QAUMI drove to the offender's home in a white Range Rover belonging to Farhad. The offender went outside and briefly advised them of what had occurred in Bardo Circuit.

109. All three males then left that location, meeting up with Witness M, Jamil QAUMI and ZARSHOY at the park in Auburn where they had met earlier. They then travelled back to Granville Park and ate McDonalds takeaways, while discussing what had occurred.

110. The offender was then dropped off at his house by Jamil QAUMI. He later burnt the bag containing the balaclavas and gloves, along with his own clothing and the clothing worn by Jamil QAUMI at the time of the incident.”

Counts 2 and 3: assessment of objective seriousness


	
	By the time that these offences were committed the offender had seen how E was treated when he failed in the attempt to rob Mr Muscat of the $50,000 on 14 October 2013. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that there was no real evidence of duress in relation to counts 2 and 3 because nothing happened in the aftermath of the failure to rob Mr Muscat of the $50,000. I am unable to accept that submission. E was assaulted by the Qaumis and also by a group of men on Farhad Qaumi’s instruction. He was also threatened with being shot in the leg, a threat which he took seriously enough to return to attempt to steal his father’s car. He was told - and it was generally known or accepted, including by the applicant - that Qaumi had “killed people for less than this”. In all of the circumstances I am satisfied that the offender was affected to a degree by the duress that he was under to take part in this crime. However, unlike count 5 to which I will presently refer, there was no direct threat made against him or his family. Duress is a factor in an assessment of counts 2 and 3, but it is not one which greatly mitigates the objective criminality of those counts.
	
	
	These offences were extremely serious. They involved a well planned and executed (if, to a degree, bungled) application of terror inflicted on a rival criminal gang. The motive was profit and greed. It was committed in the company of a group of like-minded people, who were armed and dangerous. The incident demonstrates a degree of lawlessness and violence against which the community is entitled to be protected. Like the other offences, it was committed when the offender was at liberty on parole.
	
	
	Because these offences carry a standard non-parole period, I should indicate that I consider the offences to fit comfortably within the mid-range of objective seriousness, if not a little above it. That is a difficult assessment to make in view of the actual injuries inflicted on Mr Hamzy and the position of the Crown that it “does not seek to rely on either constructive murder, or extended joint criminal enterprise”. [13]  It seems that the offender is to be sentenced on the basis that he discharged the firearm at the lower body of Mr Hamzy. [14] 
	
	
	Even though the matter falls in or above the mid-range of objective seriousness, I do not intend to impose the standard non-parole period. The standard non-parole period does not apply to a case in which an offender has pleaded guilty, although it remains a significant legal guidepost in a consideration of an appropriate sentence. Further, the personal circumstances of the offender, including the assistance he has provided, satisfies me that the standard non-parole period ought not to be imposed.
	


COUNT 4


	
	Count 4 involves the possession for the purpose of supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. The quantity involved was almost 2 kg whereas the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) stipulates a large commercial quantity of the particular drug to be just 2 grams. On that basis, the quantity is enormous – it is almost a thousand times the large commercial quantity. The drug in question has only recently been added to the schedule of the Drug Act and why the large commercial quantity is so low is unclear. [15]  However, I must proceed on the basis that the amount in question is extremely high relative to the amounts determined by Parliament to constitute a large commercial quantity.
	
	
	On the other hand, the drugs were not the property of the offender and there is no evidence that the offender was to share in the proceeds of the supply of drugs. In the present case, the offender’s role, and his knowledge of the quantity (and nature) of the drugs, is more significant in assessing the level of objective criminality than the quantity of drugs itself. [16]  There is no evidence that the offender knew the nature and quantity of drugs involved in this offence. [17]  The learned Crown Prosecutor accepted that the offender’s role in relation to this particular offence was very limited.
	
	
	Basically, it is alleged that Jamil Qaumi brought a suitcase to the offender’s home and placed it under the house. Later that day, the offender was present when the bag (which included both the drugs subject to the charge, firearms and other drugs) was transported.
	


Counts 4: assessment of objective seriousness


	
	While the quantity of drugs is very large compared with the remarkably low threshold for large commercial quantity, the offender’s role in this particular offence was extremely limited and he was not motivated by personal profit or greed. Having been involved in this criminal organisation, he had little choice at the time other than to obey instructions to hold onto the drugs and later to be present when they were transported. The large commercial quantity is an open ended scale; in other words, there is no upper limit for the amount of drugs that might constitute a large commercial quantity. [18] 
	
	
	However, in sentencing for this offence, it is also necessary to take into account the matters on the second Form 1. Those charges arise out of other items contained in the bag that was left with the accused as well as encompassing his involvement over many months with a criminal group. This drug offence was an example of the kind of serious crime that the offender and the group were engaged in over the time he was a member. The offender admitted to police that he knew that the bag contained drugs and guns. [19]  As I have said, the matters on the Form 1 increase the need for retribution and greater weight must be given to personal deterrence.
	
	
	The limited role of the offender, the absence of any direct profit motive and his lack of knowledge of the nature and quantity of the drugs lead me to conclude that, for the purpose of the application of the standard non-parole period, this offence falls well below the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


THE MURDER OF JOSEPH ANTOUN (COUNT 5)


	
	Farhad, and Mumtaz Quami accepted a contract in the amount of $200,000 to arrange for the murder of Joseph Antoun. They approached the offender at his home and told him that “his number had come up” and that they had a job for him to do. He was told that if he did not do the job they would come back and kill both him and his partner’s daughter. They provided him with a .38 calibre revolver.
	
	
	On 16 December 2013 arrangements were made for another member of the BFL Blacktown (a man called Witness C) to drive the offender to the home of Mr Antoun. They were instructed to pretend that they were visiting the premises to drop off a package. The offender was told to pretend that he was “Adam”, a known associate of the victim. When the pair first arrived outside the home the offender approached the house and returned to the vehicle saying that he did not think Mr Antoun was at home.
	
	
	However, 10 minutes later he returned to the house and the murder was committed. The offender was carrying a small service manual in his left hand which had been obtained from Witness C’s car. Mr Anotun’s partner (Teagan Mullins) called out “Who is it?” and the offender told her “It’s Adam; I’ve got a package for Joe”. Teagan Mullins got Joseph Antoun and he opened the door. The offender opened fire almost immediately. He discharged the gun 5 times in the direction of the deceased and, according to the agreed facts, “four shots struck him in the upper body”. Mr Antoun was killed almost instantly.
	
	
	I have heard from Teagan Mullins the devastating impact that this offence has had on her and her 6-year-old twin girls. I have heard from Mr Nemer Antoun about the loss and grief that he and his mother have suffered.
	
	
	The offender fled the scene and the next day was directed to hide the firearm. Sometime later the police located the gun in a car being driven by another man.
	
	
	The murder of Joseph Antoun represents criminality at or towards the highest level contemplated by the law. It involved an organised criminal enterprise whereby a person’s life was taken for no motive better than money. It involved the use of a handgun and took place in the victim’s own home. It was committed in the presence of the victim’s wife and in the proximity of his small children. [20]  It was a callous and brutal execution carried out with ruthless efficiency. The community is entitled to be protected from people capable of committing such crimes.
	
	
	The offender told police and gave evidence before me that he did not want to kill Mr Antoun. He also claimed that when he discharged the firearm, he did not intend to kill Mr Antoun. Both in his interviews with the police, and in evidence before me, he said that if he had wanted to kill Mr Antoun – and if he intended to kill him – he would have shot him in the head.
	
	
	The Crown prosecutor contends that NK should be sentenced on the basis that he formed an intention to kill. Mr Ozen says that he should be sentenced on the basis of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm and that his evidence would lead me to have a doubt as to whether he had an intention to kill. Although not universally true, cases of murder involving an intention to kill are generally considered to be more serious than those involving an intention to do grievous bodily harm. [21] 
	
	
	There are two different factual questions involved in this area of controversy and both are important to a proper assessment of the offender’s objective criminality. The first concerns the elements of murder and what NK’s intention was when he pulled the trigger. In relation to that question, the onus is on the prosecution to establish the intention to kill beyond a reasonable doubt. Having considered all alternative inferences consistent with some other intention, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time NK shot Mr Antoun he intended to kill him. In reaching this conclusion, I note that five shots were fired from very close range and that Mr Antoun suffered four bullet wounds to the upper body. I reject the offender’s evidence that he did not intend to kill Mr Antoun and that, if he had formed that intention, he would have shot Mr Antoun in the head.
	
	
	The second question arises from NK’s assertion that he did not “want” to kill Mr Antoun. This question is relevant to the issue of duress. Having heard the offender give evidence and having considered his interviews with the police, I am satisfied that he did not want to commit this crime. I am satisfied that he acted as he did as a result of the direct and serious threat to his own life and to that of the young child that he treated and raised as his own daughter.
	
	
	This finding on the balance of probabilities that the offender was acting under duress is an important factor in a comparative and relative assessment of the objective criminality in the present case.
	


Count 4: objective seriousness and whether the maximum penalty is appropriate


	
	The killing was premeditated and undertaken with an intention to kill. It was carried out in pursuit of a contract killing and was part of a planned and organised criminal enterprise. It involved the use of a weapon and executed in the victim’s own home while the offender was on parole. Those findings mean that the murder of Mr Antoun is a matter that falls at the high end of the factual scenarios that might constitute the offence of murder. In those circumstances the imposition of the maximum penalty (that is, life without parole) must be considered in the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. The imposition of such a sentence is governed by the provision in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW):
	


“Section 61 - Mandatory life sentences for certain offences

(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.”


	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor submitted that the maximum penalty is not appropriate in all of the circumstances of this case. First, he says that the degree of assistance to authorities is such that a significant reduction in what would otherwise be an appropriate penalty is necessary. The Crown also accepts that the degree of duress under which the crime was committed is a mitigating feature of such significance that the level of culpability is not “so extreme” that the only way to meet the community interest is by the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for life without parole.
	
	
	Ultimately, it is not for the Crown Prosecutor or the Director of Public Prosecutions to make that determination. The burden of that responsibility is cast upon the Court and in particular upon me as the sentencing Judge. However, I am satisfied that the Crown’s submission is well founded and I accept the concession that the maximum penalty should not be imposed in this case. Further, I accept the Crown’s submission that the starting point (that is, the sentence before the reduction for the plea of guilty and assistance to authorities) should be a determinate sentence.
	
	
	While I consider that the offence is well above the mid-range of objective seriousness, I do not consider that it falls at the top of the range. Mr Ozen referred me to the observations of Fullerton J in the case of R v Burnes. [22]  Her Honour was sentencing in a case where the offender carried out an execution style killing on behalf of a man (May) who was in the business of supplying heroin. Her Honour accepted that the offender simply accepted that May wanted the victim killed because he posed a threat to May’s heroin business. He accepted that May was justified in wanting the deceased killed and “agreed, without hesitation, to play the role of the killer”. [23]  Her Honour found an assertion that the offender was paid $40,000 to carry out the crime was most likely a means of aggrandizing his own importance. [24]  In assessing the objective criminality Fullerton J said: [25] 
	


“In light of the findings of fact that I have made, when viewed objectively, the murder is in my opinion just outside the worst category of case. It was a murder planned by one and executed by another in cold blood and in a milieu of drug dealing where financial motivations dominated. However, the fact that this offender killed at the request of and ultimately on the command of the person who had the primary motive to kill, operates to distinguish his criminality from that of his co-offender. That offender is in the worst category of case.”


	
	I agree with those remarks and accept that the present case falls below the “worst case”. When one considers the element of duress which is particularly significant in relation to this count, the offending falls well outside of the worst case when viewed objectively and dispassionately. That finding should not be interpreted to suggest that the offending is not extremely serious and approaching the top end of the range of offences encompassed by the crime of murder. The offence was committed on parole as part of a well-executed and chilling criminal plot which involved the taking of human life for profit. For the purpose of a consideration of the standard non-parole period, the offence falls above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	


THE SUFFERING OF THE FAMILY OF JOSEPH ANTOUN


	
	On the first day of the sentencing proceedings Teagan Mullins and Nemer Antoun read victim impact statements. Ms Mullins was the partner of the deceased and the mother of his children. Mr Nemer Antoun was his brother. The statements were read to the Court with great dignity and it took real courage for each of them to read the statements in the daunting and public setting of the courtroom. To say that it was a moving and emotional experience to listen to Ms Mullins and Mr Antoun speak about the impact of this crime on them and their families is to be guilty of a gross understatement.
	
	
	Ms Mullins explained the impact of Joe’s death upon her. She told me that her life and the life of her twin daughters changed forever on 16 December 2013. Joe was the love of her life, her soul mate and her best friend. The biggest part of his life was being the father to the couple’s two little girls. No matter how busy he was at work he always came home in the evening in order to say goodnight to his daughters. In turn, they always waited up for him. She told me:
	


“A 6-year-old should be thinking about Barbies and riding bikes, not thinking about her father being murdered and taken away from us. Joe will never stand at another school assembly to see our daughters get awards with pride in his eyes.”


	
	Instead, Ms Mullins stands at those assemblies by herself with tears in her eyes.
	
	
	Apart from the emotional impact, Joe’s death has left the family with significant financial burdens. He was the sole income earner and Ms Mullins can no longer take the twins somewhere special to treat them or buy them the kinds of shoes and clothes that they want. She has trouble hiding her pain from the children but she tries to live a normal life; she tries to dust herself off and show them strength but sometimes she just needs to cry until there is nothing left.
	
	
	Teagan Mullins also spoke about the horrendous experience of watching her partner get shot and holding him as he took his last breaths. She still has nightmares of the sound of guns; she wakes at night and thinks of places where she and the children could hide if their family home is attacked again. She shook like a leaf for hours after she heard an electrical box explode in the streets near her home. She is sad, she is angry and she is confused all at once. She is scared to leave the house alone.
	
	
	Joe and Teagan planned to marry the year after he was killed. It was to be a surprise wedding at the childrens’ christening and the twins were very excited at the prospect. All of that ended at the hands of the offender and his criminal associates on 16 December 2013.
	
	
	Joseph’s brother Nemer also read a moving statement. He confirmed that the most important thing in Joe’s life was Teagan and his two twin girls. The day that the twins were born was the turning point in Joe’s life. He was a great father - “his whole life was his girls”. Nemer Antoun also explained the impact that Joe’s murder has had on the rest of the family. Their mother, who was 85, lost her son and has not slept one night since the murder without crying and making an offer to God to bring him back, whatever the costs may be to her. He told a story which said a great deal about the victim of this homicide. The story arose when he spoke to an old homeless woman who recognised Joe’s business partner and was told what had happened to Joe. Her reaction was as follows:
	


“The lady started to cry, she came to me, hugged me and gave me her condolences. She asked how it happened and why. She asked if he left loved ones behind. Then she wiped her face and looked in my eye and said;

‘Whenever I would see Joe he would always greet me with a smile and a joke, he would always leave me some money and always treated me like a human being. My family has abandoned me but you brother respected me. I used to look forward to seeing him, he would make me promise to eat and I had to hang around to tell him a funny joke. I had no family but I had Joe and I lived to see him smile. I will miss my friend.’

She made the sign of the cross, said a prayer, gave me her blessing and walked away. This is Joe as I remember him.”


	
	Once again, I say thank you to Teagan and to Nemer for the courage that each of you displayed in reading your statements to the Court and for explaining your grief and the love that you had for Joseph. I know that nothing that I say today, and nothing that I do in sentencing the offender, will help you in dealing with your grief or make amends for the tragic loss that you and your family have suffered. I hope that time will heal the wounds and I hope that in time you come to have some peace.
	
	
	But the circumstances are such that your suffering will continue for a long time and you may never completely get over the loss that you have suffered. I wish that there was something that I could do, or that the Court could do, or that the system of justice could do that will bring Joseph back. But there isn’t.
	
	
	To the entire Antoun family, and particularly to those of his family and friends who have attended the sentencing hearing, I again thank you for the dignity with which you have held vigil over these proceedings. I repeat that nothing that I do today will seem sufficient punishment for you. How could it possibly seem to be enough when a loved one’s life was so ruthlessly taken away?
	


Section 28(4) of the Sentencing Act


	
	Section 28 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act 1999 (NSW) provides for the provision of victim impact statements and the method in which they are to be used by a sentencing court. Some parts of the provision are relatively new and have been discussed in a number of recent cases. [26]  Section 28(4) provides:
	


“(4) A victim impact statement given by a family victim may, on the application of the prosecutor and if the court considers it appropriate to do so, be considered and taken into account by a court in connection with the determination of the punishment for the offence on the basis that the harmful impact of the primary victim's death on the members of the primary victim's immediate family is an aspect of harm done to the community.”


	
	There was no application under s 28 (4) and so it is not necessary to consider whether the other preconditions of the sub-section are established.
	
	
	I want the family of Joseph Antoun to know that I am deeply aware of the pain and suffering and misery that has been caused by the conduct of the offender and his criminal associates and that in determining the appropriate sentence the law considers all human life to be precious.
	


THE PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF NK


	
	I turn to consider the personal circumstances of NK. I received a psychological report under the hand of Sam Borenstein, clinical psychologist, dated 20 August 2015 and the offender gave evidence over 2 days in the course of the sentencing hearing.
	
	
	I have already made it clear that I did not accept that part of NK’s evidence when he claimed that he did not intend to kill Mr Antoun at the moment when he fired the gun. However, for the most part, I accepted NK as an honest, forthright and sincere witness. While there are a number of inconsistencies between the offender’s account of his personal history and that provided in Mr Borenstein’s report, I accept that those inconsistencies are not the result of the offender providing inconsistent accounts but rather have arisen from the way the history was taken and the manner in which the evidence was adduced. In any event, the histories are largely consistent.
	
	
	NK was born in Afghanistan in July 1988. It was a time of great turmoil in that country. NK said that the family left because it was a “war-torn country” and that the family was “escaping the Taliban”. NK’s family was forced, or chose to flee Afghanistan. It emerged in evidence that NK is Tajik. The Taliban is predominantly Pashtun and, at various times, the Tajiks and other ethnic minorities have been subject to significant discrimination and oppression by the Taliban. While there was no specific evidence of this, it is likely that the offender’s family fled Afghanistan to avoid such oppression. In any event, that is not something that would have been known to NK who was only one year of age when the family fled to become refugees in Iran.
	
	
	In Iran, the family was subject to discrimination as a result of their nationality, ethnicity and religion. Iran is a predominantly Shi’ite (or Shia) country whereas NK’s family were Sunni Muslims. This created difficulties for the family. In addition, the family, and specifically the offender, was subject to discrimination based on racial or political grounds. Because the family did not have the necessary permits (“green cards”) they were subject to deportation back to Afghanistan at any time. This happened to Afghan friends of the offender’s family. This caused the offender to be fearful and mistrustful of police. The offender gave evidence of being assaulted and abused. People threw rocks through the windows of the family’s home. They were called “Sunni dogs” and “Afghan dogs”.
	
	
	Life in Iran was terrible for the offender and his family, although the offender used understated language (“it wasn’t an easy life there”). They were denied access to many services although, it seems, his father was able to obtain employment and they had some access to education and medical services provided to the community.
	
	
	In his younger years the offender was particularly close to his paternal grandmother. However, she passed away leaving the offender somewhat traumatised by her loss. Further, the offender was very close to a younger brother, Hamed. Hamed had a medical condition and went to hospital and was provided with an injection containing the wrong medication. As a result the younger brother died. The evidence suggested that the two family members to whom the offender was closest (his grandmother and his brother) both died when the offender was a teenager. I accept that this had a significant effect on the offender’s personal development.
	
	
	When the family was living in Iran, the offender also had a good relationship with one of his aunts. When he was around 16 years of age, the aunt, her sister and the offender’s paternal grandfather had the opportunity to move to Australia (presumably as refugees). They took that opportunity and the family arranged for the offender to go to Australia with them.
	
	
	So it was that at the age of around 16 years the offender arrived in Australia. He did not speak English and was enrolled in a school where he received intensive English lessons. While he was at school he was subject to bullying and racism from other students. He had a very limited number of friends. He managed to learn English and he gave evidence in a manner that suggests that he is a reasonably intelligent and resourceful man.
	
	
	His life at home was fraught with difficulties and ultimately with trauma. The aunt (or aunts) with whom he was living, and who had previously been very kind to him, changed when they arrived in Australia. When exposed to the freedom that Australian society provided, the aunt began (to adopt the language employed by Mr Borenstein) to “act out”. The result was that her 16-year-old nephew was left at home largely to fend for himself. He had no guidance from adult relatives. He was lonely and alone. He cooked his meals for himself. It seems he was given no real moral compass. There were arguments during which the offender was slapped and hit by his aunt.
	
	
	Things then got worse. At some stage, the aunt brought home with her a male companion. The offender gave evidence of being sexually assaulted by this man. It was obvious that the offender had real difficulty in relaying this incident in the public forum of the court. It also appeared, from my observations of the court room at the time and from the offender’s demeanour, that he was affected in giving his evidence by the presence in the public gallery of a number of men who seemed to wish him ill. In any event, the evidence that he gave on the subject of the sexual assault was convincing. I believed it as it was given and I accept it now. While it was not said explicitly, I infer that the offender was anally raped.
	
	
	The offender said that he became “angry at everyone” after this incident. He started to keep a knife under his pillow. He became involved in fights. When he tried to complain about the incident to his aunt, rather than taking his side and attempting to comfort her young nephew, she instead berated him, assaulted him and “kicked [him] out of the house”. At that stage, the offender felt that there was nowhere to which he could turn for help. His experience of police and authorities in Iran made him distrustful of people in authority. It seems that it did not occur to him to turn to the police for help. This was a recurring theme over the following years.
	
	
	The offender was kicked out of home. He was allowed to stay with the family of a friend. At one stage he attempted to return but his aunt turned him away. He was alone. It was in that context that he fell in with a group of young men who were committing crimes. There is nothing that can excuse the choices that the offender went on to make but the background that I have just recounted places those choices in a proper context.
	
	
	Over the next several years the offender committed a number of serious criminal offences and was sent to gaol three times.
	
	
	In 2006, he committed offences of robbery in company for which he was ultimately sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. In 2007 he committed offences of armed robbery for which he received sentences of 30 months and 2 years respectively. In 2010 he committed an offence of robbery in company for which he was sentenced (in 2012) to a sentence of 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of one year and 11 months. As I have said in assessing the objective criminality of the present offending, the offender was on parole for the last offence of robbery when he committed the series of offences which for which he stands to be sentenced today. That breach of parole is an aggravating feature of all of the offences.
	
	
	After his release from prison, the offender had a limited group of friends. Some of them had become involved in the organisation known as the Brothers for Life. His evidence is that at that time the group was not (to his knowledge) involved in criminal offending. I have some trouble accepting that proposition and it has been challenged to a degree by the Crown. However, I do accept that over time the seriousness of the offending in which group was involved escalated markedly.
	
	
	On 10 June 2015 the offender provided a detailed account of his involvement with the Brothers for Life in a lengthy recorded interview with police. That interview took place over many hours and consisted of in excess of 1600 questions and answers. The offender told police that when he joined the group initially he saw it as a kind of family or social group where mates could “have a laugh, kick back - that’s about it”. At that stage according to the offender’s interview there were no issues between the various chapters of the Brothers for Life. He was associated with a group based around Parramatta. At some stage a man called Basim Hamzy created (or took over) what became known as the Bankstown Chapter of the Brothers for Life. The membership of the Bankstown chapter was predominantly Lebanese. It was shortly after this that the Qaumi brothers became involved in the formation of what was to become the BFL Blacktown. The Blacktown Chapter was predominantly, although not exclusively, made up of Afghanis.
	
	
	It was at that stage that the offender joined the Blacktown group and also when the group started to commit criminal offences such as robbery, drug supply and drug “rip-offs”. The offender was exposed to significant violence perpetrated by members of the group, both on others within the group and on the victims of crimes that the group committed. There is significant detail of this within the lengthy interview of 10 June 2015 and in the Crown case statement relating to nine offenders who are later to stand trial.
	
	
	The offender says that he wanted to leave the group and made some attempts to do so but was told that:
	


“[I]t’s not a soccer field, youse can’t just come into the crew and just walk away like normal. He goes mate, everything has got consequences in life you know what I mean, he goes to me, don’t think boys for a second youse can just walk away, no one walks away without a bang. I said what do you mean without a bang? He goes, mate I want to shoot youse, he goes, simple as that. No one goes out of here without a bang, it’s not a soccer team youse come in off tomorrow or youse don’t want to do it … youse committed, youse committed … and youse can’t just walk away now.”


	
	The offender took the reference to “not leaving without a bang” to be a reference to somebody getting shot.
	
	
	An example of a member of the group being bashed was when the man called Witness C stopped answering his telephone when Farhad Qaumi was calling him. The group was directed or ordered to bash the man and ultimately his motor car was confiscated from him. Another example involved the shooting of a man near the Wentworthville swimming pool.
	
	
	The offender also told the police (and confirmed in evidence) that Farhad would speak about previous offences of violence, including murders, in which he was involved.
	
	
	I accept that by October 2013 the offender felt trapped and unable to leave the BFL Blacktown. He was alone and intimidated and felt that he had nowhere to turn. Because of his experiences in Iran, he did not feel that he could turn to the authorities for help. Over the next several months the offender committed the offences with which he is now charged.
	
	
	After his arrest, the offender was incarcerated at the Lithgow gaol. Rumours had circulated that he may be intending to provide some assistance to investigating police. Further, the gaol at which he was located also housed a group of people associated with the Bankstown chapter of the Brothers for Life. The Bankstown chapter had been subject to a number of acts of violence perpetrated by the Blacktown Chapter including the killing of Mahmoud Hamzy and the plot to kill Mohammed Hamzy.
	
	
	One day when he was in the exercise yard, the offender was called over to a group of people associated with the Blacktown Chapter [sic]. [27]  He was asked whether he was involved in the Hamzy murder but by the time he said “no” he was struck. He was then hit from behind and fell to the ground. A group of three men then started stomping him. The bashing left him unconscious and he was admitted to the gaol hospital where he remained for 3 days. I gather since that time he has been in some form of protective custody.
	


The relevance of this evidence to the sentencing discretion


	
	In comprehensive and extremely helpful written submissions, Mr Ozen submitted that the offender’s subjective case meant that “the offender is not a suitable vehicle for general deterrence, nor does this case exhibit hallmarks indicating a need for particular weight to be given to specific deterrence”. In response, the learned Crown Prosecutor submitted:
	


“General deterrence applies in this case. These are offences that can be described as offences of violence committed in the community. The question of general deterrence usually flows from the fact that the individual is compromised by some deficit or some intellectual, or lacking of intellectual capacity, or a youth where their capacity to consider the consequences of their act is compromised to the extent that it does not become an appropriate avenue for general deterrence.”


	
	The parties provided notes on the issue after the conclusion of the sentencing hearing. Mr Ozen submits that the reduced significance of general deterrence flows from the history of social deprivation and the consequent reduction in the offender’s moral culpability for the offence. He submits that while youth, intellectual disability and psychiatric illness are specific examples where it has been held that general deterrence should be afforded less (or in an extreme case, no) weight, the categories of cases to which this principle applies are not closed. He submits that it applies to a case where an offender has been raised in circumstances of great deprivation and has been exposed to violence and relies on cases such as Bugmy v The Queen [28]  and Kentwell v The Queen, [29]  as well as the judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal when those matters were remitted by the High Court. [30]  Mr Ozen also referred me to two cases in which I made comments in relation to the interaction of a history of social deprivation and the role of general deterrence in the sentencing exercise [31]  and to the sentencing remarks of Judge Yehia SC in R v Sharply. [32] 
	
	
	The Crown responded by submitting that “the evidence of deprivation/disadvantage does not operate to diminish the weight afforded general deterrence”. The Crown acknowledges that the evidence may mitigate the sentence if I find that it reduces the offender’s moral culpability. The Crown relies on the decisions that emphasise the importance of deterrence in cases involving home invasions, firearms, breach of parole, crimes of violence and serious drug offences. The Crown refers to the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Alexander [33]  where his Honour said:
	


“Except in well-defined circumstances such as youth and mental incapacity of the offender, public deterrence is generally regarded as the main purpose of punishment, and subjective considerations relating to the particular prisoner (however persuasive) are necessarily subsidiary to the duties of the courts to see that the sentence which is imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by those who may otherwise be tempted by the prospects that only light punishment will be imposed.”


	
	It is often the case that the extent to which an offender’s moral culpability is diminished by reference to matters personal to him (for example, intellectual disability or social deprivation) is closely related the discretionary judgment as to the weight to be afforded to general deterrence. [34]  However, while often closely connected factually, the issues are separate and involve different considerations. In assessing an offender’s moral culpability, one consideration is whether the relevant personal circumstance explains or is causally connected to the commission of the offence, whereas an offender may be an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence in spite of the absence of such a causal connection. [35]  Conversely, while an offender’s moral culpability might be diminished in a particular case, the circumstances of that case may be such that general deterrence maintains its significance.
	
	
	An example of the latter case is where the crimes are premeditated or part of a systematic criminal enterprise. In Munda v Western Australia it was said: [36]  
	


“It may be argued that general deterrence has little rational claim upon the sentencing discretion in relation to crimes which are not premeditated. That argument has special force where prolonged and widespread social disadvantage has produced communities so demoralised or alienated that it is unreasonable to expect the conduct of individuals within those communities to be controlled by rational calculation of the consequences of misconduct. In such cases it may be said that heavy sentences are likely to be of little utility in reducing the general incidence of crimes, especially crimes of passion.""


	
	That was the situation in R v Hines (No 3) where the offender’s sudden and unpremeditated recourse to violence in the face of provocation and abuse by the victim was explained by his history of social deprivation and exposure to violence as a child. Not only was his moral culpability reduced, it was accepted that that he was “not an ideal vehicle through whom to send messages of general deterrence”. Having made that remark, I noted the passage from Munda to which I have just referred.
	
	
	In many cases, there exists both a history of social deprivation and an intellectual disability. An example was R v Booth where the offender suffered an intellectual disability of a similar severity to that described in Muldrock v The Queen. [37]   There were also psychiatric factors at play in Bugmy v The Queen.
	
	
	In Kentwell (No 2) Rothman J said:
	


“92. Thus, a person, such as the appellant, who has suffered extreme social exclusion on account of his race, even from the family who had adopted him, is likely to engage in self-defeating behaviours and suffer the effects to which earlier reference has been made. This is how the appellant has been affected.

93. Circumstances such as that are akin to a systemic background of deprivation and are a background of a kind that may compromise the person’s capacity to mature and to learn from experience: Bugmy at [41] and [43]. As a consequence, this background of social exclusion will, on the studies to which detailed reference has been made in Lewis, explain an “offender’s recourse to violence…such that the offender’s moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced”: Bugmy at [44]”


	
	In the circumstances of the present case, the offender’s personal history of deprivation and alienation explains to a significant degree how he came to be involved in criminal activities and with the Brothers for Life. I readily come to that conclusion on the evidence and circumstances of the case. There is no need for expert opinion establishing that finding. It is a rational and logical conclusion to draw from the evidence before the Court. Having been dislocated, dispossessed and subject to discrimination in Afghanistan and Iran, he was then treated badly by his Aunt and sexually abused by one of her partners. Rather than comforting him, the aunt disbelieved him and turned him out of the house. He found himself with nowhere to turn. He had been marginalised and subject to racist taunts in Australia and one of his very few friends took him in. When that friend became associated with the Brothers for Life, so did the offender. When the group’s involvement in violent crime escalated, the offender’s early and adverse fear of police and authority figures explains his failure to turn to the police to try to escape. He remained alone in Australia with no adult relatives to turn to.
	
	
	Mr Borenstein says:
	


“[NK]’s background history indicates displacement and marginalisation. [NK]’s history confirms difficulties forming significant attachments. Having served two sentences in gaol, and upon release in 2013, [NK] was ripe to accept the invitation to join the BFL which represented an alternative family in which he felt valued and affirmed. Up to that time, [NK]’s life story was defined by alienation, marginalisation and isolation in Iran and later in Australia when rejected by his paternal grandfather and aunts. When invited to join the BFL he perceived it to be an alternative, caring, protective family at a time when [NK] had nowhere to go upon release from prison.”


	
	These matters reduce the offender’s moral culpability for the crimes for which he is to be sentenced.
	
	
	However, I am not persuaded that those same considerations lead to the conclusion that the offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. While the psychological testing demonstrates some areas of concern (depression, anxiety, impulsivity, social detachment etc) there is no evidence of any significant disorder and nothing to gainsay my assessment that the offender is a reasonably intelligent man. Further, the offences for which he is to be sentenced were not impulsive, spontaneous or crimes of passion. They were well organised and premeditated offences committed by a lawless organisation determined to gain ascendancy in the criminal underworld. Those involved in such organisations who participate in crimes as serious as these must know that their actions will be met with severe punishment. Any other approach would fail to fulfil the purposes of punishment, would be contrary to relevant principles of sentencing and would neglect the need to protect the community.
	
	
	I do accept Mr Ozen’s submission that the categories of factors in relation to which the weight of general deterrence is diminished is not closed and is not limited to cases of young offenders and those with intellectual or psychiatric disabilities. This is consistent with the use of the phrase “such as” in the passage from R v Alexander upon which the prosecution relies. In many cases of significant social deprivation, the circumstances will lead a sentencing court to conclude that the role of general deterrence is reduced. However, each case must turn on the particular factual circumstances of the case. The present case is one that requires deterrence, denunciation and retribution to play significant roles in the sentencing exercise.
	


ASSISTANCE TO AUTHORITIES


	
	The most significant feature of the offender’s subjective case concerns his assistance to the authorities. Initially, based on the written submissions of counsel for either side, it appeared that the parties were in significant dispute as to the significance of this factor and how it would impact on the sentence to be imposed. However, in the course of argument it became clear that in terms of the total discount to which the offender is entitled, the parties were not very far apart. However, the Crown Prosecutor maintained a submission that the assistance provided to the authorities to this point (i.e. past or actual assistance) “is not such that it would support anything other than a small reduction in the sentence to be imposed.”
	
	
	In the course of argument the Crown Prosecutor drew my attention to the fact that the driver of the vehicle involved in the murder of Mr Antoun (Witness C) was sentenced in the District Court and provided with a discount of 55% for his plea and assistance. This discount encompassed a discount of 25% for his plea of guilty, 15% for past assistance and 15% for future. The precise details of Witness C’s assistance are not known to me and the remarks on sentence are not yet available. However, the learned Crown Prosecutor fairly acknowledged that “the value and nature and extent of the assistance and undertaking [provided by the present offender] exceeded that of Witness C.”
	
	
	In its written submissions the prosecution referred to the case of SZ v R as authority for the proposition that “a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for exceptional cases”. [38]  While Buddin J made that observation (at [53]), his Honour also (at [52]) acknowledged that there will be cases in which a combined or composite discount of more than 50% is called for. His Honour noted that “composite discounts in excess 50% have been allowed on several occasions when this court has proceeded to re-sentence following a successful appeal by an offender” and referred to the cases of R v NP, R v OPA [39]  and R v AMT. [40]  A discount of 60% was provided on appeal by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Allsop P, Davies J and Schmidt J) in OS1 v R. [41]  That case had a number of similarities with the present case, including the nature of the applicant’s incarceration, the danger that he was in as a result of the provision of assistance and the extent of assistance that he had provided. In OS1 the Court divided the total discount into 25% for the early plea, 15% for past assistance and 20% for future assistance.
	
	
	Mr Ozen submitted correctly that I am not bound by the numerical discounts which have been provided in past cases. I accept that submission. Ultimately the restraint that must be shown in reducing a sentence for assistance is based in the statute. Section 23 (3) provides:
	


“A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.”


	
	There is no doubt that if a sentence is reduced by as much as 50% or 60% the resulting sentence will be disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. The statute allows a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is disproportionate but prohibits a sentence which is unreasonably disproportionate. [42] 
	
	
	In the present case both the offender and one of the lead detectives in the case gave evidence in closed court in relation to the nature of the offender’s assistance. Further, I received a confidential affidavit from the officer in charge, [43]  as well as six recorded interviews in which the offender outlined details of the information that he has provided to police and in relation to which he has undertaken to give evidence. [44]  The offender is also to be interviewed in relation to a number of other incidents and offences which are already subject to legal proceedings against the group of nine alleged offenders who are due to be tried later this year and early next year.
	
	
	The Crown informed me that the nine accused in the trial are already aware of the details of some, if not most, of the evidence that the offender will give or proposes to give at their trial. However, it remains appropriate to exercise a degree of caution in articulating precisely the nature of the offender’s assistance and the material in the confidential exhibits.
	
	
	What I can say is that the assistance is very close to the highest level of assistance that a person could possibly provide in a case such as the present. Perhaps the only form of assistance that might be seen as more valuable and dangerous would be where an informant wore a listening device into a meeting with a group of dangerous criminals. However, even allowing for such a case, I am firmly convinced by the material that I have read that the offender’s assistance has been, to date, of an extremely high order. This accords with what the detective has said and is confirmed by the lengthy interviews provided by the offender.
	
	
	Another relevant factor is that the offender disclosed his involvement in the offences in counts 2 and 3 at a time when police were unaware or merely suspicious of his involvement. [45] 
	
	
	The evidence establishes that the offender and his family are in grave danger as a result of his assistance. Even in the course of giving evidence at the hearing, and in the presence of a number sheriff’s officers, police and corrective service officers, somebody in the public gallery yelled out “you are going to die dog”. [46] 
	
	
	While most of the members of the BFL Blacktown against whom the offender is to give evidence had been arrested for various offences prior to the offender giving assistance, it is inescapable but to conclude that the fact of his assistance has made their continuing incarceration whilst on remand almost inevitable. The result is that the BFL Blacktown no longer poses a threat to the community. This conclusion accords with the statement of assistance in confidential exhibit B. In those circumstances, I am unable to accept the Crown Prosecutor’s submission that the past assistance in the present case is worthy of little more than “a small reduction in the sentence to be imposed”. With great respect to that submission, I was reminded of the observation made by Hunt and Badgery-Parker JJ in R v Cartwright [47]  when their Honours said:
	


“Although there is no onus upon the Crown as asserted by the applicant in

the present case, there is nevertheless a clear obligation placed upon the

Crown to lend every assistance to the prisoner in establishing that material.

Having received the benefit of the information provided by the prisoner, the

public interest demands that the prisoner's reward should not be blocked by

pettifogging opposition — as seems to have occurred to some extent in the

present case, in which the Crown Prosecutor apparently saw his main task

as being to cut down as far as possible the effect of the police officers'

evidence given in favour of the applicant.”


	
	That is not what has occurred here. The Crown Prosecutor has placed all relevant material before the court. However, I am unable to understand the basis upon which it can properly be asserted by the prosecuting authority that the past or actual assistance provided by NK is worthy of no more than a “small reduction” in his sentence.
	
	
	The exercise of discretion under s 23 is guided by the mandatory (but non-exhaustive) criteria contained in s 23(2) of the Sentencing Act. I have considered those factors and outline my findings by reference to the section’s paragraph numbers:
	
	
	The offender’s assistance is significant and useful. In reaching that conclusion I have taken into account the thoughtful evaluation provided in Detective Browne’s affidavit.
	


The assistance provided seems to be complete and appears to be truthful and reliable. However, I should note that the truthfulness and reliability of the evidence is yet to be tested as it will be in the forthcoming trial proceedings.

The nature and extent of the offender’s assistance and promised assistance is substantial.

While the assistance was not offered immediately upon the offender’s arrest, and came after Witness C had provided assistance (a matter upon which the offender asserts that he was not aware), the assistance came relatively early in the criminal process and I consider it to be timely.

The offender has not gained any other benefit as a result of the assistance that he has provided or has promised to provide.

The offender has suffered and is likely to continue to suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of the assistance that he has provided.

The offender and his family are at serious risk of danger. This may continue for the rest of the offender’s life. The threat is taken so seriously that the offender’s partner and child have been relocated and provided with assumed identities to protect them from the possibility or likelihood of reprisal.

The assistance is concerned both with the offences for which the offender is to be sentenced as well as a number of other offences.


	
	Taking all of the relevant considerations into account, this offender is entitled to a reduction in his sentence at the very top of the range contemplated in other cases and lawfully available to him. The only limit on the reduction is that the ultimate sentence must not constitute “an affront to community standards”. [48]  To put that constraint correctly and in accordance with the terms of the statute, I am unable to impose a sentence which is “unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and seriousness of the offences”. But for the provision in sub-s (3), I would have been inclined to provide the offender with a total discount in the vicinity of 65-70% per cent. That would have comprised a discount of 25% for his early plea 15% for past assistance and 25-30% for future assistance. However, reducing the total effective sentence by such an amount would result in a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the grave criminality for which the offender is to be sentenced.
	
	
	Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that a total discount of 60% is appropriate. In accordance with s 23(4) I indicate that the discount is made up of a discount of 25% for the early plea of guilty, 15% for past assistance and 20% for future assistance.
	


GENERAL SENtENCING PRINCIPLES


	
	In determing the appropriate sentence, I have taken into account the purposes of punishment set out in section 3A of the Sentencing Act as well as the established principles of sentencing at common law. The offender must be adequately punished and made accountable for his actions and his conduct must be denounced. The sentence must protect the community from the offender and attempt to prevent crime by deterring him and others from committing similar offences. I must do more than pay lip service to these concepts. The penalty actually imposed must reflect those purposes.
	
	
	At the same time, insofar as it is possible in imposing such a long sentence as this one must be, I must attempt to promote the rehabiliation of the offender, especially in circumstances where he has committed to assist the authorities. The discount I have provided him must serve to encourage others in his postion to demonstrate the kind of courage that this offender has displayed.
	
	
	I have paid careful attention to the maxium penalty in realtion to each offence [49]  and have considered the standard non-parole periods that apply to counts 2-5 in accordance with the principles enunciated by the High Court. [50]  I have synthesised all of the relevant considerations in determining what is an appropriate punishment for these extremely serious offences whilst also taking into account the compelling and unique circumstances of this individual offender.
	
	
	I have considered and applied the provisions in s 21A of the Sentencing Act and have taken into account the applicable aggravating and mitigating features. I have not, and will not, catalogue those but have made reference to a number of matters in the course of my outline of the facts and assessment of the objective criminality involved in the individual offences. I have been careful not to take into account aggravating features that are inherent features or elements of the offences.
	


particular findings relevant to section 21A.


	
	While I will not treat sub-ss 21A(2) and (3) as “some sort of check-list, [51]  I should indicate my findings in relation to particular matters where controversy might attend my remarks.
	
	
	Based on his evidence and actions I am satisfied that the offender is remorseful for his actions. He has accepted responsibility and his actions in assisting the authorities suggest that he is doing what he can to make amends. In relation to count 5, the offender has acknowledged the injury, loss and damage caused by his actions. He has done this in giving evidence and in the moving letter he wrote to Mr Antoun’s family. In relation to that count, the provisions of s 21A(3)(i) are satisfied. The evidence is less convincing in relation to the other counts. The offender has not acknowledged the “injury, loss or damage” caused to the victims of counts 1, 2 and 3 or the general danger of the distribution of drugs in relation to count 4. I will treat remorse as a mitigating factor under s 21A(3) in relation to count 5 only.
	
	
	As to his criminal history and the interaction of sub-ss 21A(2)(d) and 21A(3)(e), I accept the joint position of the parties that the criminal history disentitles the offender to leniency. However, it does not aggravate a proper assessment of the objective criminality of the offences and I am unable to form any adverse conclusion as to the offender’s future dangerousness. That will be a matter for the parole authorities to consider many years down the track.
	
	
	While I am guarded as to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, and cannot find a mitigating feature under s 21A(3)(g) or (h), I am optimistic as a result of the degree of his contrition and his decision to assist the authorities.
	
	
	While all of the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity, I have not treated that as an aggravating feature under s 21A(2)(n). I was inclined to do so but the learned Crown Prosecutor very fairly pointed out that one of the matters on the second Form 1 is an offence of participating in a criminal group. By increasing the weight to be given to personal deterrence and retribution in relation to count 4, I will indicate a sentence that is longer than would otherwise be the case in relation to that count by reference to the offender’s admission of the offence of participating in a criminal group.
	
	
	In relation to counts 1 and 5, it is an aggravating feature that the offences were in the victims’ homes. While I have taken into account the presence of the children in the home in assessing the objective facts, I am unable to find that the offence was literally committed in their presence. [52] 
	
	
	Otherwise, I trust that these remarks are sufficiently transparent to indicate the aggravating and mitigating features that exist in relation to the various counts.
	


comparitive cases and statistics


	
	Little guidance can be gained from the outcomes in other cases. The parties seemed to acknowledge this as neither counsel took me to any comparative cases or statistics in relation to counts 1-4. Mr Ozen referred to a few cases that may have some bearing on the appropriate sentence in relation to count 5. [53]  I have read and considered the outcomes in those cases and noted some relevant differences. I have also considered the sentencing outcomes in other cases. Having done so, I am satisfied that the starting point that I instinctively consider to be appropriate in relation to count 5 does not offend the principles of equal justice and the Court’s objective to impose consistent penalties in similar cases.
	


AGGREGATE SENTENCE


	
	The parties agree that it is appropriate to impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Act. The correct application of that section has been considered in a number of cases. [54] 
	
	
	In Cahill v R and Glare v R, the requirement in s 53A(2)(b) was considered. It is necessary to indicate the individual sentences that would have been imposed “after taking into account such matters as are relevant under part 3 or any other provision of this Act”. This means that I must indicate the sentences that would have been imposed after taking into account the aggravating and mitigating features under s 21A (including the breach of parole and the duress), the other relevant principles of sentencing and after application of the 60% discount for the plea of guilty and assistance.
	
	
	Section 44(2C) of the Sentencing Act provides that it is not necessary to indicate the individual non-parole periods that would have been imposed had an aggregate sentence not been imposed. [55]  However, in those counts to which a standard non-parole period applies, s 54B(4) requires me to indicate the non-parole period that I would have set. In the present case, section 54B(4) applies to all counts except count 1.
	


Accumulation, concurrence and totality


	
	With the exception of counts 2 and 3, each of the offences arose at different times and in different circumstances. While counts 2 and 3 arose during the same incident, there were two different victims, each of whom suffered substantial injury as a result of the wanton and lawless conduct of the offender and his criminal associates. Accordingly, if an aggregate sentence were not imposed, there would necessarily be a substantial degree of accumulation between the sentences imposed in relation to each of the offences.
	
	
	On the other hand, all of the offences occurred in the context of the activities of the BFL Blacktown over a three month period and might be seen to be part of a connected series of events. Further, to accumulate the sentences to too great a degree may result in a sentence that is crushing and one that offends the principles of totality and proportionality. Had an aggregate sentence not been imposed, the sentences would have been partially concurrent.
	
	
	Because I am imposing an aggregate sentence it is neither necessary nor desirable to indicate the degree to which I would have accumulated or to indicate the method of staggering the commencement dates in order to achieve an appropriate balance between cumulation and concurrence. [56]  However, I remain conscious of the fact that each of these offences warrant individual punishment and that the imposition of an aggregate sentence “is not to be used to minimise the offending conduct, or obscure or obliterate the range of offending conduct or its totality”. [57] 
	


Commencement date


	
	After the hearing of oral submissions, an issue arose as to the appropriate starting date for the sentence. Counsel for both parties filed submissions. The agreed factual position is that on 19 December 2013 the offender’s parole in relation to the 2010 robbery was revoked. He was returned to custody on 24 December 2013 and has remained in custody ever since. The balance of parole expired on 14 February 2015. He was charged with Mr Antoun’s murder on 16 January 2014 and bail was refused. It is a matter of speculation whether the offender would have been released again on parole had he not been charged with the murder offence although, based on my experience, I believe that it is likely that he would have been.
	
	
	The prosecution initially submitted that the sentence should commence on 15 February 2015. This was based on the fact that the only period of pre-sentence custody that is solely referable to the current offences is the period since 14 February 2015. However, the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that there is discretion to back-date the sentence to allow for a period of concurrence between the sentence I impose and the period the offender has served as a result of a revocation of parole.
	
	
	The offender submits that the sentence should commence on 16 January 2014, that is, the day he was charged with the murder of Mr Antoun. Fundamental to this submission is that the breach of parole was constituted by the offender’s association with the members of the BFL Blacktown and that this is an inherent part of his current charges and his association forms the allegation of the offence on the Form 1 of participating in a criminal group.
	
	
	Section 47 of the Sentencing Act provides that a sentence is to commence on the day it is imposed but that the court may direct that it commence on an earlier day. In deciding whether to make such a direction, “the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence or, in the case of an aggregate sentence of imprisonment, any of the offences to which the sentence relates”.
	
	
	In Callaghan v R, [58]  Simpson J (as her Honour then was) reviewed two lines of authorities and considered a statement of principle in a case of R v SAE [59]  where Gleeson CJ said:
	
	
	“The usual principle is that allowance is made for pre-sentence custody but only in circumstances where such pre-sentence custody is exclusively referable to the crime for which the offender has been sentenced.”
	
	
	Simpson J (with James and Hall JJ agreeing) held at [20] that there was no “absolute rule that, where pre-sentence custody is referable partly to the crime for which an offender is being sentenced, and partly to some other circumstance, such as revocation of parole, that pre-sentence custody may never be taken into account”. At [24] her Honour indicated that in some cases, where the breach occurred soon after release and the balance of parole was quite short, it may be appropriate to proceed on the hypothesis that the whole of the period spent in custody up to the expiration of the parole period is referable to the earlier offences and not to the subsequent offences. However, her Honour observed at [23]:
	
	
	“It would, in my opinion, in some cases be unfair not to backdate to some point (not necessarily the date of revocation of parole) before the expiration of the earlier parole period. It is always open to an offender to seek and be granted parole even after a revocation; to sentence in such a way as to commence the subsequent sentence only on the date of expiration of the whole of the previously imposed head sentence is to assume that, absent the subsequent offences, the offender would not have been granted a second chance at parole.”
	
	
	Accordingly, it was open to the Judge in that case to have specified the commencement date to be any time during the period since the offender was taken into custody. The same applies in the present case.
	
	
	I have determined that the sentence will commence on 1 March 2014. While that may appear to be a somewhat arbitrary determination, it is a discretionary judgment based on my assessment that most, but not all, of the period of custody since 16 January 2014 should be considered to be referable to current charges. That assessment, in turn, is based on the likelihood that the offender would have received a second chance of parole at some stage but that was unlikely to have happened before March 2014. It also takes into account the nature of the breach (i.e. associating with members of the BFL Blacktown) and the fact that this is the factual basis of the charge on the Form 1 of participating in a criminal group.
	


Indicative sentences for the individual counts


	
	I will now indicate the indicative sentences for the individual counts for the purpose of s 53A(2)(b) and the individual non-parole periods in relation to counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 for the purpose of s 54B(4).
	
	
	The starting point to which I will refer is the starting point taking into account all relevant matters except for the reduction for the plea and assistance. Where necessary I have rounded the numbers.
	
	
	Taking into account all of the matters to which I have previously referred I indicate the following for the purpose of s 53A(2)(b):
	



	
	Count 1: I would have commenced with a starting point of 6 years which would be reduced by 60%. The individual sentence for count 1 would have been imprisonment for 2 years and 5 months.
	
	
	Count 2: The appropriate starting point is 12 years reduced by 60% so that I indicate a total sentence after discount of 4 years and 10 months. The non-parole period would have been around 3 years and 7½ months. I would have imposed a sentence less than the standard non-parole period on account of the offender’s plea of guilty and assistance and the compelling nature of his personal case.
	
	
	Count 3: The appropriate starting point is 12 years reduced by 60% so that I indicate a total sentence after discount of 4 years and 10 months. The non-parole period would have been 3 years and 7½ months. I would have imposed a sentence less than the standard non-parole period on account of the offender’s plea of guilty, assistance to the authorities and the compelling nature of his personal case.
	
	
	Count 4: the appropriate starting point would be 4 years, discounted by 60% and rounded down would result in an indicative sentence of around 19 months imprisonment. There would have been a non-parole period of around 14 months. I would not have imposed the standard non-parole period in view of the very limited role played by the offender in this offence, the compelling nature of his personal case and the reduction in the sentence for his plea of guilty and assistance.
	
	
	In relation to count 5, the appropriate starting point would be a total sentence of 35 years, reduced by 60% resulting in a total sentence after discount of 14 years. There would have been a non-parole period of 10½ years. I would not have imposed the standard non-parole period in view of the discount for the plea and assistance, the significant duress relevant to this count and the offender’s personal case.
	



	
	The total aggregate sentence (after the 60% discount and consideration of the totality of the criminality) will be one of 21 years.
	
	
	I have considered Mr Ozen’s submission that there are special circumstances and that the aggregate non-parole period should be adjusted downwards pursuant to the provision in s 44(2B). I am unable to find “special circumstances”. While I accept that the offender will need considerable assistance in re-entering the community after such a long sentence and given the likelihood that he will still require protection from the threat of reprisal, a period of 5 years and 3 months should be ample to serve this purpose. I have also taken into account the more onerous conditions of incarceration in relation to which the offender will serve his sentence. However, that is a matter that has been integral to my determination that he should receive a discount as high as 60% for his plea and assistance and my decision that the sentence is not unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offences. I am concerned that any further reduction in the non-parole period would result in a sentence that would offend s 23(3).
	
	
	I am conscious of the fact that the accumulation on top of the period served as part of the balance of parole for the robbery offence means that the continuous period of custody is slightly more than 75% of the total aggregate sentence. [60]  I remain of the opinion that a balance of term of 5 years and 3 months is appropriate.
	
	
	Accordingly, the aggregate non-parole period will be 15 years and 9 months.
	


sentence


	
	NK, for the five crimes upon which you have been convicted I sentence you to an aggregate non-parole period of 15 years and 9 months commencing on 1 March 2014 and expiring on 30 November 2029. There will be a balance of parole of 5 years and 3 months commencing on 1 December 2029 and expiring on 28 February 2035.
	
	
	You will eligible for release to parole at the expiration of the non-parole period.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 25C (1) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) I advise you of the existence of that Act and the fact that it applies to you and to the offence of murder.

		22 November 2016",2015-09-02 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986353,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 33) [2016] NSWSC 676,"Judgment


	
	At the conclusion of the evidence of a witness known as Witness G [1] , Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi sought a direction pursuant to s 165 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that certain evidence may be unreliable. Initially, the direction was sought in relation to the witness who was next to be called, a witness known as Witness M. However, in the course of argument it was conceded that giving the direction before Witness M gave evidence was inappropriate because it was not known with any certainty what evidence the witness would actually give or what evidence would emerge that supported a direction that her evidence fell into a category that may be unreliable. Senior Counsel then sought a s 165 warning in relation to Witness G.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor did not oppose the giving of a direction provided that it was balanced by a direction that the evaluation of the evidence must ultimately be made after the jury had heard all of the evidence in the case. Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi and counsel for both Jamil Qaumi and Mohammed Zarshoy supported the application. Counsel for Mohammad Kalal opposed the giving of a direction at this stage of the trial. He submitted that all directions, including warnings as to the potential unreliability of certain categories of evidence, should all be given at the end of the trial in the course of the summing up.
	


Section 165 provides as follows: 

“165 Unreliable evidence

(1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:

(a) evidence in relation to which Part 3.2 (hearsay evidence) or 3.4 (admissions) applies,

(b) identification evidence,

(c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like,

(d) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness, being a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding,

(e) evidence given in a criminal proceeding by a witness who is a prison informer,

(f) oral evidence of questioning by an investigating official of a defendant that is questioning recorded in writing that has not been signed, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the defendant,

(g) in a proceeding against the estate of a deceased person-evidence adduced by or on behalf of a person seeking relief in the proceeding that is evidence about a matter about which the deceased person could have given evidence if he or she were alive.

(2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:

(a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and

(b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and

(c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.

(3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.

(4) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in giving the warning or information.

(5) This section does not affect any other power of the judge to give a warning to, or to inform, the jury.

(6) Subsection (2) does not permit a judge to warn or inform a jury in proceedings before it in which a child gives evidence that the reliability of the child’s evidence may be affected by the age of the child. Any such warning or information may be given only in accordance with section 165A (2) and (3).”


	
	The evidence of Witness G fell into at least three categories of evidence specifically referred to in s 165(1). First, he gave evidence of admissions allegedly made to him by Jamil Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi: s 165(1)(a). Secondly, he is a person who might reasonably be supposed to have been a criminal concerned in some of the events giving rise to the proceedings. Third, he is a prison informer: s 165(1)(e).
	
	
	In the context of the present argument, a number of things may be observed about s 165. First, categories in sub-s (1) are not exhaustive. Secondly, the requirement for a warning is mandatory unless “there are good reasons for not” giving the warning. Third, the warning does not require that any particular form of words be employed. Fourth, the section does not specify when the warning should be given.
	
	
	Mohammad Kalal relies on the evidence for Witness G in some respects: see R v Qaumi and Ors (No 32) [2016] NSWSC 675. However, Mr Clarke (who appears for Mr Kalal), did not submit that there are good reasons for not giving the warning. Rather, he opposed giving the warning at this stage of the trial. He submitted that all such warnings and legal directions should be given during the summing up. I understand that he is concerned that the warning would attract undue prominence if given at this stage of the trial. I was unable to accept this submission.
	
	
	While it is the case that most legal directions are given during the summing up, it is common for trial judges to provide legal directions during the course of the evidence or in their opening remarks to the jury. The following are some examples of a general nature and others that have arisen in the present trial.
	
	
	It is customary, although not universally the case, that the jury is told about the onus and standard of proof at the beginning of the trial before any evidence has been elicited. This occurred in this trial. [2] 
	
	
	Directions to the jury regarding an accused person’s right to silence and warnings against misuse of evidence that establishes that an accused person elected not to be interviewed by police or to respond to allegations put to them by investigators are almost always given at the time that the evidence is elicited. That occurred in this trial at the invitation of the learned Crown Prosecutor.
	
	
	Again, where evidence is adduced of criminal acts that are not charged on the indictment, the best practice in most cases is to provide the jury with some direction as to the basis upon which such evidence is admitted and any limitation upon its use. The jury should be told if such evidence is elicited to put the events charged in their true context and, if that is the basis, be warned against tendency or coincidence reasoning. It may be that the evidence is admitted as tendency evidence or in rebuttal of an assertion of good character and, in each case, it is usual and appropriate that the jury will be given certain directions at the time that the evidence is adduced as well as in the summing up.
	
	
	In the present case, it has been necessary from time to time to direct the jury as to the basis upon which certain evidence is admitted and against which accused it is admitted. For example, evidence that Mr Kalal and another man rented a motor vehicle on the day of the alleged murder of Mahmoud was admitted against all accused. However, its use in each case was different. In the case of Mr Kalal, the evidence was admissible only in relation to a charge of participating in a criminal group (count 24). This was because there is evidence that he used the car in a drug run that afternoon but there is no evidence, and no suggestion, that he knew it was used later that night in the commission of the murder. The evidence was admitted against the other accused as part of the circumstantial case in relation to the murder. The jury was given direction as to the use to which the evidence could be put in each case and warned in relation to its limited use in Mr Kalal’s case: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 29) [2016] NSWSC 569 at [14].
	
	
	The jury has also received direction about the fact that the evidence establishes (and it is obvious) that the accused men are in custody. The jury was warned that this was not uncommon in cases of this kind, the difficulties in obtaining bail for serious offences and told that it ought not to create prejudice against the accused. [3]  The nature of a “Basha” Inquiry was also explained to the jury. [4] 
	
	
	The foregoing analysis shows that there are many occasions when it is appropriate to direct the jury in the course of the trial about matters that will also form part of the summing up. I formed the view that it was appropriate to provide a s 165 warning in relation to Witness G in the course of the evidence for three main reasons.
	
	
	First, counsel has indicated that it is expected that the Crown case will not conclude for around another two months. Allowing for some defence case and addresses by six counsel, the jury is unlikely to receive the summing up for around 3 months. The jury is no doubt making tentative assessments of the quality of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses as the case progresses. Given the effluxion of time between hearing the evidence of the witness and the summing up, it is sensible and appropriate that the jury be warned in advance that his evidence falls into a category (or categories) that the law recognises may be unreliable.
	
	
	Second, Witness G is the first of around ten or twelve witnesses who might generally be described as informant witnesses. Many of these witnesses will no doubt attract applications for directions under s 165 or other warnings. From the material tendered on the pre-trial hearing, the nature of the attack to be made on their credibility varies from witness to witness while there are some common features. If all of the warnings are given in the course of the summing up, it is likely that the impact of the warnings will be diluted. There is a danger that the impact of the directions will be reduced.
	
	
	Third, while the Crown relies on a body of evidence that the jury may accept supports the evidence of the informants and implicates the accused in the various offences, the prosecution case appears to be significantly reliant upon this large body of evidence from witnesses who have “rolled over”, in most cases in exchange for benefits such as reduced charges, discounts from their sentences and transfer to more comfortable or safer prisons. In those circumstances, it is critical that the jury receive forceful warnings at an early stage as well as during the course of the summing up.
	
	
	I accepted the Crown’s submission that, if a warning was given at this stage, I should also remind the jury that the evidence of the impugned witness had to be evaluated in the light of all of the evidence and that this could not be done until the Crown called all of the evidence upon which it relies. Similarly, in deference to the concerns raised by Mr Kalal it was appropriate to ensure the jury understood that the warning did not mean that the evidence of the witness should be disregarded or that the jury might accept parts of his evidence while rejecting other parts. A direction to that effect was also given in my opening remarks to the jury. [5] 
	
	
	For those reasons I provided the jury with the following warning shortly after Witness G left the witness box and before the next witness was called:
	


“HIS HONOUR: Thanks, members of the jury. We are presently to hear from [Witness M]. Just a couple of things I wanted to say to you about some of the evidence you heard today, one of which is a very important direction of law that you need to receive and follow carefully. You will hear it again later in the trial but I have decided it is a direction of such significance that you should hear it at this time.

Before I get to that direction, though, you may have noticed that Ms Carroll, when she cross examined, and Mr Driels when he cross examined [Witness G], that each referred to some evidence that that witness had given in November of last year. Ms Carroll referred to it as a pre trial hearing I think and Mr Driels used the expression, I don't know if you picked if up, ""Basha inquiry"", that is B a s h a. It is named after a case.

It is a procedure when the prosecution and the accused are given the opportunity to hear in advance of the trial, the details of the evidence that witnesses are going to give when that is not clear on the Crown brief, the prosecution brief. So we conducted a procedure like that with a number of the witnesses late last year and a transcript was kept and it allows counsel, if there is inconsistency between what is said, to take the witness back to that to point that out. So that is all the references were.

Coming to the more critical direction, it concerns both [Witness G] evidence generally and also some specific aspects of his evidence. I want to warn you I must warn you that [Witness G] falls into a category of witness whose evidence may be unreliable. There are a number of reasons for this, some of which would be obvious to you. They have been referred to by defence counsel and acknowledged I think by the prosecution who led some of the evidence relevant to this.

The first thing is that Mr [G] is what is known as a prison informant. The experience of the courts over many, many years is that prison informants are witnesses who may very well give unreliable evidence. It is also the case that Mr [G] was criminally concerned in some of the activities that he was giving evidence of. That may give him a motive to minimise his own role and, if you like, maximise the role of others.

Putting aside those labels, labels like prison informant, the fact is that Mr [G] had a significant motive to provide an account which incriminates the accused or some of them.

As a result of the assistance that he offered to give police and prosecution, you've heard that he obtained a substantial reduction in the sentence that would otherwise have been appropriate for a criminal offences that he committed. You have heard that referred to as a discount and you heard that he received a total discount of 50 per cent off the otherwise appropriate sentence. That was for pleading guilty and for giving assistance to the police and prosecution.

The law is that where a person receives a discount like that, the prosecution may appeal against the sentence if the witness does not come up with the goods. In other words, if he turned up here and not given that evidence, it would have been open to the prosecution to appeal against the sentence and have it increased by that amount that he got the discount for.

That means that he has a significant motive to give evidence favourable to the prosecution against some or more of the accused.

You also heard, members of the jury, that he received other advantages. You know that the police have provided him with a letter to assist with his immigration problems. He has been told, and you have that letter, exhibit 24, that he his visa was to be cancelled because of what the Immigration Department says was his bad character. It also seems to be the case that the outcome of his immigration situation will turn, to some degree, on the evidence that he has given here.

You recall Mr Stratton, on behalf of Farhad Qaumi, cross examined him and described it essentially as a death sentence to be sent back to Iran. However you look at it, in those dramatic terms or otherwise, it provides yet another significant motivation for Mr [G] to give evidence favourable to the prosecution.

There was also evidence of him getting transferred to other gaols and you have heard those over a long period of time, conversations between him and his brother and [Witness L], and you might think, listening to what they were saying in those conversations, that the transfer to that gaol was a favourable outcome for him.

There have been other attacks on his credibility. He has a criminal history which is in evidence before you. He has been attacked about his drug use, about his involvement in motorcycle gangs, lies that he allegedly told to Detective Browne about not being involved in the offences, and it has been suggested to him that he encouraged his brother and then [Witness L] to tell lies to the police as well.

It is for you, as the tribunal of fact, to assess his evidence and to consider the attacks that have been made on his credibility. The directions that I am now giving you and that I will repeat in the summing up do not mean that you must disregard his evidence. They do not mean that his evidence is necessarily unreliable in all respects, or in any particular respect. It is a matter for you to consider and scrutinise his evidence closely. But in doing that, I am directing you as a matter of law that you must take into account this very strong warning I am giving you about the possibility of his evidence being unreliable.

There is also a specific aspect of his evidence that falls into a category of evidence that may be unreliable. You heard that he gave evidence of alleged admissions made to him by Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi. Again, the history of the law is that evidence of admissions is evidence of a kind that may be unreliable. It is not recorded. You're taking his say so of what was said. And evidence like that is very easy to make up and very difficult to refute. So the law requires that any time evidence of that nature is given to a jury, the jury receives a direction that it is evidence that may be unreliable.

As I have said, none of that means that his evidence is unreliable. You must assess it and you must assess it both on its own terms and also having considered all of the other evidence in the case. At the moment you have heard one of these so called informant or rollover witnesses. You have heard a number of other pieces of evidence and at the end of the trial you will have to assess the evidence of all of the witnesses, taking into account other evidence in the case that you may accept and other evidence that reject. But in making that assessment, you must always bear in mind the warnings that I have just given you.

I think for the time being that is all I will say about the subject. I will be repeating it and adding to it later in the trial.”

2986356,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 2) (Basha Inquiry) [2015] NSWSC 1715,"Judgment


	
	Between them, the eight accused persons are charged with a total of 36 offences. This includes two counts of murder and a variety of other very serious offences including the possession of drugs and firearms, participation in a criminal group known as the Blacktown Chapter of the Brothers For Life and charges arising out of seven other shooting incidents. They were arraigned on 27 July 2015 and the matter was listed for a pre-trial hearing commencing on 2 November 2015. Six of the accused, that is all except for Witness M and Mr Nasiri, have made an application to cross-examine a number of the witnesses on what has come to be known as a “Basha Inquiry”: R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337.
	
	
	On 27 July 2015, case management orders were made requiring:
	



	
	Each accused to notify the DPP of any witnesses it seeks to examine on the Basha inquiry by 16 October 2015, with such notice to include the basis of the application and area for cross-examination.
	
	
	The Crown to advise its attitude to such applications by 23 October 2015.
	
	
	If the parties did not reach agreement, written submissions to be by 29 October 2015.
	



	
	There was substantial compliances with orders (1) and (2). The parties did not at that stage reach agreement although the Crown made some small concessions in relation to an application foreshadowed by an accused person (Nazir Akbari) who no longer appears in the trial. The pre-trial hearing began and was, to a degree, hijacked by an application by the NSW Commissioner for Police of which neither the Court nor the parties were on notice: see R v Qaumi and Ors (AVL) [2015] NSWSC 1711. This involved applications for orders that evidence be given by AVL, closure of the Court, screening of twelve witnesses as well as suppression and non-publication orders. It was also necessary to resolve a plea in bar raised by the accused Nasiri: R v Nasiri [2015] NSWC 1649. I am prepared to accept that it was as a result of those matters that there was, for the most part, a somewhat lacklustre compliance with the direction for the filing of written submissions on the Basha issue. I exempt from that last comment the representatives for Jamil Qaumi, Farhad Qaumi and the Crown.
	
	
	The status of the matter was raised at the conclusion of arguments in relation to the AVL issue on Friday 13 November 2015. At that stage the parties were still far apart. Putting to one side accusations that one side was being “intransigent” and the other seeking orders that were far too broad, the parties expressed some hope that they may reach agreement or at least reduce the areas of dispute. The matter was adjourned until Monday 16 November 2015 for argument. On that day, the parties were largely in agreement as to which witnesses should be called and the areas of cross-examination that should be allowed. The Crown filed a document setting out the areas in relation to which agreement had been reached or, perhaps more correctly, the witnesses and areas of cross-examination that the Crown did not oppose.
	
	
	Jamil Qaumi was content with the areas proposed by the Crown. There remained some areas of dispute between the Crown and Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi, John Bishop and Mohammad Kalal. Counsel for Mr Zarshoy raised a new area of cross-examination (drug use on the day of a particular offence) and the learned Crown Prosecutor did not oppose that area being added. Counsel relied on written submissions filed earlier (or, in one instance, filed in Court and after the oral submissions) and made some relatively brief oral submissions.
	
	
	It remained for me to formulate with some precision the witnesses to be called and the areas of cross-examination to be allowed. I have provided the parties with a series of directions for the conduct of the Basha inquiry. These are set out below at [22]. These are my brief reasons for making those directions. I am unable to set out or summarise the careful arguments of counsel or the voluminous material upon which the decision is based in the limited time available. It is necessary that the Basha inquiry begin as soon as possible to ensure that the pre-trial hearing, which is listed for a total of eleven weeks and involves a diverse range of issues, is completed within the time available to ensure that the trial proper commences in late February or early March next year. The timetable originally set has not been met as a result of the unexpected application to which I referred in paragraph [3] above. The Crown has indicated that it will have witnesses available commencing the day after I announce my decision and accordingly I have prepared these reasons, along with my decision in R v Qaumi and Ors (AVL), over the course of the 36 hours and these brief reasons may not appear to do justice to the submissions of counsel on both side.
	
	
	In addition to the cross-examination on the Basha inquiry, counsel for Mr Bishop and Mr Kalal have also indicated a desire to cross-examine some of the witnesses on issues concerning the application for separate trials and severance of counts on the indictment. That application will be conducted at the conclusion of the Basha inquiry. The Crown has tendered the statements of the relevant witnesses and summarised those statements in material tendered specifically for the purpose of the applications for separate trial and severance. In those circumstances, provided the questioning is relevant to the issue concerned (that is, severance or separate trial), the accused have a right to cross-examine on the voir dire. As a matter of convenience and to avoid calling the witnesses twice during the pre-trail hearing, that questioning will take place in the course of the Basha inquiry.
	


the evidence


	
	In a nutshell, the witnesses in relation to whom the Basha inquiry is directed are informants or police officers who dealt with the informants. Most of the informants were criminally concerned in the commission of many of the crimes with which the accused stand charged. Each witness has provided a number of interviews and statements and has received a number of benefits as a result of their co-operation with the police.
	
	
	I am told that the accused (and I gather that means all or most of them) made an application for leave under s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) to cross-examine the witnesses at the committal hearing. That application was refused.
	
	
	The Crown has tendered nine volumes of material which consists of statements and interviews of the relevant witnesses along with two volumes of material provided by investigating police (Ex VD-B). It has also tendered a bundle of documents prepared for an anticipated separate trial and severance application (Ex VD-A). Exhibit A contains a number of helpful charts and summaries of the evidence in the prosecution case. The Crown also tendered a “précis” of information disclosed to the defence relevant to the Basha enquiry (Ex VD-J). The accused rely substantially on the material tendered by the Crown but have also tendered a synopsis of a conversation between three of the witnesses recorded by listening device (Ex VD-3). The defence has also drawn my attention to an Instagram post in which one of the witnesses posted parts of the statements of two of the other witnesses (MFI VD-8).
	


the law


	
	In R v Basha, Hunt J (with whom Carruthers and Grove JJ agreed) explained a practical method by which the possible prejudice to an accused person occasioned by the absence of a committal hearing or the service of new statements might be removed. His Honour said at 339:
	


“I have myself in the past permitted an accused to cross-examine a new witness on a voir dire before he was called in the trial. We have been told that other judges have also done so, prior to any evidence being called in the trial.”


	
	In R v Sandford (1994) 33 NSWLR 172, Hunt J explained at 180-181 some of the limits on such a process and said that the onus was on the accused to establish the necessity for a Basha inquiry:
	


“I maintain my belief in the obvious value of such a procedure — by whatever name it may be called — provided (and these are important provisos) that the accused has demonstrated — in advance — the particular issue which he intends to pursue, that the judge is satisfied that there is at least a serious risk of an unfair trial if the accused is not given the opportunity to do what otherwise would have been done at the committal proceedings, that the procedure is not used inappropriately in order to try out risky questions which may otherwise prove to be embarrassing in the presence of the jury, and provided also that such an examination is not permitted to interrupt the trial itself significantly: cf R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49 at 59-60.

The onus lies upon the accused in such cases to demonstrate that the disadvantage or prejudice which he would otherwise suffer during the course of the trial is in a relevant sense unacceptable, to the extent that the trial would be unfair: Barron v Attorney-General for New South Wales; R v Basha. If a decision is made that it is appropriate to follow such a procedure, it is something which should usually be followed before the jury is empanelled or at some other time which does not interrupt the trial.”


	
	The procedure is now well established and may apply even when, as here, the evidence is not new and when a Magistrate has refused leave to cross-examine at the committal hearing. Indeed, in the present case, one of the accused (Witness M) appealed against the decision of the magistrate to refuse leave. The appeal was unsuccessful partially (if not largely) because the matter was already before this Court and the undesirability of fragmenting the criminal process: Redacted v DPP [2015] NSWSC 747. Hoeben CJ at CL referred to the pre-trial procedures available in the Supreme Court to cure the possibility of prejudice and observed at [31]:
	


“This would seem to be the very sort of case where there are good prospects of a Basha inquiry being conducted if and when the plaintiff makes such an application.”


	
	I would also note the observations of Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Grove J) agreed J in Kennedy v R (1997) 94 A Crim R 341. In that case, where there was confusion in the statement of a complainant as to when an offence occurred and the police had taken further statements to clarify the issue, his Honour said at 351:
	


“In my opinion, such a procedure is essential in the present case. The applicant is in no way obliged to accept that the attempts made by the police to obtain these details from the complainant.”


	
	In some cases, inconsistency within the prosecution brief, or in the version provided by a critical witness will be sufficient to justify the holding of a Basha inquiry: see for example R v Ibrahim [2007] NSWSC 1140 and (in relation to committal hearings) B v Gould & DPP (1993) 67 A Crim R 297 at 303-304. That is particularly so in cases where the inconsistency provides a real confusion over the case that the accused has to meet. However, as the many cases under s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) establish, each case will turn on its own facts and the fact of inconsistency in the material will not necessarily give rise to a right to cross-examine or to a finding that a failure to allow cross-examination (either on a committal hearing or on the Basha inquiry) will result in an unfair trial.
	


DETERMINATION


	
	The Crown correctly acknowledges that the case is an appropriate one for a Basha inquiry and, as I have said, the parties have largely agreed upon the witnesses to be called and the areas of cross-examination. There remains some dispute about the breadth of the cross-examination and it remains for the Court to determine the precise content and extent of the Basha Inquiry. Where the parties are in agreement, I can see no reason to trespass on the joint position reached after considerable negotiation conducted by experienced counsel with a far greater understanding of the issues to be ventilated at the trial than I have at this early stage of the proceedings.
	
	
	The accused rely on the fact that so called “roll-over” witnesses by their nature are apt to be unreliable. In this case, there is direct evidence of three of the witnesses scheming to maximise the available reduction in sentencing and showing a willingness to lie to achieve that end. The accused rely on the fact that the informant witnesses are critical to the Crown case in respect of most if not all of the charges. I accept that the present application, and the arguments advanced in support of broad parameters for cross-examination, must be considered in the light of those matters and with those facts borne firmly in mind.
	
	
	The Crown relies on the fact that the accused have been provided with a large number of documents setting out what the witnesses will say or have said in the past. Further, much of that material is in question and answer form and electronically recorded. The accused says that the sheer bulk of the material does not establish that it is complete and points to inconsistencies within the statements of individual witnesses and to conflicts between the versions given by individual witnesses.
	
	
	I do not accept that the fact that a witness has given inconsistent accounts of the same event or conversation or the fact that two or more witnesses give inconsistent accounts necessarily leads to a conclusion that the accused cannot obtain a relevantly “fair” trial if not permitted to cross-examine those witnesses in advance of the trial. That is the situation that pertains to one of the areas of dispute in relation to the accused Bishop (his participation or membership of the criminal group) and to aspects of the submissions made on behalf of Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi.
	
	
	The inconsistencies pointed to in this case are not of the same nature and significance as those with which Price J was dealing in R v Ibrahim when his Honour ordered a Basha inquiry to determine which of two versions a critical witness would give at the trial.
	
	
	Further, the conduct of a Basha inquiry is not an opportunity for the accused to conduct a “dress rehearsal” for the trial or to ask questions that might be considered dangerous if asked in the presence of the jury. Part of the dispute between the Crown and the accused Kalal appears to meet this description.
	
	
	On the other hand, the accused is entitled to know the case that they will be required to meet and where there is true ambiguity or a lack of clarity or particularity in the witness’ statements, it is appropriate that the accused be afforded the opportunity to cross-examine. This applies to the actions of Mr Bishop in respect of his involvement in the events giving rise to counts 8 and 9 and to the conversations alleged in respect of the directions allegedly given by Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi in respect of most of the counts on the indictment.
	
	
	Keeping firmly in mind the principles referred to above, and in an attempt to ensure that the Basha inquiry remains contained within the overarching requirement that the accused persons each receive a fair trial, I make the following orders or directions:
	



	
	Direct the Crown to make available for cross-examination on a “Basha” inquiry the witnesses known as A, B, C, D, E, G, I, J, K and L.
	
	
	Such cross-examination is subject to the following general limitations:
	



	
	The cross-examination is only to be conducted by counsel representing an accused charged with a count (excluding counts 35 and 36) to which the particular witness’s evidence relates.
	
	
	The cross-examination is not to be repetitive.
	
	
	If an area of cross-examination has been covered by counsel for a co-accused, subsequent counsel will not be permitted to engage in cross-examination on the same areas if that cross-examination is repetitive. Counsel should reach agreement as to the order of cross-examination in respect of each witness.
	



	
	Such cross-examination is to be limited to the following general areas:
	



	
	What influenced the witness to assist police by providing statements and to agree to give evidence against others.
	
	
	What prosecution material (or other material; e.g. internet/ newspaper articles) they had seen or had access to before providing a given statement.
	
	
	What conversations or other communications did they have with police prior to making a given witness statement.
	
	
	Whether the witness had any contact (direct or indirect and including telephone, mail or message) with any of the other informer witnesses prior to completing their police interviews or statements and, if so, which other witnesses.
	
	
	If there was conduct of the kind referred to in (d):
	



	
	Did it include discussion as to detail of any of the charged offences?
	
	
	Did the discussion include providing assistance to police?
	
	
	Did the witness have knowledge that other witnesses were assisting police at the time they provided interviews/statements by way of assistance?
	



	
	Counsel for the accused Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi are permitted to ask relevant witnesses about directions given by their clients and the contents of conversations that occurred prior to the offences charged in the indictment provided such questioning is limited to:
	



	
	Identifying who was present and whether the witness was sufficiently proximate to be able to give evidence of conversations.
	
	
	Identifying the speakers (as opposed to who was present).
	
	
	Whether the events described are based on personal knowledge, or derived from other witnesses, be they informers or otherwise
	



	
	Counsel for the accused Bishop is permitted to cross-examine:
	



	
	Witnesses D, E, I, J and L in relation to the role played by Bishop in the offences charged in counts 8-10.
	
	
	Witnesses I, G and L in relation to a conversation wherein they were encouraged, or encouraged each other, to become prosecution witnesses or to lie and the circumstances of such conversations (that is, the conversation referred to in exhibit VD-3).
	



	
	Counsel for the accused Zarshoy is permitted to cross-examine witnesses relevant to counts 11 and 12 about the ingestion of drugs around the time immediately before or during the commission of the shooting at Revesby Heights on 29-30 October 2013.
	
	
	Counsel for the accused Kalal is permitted to cross-examine witnesses relevant to counts 17-27 about any admission made by the accused such cross-examination being limited to the words used and the time, date, place and other circumstances in which the admission was made.
	
	
	I Direct the Crown to make available for cross-examination on a “Basha” inquiry relevant police officers (with the exception of Detectives Browne and Veness) such cross-examination to be limited to:
	



	
	The content and circumstances of conversations with witnesses A-L either before or after obtaining of a given statement.
	
	
	Conversations that are not already recorded within the body of the witness’ statement or in a statement of a police officer.
	



	
	I direct the parties to liaise with a view to agreeing on which police officers are required for the purpose of direction 8.
	
	
	I note that during the course of the Basha inquiry, counsel for the accused Kalal and Bishop will exercise their right to cross-examine on the voir dire in relation to the issues of whether counts should be severed from the indictment and/or whether their clients should be tried separately.

2986357,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 23) [2016] NSWSC 429,"EX tempore Judgment (REVISED)


	
	I am going to make some brief remarks about the case management concerning next Thursday and Friday's argument concerning the admissibility of evidence sought to be introduced by the accused Mohammed Kalal. These remarks and the written judgment that will follow should be read in the knowledge that counsel currently appearing for the accused Mohammed Kalal did not formally come into the case until 30 March 2016.
	
	
	On 27 July 2015, nine accused were arraigned on a total of 36 counts. Each accused pleaded not guilty. Mohammed Kalal was represented at the arraignment by Senior Counsel who no longer appears in the trial. I made a number of case management orders, including an order for a defence response pursuant to s 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Senior Counsel was present when that order was made and copies of the orders were provided in multiple hard copies to the parties.
	
	
	Order 4 in the case management orders made that day was in the following terms:
	


“Each accused is to give notice of its response in accordance with s 143 on or before Friday 25 September 2015. Pursuant to s 143(2), it is ordered that the response is to include, if and where relevant, the following matters:

(a) A copy of any report, relevant to the trial, that has been prepared by a person whom the accused person intends to call as an expert witness at the trial,

(b) If the prosecutor disclosed an intention to adduce evidence at the trial that has been obtained by means of surveillance, notice as to whether the accused person proposes to require the prosecutor to call any witnesses to corroborate that evidence and, if so, which witnesses will be required,

(c) Notice as to whether the accused person proposes to raise any issue with respect to the continuity of custody of any proposed exhibit disclosed by the prosecutor,

(d) If the prosecutor disclosed an intention to tender at the trial any transcript, notice as to whether the accused person accepts the transcript as accurate and, if not, in what respect the transcript is disputed,

(e) Notice as to whether the accused person proposes to dispute the authenticity or accuracy of any proposed documentary evidence or other exhibit disclosed by the prosecutor,

(f) Notice of any significant issue the accused person proposes to raise regarding the form of the indictment, severability of the charges or separate trials for the charges,

(g) Notice of any consent the accused person proposes to give under section 184 of the Evidence Act 1995.”


	
	Section 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act is in the following terms:
	


“143 Defence response

(1) For the purposes of section 141 (1) (b), the notice of the defence response is to contain the following:

(a) the name of any Australian legal practitioner proposed to appear on behalf of the accused person at the trial,

(b) the nature of the accused person’s defence, including particular defences to be relied on,

(c) the facts, matters or circumstances on which the prosecution intends to rely to prove guilt (as indicated in the prosecution’s notice under section 142) and with which the accused person intends to take issue,

(d) points of law which the accused person intends to raise,

(e) notice of any consent that the accused person  proposes to give at the trial under section 190 of the Evidence Act 1995 in relation to each of the following:

(i) a statement of a witness that the prosecutor proposes to adduce at the trial,

(ii) a summary of evidence that the prosecutor proposes to adduce at the trial,

(f) a statement as to whether or not the accused person  intends to give any notice under section 150 (Notice of alibi) or, if the accused person has already given such a notice, a statement that the notice has been given,

(g) a statement as to whether or not the accused person  intends to give any notice under section 151 (Notice of intention to adduce evidence of substantial mental impairment).

(2) The notice of the defence response is also to contain such of the following matters (if any) as the court orders:

(a) a copy of any report, relevant to the trial, that has been prepared by a person whom the accused person intends to call as an expert witness at the trial,

(b) if the prosecutor disclosed an intention to adduce evidence at the trial that has been obtained by means of surveillance, notice as to whether the accused person  proposes to require the prosecutor to call any witnesses to corroborate that evidence and, if so, which witnesses will be required,

(c) notice as to whether the accused person  proposes to raise any issue with respect to the continuity of custody of any proposed exhibit disclosed by the prosecutor,

(d) if the prosecutor disclosed an intention to tender at the trial any transcript, notice as to whether the accused person  accepts the transcript as accurate and, if not, in what respect the transcript is disputed,

(e) notice as to whether the accused person  proposes to dispute the authenticity or accuracy of any proposed documentary evidence or other exhibit disclosed by the prosecutor,

(f) notice of any significant issue the accused person  proposes to raise regarding the form of the indictment, severability of the charges or separate trials for the charges,

(g) notice of any consent the accused person  proposes to give under section 184 of the Evidence Act 1995.”


	
	In purported compliance with that order, the solicitors for Mr Kalal filed a one-page document under the law firm's letterhead in the following relevant terms:
	


“2. The accused is pleading not guilty on the basis that he denies all the facts, matters and circumstances relied on by the Crown;

3. The defence at this stage takes issue with all of the facts, matters and circumstances said to be relied on by the Crown.”


	
	In November and December 2015, a number of pre-trial issues were ventilated. The accused were permitted a Basha inquiry in relation to a number of informant or rollover witnesses, see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 2) (Basha Inquiry) [2015] NSWSC 1715. In addition to matters permitted under the Basha inquiry, Senior Counsel for Mr Kalal sought and was granted the opportunity to ask questions relevant to the question of whether there should be a separate trial of his client.
	
	
	The Basha inquiry and associated voir dire into the question of separate trials took place from 19 November 2015 to 3 December 2015.
	
	
	From 8 to 10 December, submissions were made on the question of severance of counts and separate trials of accused.
	
	
	The accused Farhad Qaumi sought severance of a number of counts but Senior Counsel on his behalf specifically eschewed any application for a separate trial from any one or other of his co-accused. I reserved on the issue over the Christmas break.
	
	
	On 3 February 2016, judgment was delivered on the issue, see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) (Severance and Separate trial) [2016] NSWSC 15. Relevantly, Mr Kalal's application for a separate trial and consequent remitter to the District Court in accordance with an undertaking made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Chief Justice was refused.
	
	
	On 18 and 19 February 2016, I heard arguments relating to a number of evidentiary objections, including an objection by Farhad Qaumi to certain evidence proposed to be led by the Crown. That evidence suggested that Farhad Qaumi had boasted to members of the Brothers for Life Blacktown that he had previously committed two (or three) murders and had been acquitted.
	
	
	In the course of that argument, Senior Counsel raised, as far as I can tell for the first time, that he had an interest in the admissibility of the evidence because a defence of duress may be raised. I am going to set out a passage from the transcript at 907:
	


“[REDACTED] [1]  SC:  Can I indicate your Honour that I have an interest in this argument on behalf of Mr Kalal.  I have indicated this to Mr Stratton and to the Crown, it does not come as a surprise.  As you know I am withdrawing but I can put it this way.  We would want left open, at the least position, an opportunity to cross-examine witness A, witness D and witness I in respect of these conversations said to have occurred, or this conversation said to have occurred not in respect of proving the content of the conversation but rather the fact that it was said as a mechanism for dominance and fear and duress.  Having told your Honour that really I don't want to be heard much more on the topic other than to indicate that in our submission it should be kept open, if it does not come in the Crown case for it to be allowed in Mr Kalal's case.” 


	
	The reference in that passage to Senior Counsel withdrawing was a reference to the fact that he intended to withdraw from the trial, as I understand it for professional reasons unrelated to the case. He had advised me of that some days earlier and indicated that a barrister, who is a senior junior, was to take his place with the consent of Mr Kalal and his solicitor.
	
	
	It is worth repeating that until 18 February 2016, there had been no suggestion that Mr Kalal was to mount a defence of duress. The defence disclosure suggested that the defence was that Mr Kalal was not involved. There is no other way that I can see of reading it. There was no cross- examination on the issue in the course of the voir dire or “Basha” inquiry, even though the matter is obviously relevant to the question of whether there should be separate trials. There was no submission on the issue either orally or in writing in the course of the applications for separate trials or severance of counts on the indictment.
	
	
	On 24 February 2016, I ruled the evidence relating to Farhad Qaumi boasting about two (or three) previous murders to be inadmissible and published reasons for that decision, see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 115.
	
	
	The position of Mr Kalal, as stated by Senior Counsel on 18 February, was noted and reserved in paragraph 21 of that judgment. A number of pre-trial issues continued to be ventilated and the commencement of the trial proper was delayed. The matter with which I am presently concerned was not raised in any context.
	
	
	One of the issues ventilated was whether the accused should be tried by jury or judge alone. The issue of duress and the kind of evidence that might be led in support of that defence was at least potentially relevant to that question and yet at no stage was the matter raised with any degree of certainty. [2] 
	
	
	On 24 March 2016, in the course of submissions on an unrelated issue, Mr Kalal withdrew his instructions from the barrister that had taken over on 22 February 2016; see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 18) (Stay of Counts 8 and 9) [2016] NSWSC 351 and transcript pages 1343 to 1344. At that stage, a jury pool of more than 200 people had been summoned to attend the Court on Monday 4 April 2016. A principal of the law firm appeared on the 24 March 2016 after counsel advised me that her instructions had been withdrawn. He indicated that he hoped to find alternative counsel by the time that the trial commenced. He told me that he and his law firm had been in the case ""since the beginning"".
	
	
	On 30 March 2016, Mr Clarke of counsel appeared for the first time. He was in an unenviable position. At that stage, there remained a problem with Legal Aid funding and he was confronted with a very large brief. On the other hand, his solicitors had been in the matter for many months or years and presumably were well on top of the material and issues. Mr Clarke referred to his client's defence and what I had said in paragraph 21 of R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6).
	
	
	On Friday 1 April 2016, the matter was listed for final submissions on the proper approach to the empanelment procedures. Mr Clarke indicated then that part of his client's defence would involve canvassing matters of duress.
	
	
	Since the jury was empanelled, Mr Clarke has continued to gain greater familiarity with the brief. He opened to the jury an appropriately circumspect way. He did not say the word ""duress"" but he did make reference to the distinction between ""leaders"" and ""followers"" and raised what he called the issue of whether his client was acting voluntarily. I can only assume that this was a cautious way of flagging the issue of duress.
	
	
	It is now clear that Mr Kalal seeks to adduce evidence that he was aware of boasts made by Farhad Qaumi that he had ""beaten"" two (or three) previous murder charges. It seems that this will go beyond the evidence of the three witnesses to whom R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) related.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi has indicated that he will ""ferociously"" object to such evidence. The precise content of Mr Kalal's defence and the detail of the evidence is not presently known. Meanwhile, there is a jury of 15 and we are in day 8 of the trial before the jury. Over 30 witnesses have already been called and the matter is proceeding quickly and efficiently.
	
	
	The issue must be resolved before Mr Clarke cross-examines the informant witnesses, or at least some of them. It is expected that those witnesses will start to give evidence in the next couple of weeks.
	
	
	Mr Stratton canvassed the possibility of separating Mr Kalal and his trial from the other accused. Mr Kalal makes no further application for separate trials. Whether any of this will impact on the other three accused is not presently known because the details of what Mr Clarke seeks to do remain somewhat opaque. It is estimated that the argument will take about a two days.
	
	
	Yesterday, I told the jury that a legal issue would be discussed in its absence on Thursday 21 and Friday 22 April 2016 and that is when I propose to hear the arguments on this issue.
	
	
	It is necessary to make further case management orders to ensure that the argument will proceed quickly and efficiently. It needs hardly be observed that if Mr Kalal's former barristers and lawyers had provided an adequate defence response or raised this matter at some stage during the lengthy pre-trial hearing, this would not be necessary and the flow of the jury trial would not be interrupted. [3] 
	
	
	I am considering whether any action should be taken in that regard and whether, in particular, I should call on submissions as to why the matter ought not to be referred to appropriate professional bodies.
	
	
	Accordingly I make the following case management directions:
	



	
	On or before 10.30am on Monday 18 April, the accused Mohammed Kalal is to file and serve on the other parties an amended defence response pursuant to s 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Such response is to include, where relevant, the matters referred to in s 143(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).
	
	
	On or before 10.30am on Monday 18 April, the accused Mohammed Kalal is to file and serve on all affected parties the following documents:
	



	
	A notice containing,
	



	
	The names or the pseudonyms of all witnesses to which relevant propositions concerning statements made by the accused Farhad Qaumi or others are to be put;
	
	
	(ii)    The propositions to be put, in general terms;
	
	
	(iii)    Whether it is to be suggested that Mr Kalal heard the statements attributed to Farhad Qaumi or others;
	
	
	(iv)    The evidentiary basis - that is, reference to material in the prosecution brief or material to be adduced by the accused - upon which items (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) are based;
	
	
	(v)    The identity of person or persons said to have placed him under duress;
	



	
	A photocopy of extracts of the brief referred to in (2)(4) above and any other documents proposed to be tendered on the voir dire;
	
	
	Written submissions directed to but not limited to the following issues:
	



	
	Identification of the first time that the accused indicated to the Court that the defence of duress was to be raised and an explanation for the failure to identify that defence earlier;
	
	
	The relevance of the failure to comply or adequately to comply with the case management orders made on 27 July 2015 by provision of inadequate and misleading defence reply;
	
	
	The relevance of the material referred to in (2)(a) above;
	
	
	The probative value of the evidence;
	
	
	Whether Farhad Qaumi is a party in terms of the application of s 135 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW);
	
	
	The power of the Court to separate the trials at this stage of proceedings;
	
	
	The desirability of the Court to do so;
	
	
	If the trials are to be separated, the most appropriate orders to be made;
	



	
	Any other party, accused or Crown who seeks to be heard in opposition to the proposed cross-examination or admission of the evidence, or on the issue of separating the trials, is to file and serve written submissions by 9am on Thursday 21 April 2016, such submissions to indicate whether there would be any consequent application for discharge of the jury if orders for separation of the trials is made at this stage.
	
	
	Confirm the matter is listed for oral argument on Thursday 21 April 2016 with an estimate of one and a half days.
	
	
	The cross-examination on behalf of Mohammed Kalal of any relevant witness is deferred until determination of this issue.
	


Addendum


	
	After this judgment was delivered, counsel made submission as to the form of the above orders and the orders were varied: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 24) [2016] NSWSC 505 at [16].
	
	
	Further, after considering the matter further, I have decided to take no action of the kind contemplated above at [28]. I have come to that decision in spite of the fact that the failure to raise the matter clearly and unambiguously has created delay and additional expense. Further, legal practitioners must be aware that the case management provisions in ss 141-144 of the Criminal Procedure Act must be taken seriously. The original defence reply under s 143 in the present case was wholly unsatisfactory. Further, it was misleading in that it suggested that the accused intended to deny participation in the shootings in spite of forensic evidence that connects him to the weapons. His actual defence is that (i) he participated in the shootings but that his will was overborne by threats by two of the co-accused and he was acting under duress and (ii) that he deliberately discharged the weapons in such a way that the victims would not be killed or injured. In spite of this, I have decided to take no further action because of the possibility that counsel may have been concerned that raising the matter would create a situation of danger for Mr Kalal and may have taken a forensic decision that they believed were necessary. I accept that there was no intentional misleading of the Court and other parties although that was the result of the inadequacy of the document filed.

		23 November 2016",2016-04-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986358,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 24) [2016] NSWSC 505,"Judgment


	
	Five accused are currently on trial charged with 24 offences arising out of their alleged involvement in a group known as the Blacktown Chapter of the Brothers for Life (BFL Blacktown). Originally, nine accused were charged with 36 offences. There were 46 days of pre-trial hearing between 5 November 2015 and 1 April 2016. A jury of 15 was empaneled on Monday 4 April 2016. The trial has an estimate of four to six months. The trial proper has proceeded for twelve days. One of the accused (Mohammed Kalal) seeks to cross-examine a number of prosecution witnesses in an attempt to establish a defence that he was acting under duress by another of the accused (Farhad Qaumi). He hopes to elicit evidence that Farhad Qaumi boasted about being involved in two (or three) earlier murders and “beat” the charges. Objection is taken to this evidence by three of the accused. However those objections may be resolved, questions arise as to whether orders should be made separating the trials of one or more of the accused.
	
	
	The prosecution case is that the BFL was a criminal gang involved in drug supply, extortion and other malfeasance. The present trial encompasses offences arising out of five separate shooting incidents that occurred on 28 October and 2, 4, 7 and 29 November 2013 as well as allegations of possession of guns, the large commercial supply of drugs and participating in a criminal group. The prosecution alleges that these shootings arose in the context of a “turf war” between the BFL Blacktown and another criminal gang known as the BFL Bankstown. The leader of the BFL Blacktown was the accused Farhad Qaumi while the BFL Bankstown was run by Mohamed (Hamoudie) Hamzy, also known as Little Crazy or LC.
	
	
	The facts and evidence are summarised in earlier judgments: see, for example, R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) (Severance and Separate Trials) [2016] NSWSC 15. At least part of the evidence that Mr Kalal seeks to adduce was ruled to be inadmissible as between the Crown and the Farhad Qaumi: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 115.
	


The issues to be determined on the voir dire and the unsatisfactory way in which those issues have arisen


	
	Case management directions were made in July 2015 and there were extensive pre-trial hearings relating to the conduct of the trial and the admissibility of evidence. The two judgments to which I referred in the previous paragraph are of particular relevance to the questions that now arise. On 8-10 December 2015 I heard argument in relation to a variety of applications for the severance of various counts on the indictment and for separate trials. Judgment on that issue was delivered on 3 February 2016: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3). On 18-19 February 2016 I heard argument as to the admissibility of evidence that the Crown sought to tender against the accused Farhad Qaumi that showed that he had boasted to members of the BFL Blacktown that he had previously killed two (or three) people and had “beaten” the charges. On 24 February 2016 that evidence was ruled to be inadmissible for reasons set out in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6).
	
	
	In the course of the latter argument, Senior Counsel then appearing for the accused Kalal raised the possibility that Mr Kalal may seek to elicit such evidence in his case. He said:
	


“As you know I am withdrawing but I can put it this way. We would want left open, at the least position, an opportunity to cross examine witness A, witness D and witness I in respect of these conversations said to have occurred, or this conversation said to have occurred not in respect of proving the content of the conversation but rather the fact that it was said as a mechanism for dominance and fear and duress. Having told your Honour that really I don't want to be heard much more on the topic other than to indicate that in our submission it should be kept open, if it does not come in the Crown case for it to be allowed in Mr Kalal's case.” [1] 


	
	After it was indicated that the ruling as between Farhad Qaumi and the Crown would not be binding on Mr Kalal, Senior Counsel went on to say
	


“It may be that you might just simply, so that Mr Stratton has an opportunity to deal with it, require an application to be made to do so. But for that restriction, we would want it left open.”


	
	Another barrister appeared for Mr Kalal from 22 February 2016 until 24 March 2016. At no stage during that period was the evidentiary issue raised. However, the learned Crown Prosecutor raised his suspicion that the issue of duress may be raised and counsel for Mr Kalal did not refute that suggestion saying that “it would appear that an element of duress will be raised in the case of Mr Kalal”. [2]  On 24 March 2016, Mr Kalal withdrew his barrister’s instructions. Counsel who currently appears came into the matter on 30 March 2016. He immediately raised the matter as a possible issue but there was no application to postpone the commencement of the jury trial. [3]  It was not until after the empanelment that it became clear that the matter must be resolved as between Mr Kalal and Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	Two things should be observed about this procedural history. First, the possibility that Mr Kalal might raise a defence of duress was not raised in Mr Kalal’s reply pursuant to s 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). Secondly, the fact that the Mr Kalal might mount a defence of duress – directed to one or more of his co-accused – and the evidence to be adduced in support of that defence, may have been a relevant consideration in the separate trial applications. It would also have informed the important decisions taken by the co-accused from whom the duress is said to emanate. In fact, as soon as the matter was raised clearly and unambiguously as an issue, Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi indicated that an application for separate trials would be made. On 18 April 2016 Farhad Qaumi filed a notice of motion seeking an order that he be tried separately to Mr Kalal. [4]  Jamil and Mumtaz Qaumi subsequently made similar applications. [5] 
	
	
	The failure to identify the true defence and to raise the evidentiary issue as a matter clearly in need of resolution has delayed and interrupted the flow of the jury trial. After two and a half weeks, the jury has been released until after the Anzac Day and Passover long weekend, a period of seven days (three court sitting days). It also means that crucial legal rulings must be made hurriedly in order to minimise the disruption to the jury. I have recommended that the jury be paid for the days that they are not required to attend Court. This results in additional expense to the community. Finally, it has created a risk that the jury may need to be discharged. The situation is highly unsatisfactory.
	


Case management of the issues that arise on the voir dire


	
	On Wednesday 13 April 2016 I made a number of orders designed to streamline the conduct of the voir dire and to clarify the nature of Mr Kalal’s defence and the evidence (in general terms) that he sought to adduce in support of that defence: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 23) [2016] NSWSC 429. These orders were designed to minimize the disruption to the jury, to put the other accused on notice as to the issues that arose, to enable them to be heard and to ensure that I had a clear understanding of the matters to be decided.
	
	
	The orders provoked a response for counsel for the accused Zarshoy who complained that the directions had a capacity to infringe the accuseds’ right to silence. [6]  How the orders initially made could infringe Mr Zarshoy’s right to silence remain mysterious. Apart from those directed to Mr Kalal, the orders simply provided the other accused with a right to be heard on the issues that arose.
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Kalal also complained about the onerous nature of the directions.  [7]  At the heart of his complaint was the lack of time that he has had to prepare, as a result of his late entry into the trial. [8]  He made it clear that he did not intend to “play detective” [9]  as to the actions of his predecessors and did not appear initially to appreciate the relevance of the late notice of the issue – that is, the extent to which the evidence might be “unfairly prejudicial” (with emphasis on “unfairly”) – to the other accused (and in particular Farhad Qaumi). That unfairness arose specifically because they had conducted the separate trial and severance applications in a particular way, ignorant of the fact that Mr Kalal might attempt to adduce evidence that was otherwise inadmissible in the trial and which had the potential to prejudice their right to a fair trial.
	
	
	Further submissions were made that the directions went “way beyond” the specific application made by Mr Kalal and were outside of the scope of s 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act. I was unable to accept the complaints made about the directions. Section 143(1)(b) requires disclosure by the accused their defence and specifically any “particular defences to be relied on”. This must encompass a defence of duress. The document originally filed not only failed to comply with the section, it also had a capacity to mislead the reader. It was relevantly in the following terms:
	


“2. The accused is pleading not guilty on the basis that he denies all the facts, matters and circumstances relied on by the Crown;

3. The defence at this stage takes issue with all of the facts, matters and circumstances said to be relied on by the Crown.”


	
	Accordingly, in circumstances where there was a real possibility that the trial would miscarry, it was appropriate to require Mr Kalal to file a document that complied with the section. This was particularly significant in circumstances where the content of that notice may inform decisions to be made by other counsel as to whether they should revisit decisions previously made as to whether to apply for separate trials.
	
	
	Further, one of the things that is happening at this stage of the trial is that I am being asked to make an advance ruling pursuant to s 192A of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It is clearly “appropriate” to make such a ruling. For that ruling to have any content and meaning, the Court must have an understanding, at least in general terms, of the evidence proposed to be elicited. Not only that, but I am also revisiting the question of whether the five accused should be tried together in light of information that ought to have been – but was not – brought to my attention in the course of the evidence tendered and submissions made on the separate trial application in December 2015.
	
	
	In circumstances where those representing Mr Kalal elected to make a separate trial application on incomplete evidence, based on submissions that did not canvass a matter that had a very real potential to cause embarrassment and prejudice to the co-accused, it was imperative to make clear and precise directions requiring Mr Kalal to provide such information. However, in view of the difficulties under which counsel was labouring and in deference to the complaints made about the directions made in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 23), I amended the orders to extend and stagger the time in which to file relevant documents, to delete the requirement to explain the failure to raise the issue earlier and to relax the prescriptive nature of the written submissions. On Friday 15 April 2016 the earlier orders were replaced by the following directions:
	


“1.   On or before 4pm on Monday 18 April, 2016 the accused Kalal is to file and serve on the other parties a statement, signed by his legal practitioner, setting out:

(i)   The nature of his defence, including particular defences to be relied on.

(ii)    The facts, matters or circumstances on which the prosecution intends to rely to prove guilt (as indicated in the prosecution’s notice under section 142) and with which the accused person intends to take issue.

(iii)    Points of law which the accused person intends to raise.

2.    On or before 10am on Tuesday 19 April, 2016 the accused Kalal is to file (and serve on all affected parties) a notice setting out:

(i)   The names (or pseudonym) of all witnesses to which relevant propositions concerning statements made by the accused Farhad Qaumi (or others) may be put.

(ii)   The propositions to be put, and evidence sought to be elicited, in general terms.

(iii)   Whether it is to be suggested that Mr Kalal heard the statements attributed to Farhad Qaumi (or others).

(iv)   The evidentiary basis (that is, reference to the material in the prosecution brief or exhibits it is anticipated are to be tendered by the accused Kalal) upon which (i), (ii) and (iii) are based.

(v)   The identity of the person or persons said to have placed him under duress.

3.   On or before 10am on Wednesday 20 April 2016 the accused Kalal is to file and serve written submissions on the issue of admissibility of the material referred to 2 and 3 above and on the issue of separation of trials.

4.   At the hearing of the argument the accused Kalal is to produce a photocopy of extracts of the brief referred to in 2(iv) above and any exhibit proposed to be tendered on the voir dire.

5.   Any other party (accused or Crown) who seeks to be heard in opposition to the proposed cross-examination or admission of the evidence, or on the issue of separating the trials, may file and serve written submissions by 9 am on Thursday 21 April 2016 and otherwise will be heard orally on the issues. Such submissions should indicate whether there would be any consequent application of discharge of the jury if orders for separation of the trials are made at this stage.

6.   The Court will sit with the jury until 12-30pm on Monday 18th April 2016 and Tuesday 19th April 2016. The jury will then be released until Tuesday 26 April 2016. The Court will not sit on Wednesday 20th April 2016.

7.   Confirm that resolution of the evidentiary issue and any consequent application for separate trial is listed for oral argument on Thursday 21 April 2016 with an estimate of 1½ days. The Court will sit from 9-30am on each of those days.

8.   Cross-examination of any relevant witness on behalf of the accused Kalal is deferred until resolution of this issue.”


	
	In compliance with Order 1 above, a document was filed on 18 April 2016 that relevantly disclosed:
	


“2. The issues to be raised by the accused in the conduct of his defence are:

(i) Duress (in respect of all counts); and

(ii) Intent, in respect to all counts alleged against him, save for Counts 17 and 24 respectively.

3. The accused takes no issue with, and confirms that he was present and participated in what can be described in short form for convenience, as the Blacktown (Zakaria) and Chokolatta shootings.

4. The accused asserts that in respect of each of the two shooting incidents identified above, he participated only as a result of being subject to threats of death or serious injury to himself or members of his family. Those threats being made directly to him by the leadership of the BFL Blacktown Chapter, shortly before he was required to participate in each shooting.

5. The accused further asserts that his actions during his participation in the two shootings were based upon an intention in each case, not to murder or cause grievous bodily harm to any other person.

…

7. The accused will rely on the legal principles that underpin duress.”


	
	The contrast between this document and the original Defence Response under s 143 of the Criminal Procedure Act is stark. The original document (set out at [13] above) did nothing more that put the Crown to proof and (at least) implied that Mr Kalal denied participation in the shootings.
	


The evidence that Mr Kalal seeks to elicit


	
	On 19 April 2016, in compliance with order 2, Mr Kalal filed a document entitled Notice – Defence Case Particulars. This document set out the particulars of the evidence that he seeks to adduce. In oral submissions, Mr Clarke went on to put a series of propositions that constituted Mr Kalal’s “case” on the issue.
	
	
	The notice confirmed that Mr Kalal sought to adduce evidence that Farhad Qaumi had boasted about “having got away with three killings unrelated to those matters contained on the present indictment”. The notice indicated that it was intended to put propositions concerning such boasts to six informant witnesses (A, B, D, G, I and L) who “have included material in statements/electronically recorded interviews, that are relevant to this issue” as well as:
	


“(ii) … [o]ther Crown (roll-over) witnesses who were members of the Blacktown Chapter, if deemed appropriate to do so. That is to say, once the evidence has established that they attended the Saturday club meetings, that Farquad Qaumi was in attendance and spoke to the members at those meetings. A forensic decision would be finalised at that stage. The following witnesses may fall into this category, K, C, J and E. It is not envisaged that Witness M will fall into this category.

(iii) Any defence witness called (by any party) if appropriate. That is to say once those matters as set out in (ii) above have been established first.”


	
	The “general propositions to be put to these witnesses” were identified as follows:
	


“The general propositions to be put to these witnesses would include:

1.   The fact that this boast was made at a number of club member meetings;

2.   That they were made in such a way that the members would believe them to be true (whether they were in fact true or not);

3.   That as part of the boast, Farhad Qaumi would direct the members to material on the internet, which included information about the incidents and photographs;

4.   That it was clear from the reaction of members around the respective witness on those occasions, the attending members took the boasts seriously; and

5.   Mohammed Kalal was in attendance on a number of occasions when the boast was made by Farhad Qaumi.”


	
	As to whether it is to be suggested that Mr Kalal heard the statements attributed to Farhad Qaumi, the notice stated:
	


“In respect of the boasts that are attributed the Farhad Qaumi, the position of the accused Mohammed Kalal is that he was present at club meetings on a number of occasions and heard Farhad Qaumi make claim to the members present that he had got away with three killings. That claim was reinforced by showing members reports and photographs on the internet which appeared to support his claims.

Mr Kalal was also present when Farhad Qaumi also informed members of other incidents, such as the shooting of Mustafa Shanansa and the Hamzy shooting.

Mr Kalal was also present at a meeting when the Odisho shooting was discussed in his presence.”


	
	The notice then set out the material in the prosecution brief that provided the evidentiary basis for the case.

	Extracts of this material was tendered on the voir dire as Ex VD-25, 26 and 27.
	
	
	By way of example, Mr Kalal seeks to introduce evidence from Witness B whose statement of 30 September 2015 said:
	


“Farhad Qaumi used to boast about all the knee cappings he had done and the three murders he had gotten off. Two of the murders he told us he had gotten off on self-defence and the other one he told us he had chopped some Turkish guy up and buried him under a house.”


	
	In oral argument, the date upon which Mr Kalal allegedly heard Farhad Qaumi boasting of the previous killings could not be specified. All that could be said was that it occurred at sometime between mid-August 2013 (when he joined the group) and early November 2013 (the time of the shootings in which he participated). [11] 
	
	
	Counsel for Mr Kalal made it clear that he did not seek to establish the truth of Farhad Qaumi’s boasts. That is, he did not seek to establish that Farhad Qaumi had in fact committed three previous killings (and not been convicted) but only that he had boasted of that fact. It was the fact that the boast was made, rather than the truth of the boast, which is said to be probative of the issue of whether Mr Kalal’s will was so overborne that his liability is excused by duress.
	
	
	In terms of the specific facts said to provide the basis of duress in respect of the particular charges faced by Mr Kalal, the notice provided the following information:
	


“No issue is taken with the Crown case, in respect of the leadership structure of the Blacktown Chapter is concerned, namely at the material time Farhad Quami was the leader of the group and his brothers Mumtaz and Jamil Quami formed the remainder of the leadership group. There is also no issue in respect of the claim that Farhad Qaumi was in sole charge of directing the group’s activities and the selection of those members who would carry out any given task. It was also the case that some of the directives would not only be issued by Farhad Qaumi himself, but by other members of the leadership group i.e his two brothers.

In that context, Mohammed Kalal’s position is that:

(i)   In respect of the Blacktown (Zakaria) shooting, the threats that constituted the duress came directly from Farhad Qaumi, and that he was directly supported by Jamil Qaumi.

(ii)    In respect of the Chokolatta shooting, the threat that constituted the duress was delivered by Jamil Qaumi, the Accused Mohammed Kalal believing it came from Farad Qaumi in the recognised chain of command and delivered by Jamil Qaumi as a member of the leadership group.”


	
	Mr Kalal is charged as a result of his involvement in two of the five shootings that give rise to most of the charges on the twenty four count indictment. These were the “Zakaria shooting” at Blacktown on 4 November 2013 (counts 8 and 9) and the “Chokolatta Café shooting” at Bankstown on 7 November 2013 (counts 11-17). The threats said to have given rise to duress were identified both in the notice and in the course of the oral submissions.
	
	
	In relation to the Zakaria shooting – which came in the aftermath of the failure to murder Mr Odisho on 3 November 2013 (counts 4 to 6) – Mr Kalal relies on evidence expected to be given in the Crown case by Witness I. It is expected that the evidence will be that Farhad Qaumi said ""how fucking hard is it to shoot somebody"" and that the plan to kill Masood Zakaria was then discussed. Farhad Qaumi allegedly said to Witness I, Witness D and Mr Kalal ""If you don't get Masood one of you is getting shot"". Jamil Qaumi was also present and reinforced the threat by saying ""I'm going to shoot whoever doesn't get Masood"".
	
	
	In relation to the Chokolatta shooting, Mr Kalal relies on statements made by Witness D who said of Mr Kalal:
	


""He didn't want to do it, then Jamil forced him. He said ‘if you don't do it, I'll have to get your family. Sorry Bro, like that's, this is a game.’”


	
	It may be that there is other evidence in the Crown case of threats made to Mr Kalal. Counsel candidly acknowledged that he is not yet on top of all of the material. The important thing is that Mr Kalal’s case is that threats of death or serious injury were directed to him and his family immediately before each of the shootings. Part of his case, or his “defence”, is that his actions are excused as a result of duress, that his will was overborne by the threats such that he is not criminally responsible for his acts.
	
	
	The other part of Mr Kalal’s defence is that he did not intend to kill or inflict serious injury. He says that the threats caused him to attend the shootings and to discharge the weapons but that he did so in such a way as to ensure that nobody was killed or seriously hurt. In support of this contention, Mr Clarke has cross-examined some of the crime scene officers to establish the limited number of shots fired and that many of the shots appear to have been directed at the roof or floor of the Zakaria house, or into parts of the BMW car targeted in Chokolatta Café shooting that could not have caused injury to those inside.
	
	
	Mr Clarke opened the case in an appropriately circumspect way:
	


“One of the themes that will be going through this case from start to finish is the role of leaders and followers. And, of course, you are invited to look at the dynamics that is operating between the various players in this case to understand where the power lies, where the weakness lies, where the vulnerability often lies. And that is particularly important for Mr Kalal in this case because, of course, all you have heard at the moment is he turns up on two occasions and shoots at people. So that is not the end position as we see it.

The type of authority that we are dealing with is one that requires blind obedience, no questioning, no initiative. Theirs is not to question but to do what they're told. That's the kind of leadership that you may be viewing here.

…

Well, the position is this, that in addition to having to prove each and every element, the Crown has to disprove other things that are raised by the defence. Now, you have heard about self‑defence, that has been said. And so the whole basis of the Crown case is predicated on the basis that Mohammed Kalal acts in a voluntary way. A voluntary way.

And so if you come to the view at the end of the evidence that he hasn't been acting in a voluntary way, involuntary, in fact, then clearly the Crown wouldn't have proved their case against Mohammed Kalal, would they, because they haven't managed to deal with the issue that they would have to as part of proving the case against Mohammed Kalal.

I am not going to obviously take you through much evidence because we haven't heard any but I just want to use one example, if I may. Because the Crown used the word ‘tasked’ as though it is some sort of, you know, voluntary kind of phrase. It may not be their intention but my suggestion to you is that there is nothing voluntary about what is going on here. All right?”

The position taken by the other parties


	
	Farhad Qaumi objects to the admission of the evidence. In the alternative, he seeks an order that Mr Kalal receive a separate trial. The application for separate trials is based on the admission of the evidence that refers to the three previous killings. It is not based on the fact that Mr Kalal has (belatedly) indicated that he will be running a defence that includes raising the question of duress. In other words, if the evidence of Farhad boasting of the three previous murders is excluded, no application for separate trial is made even though Mr Kalal will attempt to mount a defence of duress based on other evidence to be adduced in the trial. Senior Counsel pointed to a number of matters that reduced the probative value of the evidence and went on to point to the extreme nature of the prejudice that would be occasioned if the evidence were to be introduced into the joint trial. Reliance was placed on a number of observations made in R v Qaumi (No 6). 
	
	
	Jamil Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi each support the position taken by Farhad Qaumi. That is, they object to the admission of the evidence but, as fall back position, ask that Mr Kalal be subject to a separate trial (if the evidence is held to be admissible). Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi and Counsel for Jamil Qaumi acknowledged the relevance and probative value of the evidence in Mr Kalal’s case but emphasised that the prejudice that would be occasioned to Farhad Qaumi would flow to their clients as a result of the fraternal relationship between the three men.
	
	
	I interpolate here, because it is relevant to whether I should make an order for separate trials of my own motion, [12]  that Jamil Qaumi indicated that he denies making any threat (as alleged by Witnesses I and D or otherwise) to Mr Kalal. This denial came in argument on the present issue and also in counsel’s opening statement to the jury:
	


“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the Crown in addition to that fact says however that Jamil participated either before or after in the directing or assisting those who were going to participate in these later shootings. Well, that is denied. We deny ordering anyone to go and do these later shootings. We deny ordering any of those people that you have heard me mention that are the shooters to either kill Michael Odisho or to kill Masood Zakaria or to shoot at ‑ I'll just get his name right ‑ Abdul Abu‑Mahmoud who I think you will come to find out is commonly referred to as ""Absy"". [13]  Jamil Qaumi gave no orders of that kind. He told nobody to go and kill those people. He is not responsible, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, for any of the shootings that occurred after the Revesby shooting.”  [14] 


	
	In the course of argument, Ms Carroll (counsel for Jamil Qaumi) said:
	


“CARROLL: …but can I say at the outset that allegations that we threatened to shoot someone either just prior to Zakaria or just prior to Chokolatta is denied and it will be an issue in the trial and I have got no difficulty in saying that. I don't think I put that detail in my opening, but that is our position. Having said that, your Honour is correct

HIS HONOUR: Sorry, so that means the very substance upon which Mr Kalal's purported defence of duress rests is denied by the person said to have made it?

CARROLL: Yes.”


	
	Mohammed Zarshoy initially indicated that if the trials were to be separated, it should be Farhad Qaumi (rather than Mr Kalal) who should be separated. At that stage, it was not clear (as it is now) that the evidence touches not only Farhad Qaumi, but also each of his brothers, and in particular Jamil Qaumi. Ultimately, Mr Zarshoy made no submissions either on the issue of admissibility or on the issue of separate trials.
	
	
	In written submissions, the Crown Prosecutors made a number of arguments tending to diminish the probative value of the evidence as it relates to a defence of duress. They pointed to the fact that the real evidence of duress came in the threats that immediately preceded the shootings. They pointed to the large body of evidence that will be led by the Crown that will otherwise support the proposition that Farhad Qaumi used violence and threats of violence to intimidate his cohorts into following his orders. The nature and extent of this evidence diminishes the importance of the leader boasting about the three previous killings. The Crown observed that the evidence of Farhad Qumi boasting of the three previous murders did not constitute a direct threat connected to the offences with which Mr Kalal stands charged. The written submission on the admissibility question concluded:
	


“Accordingly, if the evidence of boasting of three killings is not admitted there will be ample other evidence before the jury which is capable of establishing that Farhad Qaumi controlled the group through violence or threat of violence and further that Farhad and Jamil Qaumi were involved in two shootings in the days prior to the shootings in which Kalal was involved. It is also to be taken into account that the shootings will be alleged to be part of an all-out attack to eliminate members or associates of the rival criminal group. This evidence is directly relevant to the issue as to whether Kalal believed Farhad or Jamil Qaumi would carry out the direct threats if he did not do as they directed. In such circumstances the probative value to Kalal’s case of the evidence of boasting of three killings, which is not relied on for its truth, is negligible if of any value at all to his defence.


	
	The Crown also submitted that the defence of duress cannot run when the accused voluntarily joined a criminal group or (more correctly I think) when an accused voluntarily put himself in a position where he may be subject to illegal compulsion. Reliance was placed on R v Nguyen [2008] 181 A Crim R 72 at [28], [40], R v Baker & Ward [1992] 2 Cr App R 335 and R v Hasan [2005] UKHL 22; [2005] Cr App R 22. However, in the course of argument, the Crown correctly acknowledged that it was too early to make a determination as to whether the defence of duress should be left to the jury.
	
	
	In oral submissions, the Crown Prosecutor maintained the position that the probative value was diminished by the various matters referred to in the written submissions. It was submitted that the probative value to the issues in Mr Kalal’s trial (duress and intention) is “negligible” or “slight”.
	
	
	In written submissions the Crown indicated that it opposed “any application for separation of any accused from the trial whether the evidence sought to be adduced by Kalal as to Farhad Qaumi boasting of three killings is admitted or refused”. However, in oral submission the Crown indicated that it may revisit the question if I determined that Mr Kalal was entitled to elicit some or all of the evidence indicated in the notice setting out the particulars of the evidence.
	


Section 135 Evidence Act


	
	The application of s 137 of the Evidence Act led to the earlier ruling that the evidence was inadmissible. Section 137 applies to evidence “adduced by the prosecutor”. Because the evidence now under consideration is to be adduced by a co-accused, s 137 does not apply. Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides:
	


“137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings

In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.”


	
	Section 135 provides:
	


“135 General discretion to exclude evidence

The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:

(a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or

(b) be misleading or confusing, or

(c) cause or result in undue waste of time.”


	
	While ss 135 and 137 both require an evaluation of the “probative value” and the prejudicial effect of the evidence under consideration, there are a number of relevant differences between the sections. First, s 137 is in mandatory terms – the court “must” exclude the evidence if it reaches the conclusion posited by the section. It is headed “Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings”. By contrast, s 135 provides what is described in the heading as a “general discretion” and the section provides that the court “may refuse to admit” the evidence. Second, s 135 requires that the [danger of] prejudice “substantially outweighs” the probative value while the word “substantially” is absent in the terms of s 137.
	
	
	A question addressed in argument was the scope of the word “party” in section 135. On a restrictive view, and on the basis that there a number of individual trials being conducted together, the parties are Mr Kalal and the Crown. The broader view, and the view I accept, is that in a joint criminal trial each of the accused is “a party” for the purpose of the application of s 135.
	


Relevance and Probative Value


	
	There is no dispute that evidence that Farhad Qaumi boasted in Mr Kalal’s presence that he had previously killed three people is relevant to the issues of duress and intention. It could rationally affect an assessment of a fact or facts in issue. Those facts are (i) whether Mr Kalal was so affected by the alleged threats made immediately before the two shootings that it might be found that he acted under duress and (ii) whether he participated in the shootings but deliberately fired his weapon in such a way that he did not kill or inflict serious injury on the targets of the shooting. In that latter respect his case will receive some support in the evidence of Witness D whose interview of 4 March 2013 recounted a conversation on the way to the Chokolatta shooting where the participants complained about the Qaumi’s giving orders and suggested “We’ll just shoot at the car and drive off” and that they were “planning to just like run off.”  [15] 
	
	
	An assessment of the probative value of this evidence (that is, the extent to which it could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue) is more complicated and controversial. The fact in issue concerns Mr Kalal’s state of mind. The task must be approached by assuming that the jury will accept the evidence and not by reference to potential unreliability of the witnesses who are to give the evidence: IMM v The Queen [2016] HCA 14.
	
	
	It seemed to be suggested (by counsel for Jamil Qaumi) [16]  that the evidence might affect an assessment of the factual dispute between Mr Kalal and Jamil and Farhad Qaumi as to whether threats were issued immediately prior to the two shooting in which Mr Kalal participated. If it has any relevance to that issue, its probative value is slight. The fact (assuming it to be) that Farhad Qaumi boasted to the group of committing previous killings does little to inform a rational assessment of the question of whether the specific threats were issued shortly before the two shootings.
	
	
	However, the probative value of the evidence to Mr Kalal’s state of mind is greater. I do not accept the Crown’s submission that its probative value to that issue is slight or negligible. However, I do not find the probative value of the evidence to be substantial or significant, to adopt terms used in the course of argument. This is so for a number of reasons.
	
	
	First, as explained in R v Qaumi  & Ors (No 6), there is a significant body of evidence to be led by the prosecution that supports the proposition that Farhad Qaumi used violence and threats of violence to intimidate and control other members of the BFL Blacktown. Those matters were set out at paragraph [13] of the earlier judgment in the following general terms:
	


(1)   The assault of a member who refused to involve himself in a drug run.

(2)   The assault of a member who indicated that he no longer wished to stay with the group including a threat that he might be shot and the suggestion that he must choose whether he was to be shot in the right or left leg.

(3)   The bashing of a member (including threats with a gun) in response to the member doing an “unauthorised drug run”.

(4)   Threats of shootings if a member failed to pay the $50 weekly membership fee.

(5)   The pulling of a gun on witness B and being required to indicate which leg he wanted to have shot.

(6)   An assault on witness I for refusing to be involved in the murder of Mohammed Hamzy.

(7)   The bashing of the brother of witnesses G and I for “disrespecting [Farhad and Jamil Qaumi] in front of their wives.”

(8)   An order that witness C be bashed for failing to answer his phone.

(9)   An assault of witness C by Farhad Qaumi during which the witness was struck in the head with a dumbbell. This occurred because witness C failed to arrange finance for a car.

(10)   Threats of violence if a person should leave the Brothers for Life.

(11)   The bashing of Masieh Amiri by Farhad Qaumi because of a failure to obtain a gun.

(12)   Farhad Qaumi telling members that former member Mustafa Shanasa had “gone out with a bang” and would not be returning to the group. [I a note that this is a peripheral detail of offences originally charged in counts 12 and 13 of the indictment and which have been severed.


	
	As I said in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) at [14]:
	


""14.   There are multiple witnesses to each of these incidents. The nature and extent of this body of evidence is such that a jury will readily understand the prosecution case on this issue. In conjunction with the evidence pertaining to the counts on the indictment – which includes evidence that witnesses were threatened if they failed to obey directions – the jury will appreciate that the Crown case is that the witnesses acted as a result of fear and intimidation instilled by the use of violence and threats of violence. I accept that the evidence that Farhad Qaumi boasted of being involved in three earlier killings would increase the impact of this evidence, but the extent to which it would do so, given the volume of the other evidence is not as great as if it were the only evidence of Farhad instilling fear in the other members.""


	
	In addition to those matters, Mr Kalal’s case is that he was aware of the killing of Mahmound Hamzy on 29 October 2013 and the shooting of Michael Odisho on 3 November 2013. [17]  The defence case particulars (MFI 25) states:
	


“Mr Kalal was also present when Farhad Qaumi also informed members of other incidents, such as the shooting of Mustaf Shanasa and the Hamzy shooting.

Mr Kalal was also present at a meeting when the Odisho shooting was discussed in his presence.”


	
	The precise extent of his knowledge is not clear but those events occurred on 29 October 2013 and 3 November 2013 and will be subject to evidence adduced by the Crown to establish counts 1-6. Based on the opening statements of counsel for Farhad Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi, it appears that the group’s involvement in those shootings will not be disputed. [18]  Those shootings, and Mr Kalal’s knowledge of them, arose within days of the Zakaria and Chokolatta Café shootings.
	
	
	It is also the case, as submitted by the Crown, that the critical issue in Mr Kalal’s case appears to be whether the threats were made by Farhad and Jamil Qaumi shortly before Mr Kalal participated in the Zakaria and Chokalatta Café shootings. Further, the temporal proximity between the boasts of three prior killings and those shootings is unclear other than the fact that they were made at some time between mid-August 2013 and late October 2013.
	
	
	In the context of all of these matters, I am unable to accept Mr Clarke’s submission that the boasting of three previous killings at some non-specified stage in the previous weeks or months is the “very bedrock” of the belief upon which Mr Kalal’s defence is based. [19]  I do accept that the evidence has more than “slight” or “negligible” probative value, but the extent to which the evidence has the capacity to impact on an assessment of the facts is not as significant as submitted on behalf of Mr Kalal.
	


Prejudicial impact in the case of the other accused


	
	I accept the submissions of Mr Stratten SC on behalf of Farhad Qaumi that the introduction of evidence that Farhad Qaumi boasted about committing three previous murders and getting away with them creates a danger of unfair prejudice in his case. I explained the nature of that prejudice, and why it was relevantly unfair, in R v Qaumi and Ors (No 6).
	
	
	A further aspect of unfairness arises as a result of the belated raising of this issue. In the course of the separate trial applications (argued on 8-10 December 2015 and decided on 3 February 2016), Farhad Qaumi eschewed any application to be tried separately from any of his co-accused. His application may have been different had he been aware that Mr Kalal intended to raise the defence of duress and to elicit evidence of the kind under consideration in doing so. I accept that this aspect of the unfairness might be cured by ordering, at this stage of the proceedings, a separate trial of Mr Kalal. However, whether that remedy is an appropriate one must be considered in the light of a number of other relevant factors to which I will ultimately turn.
	
	
	Mr Clarke emphasised that he does not seek to establish that Farhad Qaumi in fact committed previous killings and successfully defended the charges. All that he seeks to establish is that Farhad Qaumi boasted of those matters and that he showed the other members (presumably including Mr Kalal) photographs and items from the Internet to support his claims. The use of the evidence would be limited and the jury could be directed accordingly. However, it is submitted by Senior Counsel (and I accept) that Farhad Qaumi was in fact found not guilty by a jury of two charges of murder on the basis of self-defence. The showing of the Internet items and photographs to the group tends to support the fact of the killings rather than the mere boasting of them. The third murder was apparently subject to an order by the Director of Public Prosecutions that there be no further proceedings on the basis of insufficient evidence. Farhad Qaumi is entitled to the “full benefit of the acquittal” of the two murder charges: see for example Garrett v The Queen [1977] HCA 67; 139 CLR 477. But the question, if this evidence is introduced by a co-accused, would be a tactical one. Farhad Qaumi relies on what was said in R v Qaumi (No 6) at [17]:
	


“Farhad Qaumi would be confronted with an impossible forensic election involving two bad choices. He could elect not to respond to the evidence and to trust that the jury would use the evidence in the limited way that the Crown proposes and obey directions that it should ignore the possibility that the accused had previously been responsible for the deaths of three people. Putting aside the obvious prejudice in this, there would also be unfairness in the fact that the jury would not be told that he was, in fact, acquitted in respect of two of the killings and that the prosecution had insufficient evidence to justify putting him to trial on the third. The other bad choice would be to re-litigate those offences for which he had already been acquitted or to rely on the outcomes of the earlier prosecutions. This would involve bringing to the jury’s attention the fact that he was in fact involved in three earlier killings.”


	
	The same reasoning would apply if Mr Kalal introduces the evidence. Further, the forensic choices are now even more complicated by the fact that Farhad Qaumi has opened the case by raising the question of self defence. If he elected to establish that he had been acquitted, and sought to rely on the full benefit of that acquittal, it may (or would) emerge that he raised the same defence in respect of two of the earlier killings. Further, the evidence of his boasts as to the third alleged murder are quite gruesome (chopping up the Turkish man).
	
	
	As to whether the prejudice could be cured by direction, Mr Stratten SC relies on the following comments in R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) at [18]:
	


“18 In my view, these matters give rise to the “danger of unfair prejudice” for the purpose of s137. The question is whether that danger outweighs the probative value of the evidence. In many cases, prejudice such as this can be cured by direction. However, the evidence in this case is of such a nature that I am unable to contemplate a direction that would overcome the unfair prejudice to the accused.”


	
	Different considerations apply where the evidence is adduced by one accused although the issue to which the matter is directed (Farhad Qaumi using his reputation for violence to overbear the will of the other members of the BFL Blacktown) is similar to the use to which the Crown sought to elicit the evidence. I have given further consideration as to whether the prejudice might be cured by direction to the jury as to (i) the limited use to which the evidence might be put, (ii) the fact that the evidence is not led to prove the truth of the allegations, (iii) the fact (if the issue was raised) that Farhad Qaumi is entitled to the full benefit of the acquittals and (iv) directing the jury that the evidence may only be used only in Mr Kalal’s case on the issues of duress and intention. I have come to the same conclusion as I did in rejecting the evidence in the Crown case – the prejudice to Farhad Qaumi cannot be cured by direction.
	


Decision on admissibility


	
	Shortly before conclusion of argument on these issues, I became aware of two judgments of Bellew J in trial proceedings that have reached the stage where one of the accused in giving evidence: see R v Rogerson & McNamara (No 3) [2015] NSWSC 965 and R v Rogerson & McNamara (No 45) [2016] NSWSC 452. In each case, his Honour made variations to the non-publication orders to allow the parties in the present case to have access to the judgments. The Crown raised the former decision in the context of the suggestion that the trials of the accused now be separated. The latter decision has some relevance to the present application to exclude part of the evidence upon which one accused relies to lay the foundations for a defence of duress.
	
	
	In R v Rogerson & McNamara (No 45) Bellew J decided that the accused McNamara would not be permitted to give evidence that Rogerson boasted that he was responsible for five earlier killings. At [32]-[35], his Honour gave reasons why the probative value of the evidence was “limited”. This included the lack of precision as to the timing of the earlier boasts and that they took place “some months” prior to the events that gave rise to the duress. It also included the fact that “the real basis of the duress asserted by McNamara stems from a combination of seeing the deceased shot in cold blood, and the threat made by Rogerson immediately thereafter.”
	
	
	As Mr Clarke pointed out, that is a different situation to that which prevails here. In particular, Mr Kalal did not see the perpetrator of the duress shoot somebody in cold blood. However, on his case (as articulated in argument and set out in the particulars), Mr Kalal was aware of the killing of Mahmoud Hamzy and the shooting of Michael Odisho in the days leading up to the threat that he asserts caused him to involve himself in the Zakaria and Chokolatta Café shootings. Further, while the timing of the boasts is more temporally proximate than they were in Rogerson and McNamara, there is a similar lack of precision in the timing of the boasts and they occurred sometime (perhaps weeks, perhaps two months) earlier. Again, the threats made immediately prior to the shootings are the “real basis of the duress”. In support of the impact that those threats had on Mr Kalal, there is a large body of evidence of earlier instances of violence and intimidation perpetrated by Farhad Qaumi in order to intimidate and control the other members of the BFL Blacktown. It is significant that Jamil Qaumi was the author of the immediate threats and also a participant in the Hamzy killing a week earlier.
	
	
	While the decision of Bellew J is distinguishable on its facts and is not binding, his Honour’s reasoning reinforces my conclusion that restricting the evidence to be adduced by Mr Kalal will not unduly fetter his ability to mount the defence that he seeks to run. There will be ample evidence, adduced by the prosecution, that will support his case and the belief that it is anticipated he will assert.
	
	
	In term of the balancing exercise and discretion that arise under s 135 I have concluded that the probative value of the evidence in Kalal’s case is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice in the cases of Farhad and Jamil Qaumi.
	
	
	Accordingly, I rule the evidence to be inadmissible in the joint trial.
	


Separation of trials


	
	Because the evidence has been ruled to be inadmissible in the joint trial, the applications by Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi for Mr Kalal to be tried separately do not arise.
	
	
	However, while Mr Kalal has made no further application for a separate trial, Mr Clarke has invited me to consider my power to separate his trial of my own motion. There is no doubt that I have the power to do this and to make the orders “at any stage during the trial”: see s 21 of the Criminal Procedure Act.
	
	
	It was submitted that if I came to the conclusion that the exclusion of the evidence would result in Mr Kalal receiving an unfair trial, I should exercise my power to order a separate trial. It may be more correct to say that I would exercise that power if I was of the view that he would be “prejudiced or embarrassed” in his defence or if there is some “other reason” to separate the trials: see the terms of s 21(2). This may be an irrelevant distinction – if I was satisfied that Mr Kalal could not receive a fair trial if the evidence is excluded, I would readily form the view that he may be prejudiced in his defence or that there was some other reason why it is desirable for him to be tried separately.
	
	
	The applicable legislation, case law and many of the relevant principles were set out in my judgment on separation delivered on 3 February 2016: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 3) at [83]-[97] and [120]-[136]. Given that I have released the jury for around a week in order to determine these issues, there is insufficient time to set out the relevant statutory and case law again. I am guided by those well-established principles discussed in the earlier judgment.
	
	
	A number of factors must be considered in determining the question of whether the court should order that Mr Kalal be tried separately.
	
	
	It is accepted that if Farhad and Jamil Qaumi were not parties to the trial, Mr Kalal would be permitted to lead the evidence of the boasts about the earlier killings. That is significant factor in favour of separation.
	
	
	However, there are many factors pointing in the other direction. In particular, Farhad and Jamil Qaumi dispute the allegation that they made the threats upon which Mr Kalal’s defence of duress is predicated. It also appears that the evidence of the boasts relating to previous killings is disputed. It is appropriate that the same jury hear all of the evidence and cross-examination relevant to a resolution of these factual disputes. It is not strictly a “cut throat” defence but, on the issue of duress, there are substantial factual disputes that should be resolved by a single jury.
	
	
	Further, while Mr Kalal is only charged with a handful of the offences on the indictment, those allegations involve him acting jointly with his co-accused. The general rule is that co-offenders should be tried together.
	
	
	Next, there is a very large body of common evidence. In particular, a number of the informant witnesses would be required to give evidence in both trials. It is at least desirable that they are not required to give evidence on multiple occasions (or at least on more occasions than is necessary to provide each of the accused with a fair trial).
	
	
	Not only that, but it is also clear from the submissions that substantial attacks will be made on the credibility of those witnesses by Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi. The jury called upon to determine the defence to be mounted by Mr Kalal should have the benefit of hearing the cross-examination to be mounted on behalf of the Qaumi brothers.
	
	
	In some cases, the fact that one accused may raise duress as an issue will result in separate trials being granted to the person against whom the allegation of duress is made: see R v Singh, unreported Supreme Court of New South Wales (Fullerton J) 10 November 2011 and R v CE [2005] NSWCCA 326. However, as I have emphasised, neither Farhad Qaumi nor Jamil Qaumi press a separate trial based on the fact that Mr Kalal is running a defence of duress that will prejudice or embarrass them in a joint trial. Cases where duress results in separation generally arise on the motion of the party said to have been responsible for placing the other accused under duress.
	
	
	I have not come to the conclusion that Mr Kalal’s trial will be unfair as a result of the exclusion of this evidence. Nor do I conclude that he will be prejudiced or embarrassed in the conduct of his defence. Taking all of those matters into account, I decline the invitation to make orders for separation and/or postponement of Mr Kalal’s trial of my own motion.
	


ORDERS AND RULINGS


	
	For those reasons, I make the following orders and evidentiary rulings:
	



	
	The evidence that Mr Kalal seeks to adduce, as set out in the particulars (MFI 25) and Ex VD 25, 26 and 27, is inadmissible.
	
	
	The applications for separate trial by Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi do not arise.
	
	
	I decline to make an order for separation or postponement of Mr Kalal’s trial of my own motion.

2986359,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 36) [2016] NSWSC 718,"Judgment


	
	An incident arose part way through the thirty eighth day of the jury trial in the present proceedings. The nature of the allegations and evidence in the trial proper has been summarised in a number of earlier judgments. I will not repeat those summaries. As a result of the incident, the learned Crown Prosecutor made an application under s 53B(b) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) that an individual juror be discharged. Each of the five accused men opposed the discharge of the juror. The incident was explored in argument and by way of an investigation under s 73A of the Jury Act on Wednesday 1 June, Thursday 2 June and Monday 6 June 2016. For unrelated reasons, the Court did not sit on Friday 3 June 2016.
	
	
	In short, material came to the attention of the Crown that one of the jurors may have some acquaintance with one or more of the witnesses [1]  who are soon to give evidence in the trial. The incident raised sensitive issues surrounding the procedures to be adopted in these circumstances, the content and application of the test for apprehended bias under s 53B(b) and the nature of the discretion provided by that section.
	
	
	On 6 June 2016 I decided to discharge the juror. I also decided pursuant to s 53C(1) that the trial is to continue with a reduced number of jurors. These are my reasons for those decisions.
	


The Evidence


	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi brought the matter to my attention by inviting the Crown Prosecutor to provide me with two Investigator’s Notes that had just been served on defence counsel. This occurred shortly after lunch on Wednesday 1 June 2016. [2]  The documents were marked for identification. [3]  After the legal representatives were given an opportunity to consult with their clients, a third Investigator’s Note was marked for identification. [4]  The three Investigators’ Notes were subsequently marked as a single exhibit on the voir dire. [5] 
	
	
	The first Investigator’s Note was prepared by Detective Senior Constable Veness:
	


“On Wednesday 1st June 2016, Detective Senior Constable VENESS and Detective Inspector LAIDLAW attended a Correctional Facility and spoke with Witness I.

During this conversation, Witness I raised concerns about his obligations, if any, if he were to personally know one of the jurors in the trial.

Witness I was advised that if he knew any of the jurors he would have to disclose that to the police and the court. Witness I asked if this would cause a mistrial if he knew one of the jurors. Police pressed Witness I as to why he had those concerns and he indicated that he had heard it from an inmate at the gaol that he may know one of the jurors. Witness I was informed that there are fifteen jurors and it may not necessarily cause a mistrial but it was something that needed to be addressed.

Witness I stated that before he disclosed any further information to police he wanted to speak with his solicitor Chadi IRANI. Police stated that it was so important that he attend to this issue as a matter of urgency. Witness I advised police that he would have Chadi IRANI make contact with Detective Inspector Glen BROWNE today.

Witness I advised police that the juror was female and Greek in appearance.

Following the visit with Witness I Detective Senior Constable VENESS and Detective Inspector LAIDLAW met with Witness J. During the conversation with Witness J he raised the same issue as Witness I. Witness J stated he had concerns that he knew one of the jurors in the Brothers for Life trial. Witness J stated he came to learn this from his friend John. Police know John to be John (name redacted) and approved him as a visitor for Witness J. Witness J stated that he told John that he would be giving evidence shortly for the trial. John informed Witness J that a girl known to them was doing jury duty on a six month trial. John informed Witness J that this female had published this on social media, Facebook.

Witness J advised police of the first name of the female and also the first letter of her surname. Witness J also stated the female was Greek in appearance. Witness J asked police what he should do if he recognizes any jurors when he gives his evidence. It was explained to Witness J that if he knew any of the jurors the Judge would need to be informed immediately. Police indicated that if that were the case he would need to raise this in court not in the presence of the jury.

Witness J indicated that he was friends with a group of people including this female. He last saw this female four (4) to five (5) years ago at a friend's birthday party. Witness J further advised that he believes that this female may also be known to Witness I and Witness G and based this on the fact that this female has a best friend who is Persian.”


	
	The second Investigator’s Note was prepared by Detective Inspector Laidlaw:
	


“As per the request from the Crown Prosecutor, Mr. McKay in the current trial at the Supreme Court.

On the morning of 1 June 2016, in company with Detective Senior Constable Kellie VENESS, I attended the Special Purpose Centre, Long Bay Corrections Complex in order to speak with several inmates associated with both Strike Force ROXANA (HAMZY & AJAJ) and KIRKLAND (ANTOUN).

We spoke with Witness I whereupon he raised an issue associated with the possibility that there was a juror sitting at the present trial at the Supreme Court, Sydney, in that if that person was someone known to either the accused or witnesses, if a mistrial would occur. When asked about his knowledge of this juror, he advised that is was another inmate within the SPC that may have such knowledge and not him specifically. I advised that there were fifteen jurors due to the length of the trial, so that may be likelihood that if this juror is known to those persons, they may be removed and the trial continue, but would have to assessed by the presiding Justice. He stated that this juror was a female and he believed to be of Greek decent.

When asked if he could disclose further information about this juror, Witness I stated that he did not wish to speak any further about this matter until he had conferred with his legal representative, Chadi IRANI, Solicitor. He was advised that after such consultation, to contact the OIC, Det. Insp. Glen BROWNE to advise on the outcome of this conference as to whether he wishes to speak to police further about this matter.

Immediately after this visitation, we spoke with Witness J, during which he raised that issue concerning his knowledge of a female juror, that may be sitting in judgment at the current trial. He advised that he had a visit from a friend, 'John' who stated that a female who was known to both of them was sitting at a lengthy trial, 6 months duration, and they both assumed that it was the current trial relating to the Brothers For Life matters. John had stated that he heard about via social media, Facebook.

Witness J advised that he knew of a female of Greek nationality from several years ago, that used to 'hang around' with them when he was into hotting up motor vehicles. He provided her first name and also the first initial of her surname. He stated that he had not seen this female for probably five years, the last being at a friend's party. We advised that upon his attendance at Court, that should he recognise her (to which he stated that he could) he should immediately advise the Crown Prosecutor, who will then undertake certain action. To which he stated he would.”


	
	The final Investigator’s Note was prepared by Detective Sergeant Whiting:
	


“I am the officer in charge of a deliberately lit fire that occurred in 2008. The trial is listed for hearing and as a result I have served a substantial amount of witness subpoena's for this matter.

On Tuesday 24 May 2016, I sent via Toll Express, who are the mail contractors for the New South Wales Police Force, a subpoena for a key witness in my matter. I obtained the address from the Police COPS / RMS System, after I had made several failed attempts to contact the witness on the numbers I had been given during the investigation phase.

On Friday 27 May 2016 I received a call from this witness, who advised me that the subpoena was received. The witness also told me, 'I am currently on jury duty, I am in week 8 of a 33 week trial at the Downing Centre', adding that the Court Officer had been notified of the subpoena.

Having given the situation some thought, and having some knowledge of current trials being heard, later that afternoon, I made the decision and called the OIC D/lnspector Glen BROWNE to advise him of the possible situation unfolding as I believe the character of my witness is not one of sound character. I did not disclose my witnesses name.

During my investigation, I believe my witness may have been complicit in the fraud matter and of concealing the offence on behalf of the accused in my matter.

On Tuesday 31 May 2016, I met with The Crown in my matter, Mr Jeff TUNKS, during that conference he asked me why this witness had not been charged, I advised him that I was waiting on The Crown determination now the matter had been referred from the Glebe Coroners Court. I also advise him that this witness was now a juror on a large trial that was currently sitting.

On Wednesday 1 June 2016, I received a call from D/lnspector BROWNE who asked me to attend Court 3.2 to identify and confirm that my witness was part of the jury. Given my matter is almost 8 years old and I have had little face to face interaction with this witness, I viewed a photo of the witness from the ERISP interview from 2008 and went to Court 3.2. I was able to identify this witness as part of the jury.

I left Court and contacted D/lnspector BROWNE and updated him with the outcome.”


	
	The third note appeared to concern a different, unrelated issue and its content was bereft of appropriate factual detail, as opposed to the unsubstantiated, subjective views of its author and hearsay statements attributed to a named prosecutor. However, the Crown Prosecutor indicated that police believed that the three notes may relate to a single juror. There was general consensus among counsel that more information was required before the parties could formulate their positions. I was conscious of the sensitivity of the issues and the requirements of the Jury Act. In Wu v The Queen [1999] HCA 52; 199 CLR 99, Callinan J said at [103]:
	


“It is appropriate that a trial judge, confronted with a situation in which he or she has to make a decision about a reduction in the number of jurors not do so hastily, without as full an inquiry as is practicable and reasonable, and without making explicit orders as s 22 requires, as to the reduction in number and the continuation of the trial with the reduced number. Adherence to such a procedure (which the Act demands) has the effect not only of ensuring an unambiguous record of what has taken place but also of focussing the trial judge's attention upon the necessity to weigh up whether a juror's or jurors' absence should require the trial to be aborted or whether it should continue with the reduced number.”


	
	Section 73A(1) of the Jury Act provides:
	


“If there is reason (including a report under section 75C) to suspect that the verdict of a jury in a trial of any criminal proceedings may be, or may have been, affected because of improper conduct by a member or members of the jury, the sheriff may, with the consent of or at the request of the Supreme Court or District Court, investigate the matter and report to the court on the outcome of the investigation.”


	
	Prior to the empanelment procedure, the panel that had been summoned for the trial were provided with the names of all of the witnesses and exhorted to indicate whether they may have any knowledge of the matter or witnesses that could potentially impact on their ability to fairly try the case. The list of witnesses was read out and also provided in multiple hard copies to the panel. On the third day of the trial proper, the jury sent a note indicating that one member of the jury had become aware that “one of the prison officers is someone they know”: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 21) [2016] NSWSC 402. The juror was separated from the balance of the jury and examined briefly. Ultimately, an application to discharge the individual juror was withdrawn. However, the incident meant that the jury as a whole was aware of the sensitivity surrounding any personal knowledge of the participants in the trial.
	
	
	That history, along with the contents of the first two of the Investigator’s Notes, led me to conclude that it was appropriate to request an investigation under s 73A. Accordingly, I made the following orders:
	


“Pursuant to s 73A of the Jury Act 1977, I am satisfied that there is reason to suspect that a verdict of the jury in the current trial may be affected because of improper conduct by a member of the jury and, accordingly, pursuant to that section, I direct the Sheriff to conduct an inquiry into the matters raised by the three investigators' notes, namely MFI 96, an investigator's note of Detective Senior Constable Kellie Veness dated 1 June 2016; MFI 97, an investigator's note of Detective Inspector David Laidlaw dated 1 June 2016; and, MFI 98, an undated investigator's note of Detective Sergeant Kylie Whiting.

In the immediate term, the inquiry is to ascertain as a matter of urgency,

(1) Whether any member of the current jury of fifteen sitting in the trial of R v Qaumi and Others fits a description by name and second initial of the person referred to in MFI 96 and 97.

(2) Whether the juror or witness referred to in MFI 98 is the same juror referred to in MFI 96 and 97.

(3) If yes in either case, the jury identification number of the juror or jurors referred to in MFIs 96, 97 and 98.

(4) The nature of the publications on social media referred to by the person referred to as ""John"" in MFI 96.

To facilitate this inquiry, the Sheriff is to be provided with copies of MFIs 96, 97 and 98 and should liaise with the authors of those documents. The Sheriff is to report back to me as soon as possible and as soon as any of the above information is ascertained.”


	
	The jury was advised that an issue had arisen and were permitted to disperse for the day. [6] 
	
	
	The following morning the Sheriff’s delegate [7]  notified me that the Christian name and initial referred to in MFI 96 and 97 fitted the description of one of the members of the jury. Further the investigation confirmed that it was the same juror referred to in MFI 98. The juror’s number was identified. As soon as that information was received, and before the Court assembled for the day, I directed the Court Officer to separate the individual juror from the remaining members of the jury. When Court assembled, the parties were advised of the development. Counsel agreed that separating the juror was appropriate and that it was necessary and appropriate to examine the juror on oath. [8]  The prosecutor was able to provide photographs of the four witnesses who may have been known by the juror in case she did not know his name but recognised his image.
	
	
	After consultations with the parties as to the questions that should be addressed to the juror, the juror was brought into court and examined:
	


“JUROR 00393293

HIS HONOUR: Good morning, just come forward to the witness box, please.

Q. I'm not sure if you remember it, but you were allocated a jury number at the beginning?

A. Yep.

Q. And it is 00393293?

A. I think so, I don't know it off the top of my head.

Q. That's okay, that is what I'm told it is. The reason we give you that number and all of the jurors a number is because you are entitled to be anonymous when you serve on a jury?

A. Yep.

Q. And nothing that is about to happen will undermine your right to be anonymous?

A. Mmm.

Q. I am shortly going to show you a piece of paper which I only I have seen [and] all of the people in the Court? [9] 

A. Yep.

Q. That has what I think is your name on it?

A. Okay.

Q. And I am going to ask you to confirm that by answering yes or no?

A. Okay.

Q. Before we start that, I am going to ask the court officer to swear or affirm you because I am going to ask you some questions.

A. Okay.

SWORN( 10.55AM)

Q. Just take a seat. Can I just show you that piece of paper, (shown). I will just get you to open that and you will see a name on it. Do you see the name?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Is that your name?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Thank you. If that piece of paper could be returned. What I will do is to place it in an envelope and we will mark it as a confidential document that can't be opened except by another Judge or on the order of another Judge or me. I just want to ask you a couple of questions about information that has come to my attention that suggests you might know or have met in the past some of the witnesses in the case?

A. Yep.

Q. First of all, do you know or have you ever met a person called Witness J?

A. Not that I recall, no.

Q. I'm just going to show you a photograph?

A. Yep.

Q. (Shown.) And just ask whether or not that is a person you may have met?

A. Yes, I have seen him before.

Q. If you can return that, please. (Document returned.) The next one is whether or not you know or whether you've ever met a person called Witness I?

A. No.

Q. And I'm just going to show you a photograph, (shown).

A. No, never.

Q. Never seen that person?

A. No.

Q. Just take a moment to look at it and imagine his appearance may have been different when you knew him. Could have had longer hair, could have had a beard?

A. No.

Q. Never seen that person? Thank you. The next one is a witness who has already given evidence and that is the witness I?

A. No, I've never seen him before.

Q. So you remember him giving evidence --

A. Yes, I do.

Q. -- over a number of days?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn't know his name?

A. No, no.

Q. Never seen him before?

A. Never seen him.

Q. I'm just going to show you a photograph

A. Yep.

Q. -- anyway. (Shown.) Never seen that person --

A. Never seen him before.

Q. -- judging from you're shaking your head?

A. No, never.

Q. Thank you, that could be returned. The last name I want to ask you about is, and the name is Witness K?

A. The name doesn't ring a bell at all.

Q. All right, I show you a photograph, (shown).

A. Never seen him before.

Q. Never seen that person before?

A. Nah.

Q. If that could be returned, thank you. (Document returned.) Just going back to the person who I've told you is called Witness J, which is the picture you --

A. Yep.

Q. -- seem to recognise?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell me how you know that person?

A. Just through other friends, acquaintances.

Q. When was the last time you saw him, as best as you can estimate it?

A. About six years ago.

Q. In what circumstances did you know him?

A. Just through friends of friends, going for drives. If I met up with friends, he was there.

Q. Do you feel, from your knowledge of him, now that you've seen his picture, that that might influence you in your job as a juror?

A. No, not at all.

Q. Until I just started asking you these questions and showed you that photograph, had you any idea that you may have known any of the witnesses?

A. No, cause I didn't know him by that name.

Q. Do you remember what name you knew him by?

A. I knew him as Witness J.

Q. Witness J?

A. Yep.

Q. Have you heard the name Witness J mentioned in the evidence?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. When you heard the name, did you think to maybe raise with me the fact that you knew that name?

A. I didn't know cause I didn't know that Witness J was his first name. I always thought Witness J was his first name.

Q. All right, what I will get you to do now is go with the officer?

A. Okay.

Q. What we have done, just so you don't think there is something mysterious or terrible happening, once I found out this information, I had to separate you from the rest of the jury?

A. No, that's fair enough.

Q. Just before you go, have you talked to any of the other jurors about the fact that you knew someone called Witness J?

A. No, no, I never brought it up.

Q. I'm sorry, there is one more thing and that is, do you own and operate a Facebook account?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that a public account or is it private?

A. Private.

Q. The settings on Facebook allow friends to look at your posts. Does yours also allow friends of friends?

A. No, just friends, whoever I have on Facebook can see whatever I have on there.

Q. Have you, in the course of the last 8 weeks or so, become Facebook friends with any of the other jurors?

A. Yes.

Q. How many of them?

A. Four. Three or four, yeah, four.

Q. Have you posted anything on Facebook about the fact that you're serving on a jury?

A. No, not that I can remember, no.

Q. Have you said anything on Facebook about the trial?

A. No.

Q. Thank you. What I will do now is just ask you to go with the officer. We'll keep your separated from the jury at the moment?

A. Okay, yep.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you for coming in.

	The four photographs that were shown to the witness were marked as Exhibit VD XX. With the consent of the parties, the Court Officer was directed to advise the juror that she would remain separated for some time and to tell the remaining (14) members of the jury that the issue was taking some time to resolve and to please be patient. [11] 
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor made an application for discharge of the individual juror. Senior Counsel for both Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi indicated that they opposed the application and that they “wished to continue with a jury of 15, including the juror.” Counsel for the remaining accused were provided with a transcript of the examination of the juror and given time to take instructions. When I returned to the bench the Crown Prosecutor confirmed that he made an application for discharge of the individual juror under s 53B on the basis that there was a “reasonable apprehension of bias”. Each of the accused opposed that application.
	
	
	The Crown acknowledged that the evidence did not establish misconduct but the parties agreed that further information was required in relation to the suggestion that the juror had posted material relevant to the trial on Facebook. I requested that the Sheriff continue the investigation into any Facebook posts and how the person “John” otherwise came to be aware of the possibility that the witness was known by the juror. Later in the day the Crown Prosecutor advised the Court that police had made further contact with the person John:
	
	
	“I don't think they have had a chance to verify it further, other than he said he heard it third hand and didn't see it on Facebook as such, that she was a member of a jury.” [12] 
	
	
	This is directly contrary to the first Investigator’s Note (“John informed Witness J that this female [juror] had published this on social media”) and inconsistent with the second (“John had stated that he heard about [it] via social media, Facebook”). It is a troubling that the Investigators’ Notes that precipitated this inquiry suggested the juror made Facebook posts concerning her participation in the trial, a matter that may (depending on the nature of the posts) suggest misconduct on the juror’s part whereas it now appears that this suggestion is erroneous. It is difficult to know what to make of that inconsistency. It serves to highlight the imperfect nature of inquiries that can be conducted in the course of the trial. It also demonstrates why the Jury Act casts the responsibility of investigating such matters with the Sheriff rather than with the police who are active participants in the trial.
	
	
	At 3.45pm on Friday I received a further report from the Sheriff’s delegate. It comprised notes of an interview with “John”:
	
	
	“Interview with ‘John’
	
	
	Name and contact provided by Inspector Brown
	
	
	R-V- Quami & others
	
	
	12.40pm
	
	
	Initial contact with John was 9.30am. I advised John that I would like to ask him about some recent events that had been documented and that his name had been given as a contacted. John advised that he had spoken to Detective Brown and he had provided him with some information. I advised John that I was the Jury Coordinator and therefore it was a matter involving a jury that I was required to document the conversation and I would be compiling written report. I then arranged to call John between 12:30-12:45 pm due to his work commitments.
	
	
	Interview via phone:
	
	
	John indicated that he was a friend of Witness J – he knew Witness J by ‘Witness J’
	
	
	John stated that he was aware that information had been provided that a friend of his and Witness J’s may be on a jury – he stated that he was ‘aware of this but it was not 100%’.
	
	
	John stated that the person that was identified was an associate of his and he knew this person from friends of friends and that he knew the identified persons ex-boyfriend
	
	
	John said that he had not seen this person in a while and it had been a few months. His relationship with this person was one that they would say hello to each other but did not ‘hang out’ together. The last time he saw her when he was out driving and said ‘hi’.
	
	
	John confirmed that he is a current friend of the person identified on Facebook and has been Facebook friends for approximately 1 year.
	
	
	John stated that he has not seen any post or posts on Facebook referring to the trial from this person he also stated that he did not go out of his way to follow this person on Facebook.
	
	
	John said he had heard from friends of friends that this person was on a trial, he said he was aware that Witness J was to give evidence and that it was not hard to work out that it may have been the same trial.
	
	
	He again stated that there were no posts or any information posted on Facebook by the identified person.
	
	
	I advised John as this is a current matter and a report was to be compiled that he was not to speak to any other parties about the conversation that had just taken place.”
	
	
	The contents of that note were brought to the attention of the parties on Monday 6 June 2016. It did not alter the position that each took to the application. The parties agreed that the interview with “John” tended to confirm parts of the juror’s evidence. It was submitted that it supported the proposition that the contact between the juror and the witness was “fleeting”. [13] 
	
	
	A further response from the Sheriff’s delegate concerned an interview with the police officer who was the author of the third Investigator’s Note (referred to in paragraph [7] above. The parties agreed that this evidence had no relevance to the issue now at hand.
	
	
	The final piece of evidence was Exhibit VD 36. This was a letter from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions annexing a list of particulars of conduct on the part of some jurors and two of the accused. This was tendered by Farhad Qaumi in support of the proposition that “it suggests that the motivation [to discharge the individual juror] is not related to prior associations of the juror but just the way she is reacting in court.”
	


SUBMISSIONS


	
	The parties made submissions on the question of whether I should exercise my discretion under s 53B to discharge the individual juror on the grounds of apprehended bias. The question of misconduct was put to one side while the Sheriff’s investigation continued.
	
	
	The Crown’s position was that the precise nature of the relationship between the witness and the juror was not known. The Crown noted that the investigations that can properly and practically be undertaken in the course of a trial are not exhaustive and “there can never be certainty as to whether all the circumstances … surrounding the connection between this juror and the witness”. The Crown accepted that I should decide the case on the evidence of the juror and did not seek to impeach her credibility. He submitted that it could not be known what influence that relationship might have on the juror once the witness entered the witness box and began to give evidence. The Crown emphasised the importance of the witness’s evidence to the issues in the trial. He is expected to give very important evidence in relation to the events that occurred in preparation for the first shooting incident – that is, the Hamzy murder. Those events are subject to significant dispute as is demonstrated by the conduct of the trial to this point. The Crown anticipates that the evidence of the witness will be subject to substantial attack by the accused. Nobody on the defence side disputed that proposition.
	
	
	On being challenged by counsel for the accused Zarshoy, the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that he could not identify whether any bias would be favourable or adverse. In other words, it was not known whether the juror’s personal knowledge of the witness would make her more or less likely to accept his evidence or be unable impartially to evaluate his evidence. However, it was submitted that this only served to emphasise that the impact of the connection between the witness and the juror could not be known. It was submitted that because the nature of the influence was not known, including to the juror herself, directions to the jury were not capable of overcoming the potential for prejudice.
	
	
	The Court took me to a number of relevant cases including Webb v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41, R v Bright [2000] NSWCCA 258 and R v Moore [2014] NSWSC 1955.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC (for Farhad Qaumi) submitted (correctly) that the mere fact that a juror knows a witness is not a disqualifying factor. He observed that it is often the case in country trials that jurors know the witnesses. They are only excused if that knowledge may influence them in their role as a judge of the facts. On the other hand, Mr Stratton accepted that such a juror would generally be excused at the beginning of the trial if it was expected that the witness would give evidence as to controversial matters. He also accepted that, given the rigour with which the empanelment process was conducted in the present case – wherein any possible connection or concern expressed by the member of the jury pool resulted in the person being excused – it is likely that the juror would have been excused if the information now known had come to light at the outset.
	
	
	Mr Stratton distinguished the cases of R v Finley [2016] NSWSC 327 and R v Moore. In each of those cases, individual jurors (and then the whole jury) were discharged. However, it was submitted that in each case the relationship between the juror and the witness (or participant in the trial) was “of a much higher nature”. Further, in Finley at least, the discharge application was made jointly and came at a very early stage of the trial. Mr Stratton placed heavy reliance on the decision in Webb v The Queen where the majority of the High Court was satisfied that an incident in which a juror gave flowers to members of the deceased victim’s family was capable of being cured by direction.
	
	
	Mr Stratton noted that the discharge was a discretionary decision. He submitted that it was significant that, while we have the “luxury of 15 jurors”, the trial still has a number of months to run. He said that the test for discharge was one of necessity and relied on the decision in R v Wood [2008] NSWSC 817 where it was said at [31]:
	


“The exercise of a trial judge’s discretion to discharge a jury when some incident occurs during a trial which may adversely affect its fairness depends upon the principle of necessity state in Winsor v R (1866) LR 1 QB 390. There must be evidence a ‘high degree of need for such discharge … such as in the wider sense of the word might be denoted by necessity’ per Erle CJ at 394.”


	
	When I asked whether it was not of concern to the accused men that an important prosecution witness may have some acquaintance with one of the jurors, Mr Stratton submitted:
	


“The fact that the accused are united in opposing the application should give your Honour some comfort.” [14] 


	
	After tendering Exhibit VD 36, Mr Stratton submitted:
	


“Leaving aside what appears to be an element of creative writing, it seems to suggest that the Crown are attempting to well, the Crown or those instructing him, are attempting to eliminate from the jury anyone who reacts with empathy to the accused and it is not limited to the juror in question, but in fact to three of the 15 jurors.”


	
	Mr Young SC (for Mumtaz Qaumi) essentially adopted the submissions of Mr Stratton although he also raised concerns about the outstanding issue surrounding “this Facebook business”. [15] 
	
	
	Ms Carroll (for Jamil Qaumi) adopted Mr Stratton’s submissions but went on to emphasise that “there is no clear evidence that there was any kind of relationship between the two of them directly” and it was not clear whether the juror had even “had conversations with him directly”. [16]  Ms Carroll relied on the juror’s clear and immediate statement that the contact that they had would not influence her and noted that the contact was around six years ago. Ms Carroll went on to submit that the unnecessary removal of this juror may create an “imbalance” in the jury where relationships have been formed over nine weeks and may even result in “resentment” in other members of the jury. She noted that all members of the jury appear to be “paying close attention”. [17] 
	
	
	Ms Carroll conceded that the juror would probably have been excused if the matter had emerged prior to empanelment but noted that at that stage “we had just under 300 jurors” and thus “wouldn’t take any risks”. She said that we are now two months into the trial and should “try to hold on to as many of the 15 as we can”. She told me about a recent case in which she appeared where a number of jurors were “lost” during the course of a lengthy deliberation.
	
	
	Mr Driels (on behalf of Mr Zarshoy) raised concerns about what he described as the “compounding” of considerations under s 53A with those under s 53B. The former section is (relevantly) concerned with misconduct while the current application is based on a reasonable apprehension of bias. He said that the misconduct issue has been “floating around and it colours the consideration now, in a sense, of what the position is with regard to the discretionary discharge”. This was a reference to something that happened earlier in the trial when (on 24 May 2016) the Crown raised a concern of some interaction between two of the accused and some members of the jury which had apparently been observed on 17, 18 and 20 May 2016. [18]  As a result of that incident, I directed the Sheriff (or those in control of such matters) to maintain the CCTV footage that is captured by a number of in court cameras. [19]  Since that time I have been told by the Sheriff’s representatives that the footage has been maintained and that digital copies are being made. I have also been told that there is no camera that captures clearly the behaviour of the jury. No application has been made based on this alleged interaction between the jury and the accused. As I understand it, the point of Mr Driels submission is that I should not conflate the non-particularised suggestion of misconduct with the evidence concerning the present application. I accept that submission without reservation.
	
	
	It was after Mr Driels had criticised the lack of particularity of the Crown’s assertion of interaction between the jury and the accused that the Crown served the document that Mr Stratton tendered as Exhibit VD 36. Having read that, I confirm my acceptance of Mr Driels’ submission that the issue (if there is one, noting that no application has been made in respect of it) is completely separate from issue with which I am here concerned. It is an irrelevancy.
	
	
	Mr Driels went on to submit that the juror’s evidence is clear that she will not be influenced by her personal contact with the witness. Mr Driels submitted that bias must be “one way or the other and for it to be reasonable, you have to know which way the bias is.” He submitted that what happened during the empanelment process, and what may have happened at that stage if the connexion was then known, is irrelevant. It was “a different time. We had so many people, hundreds of them, to decide. There was still room to move.” [20]  He went on to observe that “time and effort invested into the juror” and “[she] should not just be tossed on the basis of ‘I don’t know what the bias is but there may be a bias.’”
	
	
	Mr Clarke (on behalf of Mr Kalal) stressed the importance of the position of the parties and, in particular, urged me to take into account that his client “strongly resisted” the removal of the juror. He stressed that the evidence shows that “[the juror’s] knowledge of this man is distant”. They are no more than “friends of friends”. He submitted that the Crown had “overstretched in terms of the test in this case” and that:
	


“… the person sitting in the back of the Court listening to this, I would venture, would, if they were in possession of all the facts, be less troubled by this lady's ability to actually continue her duties, listening to what she's said, because that is the evidence, and knowing something about the case and the place in which this witness may or may not fit.” [21] 


	
	In reply, the Crown Prosecutor stressed that the bias may be “subconscious” and that such a bias was difficult to direct against. He distinguished directions that might cure prejudice created by (for example) publicity where the nature of the publicity is known with a situation where “a person who has prior knowledge which no-one else knows about”.
	


THE MISCONDUCT ISSUE MUST BE DISREGARDED


	
	As I said in summarising the submissions made on behalf of Mr Zarshoy, it is critical to disregard the hints and suggestions that the juror may have misconducted herself.
	
	
	The material in the third Investigator’s Note has no relevance to the issue here to be determined. While I accept the good intentions of Sgt Whiting, her belief that “the juror may have been complicit in the fraud” was not substantiated in any way. Nor was it pressed as a matter of relevance to the present application. Her conversation with the Crown Prosecutor is a complete irrelevancy, cannot be tested, and should not have been included in the material. Having said that, I accept that the Crown was simply attempting to provide me with all material that may have some bearing on the question of whether the juror should be discharged and that this occurred at a time when misconduct (by failing to disclose her knowledge of the witness or by posting information on Facebook) appeared to be a live issue.
	
	
	The third Sheriff’s Delegate’s report encompassed further statements by Sgt Whiting. They are utterly irrelevant and I have disregarded them.
	
	
	The “Facebook business” (as described by Senior Counsel) must also be disregarded. As I have said, the original Investigator’s Notes suggested that the juror had posted material on Facebook. However, the Crown has now advised that the person “John” has since denied seeing such posts in his conversations with police. Similarly, he told the Sheriff’s Delegate that his knowledge of the matter came from “friends of friends” (that is actual friends, not virtual or Facebook friends). He said “there were no posts or any information on Facebook by the identified [juror]”. [22] 
	
	
	Finally, the suggestion of some interaction between two of the accused and some members of the jury must play no part in my consideration of the present application. Until the tender of Exhibit VD 36, which was tendered to establish an improper purpose in making the application, there was no evidence of such conduct before me. I have not observed any interaction that I considered to be inappropriate or improper. Since the Crown first raised the matter, I have been alert to the issue and have attempted to observe both the dock and the jury box and have seen nothing untoward in the occasional and inevitable glances that pass between the accused and the jury. Prior to the Crown raising the matter my observations were more general and, based on my own observations, I cannot exclude the possibility of the kind of conduct described. When all is said and done, the suggestion of some “flirting” [23]  across the court room is in no way relevant to a determination of the present application. I disregarded it.
	


THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS OF FACT ON THE APPLICATION


	
	As has been observed in argument and in some of the decided cases “the investigation of such incidents during the course of the trial is not exhaustive”: Webb v The Queen at 52 (Mason CJ and McHugh J). Further, “seldom, if ever, is there a detailed cross-examination of the juror by counsel or the judge”: Webb v The Queen at 52.
	


Power to Examine the Juror


	
	In R v Moore, Garling J considered, but did not resolve, the question of whether “it is appropriate to examine the juror on oath” and whether “upon the proper interpretation of the Jury Act, the court retains any power at law which it otherwise had to examine a juror”: R v Moore at [4]-[6]. His Honour noted at [5] that “the Jury Act does not directly grant the that power” and referred to the decision in BG v R [2012] NSWCCA 139 where Adamson J at [87] considered that it was not appropriate to examine the juror. In those cases, the information upon which the application to discharge was based emanated from the jury itself. In each case “there was no reason to doubt the veracity of the report she received from the jury via its note”: BG v R at [87].
	
	
	The situation that has arisen in this trial is different. The information came from the police who were made aware of the possible association between the juror and the witness by the witness who, in turn, was told about the possibility by “John”. At the time the incident arose, it was not clear whether the juror in question was in fact a member of the present jury. There was a reference in the Investigator’s Notes to a “six month trial” but this particular trial was not identified. Inquiries with both the District Court and Supreme Court suggested that this was the only trial that commenced with an estimate of six months but there were around four other current trials that had proceeded over several months. [24]  Once the Sheriff’s investigation removed any doubt that the person referred to by “John” was a member of this jury, the parties agreed that it was appropriate to examine her and were in general agreement as to the extent of that examination.
	
	
	The Jury Act specifically permits an examination of a juror in certain circumstances: see, for example, ss 55D (examination concerning exposure to publicity), 55DA (examination concerning juror making private inquiries) and 56 (examination concerning jury’s inability to agree). However, as Garling J noted, there is no express power to examine a juror in relation to matters that arise under s 53B (discretionary discharge of an individual juror). Section 53B(b) relevantly provides:
	


“53B The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:

(b) it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial or coronial inquest, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason, or…”


	
	The words in parenthesis in that paragraph support the proposition that the Court retains a power to examine a juror. In circumstances such as the present, it would be impossible to exercise the discretion of the Court without that power. That is because this is not the usual case where the juror raised the fact that they know a witness or something about the case.
	


The Juror’s Evidence


	
	I was satisfied that the juror answered the questions addressed to her truthfully. In making that finding, I am conscious of the fact that the juror was not cross-examined and that “a juror involved in an irregular incident may feel defensive about [her] role” and “may seek to put the best light on the matter”: Webb v The Queen at 52. However, she did not present as defensive. On the critical question, she denied knowing the name of the witness but, when shown a photograph, responded without hesitation “Yes, I have seen him before.” She explained that she knew him by his nickname (“Witness J”). “John” told the Sheriff’s delegate that he knew the witness by that nickname.
	
	
	The juror’s evidence also receives support from other parts of John’s statements to the Sheriff’s delegate. In particular, the circumstance of the acquaintance is similar (“friends of friends”). His statement tends to confirm the juror’s denials of posting information about the trial on Facebook. While the statement to the Sheriff’s delegate is vague as to the timing of contact between the juror and the witness, Detective Veness’s Investigator’s Note records that Witness J “last saw [the juror] four (4) to five (5) years ago at a friend’s birthday party.” The juror’s evidence was that she last saw the witness “about six years ago”.
	


Findings Relevant to Determination of the Issue


	
	On the limited material available, my findings are these:
	



	
	The evidence to be given by Witness J is important evidence in the trial and his credibility is likely to be subject to substantial attack by the defence.
	
	
	Witness J is a cousin of Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi, three of the five accused on trial.
	
	
	The juror and the witness are known to one another by socialising in the same circle of friends in the past.
	
	
	They are best described, not as friends, but as “friends of friends” or past acquaintances.
	
	
	The last contact between them occurred around four to six years ago.
	
	
	There is no evidence of any recent contact between them.
	
	
	The contact between them was sufficiently frequent that the witness instantly recognised a photograph of the witness. I reject the suggestion that their association can properly be described as “fleeting”.
	
	
	The juror did not know the real name of the witness and wrongly believed his first name was “Witness J”. This suggests that their association was not a close friendship. Rather it is an association through mutual friends.
	
	
	The juror believes that her capacity to judge the case impartially is not compromised by her knowledge of the witness.
	
	
	There is no evidence that the juror misconducted herself by failing to disclose her association with Witness J at an earlier stage. She did not know of that association until she was shown the photograph at which time she immediately indicated that she knew him.
	


THE LEGISLATION AND AUTHORITIES


	
	Section 53B(b) provides a discretion to discharge an individual juror in certain defined circumstances. Relevantly, these include where the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with a witness or because of any reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the juror.
	
	
	In Webb v The Queen, Mason CJ and McHugh J said at 52:
	


“[T]he reasonable apprehension test … allows a margin of error in evaluating the facts as elicited. It concentrates not on whether there is a danger of bias as an objective fact, but whether a fair minded and informed person might apprehend that bias existed.”


	
	Their Honours went on to explain that, “in considering whether a reasonable apprehension of bias exists, it is therefore necessary to consider the likely effect of the judge’s directions (if any) as well as the irregularity in question”.
	
	
	The fact that a juror does not believe that they will be biased is not decisive. The test is an objective one based on the reactions of the hypothetical fair minded or reasonable observer. It is concerned with the appearance of justice. Subject to the qualifications that the jury can receive directions calculated to cure a potential problem, the test for apprehended bias is the same in the case of a jury as it is in the case of a judicial officers or administrative decision maker: see Webb v The Queen at [53]. 
	
	
	In Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488, the High Court, at [11] stated the the test for apprehended bias in a judicial officer as follows:
	


“…whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.”


	
	This is sometimes called the “might/might” test. It is concerned with appearances and possibilities. In Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ explained at [7] that the principle that the tribunal be independent and impartial is so important that “even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined”.
	
	
	The test is satisfied if there is a “real and not remote” possibility that a judicial officer might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of an issue: Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy at [7]. In Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs v Jia (2001) 205 CLR 507, Kirby J explained at [134] that the test looks to “how the decision, and the process of arriving at it, might appear to the persons affected and to the public, judged reasonably and objectively.
	
	
	The application of the apprehended bias principle has two steps. First, the identification of the factors that might lead the tribunal to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. Secondly, an assessment of the reasonableness of the connection between the matter and the possibility of departure from impartial decision-making: Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy at [8]; CUR24 v DPP [2012] NSWCA 65 at [35].
	
	
	In considering the evidence of the juror that she does not believe that her knowledge of the witness will affect her impartiality, it is important to remember that the influence might be subtle and sub-conscious. This was explained in Sun Zhan Qui v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] FCA 1488; 81 FCR 71 where North J observed:
	
	
	“A decision-maker may not be open to persuasion and, at the same time, not recognise that limitation. Indeed, a characteristic of prejudice is the lack of recognition by the holder. Some judges, including myself, who have in recent years attended gender and race awareness programmes, have been struck by the unrecognised nature of the baggage which we carry on such issues. Decisions made upon assumptions or prejudgments concerning race or gender have been made by many well-meaning judges, unaware of the assumptions or preconceptions which, in fact, governed their decision-making.”
	
	
	The court should not too readily accede to an application to discharge an individual juror when it is opposed; particularly, I think, when it opposed by the accused. In Wu v The Queen,  McHugh J said at [27]:
	
	
	“For hundreds of years, the common law has insisted that no person be convicted of serious crime without the unanimous verdict of 12 jurors. If even one juror died or had to be discharged, the common law required the rest of the jury to be discharged. The trial had to recommence with a new jury of 12. In various jurisdictions, including New South Wales, the dictates of expense and convenience have introduced legislative change which now authorises the judge in a criminal trial, after the death or discharge of a juror, to make an order that permits a person to be convicted by a jury of less than 12.”
	
	
	In the present trial, an order was made to empanel a jury of fifteen pursuant to s 19 of the Jury Act: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 17) (Additional Jurors) [2016] NSWSC 338. I do not consider the fact that we have what was described in argument as “the luxury” of fifteen jurors to be relevant to the decision that I now have to make. Given the anticipated length of the trial, it would be far preferable to continue with fifteen jurors to reduce the risk that the number may ultimately fall below twelve.
	
	
	Further, each of the accused is entitled to the group that was randomly selected at the outset unless a proper application of principle means that a juror must be discharged. As Kirby J (dissenting in the outcome) said in Wu v The Queen at [45]:
	
	
	“The jury must be ‘a body of persons representative of the wider community’. Obviously, to the extent that the historical and statutory number of twelve is reduced, there is an equivalent reduction of the degree to which the jury may reflect the diversity of the makeup of the community in Australia. Unlike the community of village England from which jurors were historically drawn in that country, the Australian community today is highly diverse in its composition. It reflects differences of age, gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, sexuality and other grounds, as well as in life's experiences and attitudes.”
	
	
	The same principles apply where a jury of fifteen is reduced as a result of the discretionary discharge of an individual juror. However, the existence of the discretion to discharge and the availability in appropriate cases to empanel a jury of fifteen, show that there are cases where the diversity of the originally selected jury may be altered by circumstances that arise in the course of the trial. Ultimately the question must be approached in accordance with the terms of the statute and the authorities that explain the apprehension of bias test.
	
	
	I should address a couple of legal issues that arose in the course of submissions lest there be any ambiguity over the approach that I took to those matters.
	
	
	First, as I acknowledged on the second day of argument, the thought process or assumptions behind some of my questions of counsel on one issue was erroneous. [25]  I accept the submissions of various defence counsel that the fact that I would have excused the juror had the matter came to light in the course of the empanelment procedure is not a relevant consideration. I accept that the situation is now different – as Mr Driels put it “a different time. Different time.” [26]  But more importantly, the statutory function and discretion is different. During the pre-empanelment process, the power was to excuse a potential juror under s 38. Section 38(7) requires (or calls on) a jury “to apply to be excused if they consider that they are not able to give impartial consideration to the case”. That involves a subjective assessment by the juror themselves. The discretion to discharge a juror under s 53B involves the application of an objective test based on the possible and reasonable reactions of a fair minded observer of the proceedings. There is little doubt, as counsel submitted, that the power to excuse at the beginning of the trial will more readily be exercised than the power to discharge a juror after they have been empanelled.
	
	
	Insofar as this appears to be contrary to the approach taken by Garling J in R v Moore at [14], I consider that his Honour did not proceed on the basis that the matter was determinative. It is also clear from Garling J’s judgment (see, for example, at [5]) that his Honour’s judgment was delivered under the pressure of time in the course of a trial. [27]  It appears that no submissions were directed to the issue in R v Moore. It appears to me to be an obiter, or even throw-away, remark. In any event, and with complete respect, I do not consider that it is appropriate to adopt the same reasoning.
	
	
	Second, I do not accept the submission that it was incumbent on the Crown to identify whether the “bias” asserted was favourable or adverse to the witness (or to one or other of the parties). Apart from the fact that this involves an unduly narrow approach to the expression “apprehended bias”, the section is cast in deliberately wider terms in that it closes with the words “or any similar reason”. In a situation such as the present, a requirement for the decision maker to determine precisely how the juror might react is unworkable.
	
	
	Third, I accept that part of the process (and legal test) involves considering whether the parties (as well as the fair minded observer) might consider that the juror would not be able to bring an impartial mind to the issue. However, in circumstances where the parties take opposing positions, it is difficult to see how the litigants’ perceptions (at the time of the argument) could take precedence over that of the putative fair minded observer. Further, a party’s perception may change over time. For example, if the juror in the present circumstances were to remain on the jury and the jury convicted, it may be that the accused would (in retrospect) wonder whether her personal acquaintanceship with the witness may have affected her capacity to judge his evidence impartially. It is important in the present case that each of the accused resists the application to discharge the jury as can be seen by the judgment of Kirby J in Wu v The Queen. However, the Crown is also a party and takes a contrary view. Ultimately, while the position taken by the parties at the hearing informs the content of the debate, the legal test involves a consideration of what the parties and the fair minded observer might objectively and reasonably apprehend.
	


CONCLUSION


	
	While I accept that the evidence of the connection between the juror and the witness does not suggest a close relationship, there is no doubt that they socialized together. At the very least they shared a number of mutual friends. The fact that she recognized him instantly upon seeing his photograph shows that their acquaintanceship was more than a fleeting one.
	
	
	The passage of six years (on the juror’s evidence) or four to five years (on the information provided to the police by the witness) reduces the risk that she might be influenced (consciously or sub-consciously) in assessing his evidence. On the other hand, her recognition of the photograph after that length of time demonstrates that at that stage the pair spent some time in one another’s company.
	
	
	It is necessary to take into account that the limited nature of the inquiry into the connection between the witness and the juror means that the information upon which the decision must be made is imperfect.
	
	
	I have given considerable weight to the fact that the juror stated unambiguously that she did not believe that her knowledge of the witness would not influence her or compromise her capacity to perform her task. However, I accept that the juror may not know how (or whether) her past connection to the witness may influence her. The impact on her capacity to judge the case impartially may be sub-conscious. Her belief now may change when she sees the witness in the witness box or when she sees him cross-examined. The fact that her anonymity as a juror is compromised to the extent that the witness knows her may have some impact on the way she approaches her task. In saying those things, I am not suggesting an actual bias. Rather, I am considering what a fair minded observer might apprehend.
	
	
	The importance of the evidence, the relationship between the witness and the accused, and the fact that the evidence will be subject to a substantial credibility attack are significant factors.
	
	
	The fair-minded observer would understand all of these things. They would also understand that the juror would be directed that she must disregard any knowledge that she has of the witness, any past association with him and should assess his evidence only on the evidence adduced in court and the legal directions that are provided in the course of the trial and in the summing up.
	
	
	To adopt the two steps referred to in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy, [28]  I identified the above factors as matters that might lead the juror to assess the evidence of the witness and the issues in the trial other than on their legal and factual merits. Having identified those factors, I assessed the reasonableness of the connection between those factors and the possibility of a departure from impartial decision maker.
	
	
	I have concluded that a fair minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the juror might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the questions that the jury is required to decide. The observer might reach that conclusion in spite of the directions that the juror will receive and in the understanding that jurors generally are capable of disregarding prejudicial material and dutifully follow directions.
	
	
	For those reasons, I am satisfied that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the juror. In the exercise of the discretion under s 53B(b) of the Jury Act I will make an order discharging Juror 00393293.
	


SECTION 53C: DISCRETION TO CONTINUE TRIAL OR DISCHARGE THE WHOLE JURY


	
	Section 53C of the Jury Act provides:
	


“(1) If a juror dies, or the court or coroner discharges a juror in the course of a trial or coronial inquest, the court or coroner must:

(a) discharge the jury if the court or coroner is of the opinion that to continue the trial or coronial inquest with the remaining jurors would give rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice, or

(b) if of the opinion that there is no such risk and subject to section 22, order that the trial or coronial inquest continue with a reduced number of jurors.”


	
	In Wu v The Queen, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said:
	


“6. The decision to discharge a juror and the decision to proceed with a jury of less than 12 are distinct steps and often will be affected by different considerations. The conduct of, or circumstances affecting, a single juror may require that juror's discharge. That conduct or those circumstances may not affect the other members of the jury or suggest that they cannot perform their task satisfactorily.

…

8. It is plainly desirable that a judge exercising the power to discharge a juror and the power to proceed with a jury of less than 12 members does so in unmistakable terms. Ordinarily that will be done by the trial judge making two separate orders: an order discharging the juror and an order that the trial proceed before the jury constituted by the remaining jurors.”


	
	McHugh J said:
	


“28. But no-one should think that, once a juror dies or is discharged, the trial should automatically continue with the remaining jurors.”


	
	Kirby J (dissenting in the outcome) also made it clear at [67] that the question of whether the trial should continue must receive separate consideration.
	
	
	There is nothing in the evidence that suggests that any of the remaining jurors may have been influenced by the individual juror’s knowledge of the witness. Accepting the evidence of the juror, it is unlikely (or impossible) that the matter was discussed with the other jurors. This is because she did not realise the connection until she was shown the photograph in the course of her examination on the voir dire. While she acknowledged that she had become “Facebook friends” with three or four of her fellow jurors, she denied having posted anything to do with the trial. As the matters stands, there is no evidence that she did.
	
	
	For those reasons, I am of the opinion that there is no risk that continuing with the trial would give rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Accordingly, I will order under s 53C of the Jury Act that the trial continue with a jury of 14.
	


ORDERS


	
	I make the following orders:
	



	
	Pursuant to s 53B(b) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) Juror 00393293 is discharged.
	
	
	Pursuant to s 53C(1) of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) the trial is to continue with a reduced number (14) jurors.

 Chao Hick Tin JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
Introduction
1       Section 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2012 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) criminalises the giving of information to a public servant which one “knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him”. This offence can be committed in a wide range of situations for a wide range of purposes. A passenger who lies to the traffic police that he was the driver of the car to protect an intoxicated friend who was driving, a father who lies to a school principal about his home address to get his child into primary school, or a public servant who lies to his boss at work to conceal certain errors he made, may all be found guilty of an offence under s 182 of the Penal Code (“s 182”).
2       Thus, to define the interest that the offence was intended to protect is difficult. The interests at stake vary across the wide range of different possible situations. Nevertheless, it may generally be said that at the heart of the offence lies the 
harm
 that would be caused from lying to a 
public servant
 (as opposed to any other ordinary person) because of the 
unique powers and duties
 that a public servant generally has – as the provision specifies, the offender must 
intend
 or 
know
 that his false information will likely cause the public servant to misuse his lawful powers or act in breach of his duties as a public servant.
3       This appeal concerns an ex-school principal who pleaded guilty to an offence under s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code 1985”) for falsely telling his Cluster Superintendent that he was 
not
 having an extra-marital affair with a school vendor. The district judge (“the DJ”) meted out a sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment, and the appellant appeals against his sentence on the basis that the DJ erred in fact and law, and that the sentence is manifestly excessive. This appeal gives us the opportunity to provide some guidance on the correct approach to sentencing s 182 offences, which hopefully will help lower courts in dealing with the myriad of factual situations that come before them, and enable a greater degree of consistency in sentencing. We appointed a young amicus curiae, Mr Benny Tan Zhi Peng (“the amicus”), to address us on the appropriate sentencing guidelines for offences under s 182 of the Penal Code. We were greatly assisted by his written brief and would like to record our gratitude.
Background facts
4       Mr Koh Yong Chiah (“the Appellant”) is a 61-year-old male Singapore citizen who was a principal at four different schools from 1995 to 2012 and a Cluster Superintendent for three months in 1999, where he supervised school principals.
[note: 1]
 Specifically,
(a)     from 1999 to 2002, he was the principal of the Chinese High School (“CHS”)
[note: 2]
;
(b)     from January 2003 to December 2009, he was the principal of Jurong Junior College (“JJC”) 
[note: 3]
; and
(c)     from December 2009 to September 2012, he was the principal of River Valley High School (“RVHS”) 
[note: 4]
.
5       He became acquainted with one Loke Wai Lin Ivy (“Ivy”) in 2000, when Ivy approached CHS with a view to getting the school to participate in a community service project in China.
[note: 5]
 At that time, Ivy was working at the Television Corporation of Singapore.
[note: 6]
 But since 2005, she incorporated and became the director and majority shareholder of Education Architects 21 Pte Ltd and Education Incorporation Pte Ltd (“Ivy’s Companies”)
[note: 7]
, both of which provide education-related services including the organising of overseas learning journeys, conference management and assorted logistical services
[note: 8]
.
6       The Appellant and Ivy developed a sexual relationship and their first sexual encounter was during a CHS community service trip to Lijiang, China in March 2001.
[note: 9]
 This sexual relationship lasted up to and including the period that the Appellant was the principal of RVHS.
The procurement process for school contracts
7       As principal of the various schools, the Appellant was on a panel that approved contracts awarded by his school to vendors.
[note: 10]
 The teaching staff would prepare the specifications for an Invitation to Quote, outlining the goods and services required, evaluate the bids received from vendors and recommend the preferred bid to the Quotation Approval Panel (“QAP”).
[note: 11]
 The QAP would approve the bid if they agreed with the recommendations and thereafter, the contract would be awarded to the vendor.
[note: 12]
 In JJC, the Appellant was one of three persons on the QAP, and in RVHS, the Appellant was one of two persons on the QAP.
[note: 13]
8       From May to November 2005, as principal of JJC and a member of its QAP, the Appellant signed off on 
six contracts
 with a total value of 
$162,491.25
 to Ivy’s Companies.
[note: 14]
The Appellant’s false statement
9       In November 2005, the Ministry of Education’s (“MOE”) Director General of Education (“DGE”) received an anonymous complaint alleging that the Appellant was having an affair with Ivy and that they behaved inappropriately on school premises and on overseas school trips.
[note: 15]
 The DGE instructed the Appellant’s Cluster Superintendent, Ms Chia Ban Tin (“Ms Chia”), to interview the Appellant.
[note: 16]
 Ms Chia first inquired into Ivy’s background and found out that she was the director of a company which was a service provider of JJC.
[note: 17]
10     On 24 November 2005, Ms Chia interviewed the Appellant. She asked him whether he had an affair with Ivy. The Appellant falsely stated to Ms Chia, a public servant, that he was not having an affair with Ivy, information he knew to be false.
[note: 18]
 Ms Chia then reminded the Appellant about the importance of maintaining the integrity of the procurement process and advised the Appellant against any personal involvement with Ivy, whose company was bidding for contracts and providing services to JJC.
[note: 19]
 The Appellant acknowledged that he understood her advice. This false statement is the subject of the first and only proceeded charge against the Appellant, which the Appellant pleaded guilty to. It states:
You, Koh Yong Chiah... are charged that you, on 24 November 2005, in Singapore, being a Principal of Jurong Junior College (“JJC”), did give false information orally to a public servant, namely one Chia Ban Tin (“Chia”), a Cluster Superintendent of the Ministry of Education, who was tasked to assess the truth of an anonymous complaint lodged against you alleging misconduct in having an affair with one Loke Wai Lin (“Loke”), a Director of Education Architects 21 Pte Ltd, a service provider of JJC, to wit, by falsely stating that you were not having an affair with Loke, which information you knew to be false, knowing it likely that you would thereby cause Chia to do an act, namely submit a report to the Director General of Education that there was no such misconduct on your part, which Chia, as a public servant, ought not to do if the true state of facts respecting which such information was given were known to her, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 182 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224 (1985 Rev Ed).
11     Following the interview, Ms Chia submitted a report to the DGE stating that the Appellant had denied having an inappropriate relationship with Ivy. The Appellant’s false statement led Ms Chia to omit to inform the DGE that the Appellant was involved in a sexual relationship with Ivy.
[note: 20]
 The Appellant knew it was likely that, after the interview, Ms Chia would inform the DGE that the Appellant denied being involved in an extra-marital affair with Ivy. Further, a day after the interview, the Appellant called and spoke to the DGE about the allegations levelled against him.
[note: 21]
12     If the Appellant had been truthful, MOE would have ensured that he was no longer allowed to approve contracts awarded to Ivy’s Companies. The Appellant may also have been subject to disciplinary proceedings.
[note: 22]
Award of contracts following the Appellant’s false statement
13     After the 24 November 2005 interview, the Appellant continued to sign off on contracts awarded to Ivy’s Companies.
[note: 23]
 As principal of JJC, he approved another 48 contracts to Ivy’s Companies.
[note: 24]
 As principal of RVHS, he approved 39 contracts to Ivy’s Companies.
[note: 25]
 Between 2005 and 2012, as a member of the QAP of JJC and RVHS, the Appellant approved 
$3.2m
 worth of contracts awarded to Ivy’s Companies.
[note: 26]
 Further, during this period, the Appellant would sometimes help Ivy amend some of the details of the itinerary or quotations before she submitted her bid to JJC and RVHS.
[note: 27]
 Specifically, in September 2012, the Appellant vetted Ivy’s quotation in relation to a study trip to Japan and advised her on how to negotiate the contract with the JJC staff; nevertheless, the contract was eventually awarded to 
another vendor
 based on the recommendation of the QAP.
[note: 28]
14     On 23 March 2012, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) received information that the Appellant was suspected of being involved in corrupt dealings with Ivy and that there was impropriety in the procurement processes given his relationship with Ivy.
[note: 29]
 During the investigations, on 18 December 2012, the Appellant falsely told a Chief Special Investigator of CPIB that his 
first
 sexual contact with Ivy was in 
2006
 (when it was in fact in 2001). This false statement is the subject of the 
second charge
 against the Appellant under s 28(
b
) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed), which the Appellant has consented to have taken into consideration (“TIC”) for the purposes of sentencing. The Appellant was not eventually charged with corruption or any further offence relating to his role in approving contracts to Ivy’s Companies.
The DJ’s decision
15     As mentioned, the DJ sentenced the Appellant to four weeks’ imprisonment (
PP v Koh Yong Chiah
 
[2016] SGDC 21
 (“the GD”) at [13]). The DJ found that the dominant and relevant sentencing principle was general deterrence, and a custodial sentence was clearly warranted and justified.
[note: 30]
 In the DJ’s view, a fine would have been of negligible deterrent value.
[note: 31]
16     In coming to her conclusion, the DJ made the following observations:
(a)     Ms Chia interviewed the Appellant in her 
official capacity
, advised him against any personal involvement with Ivy and reminded him of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the procurement process.
[note: 32]
(b)     The Appellant ignored Ms Chia’s advice and continued to award $3.2m worth of contracts to Ivy’s Companies. This was a gross contravention of the Government Instruction Manual.
[note: 33]
(c)     The absence of a corruption charge was a neutral factor.
[note: 34]
(d)     Even if the Appellant did not give any specific advantage to Ivy or show her favour, his actions gave rise to a public perception that he was showing her favour and that there was no level playing field in the award of school contracts. This brings into question the integrity of the procurement process and may affect public confidence and trust in the system.
[note: 35]
(e)     The offence is not a one-off incident as the Appellant also gave false information in 2012, which is the subject of the second charge.
[note: 36]
(f)     The case of 
Public Prosecutor v Lim Yong Soon Bernard
 
[2015] 3 SLR 717
 (“
Lim Bernard CA
”) can be distinguished because (a) the offender was not holding as high a rank as the Appellant, (b) the value of the contract involved was only $57,200, and (c) the false statement was recanted after two days, in contrast with the seven years in this case. 
[note: 37]
(g)     Little mitigating weight was placed on the fact that the Appellant was a first offender as he is expected to be of good character as a senior public servant.
[note: 38]
 However, the Appellant’s plea of guilt is of mitigating value as it is an indication of his remorse.
[note: 39]
Issues on appeal
17     The 
first issue
 relates to laying down sentencing guidelines for s 182 offences. This should be discussed first so that it can be applied to the facts. The 
second issue
 is whether the sentence in the present case is manifestly excessive. Specifically, consideration must be given as to whether the 
custodial threshold
 is crossed, and if so, whether the 
duration
 of four weeks’ imprisonment is manifestly excessive.
Sentencing guidelines for s 182 of the Penal Code 
18     It is imperative to first consider the statutory provision. Section 182 of the Penal Code 1985, which is the provision the Appellant was charged under because his offence was committed in 2005, states:
Whoever gives to any public servant any information orally or in writing which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, shall be punished with 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months, or with fine which may extend to $1,000, or with both
. [emphasis added]
19     This was amended in 2008, and the 
present
 s 182 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2012 Rev Ed) states:
Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person, or to do or omit anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, shall be punished with 
imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine which may extend to $5,000, or with both
. [emphasis added]
The main effect of the 2008 amendment was to increase the maximum sentence for a s 182 offence from 
six months’ imprisonment and a $1,000 fine
, to 
one year imprisonment and a $5,000 fine
.
20     The amendment was intended to afford the courts more flexibility to impose higher sentences when the facts justified it, rather than to signal that Parliament viewed the offence with increased severity. In the 2007 Parliamentary debates on the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, which contained the abovementioned change to the maximum sentence for s 182 offences as well as the penalties for other offences, Member of Parliament Mr Lim Biow Chuan said as follows (
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (23 October 2007) vol 83 at col 2418):
... I would like to seek the Minister’s affirmation that by amending the range of penalties prescribed, the intention of Parliament is not for the judges to automatically increase the punishment nor should the courts interpret the setting of a higher limit to mean that the crime has become more serious...
…
… [I]n this current set of amendments which are not specific to any particular offence, the intention of Parliament surely must be simply to allow the courts to have greater sentencing options to mete out appropriate sentences. Heavier penalties should thus be imposed by the courts only where there are aggravating factors and there should not be a rise in the punishment across the board for all offences simply because of this amendment.
In response, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, agreed with Mr Lim’s observation (at col 2439):
… Mr Lim Biow Chuan asks whether what we have done will lead automatically to fines or punishments going up. I do not think so. He has mentioned, for example, the benchmarks, the sentencing guidelines, that the courts have. I think the guidelines will continue. It does not mean that automatically when the maximum punishment is raised, the punishment will go up. Because every punishment must depend on the facts of the case. …
Sentencing precedents
21     Before considering specific sentencing guidelines for s 182 offences, it is helpful to first identify the main ways in which s 182 offences have been committed in Singapore. A review of the sentencing precedents would allow an appreciation of the different circumstances in which the offence would normally arise, as well as the factors which have played a role in sentencing.
22     First, a significant number of s 182 cases concern persons who falsely report innocent persons to the police.
(a)     In 
Rajeshwary d/o Batumalai v Public Prosecutor
 
[2014] SGDC 153
, the offender falsely made a police report alleging that her stepfather had stolen her jewellery when in fact, she had agreed to allow her stepfather to pawn her jewellery. She made the false report because she was angry with her stepfather for not returning a sum of money which he had borrowed. Her stepfather was arrested. She recanted her false statement only 
four and a half months later
. The district judge sentenced her to twelve weeks’ imprisonment. On appeal to the High Court, this was reduced to 
six weeks’ imprisonment
.
[note: 40]
(b)     In 
Siew Yit Beng v Public Prosecutor
 
[2000] 2 SLR(R) 785
, the offender gave false information to the police alleging that she had been molested and raped by her Chinese physician. In truth, she had a consensual sexual relationship with him but was afraid that her husband might divorce her if he found out about their relationship. She maintained the falsehood for approximately 
eight months
 before retracting the false allegations, and had even reasserted the truth of those allegations at her trial for two s 182 charges. She was sentenced to 
four weeks’ imprisonment per charge
, to run concurrently.
(c)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Liu Linyan
 
[2013] SGDC 434
 (“
Liu Linyan
”), the offender falsely accused one Ng Say Leong (“Ng”) of robbing her. She did so because Ng had accidentally scratched her and she wanted to ensure that he would not get away. Ng was chased and pinned to the ground by passers-by, before being arrested by the police and held in police custody for 19 hours. 
A day later
, the offender recanted her false statement. The district judge sentenced the offender to 
two weeks’ imprisonment
, and this was upheld on appeal.
[note: 41]
(d)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Mathiyalagan Mathiselvam
 
[2016] SGMC 1
, the offender pleaded guilty to two charges under s 182. He had falsely told the police that he had been attacked and robbed by 12 to 13 persons armed with knives and wooden boards, and that Selvanathan Rajesh (“Selvanathan”) was part of the group. As a result of the false information, Selvanathan was arrested and kept in a police lock-up for seven hours. In fact, the offender had been attacked by a group of men which included Selvanathan, but no knives were used and money was not stolen from him. The offender retracted his false allegation after 
seven hours
. He concocted the false story because he was angry that he had been assaulted and wanted to hasten police investigations. The court sentenced the offender to 
10 days’ imprisonment per charge
, to run concurrently. A slightly lower sentence was imposed because the offender had actually been assaulted (at [26]). The sentence was upheld on appeal.
[note: 42]
(e)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Tan Ban Sin
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No 330 of 1998) (a summary of this case is available at 
Sentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts
 (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2013) (“
Sentencing Practice
”) at p 1111-1112), the offender gave false information to the police about an incident in which he had allegedly been a victim of robbery and extortion. He did so because he felt he had been cheated by the victims, who promised him contracts for his renovation business if he paid them $10,000. After he paid them $4,000, no contracts materialised. Further, the victims continued pestering him for the remaining $6,000. The offender stated in mitigation that he had been put under extreme pressure to pay and did not realise that he could be prosecuted for making a false police report. Further, he was only prosecuted after three years. The district judge found that the mitigating factors were sufficient to spare the offender a prison sentence and ordered the 
then maximum fine of $1,000
. The Prosecution withdrew its appeal against the sentence.
23     In such cases, it seems that (a) imprisonment terms tend to be the norm, (b) the provision of false information has a serious impact on both the victims of the false allegations as well as on the investigative process, and (c) the time the offender took to recant the false statement has a material impact on the sentence to be imposed.
24     Second are cases where a person gave false information to the authorities to shield 
himself
 from investigation or prosecution.
(a)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Moscardon Mark Henry Pueyo
 
[2009] SGDC 304
 (“
Moscardon
”), the offender falsely told the police that his name was “Mark Henry” when he was apprehended for shop theft. He was an illegal over-stayer who only had a social visit pass. He planned the deception by searching the Internet for another person’s identity to conceal his illegal status in Singapore. The police had to expend additional resources to determine the offender’s true identity, locate him and then charge him for these offences. He was sentenced to 
six months’ imprisonment
 for the s 182 offences. The Prosecution’s appeal against sentence was withdrawn.
(b)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Mok Wai Hoong Aaron
 
[2015] SGDC 264
, the offender fraudulently obtained a renovation project for his company and made a profit. To cover up the profits he made from the project, he lied to the investigating officer that he had paid substantial sums to a contractor, Keppel, for certain services and he conspired with his friend, Lim, from Keppel to lie to the investigating officer as well. The offender pleaded guilty to one charge of cheating, forgery as well as an offence under s 182. The district judge sentenced him to 
two months’ imprisonment
 for the s 182 offence. His appeal against sentence was dismissed.
[note: 43]
(c)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Park Jeoung Sang
 
[2015] SGDC 311
, the offender was found guilty of one charge of drink-driving, one charge of driving whilst under disqualification, one charge of dangerous driving and one charge of giving false information under s 182. He falsely told the police, and maintained in court, that he was not the driver of the vehicle at the material time. He was sentenced to 
two weeks’ imprisonment
 for the s 182 offence. The offender’s appeal against conviction and sentence was withdrawn.
(d)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Feng Meizhen
 
[2008] SGDC 274
, the offender admitted that she had entered Singapore illegally when she had in fact overstayed, and falsely told the police that her name was “Huang Siew Fang”. She was sentenced to 
two weeks’ imprisonment
. The sentence was upheld on appeal.
[note: 44]
25     From these two groups of cases, it appears that the sentence meted out varies, depending on (a) the complexity of the deceptive scheme employed on the public servant (
eg
, whether other people were asked to corroborate the lie, whether it was planned and premeditated, 
etc
), (b) the seriousness of the offence the offender sought to cover up, and (c) the extent to which public resources were wasted because of the false information.
26     Third, are cases where a person gave false information to the authorities to shield 
another person
 from investigation or prosecution.
(a)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Sivaprakash s/o Narayansamy
 
[2004] SGMC 7
 (“
Sivaprakash
”), the offender permitted his wife to drive his vehicle when she did not possess a valid driving licence. They eventually got into an accident and when apprehended by the police, the offender claimed that he was the driver of the vehicle. He faced two charges under s 182. The offender claimed trial and he and his wife maintained that he was the driver of the car. The district judge found him guilty of the s 182 offences. Taking into account the fact that (a) it was irresponsible for the offender to allow his wife to drive without a licence (at [87]); (b) the offender’s actions enabled his wife to get away with the offence and perverted the course of justice (at [88]); (c) the offender showed no remorse by persisting with his falsehoods in claiming trial to the charges (at [89]); and (d) the offender continued with his lies in a premeditated manner (at [90]), the judge sentenced him to five weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of $1,000 on each of the two charges. On appeal, the two 
imprisonment terms of five weeks
 for each charge were ordered to run concurrently (see 
Sentencing Practice
 at pp 1104–1105).
(b)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Yeo Fang Yi
 
[2015] SGMC 9
 (“
Yeo Fang Yi
”), the offender falsely represented to the police that she was the driver of the vehicle. She did so once when questioned on the night of the incident on 4 November 2009, and a second time when called for questioning on 31 July 2012. She was then charged with an offence of driving under the influence of alcohol on 30 August 2012. On 2 November 2012, she recanted her previous two statements, saying they were false. Investigations revealed that the offender was not the driver of the car. She had lied to shield the actual driver from a drink-driving charge. Taking into account the fact that drink-driving was a serious offence (at [22]), the offender did not tell the lie under pressure from another (at [25]) and the offender perpetuated her falsehood three years later (at [27]), the district judge sentenced her to a 
one-week imprisonment term
 and this was upheld on appeal.
[note: 45]
(c)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Poh Chee Hwee
 
[2008] SGDC 241
 (“
Poh Chee Hwee
”), the offender gave a false statement to the police claiming to have been the driver of a motor van to help his brother avoid prosecution for driving while under disqualification. He pleaded guilty to one charge under s 182. The factors that aggravated the offence include the fact that the offender’s actions obstructed the course of justice and had the potential to frustrate the progress of police investigations (at [12]), the offence of driving under disqualification is a serious traffic offence (at [13]) and the offence was premeditated (at [16]). The mitigating factors include the fact that the offender wanted to shield his brother from prosecution, he did not derive any benefit, an innocent party was not implicated, the offender’s brother was ultimately brought to justice, the offender pleaded guilty and he had no related antecedents (at [17]). The judge sentenced the offender to 
two weeks’ imprisonment
, and this was upheld on appeal (see 
Sentencing Practice
 at 1106).
(d)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Francis Clinton Wong Chee Meng
 
[2010] SGDC 378
 (“
Francis Clinton
”), the offender was involved in a conspiracy with, 
inter alia
, a housing agent Goh Choon Liang (“Goh”) to cheat Standard Chartered Bank. In a false statement to a Commercial Affairs Department officer, he stated that one Zurkifli Bin Alang Noordin and not Goh was the housing agent involved. This was the subject of the s 182 charge he faced. The offender pleaded guilty to the offence of conspiracy to cheat and to the s 182 charge. The district judge sentenced the offender to one months’ imprisonment for the s 182 charge. However, on appeal, the High Court substituted the imprisonment term for the s 182 offence with a 
$1,000 fine
 because the court found that the s 182 offence was committed because Goh had threatened to take revenge on the offender if Goh’s identity was revealed (see 
Sentencing Practice
 at 1107).
(e)     In 
Ee Chong Kiat Tommy v Public Prosecutor
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No 143 of 96) (“
Ee Chong Kiat Tommy
”), the offender and his female companion were in the car driven by the latter when she drove the car up the kerb into a retaining wall. When the police arrived, the offender falsely told the police that he had been driving. When the truth was uncovered, the offender was charged with a s 182 offence and on appeal, was 
fined $1,000
 by the High Court but did not receive a custodial term (see 
Sentencing Practice
 at p 1101).
(f)     In 
Kuah Geok Bee v Public Prosecutor
 (Magistrate’s Appeal No 171 of 96) (“
Kuah Geok Bee
”), the offender falsely claimed to be the driver of the vehicle to allow her husband who had been driving under the influence of alcohol to evade police investigation. She pleaded guilty to an offence under s 182 and on appeal, was 
fined $1,000
 by the High Court but did not receive a custodial term (see 
Sentencing Practice
 at p 1102).
27     From the above, it appears that offenders who provide false information to shield 
another person
 from investigation or prosecution have not necessarily been treated less severely than offenders who provide false information to shield 
themselves
. Nevertheless, on some occasions, offenders who committed the offence to protect another person have been treated more lightly by the courts if no other aggravating factors are present (see for 
eg
, 
Ee Chong Kiat Tommy
 and 
Kuah Geok Bee
, which were cited in 
Yang Suan Piau Steven v Public Prosecutor
 
[2013] 1 SLR 809
 at [23] as being “exceptions to the norm” due to their unique circumstances). It would appear that in some circumstances, the absence of personal gain could play a role in reducing the seriousness of the offence.
28     Fourth, are cases where a person gave false information to public servants to subvert a public institution’s screening process.
(a)     In 
PP v Loo Way Yew
 (PS 2278/97) (“
Loo Way Yew
”), the offender gave false information on six occasions in his blood donor registration form about whether he had had sex with a prostitute in the past 12 months and whether he had lived in or visited other countries. He pleaded guilty to three charges under s 182 and gave his consent for three other similar charges to be taken into consideration. His blood was tested positive for HIV and had been transfused to two patients who contracted HIV. The offender was not aware of his condition at all material times. He was sentenced to 
six months’ imprisonment
 for each charge, with two of the sentences ordered to run consecutively. He therefore faced a total of 12 months’ imprisonment and there was no appeal against this decision (see 
Sentencing Practice
 at p 1097).
(b)     In 
CLB and another v Public Prosecutor
 
[1993] 1 SLR(R) 52
 (“
CLB
”), the appellants were blood donors who made false declarations on the blood donor registration form about their sexual history. Their blood was later tested positive for HIV, though neither of them knew they had the disease. They each pleaded guilty to a single charge under s 182 for giving false information to a public servant, the Medical Director of the Singapore Blood Transfusion Service, in their respective donor registration forms. The High Court found that a two-month sentence would have been appropriate given (i) the importance of encouraging blood donors not to treat the questionnaire in the donor registration form lightly, and (ii) the danger inherent in the particular falsehoods given. However, bearing in mind the mitigating factors in this case (
CLB
 at [4] and [8]), including the fact that a voluntary donation of one’s blood is a commendably noble and civic-conscious act, no harm was caused, the appellants did not act with malice, not knowing that they themselves were infected, the appellants pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and personal gain did not operate as an active incentive to lie, the High Court sentenced the appellants to 
one months’ imprisonment
 (see 
CLB
 at [10]).
(c)     In 
PP v West Jack Gilbert
 
[2004] SGDC 310
 (“
West Jack Gilbert
”), the offender made false statements to the Ministry of Education in his application forms for “Registration as a Teacher” in order to obtain an employment pass to work as a teacher. He declared that he had not been convicted in a court of law in any country when he had in fact been convicted for drug offences, rape, criminal intimidation and carrying concealed weapons in the United States of America. He was sentenced to 
one months’ imprisonment
 for each of the two s 182 offences. The offender’s appeal against sentence was withdrawn.
(d)     In 
Wong Yi Hao Henry v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGHC 232
 (“
Wong Yi Hao Henry
”), the offender gave false information about his residential address in his application to register his daughter for primary school admission. The High Court held that “in the absence of any material indicating that offences of this nature had been or are becoming more prevalent, and with no additional aggravating features present”, there was insufficient basis to impose a custodial sentence and the sentence of two weeks’ imprisonment should be reduced to a $5,000 fine (at [6] and [7]). No opposition was raised by the Public Prosecutor.
29     Many of the above cases clearly trigger the public interest and are examples of possible situations in which the provision of false information to a public servant has the potential to cause serious harm to a large group of people. Of course, the gravity of the offence still can vary greatly within this category of cases (comparing, for 
eg
, the seriousness of lying about one’s criminal record in an application to be a teacher against providing false information for primary school admissions). Further, the comparison between 
CLB
 and 
Loo Way Yew
 demonstrate that the materialisation of actual harm can make a significant difference to the sentence.
30     Fifth are cases where a person who gave false information to public servants to facilitate fraud on a third party to gain some personal benefit.
(a)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Tew Yee Jeng
 
[2016] SGDC 28
, the offender (a Malaysian) conspired on multiple occasions with different groups of people to stage road traffic accidents in Singapore for the purpose of making fraudulent insurance claims. He managed to cause several accidents involving heavy vehicles, and submitted insurance claims thereafter. On one occasion, the offender induced one Helen to make a police report stating that a genuine accident had happened and that she was the driver of the vehicle when it was actually the offender behind the wheel. Helen was also asked to omit to mention the offender’s involvement in the accident. Helen then made a fraudulent insurance claim. The offender was charged with several counts of conspiracy to cheat, dangerous driving, and one count of abetting another person to furnish false information under section 182 read with section 109 of the Penal Code. In relation to the s 182 offence, the district judge found that “the “false report has to be viewed in the context of the overall motor insurance fraud that was being perpetrated by the Accused and his accomplices. In this light, the false report took on a completely different complexion and fell into a very aggravated form of a section 182 offence” (at [32]). In particular, the district judge took into account the fact that (i) the offender played a central role in the offences, (ii) he entered Singapore with the sole purpose of committing these offences, and (iii) innocent road users had been exposed to great risk of personal injury and property damage (at [21]). A 
four-month imprisonment term
 was therefore meted out for the s 182 offence. This was upheld on appeal.
[note: 46]
(b)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Kumaran A/L Subramaniam
 
[2009] SGDC 220
 (“
Kumaran
”), the offender was an operations manager of a security firm and was engaged to escort cash of approximately $80,000 from the Hyatt Hotel to the bank. He falsely reported to the police that the money was stolen to cover up his misappropriation of the funds. He faced two charges under s 182, and further charges for criminal breach of trust. In determining the sentence, the judge took into account the fact that (i) the offender was the mastermind of the whole scheme (at [84]), (ii) the offences committed were serious in nature (at [86]), (iii) his scheme involved removing the money beyond the boundaries of the country (at [86]), (iv) the offender was one of the very few senior security personnel in the firm entrusted with performing escort duties and yet he misappropriated the very money which he had been charged to protect (at [86]), and (v) the offence struck at the heart of the security industry here and adversely affected the reputation of Singapore as a safe country to do business, thus engaging the public interest (at [87]). He was sentenced to 
two months’ imprisonment
 for each of the two charges he faced under s 182 (to run concurrently). The sentence was upheld on appeal.
[note: 47]
(c)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Alvin Chan Siw Hong
 
[2010] SGDC 411
 (“
Alvin Chan
”), the offender gave false information in a police report claiming that his motorcycle was stolen in Singapore when it was stolen in Malacca, Malaysia. The offender’s motivation for making the false report was to defraud his insurers and get an insurance pay-out. The district judge found that the case was “devoid of any aggravating factor” as the offender was not evading prosecution, shielding someone from prosecution, or making a false allegation of a crime to exact revenge or injure reputation (at [9]). The judge thus found that a 
fine of $4,000
 would serve the ends of justice (at [9]). The Prosecution withdrew its appeal against sentence.
31     The above cases also demonstrate the wide range of fraudulent schemes a s 182 offence can be part of, ranging from more complex insurance fraud schemes involving foreign syndicates, to the making of a false police report about where one’s motorcycle was stolen in the hope of satisfying the terms for an insurance pay-out. The sentences imposed thus differed accordingly. However, it seems to us that the sentence imposed in 
Alvin Chan
 may have been too lenient, bearing in mind the fact that the fraud did not relate to an insignificant sum and there is a public interest in protecting the insurance industry.
32     Sixth are cases where a public servant gave false information to another public servant about matters relating to the offender’s employment.
(a)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Low Vins
 
[2015] SGDC 6
, a police officer falsely told his superior that he had visited two drug offenders’ homes and that they were not in, resulting in the drug offenders being deprived of the option of being sent to Drug Rehabilitation Centre even though they had dutifully reported for bail. Instead, they were considered as offenders who had absconded and were duly prosecuted and charged in court. The offender was convicted under two charges under s 182 and received 
three months’ imprisonment
 per charge, to run concurrently. This was upheld on appeal.
[note: 48]
(b)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Charan Singh
 
[2015] SGDC 180
 (“
Charan Singh
”), the offender was a senior investigation officer attached to the Investigations Department of the Land Transport Authority (“LTA”). Some of Super Bike Centre Pte Ltd’s (“Super Bike”) motorcycles were about to be auctioned off by the LTA to recover outstanding road tax arrears. The offender represented to the officers at the Road Tax Arrears department that his supervisor had authorised the removal of Super Bike’s motorcycles from auction, and then represented to his supervisor that the road tax arrears had been paid even though they had not. The offender was convicted after trial of one charge under s 182. The district judge found that the following factors aggravated the offence: (i) the offence was deliberate, (ii) the offender abused his position as an investigation officer and trusted colleague, and (iii) he was in fact a law enforcement officer whose duty was to uphold the law rather than to subvert it in the way that he did (at para [104]). The judge thus imposed a custodial term of 
four weeks’ imprisonment
 (at [107]). This was upheld on appeal.
[note: 49]
(c)     In 
Public Prosecutor v Bernard Lim Yong Soon
 
[2014] SGDC 356
 (“
Lim Bernard DC
”), the offender was an Assistant Director of the National Parks Board (“NParks”). He was in charge of purchasing a batch of foldable bicycles for NParks. He tipped off one Lawrence Lim about the upcoming tender for the supply of bicycles and gave him an indication of the price NParks was willing to pay. It transpired that Lawrence Lim was the sole bidder and he was awarded the tender. In an internal investigation about NParks’ purchase of a batch of foldable bicycles, which the offender was in charge of, the offender denied knowing Lawrence Lim. The offender also instigated Lawrence Lim to deny knowing him to the authorities who questioned him. He faced two charges under s 182, but was not charged with corruption. In sentencing the offender, the judge took into account the fact that (i) the price NParks paid for the bicycles was not excessive (at [98]), (ii) there was no predicate offence (at [104]), (iii) the offender recanted his false statement after two days (at [105]) and (iv) no reliance was placed on the offender’s false statement (at [123]). The offender was sentenced to the maximum fine of $5,000 (at [138]).This was upheld on appeal.
[note: 50]
33     This final category of cases deals with the more unique situation where the offence involves the offender’s performance of his duties as a public servant. These cases often engage a unique type of public interest related to the integrity of the Public Service and the performance of public duties not seen in other cases. Slightly different considerations are therefore at play in sentencing.
34     From the above review, it can be seen that s 182 would encompass a wide range of misconduct in different circumstances. While certain fact patterns stand out, and while the sentences imposed in cases bearing similar fact patterns may be rationalised, it is doubtful if a 
single
 sentencing framework would ever be adequate to cater to the full range of different factual scenarios.
Submissions on the appropriate sentencing guidelines 
35     We first consider the Prosecution’s and the amicus’ submissions on the appropriate sentencing guidelines for s 182 offences.
Prosecution
36     The Prosecution puts forward two broad guiding principles for determining whether the custodial threshold has been crossed:
(a)     whether any serious consequences arose from the breach of applicable regulations or whether the conduct was so wholly innocent that one can disregard it as an incidental transgression; and
(b)     whether the investigation relates to conduct which would, if undetected or unpunished, so undermine the standing of the public service that the punishment must be a custodial sentence.
37     The Prosecution also identifies four further factors which are relevant to offenders who are themselves public servants:
(a)     whether the offender was a high ranking or influential official, or a junior official;
(b)     whether the consequences of the falsehood involved a significant aggregate amount;
(c)     whether the falsehood was perpetuated over an extended period of time, or was repudiated/recanted soon after the falsehood was uttered; and
(d)     whether the falsehood was said to cover-up a deliberate breach of conduct rules, or to cover-up a careless lapse on the part of the public servant.
38     In our view, while the Prosecution’s proposed guiding principles identify relevant factors that the courts should take into account in sentencing offenders under s 182, they are not adequate as guidelines for 
all types
 of s 182 offences. For example, in the case of an offender who lies to the police to cover for his friend who would have been prosecuted for drink driving, there would be no breach of “applicable regulations” to speak of ([36(a)] above), nor would there be any “breach of conduct rules” to cover-up ([37(d)] above). The considerations proposed seem more directed at cases involving public servant offenders committing a s 182 offence in the course of their employment.
The amicus
39     The amicus proposes categorising all s 182 offences into four categories based on the level of culpability and harm:
 
 
 
 
Culpability and harm
 
 
Range of sentences
 
 
Cat A
 
 
No significant culpability and harm
 
 
Fine up to $5000
 
 
Cat BC
 
 
Significant culpability but 
not
 harm
 
 
Imprisonment term between 1 week and 6 months
 
 
Cat BH
 
 
Significant harm but 
not
 culpability
 
 
Imprisonment term between 1 week and 6 months
 
 
Cat C
 
 
Significant culpability and harm
 
 
Imprisonment term between 3 months and 9 months
 
40      
Significant culpability
 can be found in one or more of these scenarios
[note: 51]
:
(a)     the offender plays a leading or significant role where offending is part of a group activity;
(b)     there is the involvement of others through pressure, influence;
(c)     there is an abuse of position of power or trust or responsibility;
(d)     the offence is of a sophisticated nature and/or there has been significant planning;
(e)     it involves fraudulent activity conducted over sustained period of time or on many occasions;
(f)     there is the targeting of a large number of victims; or
(g)     the offender deliberately targets a victim on basis of his or her vulnerability.
41      
Significant harm
 can be found in these scenarios:
(a)     where the false statement results in a perversion of the course of justice (
eg
, false statement to the police to help the statement-maker or another evade the prosecution of an offence, or falsely alleging a crime against another);
[note: 52]
 or
(b)     where important public interests are at stake or strong public policy considerations are involved (
eg
, harm to a large group of victims, harm to the community at large, to national interest, or some other important public interest).
[note: 53]
42     According to the amicus, after determining the category under which the offence falls, the appropriate quantum of fine or length of custodial term should be determined by considering 
further factors
 that have an impact on the offender’s culpability and the harm caused by the offence.
43     The 
further
 factors which are relevant in assessing the 
level of culpability
 of the offender include:
[note: 54]
(a)     whether the offender knew or merely believed that the statement given was false
[note: 55]
;
(b)     whether the offender intended or merely knew it to be likely that the harm would arise
[note: 56]
;
(c)     whether the giving of false information was pre-meditated or planned, or whether it was simply spontaneous;
(d)     whether active, deliberate or sophisticated steps were taken by the offender to bolster the deception and boost the chances of hoodwinking the public authorities;
(e)     the motive of the offender in giving the false information (malicious, revenge, innocuous, or altruistic intention);
(f)     whether the deception was perpetrated despite or in active defiance of a warning not to lie;
(g)     the number of times the lie was actively said;
(h)     the number of people instigated or involved in the deception, and the specific role played by the offender;
(i)     whether the offender had exploited or exerted pressure on others in the commission of the offence; and
(j)     whether the offence is committed due to threat or pressure or fear of another person is a mitigating factor.
[note: 57]
44     The 
further
 factors which are relevant in assessing the 
level of harm
 caused by the offence include:
(a)     whether the false statement was recanted, and if so, after how long;
[note: 58]
(b)     the gravity of the predicate offence which the offender seeks to avoid or help another avoid;
[note: 59]
(c)     the investigative resources unnecessarily expended;
[note: 60]
(d)     the extent to which the innocent victims were affected, how many victims were affected, and the seriousness of the falsely-alleged crime;
[note: 61]
 and
(e)     whether the offender obtained a financial advantage from the commission of the offence.
[note: 62]
45     We agree with the amicus’ approach of sentencing offenders based on the degree of culpability and harm involved. Further, in our view, the amicus’ proposed sentencing guidelines helpfully and comprehensively identify the type of concerns that have featured in the sentencing precedents and that should shape the sentences for offences committed under s 182. However, given (a) the narrow sentencing range available to the courts under s 182, (b) the wide variety of factual circumstances in which the offence may be committed and (c) the importance of maintaining simplicity and flexibility in the sentencing guidelines laid down, we have some reservations about categorising the appropriate sentence for this offence into four groups based on 
significant
 culpability and harm. We shall explain.
Our view on the appropriate sentencing guidelines
46     In 
CLB
 at [9], the High Court observed that “s 182 covers an extensive array of misinformation of greatly varying degrees of iniquity”. This diversity is evident from our above survey of the types of conduct falling within s 182. Indeed, in 
Lim Bernard CA
, the Court of Appeal observed that a wide array of factors was germane to sentencing for a s 182 offence (at [22]), and that it was difficult to lay down sentencing benchmarks in the abstract without the particular facts of the case (at [23]). While this observation may be true of sentencing in general, in our view, the wide variety of misconduct that is caught under s 182 makes it 
exceptionally
 difficult to identify a single set of principal factors which can form the basis of a sentencing framework.
47     In 
Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor
 
[2014] 4 SLR 892
 for example, the court managed to identify “principal factual elements” applicable across 
all
 the vice-related offences under consideration, and found it possible to define three levels of culpability and two categories of harm based on those principal facts (at [74]–[78]). Similarly, in 
Vasentha d/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 5 SLR 122
, the court was able to build its sentencing framework for the offence of trafficking in diamorphine on the quantity of drugs involved in the trafficking charge as this would inevitably have a strong bearing on the sentence to be imposed (at [19] and [23]). From these examples, it is clear that a prerequisite to establishing a detailed sentencing framework for a particular offence is the possibility of identifying a set of principal fact(s) that significantly impact the gravity of the offence 
across the board
.
48     In our judgment, it is difficult to categorise s 182 offences based on a set of “principal factual elements”. The way in which the offence may be committed, the offender’s motivation and the outcome of a s 182 offence can take a wide variety of shapes and forms. 
In particular
, we find it difficult to define in the abstract a uniform set of factors that allows us to categorise an 
offender’s degree of culpability
 for s 182 offences and in turn the appropriate punishment. For example, the significance of the fact that a lie was repeatedly told, or that the offender may have had an intention to reap personal benefit, must be assessed 
in context
 before the extent to which these factors aggravate the offence can be assessed. As we put to the parties in the course of the hearing, a public servant may have repeatedly lied to his superiors about not being the one who did not turn off the printer or the lights in the office. This is however unlikely to be treated by the courts as a serious criminal offence. We would add that the factors which the amicus identified as indicating “significant culpability” do not seem to be well suited to s 182 of the Penal Code. The amicus adapted those factors from the United Kingdom sentencing guidelines for the offence of fraud by failing to disclose information,
[note: 63]
 which is quite different from an offence of giving false information to a public servant. Also, as seen from the amicus’ own illustrative table, the contemplated circumstances under which “significant culpability” may be found have rarely presented themselves in the s 182 offences we have seen in Singapore. Their utility as part of a sentencing framework is thus limited.
49     In the circumstances, given the broad nature of the s 182 offence, we are of the view that we can do no more than to give some broad guidance as to the type of cases that would generally attract a 
custodial sentence
 as a 
starting point
. Thereafter, we identify a non-exhaustive set of factors which we think can affect the degree of culpability and harm of a s 182 offence. These factors can then be used to determine if the starting point should be departed from and/or what the appropriate quantum of fine or imprisonment term should be.
Custodial threshold
50     In our view, whether the custodial threshold is crossed should essentially be determined based on the 
degree of harm
 caused or likely to be caused by the s 182 offence. As the High Court in 
CLB
 observed at [9], “the [sentencing] norm must be varied according to the circumstances of each case, in particular, 
the mischief that might be caused by the false information
” [emphasis added]. Specifically, if 
appreciable harm
 may be caused by the s 182 offence, the courts should, as a starting point, impose a custodial term. The range of harm that may ensue includes personal injury (
eg
, by causing another to contract HIV), loss of liberty (
eg
, by causing another to be unjustifiably arrested), financial loss (
eg
, by lying to facilitate the misappropriation of property or to commit insurance fraud) or harm arising from the wastage of public investigative resources.
51     Several qualifications should also be added:
(a)     First, the harm must be 
causally connected
 to the provision of false information. In other words, the only relevant harm is the harm that was caused by the provision of false information. For example, an offender who lies about being the driver of the car to shield his friend from a drink driving charge merely makes it more difficult for the investigative authorities to bring the true perpetrator to justice and may cause the wastage of investigative resources – which is a different form of harm in itself. The false information, however, did not cause the drink driving offence to be committed.
(b)     Second, the harm in question must be 
more than de minimis
. It is important to keep in mind that a custodial term is only justified if the offence is of sufficient gravity. Parliament has increased the range of possible fines to give the courts more flexibility to impose higher fines instead of a custodial term. For example, unless otherwise proved, misleading investigative authorities for a few hours or even a day or two may not on the facts have the potential to bring about sufficient harm such as to justify a custodial term as the starting point. The 
Lim Bernard DC
 case is an illustration of this. The fact that the offender lied about his relationship with Lawrence Lim before recanting two days later cannot be said to have caused more than 
de minimis
 harm to the investigative process or public resources. By contrast, in 
Liu Linyan
 for example, although the false statement was recanted after a day, it caused the victim of the false allegation to be unjustifiably held in police custody for 19 hours (see [22(c)] above). This is clearly appreciable harm. Also, in 
CLB
, lying on a blood donor form had the potential to cause significant harm even if no harm actually eventuated (in that no third person was infected with HIV); the serious potential consequences were sufficient to justify a custodial sentence as a starting point. In this kind of situation, public interest and general deterrence must be accorded paramount consideration.
(c)     Third, harm in this context refers to both 
actual
 and 
potential
 harm. The fact that harm did not actually eventuate because the lie was detected fast enough or the offender was simply lucky should not detract from the justifiability of a custodial sentence if the potential for harm to be caused was real and significant. For example, in cases such as 
Kumaran
 (see [30(b)] above), even if the money was eventually recovered and returned to the victim after the offender was apprehended, the offence nevertheless still had the strong potential to cause the victim financial loss by facilitating the commission of the predicate offence and this harm should contribute to pushing the case across the custodial threshold. By contrast, and for the sake of argument, if the sum misappropriated had been merely a few dollars, this may be considered no more than 
de minimis
 harm.
(d)     Fourth, it would usually, if not always, be relevant to assess the potential harm caused by the offence with reference to the 
duration
 that the falsehood was maintained. It can be fairly said that generally, if the falsehood was recanted quickly, appreciable harm is unlikely to be caused.
(e)     Finally, it is acknowledged that “appreciable harm” is not a test capable of being applied with scientific precision. There will be many cases on the borderline, especially when the court is required to assess the potential consequences which 
could have
 ensued from the provision of false information, but did not on the facts. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that the sentencing court must still ultimately exercise its discretion on the facts of each case. The laying down of guidelines is merely intended to achieve a measure of consistency in sentencing and to provide a starting point for the courts. It is not meant to restrict the court’s discretion in sentencing, something which we recognise is much needed especially in the context of s 182 offences.
52     We would add that in our view, there is good basis to rely 
essentially
 on the 
degree of harm
 to define the custodial threshold as a 
starting point
. Section 182 of the Penal Code ultimately seeks to protect the public against the 
potential harm
 that may result from a public officer misusing his/her powers, or failing to perform his/her duties.
53     This approach is generally consistent with the sentencing precedents. In 
Wong Yi Hao Henry
 for example, a fine was justified because no appreciable harm was caused by the offender lying to the primary school about his residential address (see [28(d)] above). But we must emphasise that should an offence of such a nature become more prevalent, the public interest may well dictate otherwise. Similarly, in 
Lim Bernard DC
, a fine was justified because the offender’s attempt to cover up his relationship with Lawrence Lim did not have the potential to cause appreciable harm given that his superiors did not take his word at face value and continued investigating into possible improprieties (see [32(c)] above). This would have made further improprieties in the procurement process unlikely even if the offender had not recanted his false statement. Moreover, that case involved a one-off purchase. Also, in cases where an offender provides false information to shield another from investigation (
eg
, in 
Ee Chong Kiat Tommy
 or 
Kuah Geok Bee
 – see [26(e)] and [26(f)] above), where this does not cause a significant wastage of investigative resources nor does it hurt any third party, the starting point of a custodial sentence may not be appropriate. However, we must reiterate that we are merely laying down a starting point. In 
some
 cases where harm is 
de minimis
 but culpability is high, (for 
eg
, where aggravating factors such as the offender’s irresponsibility (see for 
eg
, in 
Sivaprakash
 at [26(a)] above), persistence in maintaining the lie (see for 
eg
, in 
Yeo Fang Yi
 at [26(b)] above) or evidence of pre-meditation (see for 
eg
, 
Poh Chee Hwee
 at [26(c)] above) exist), a custodial sentence 
could
 very well be justified on the facts.
54     Conversely, cases in which the offender makes a police report alleging a crime against an innocent party have generally resulted in custodial terms given the risk of arrest and embarrassment those false allegations create (see [22] above). Also, cases in which the false information has caused a significant wastage of public resources have also resulted in a custodial term (see for 
eg
, 
Moscardon
 at [24(a)] above).
55     We should point out that in the case of 
Alvin Chan
 (see [30(c)] above), while the offender was sentenced to a $4,000 fine on the facts, we are of the view that the 
starting point
 should have been a custodial sentence given that the attempted insurance fraud had the potential to cause significant financial losses to the insurer. Other mitigating factors may justify reducing the sentence to a fine instead – but that would have to depend on the specific facts of the case.
Other relevant sentencing factors
56     The above test of appreciable harm merely provides the sentencing court with a 
starting point
. Other relevant sentencing factors should then be taken into account to determine (a) if the starting point should be departed from, and (b) what the appropriate quantum of fine and/or length of imprisonment should be. As to what these other relevant sentencing factors are, we gratefully adopt the factors identified by the amicus and reproduced at [43] and [44] above as a non-exhaustive list of factors that future courts should take into account (where applicable) in determining the appropriate sentence in each case.
Present case
Appellant’s submissions 
57     The main grounds advanced by the Appellant in his appeal against his sentence are:
(a)     the prior and subsequent procurement improprieties the Appellant perpetrated from 2005 to 2012 (namely, signing off on contracts to Ivy’s Companies despite his sexual relationship with her hence placing himself in a position of conflict of interest in breach of, 
inter alia
, the Government Instruction Manual) should not be a relevant sentencing fact in this case because (i) the false information was given in response to a question about his personal affairs and not in the context of an inquiry about the way he awarded contracts to vendors or the integrity of the procurement process;
[note: 64]
 (ii) the Appellant provided the false information out of embarrassment
[note: 65]
 and the procurement process was not on the Appellant’s mind when he denied the affair;
[note: 66]
 and (iii) there is no evidence that he actually manipulated the tender process or that he caused public funds to be misapplied;
[note: 67]
(b)     the DJ erred in speculating that there could have been corruption and that there were other reasons to explain why the Appellant was not charged with corruption
[note: 68]
;
(c)     the lie about the affair in 2005 was one-off and the lie which is the subject matter of the TIC charge was of a different character from the first lie;
[note: 69]
(d)     the DJ failed to consider relevant mitigating factors including his contributions to the public service
[note: 70]
 and evidence of his good character;
[note: 71]
(e)     the DJ erred in failing to consider the sentencing considerations in 
Lim Bernard DC
 and in finding that that case was less serious than the present;
[note: 72]
 and
(f)     the DJ failed to explain why the facts justified a custodial sentence, or why a four week term was appropriate
[note: 73]
 – in fact, this case is less serious than 
CLB
, 
Charan Singh
 and 
West Jack Gilbert
, all of which are cases where a four weeks’ imprisonment term was meted out.
Relevance of the procurement improprieties
58     The most important question that arises on the facts of this case is whether the prior and subsequent procurement improprieties the Appellant perpetrated from 2005 to 2012 is a relevant sentencing factor. Before us, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Eric Tin (“Mr Tin”), submitted that the procurement improprieties were simply not on the Appellant’s mind during the interview. Instead, he was overwhelmed by the embarrassment of being confronted with his extra-marital affair. The procurement improprieties are therefore not connected to the present offence and given that the Appellant is not being punished for those procurement improprieties but for the provision of false information about his affair with Ivy, the court should not take into account the procurement improprieties in sentencing the Appellant.
59     In this regard, it is essential to carefully scrutinise the section of the statement of facts describing the interview:
18. During the interview, Ms Chia directly questioned the accused on whether he had an affair with Ivy – a service provider to JJC. The accused falsely stated to Ms Chia, a public servant, that he was not having an affair with Ivy, which information he knew to be false. He was adamant in his denial.
19. During the interview, as the accused denied being sexually involved with Ivy, 
Ms Chia reminded the accused about the importance of maintaining the integrity of the procurement process, and advised the accused against any personal involvement with Ivy, whose company was bidding for contracts and providing services to the accused’s school. 
The accused acknowledged that he understood Ms Chia’s advice.
 [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]
60     From the statement of facts, it is evident that (a) Ms Chia did direct the Appellant’s mind to the issue of possible procurement improprieties, and (b) the Appellant acknowledged that he understood Ms Chia’s advice. In this context, it is unbelievable that the issue of procurement improprieties was not on the Appellant’s mind 
at all
. Even if the Appellant did not realise, at the time he denied the extramarital affair, that the interview pertained to procurement issues, he must have realised what was at stake 
after
 Ms Chia reminded him about the importance of maintaining the integrity of the procurement process. At that point, it was open to him to retract his denial. Even if he was too embarrassed to do so, the least he could have done, if he truly felt embarrassment and remorse, was to remove himself from the position of conflict of interest thereafter. Instead, the Appellant continued signing off on contracts awarded to Ivy’s Companies. The Appellant’s provision of false information to Ms Chia 
enabled
 him to cover up his improper involvement in approving contracts to Ivy’s Companies, and perpetrate the procurement improprieties for the next seven years, tainting the award of more than $3m worth of government contracts.
61     In the circumstances, we are of the view that the Appellant’s continued involvement in the award of government contracts to Ivy’s Companies is clearly a relevant sentencing factor that should be taken into account and which aggravates the offence. It does not matter that the Appellant’s intention may not have been to cover up the procurement improprieties or to help Ivy obtain more contracts in future. There is a clear causal connection between the provision of false information and the continuation of the procurement improprieties.
Custodial threshold
62     As mentioned, to determine whether the case justifies a custodial term, at least as a starting point, the court has to ask whether the offence caused, or had the potential to cause, appreciable harm. In this case, there is no finding of actual corruption or misuse of public funds. Nevertheless, in our view, appreciable harm was clearly caused by the offence. By concealing his affair with Ivy, a school vendor, and passively maintaining the falsehood, the Appellant was allowed to undermine the integrity of the procurement process and confidence in the Public Service,
[note: 74]
 especially since the conflict of interest went undetected for a long period of time. It is also significant that a large number of contracts of significant value were infected by this impropriety (regardless of whether Ivy could have obtained the contracts without the Appellant on the final approving board).
63     This case is clearly distinguishable from 
Lim Bernard DC
, which the defence relied heavily upon. In 
Lim Bernard DC
, the provision of false information only impeded internal investigations for about two days, after which, the lie was recanted. The offending conduct in that case was done in order to 
cover up
 a 
prior
 impropriety; it did not facilitate or allow the commission of 
further
 improprieties. Harm to person or property, or to the public service, did not 
continue
 to be caused by the false provision of information. In this case, the provision of false information 
enabled
 the procurement improprieties to 
continue
 for the next 
seven years
, and for more than 
$3m worth of government contracts
 to be tainted by this. The harm in this case is therefore clearly much greater.
64     In our judgment, the custodial threshold in this case is undoubtedly crossed. As a starting point, a custodial sentence should be imposed. It only remains to be determined whether the other relevant sentencing factors justify (a) a departure from this starting point, or (b) lowering the term of imprisonment.
Other relevant factors
65     In our view, the fact that the Appellant did not repeat the lie which is the subject of the charge is not significantly mitigating. Given his senior position in the public service, he was clearly trusted by Ms Chia and MOE. The fact that he was allowed to continue sitting on the QAP approving contracts to Ivy’s Companies demonstrates that the MOE assumed throughout that he was telling the truth (without him having to repeat the lie). We find it particularly aggravating that despite having been warned by Ms Chia, and claiming to have been embarrassed by the situation, he nevertheless allowed the procurement improprieties to continue for such a long time. Indeed, in a case like the present, so long as the false statement was not retracted, that effectively amounted to a continuous assertion of the falsehood by the Appellant.
66     Also, we did not think the DJ erred in treating the absence of a corruption charge as a neutral factor. While she may have given a view as to why the Appellant was not charged with corruption, she nevertheless treated that as a neutral factor and we do likewise in reviewing the Appellant’s sentence. As we made clear at [62] above, we sentence the Appellant on the basis that there is no finding of actual corruption or misuse of public funds.
67     As to the Appellant’s motive for lying, we are content to accept Mr Tin’s submission that the Appellant’s motive was not to cover up the previous procurement improprieties, or to enable the perpetration of further procurement improprieties for Ivy’s benefit. However, even if he was, 
momentarily
, motivated primarily by embarrassment, his subsequent brazen conduct was clearly inconsistent with any continued embarrassment or remorse. And as stated at [65], so long as he did not retract his false statement, he was in effect continuously asserting the falsehood.
68     In Singapore, the integrity of the public service and its freedom from corruption are matters which are highly prized. Public perception and trust in the government and in its integrity is of the highest importance. The Appellant’s actions significantly threatened this, bearing in mind the length of time his affair went undiscovered, as well as the value of contracts that were improperly approved by the Appellant (given the conflict of interest). The Appellant knowingly concealed his affair with Ivy and continued to improperly approve government contracts to Ivy’s Companies. Such conduct impinges on the public interest and must be deterred. This is especially since the effect of the Appellant’s lie was enhanced by the trust reposed in him as a senior public servant by the MOE. No further investigation was carried out – he was taken at his word and allowed to continue awarding contracts to Ivy’s Companies undiscovered. These are significantly aggravating factors. Seen in this light, we are of the view that his contributions to the public service and evidence of his good character – the very things he abused in committing the offence – are not of substantial mitigating value.
69     All things considered, therefore, we do not think that the four weeks’ imprisonment term is manifestly excessive.
70     Mr Tin has raised three precedents which we will briefly deal with. 
CLB
 concerned the making a false declaration on a blood donor form (see [28(a)] above), and 
West Jack Gilbert
 involved an offender providing false information about his past criminal record on an application to MOE to be a teacher (see [28(c)] above). In both these cases, the offender was sentenced to four weeks’ imprisonment and Mr Tin’s submission is that the present case is less serious. In our view, these fact patterns are too dissimilar to the present to be a meaningful basis for evaluating the appropriateness of the present sentence. In 
CLB
, the interest protected was the public health system and the well-being of patients who receive blood. In 
West Jack Gilbert
, what was primarily at stake was the well-being of the students that the offender was allowed to interact with. In this case, we are concerned with the integrity of the Public Service and the procurement process. These are incommensurables and it is impossible to say which interest is more important and worthy of greater protection. We therefore see no basis for Mr Tin’s submission that the offences in 
CLB
 and 
West Jack Gilbert
 are more egregious. Given the wide diversity of s 182 offences, it is only meaningful for the sentencing courts to compare sentencing precedents which bear at least 
some
 factual resemblance to the case before it.
71      
Charan Singh
 bears slightly more resemblance to the present case as it also involves a public servant abusing his position in the provision of false information (see [32(b)] above). However, we note that the improprieties in 
Charan Singh
 were quickly detected (unlike the seven years it took in this case) and did not involve sums as large as those involved in the present case. Therefore, there is no basis to say that the offence in 
Charan Singh
 was more serious than the present.
Public servant offenders
72     Finally, we should address the relevance of the fact that the offender guilty of a s 182 offence may himself be a public servant. In our view, this is not 
always
 an aggravating factor. Insofar as the offender’s status as a public servant may accentuate the harm caused by his actions, or may increase his culpability for the offence because he may have abused his position in the public service in telling the lie, these will certainly be relevant sentencing factors that aggravate the offence. However, where the false information was provided in a context that is completely unrelated to his work, the fact that the offender is a public servant is unlikely to be an aggravating factor.
73     In 
Public Prosecutor v Mohdnizam bin Othman
 
[2007] SGDC 41
, the offender, a police officer, falsely reported to the police that his ex-wife had forged his signature in an application for a card, triggering investigations into cheating and forgery against her. In fact, he had authorized her to sign the application form on his behalf. He only falsely reported his ex-wife to the police after their marital relationship broke down. The court found that the fact the offender was a police officer holding the rank of sergeant was an aggravating factor as his duty was to uphold the law, not to abuse it (at [52]), and sentenced the offender to three months’ imprisonment. The sentence was upheld on appeal.
[note: 75]
 We have serious doubts as to the correctness of this proposition. The motive and circumstances in which the offence was committed clearly had nothing to do with the offender’s job. It was done against his ex-wife following the break-down of his personal relationship. The fact that the offender also happened to be a sergeant with the police force should not have been treated as an aggravating factor.
74     The present case is different. Here, the fact that the Appellant was a senior public servant had implications on both his culpability as well as the harm caused by the false information he provided. It therefore was correctly taken into account in determining the Appellant’s sentence.
Conclusion
75     In conclusion, we find that the DJ’s sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was neither arrived at on the basis of an error of fact or law, nor is it manifestly excessive. As such, we dismiss the appeal.

Magistrate’s Appeal No 188 of 2006.",2016-11-18 00:00:00,SG High Court
2986453,R v Zanker [2016] NSWSC 1653,"Judgment


	
	On 6 May 2016 Shaun Steven Zanker pleaded guilty to charge that on 27 July 2014 he knowingly took part in the cultivation of 664 cannabis plants being not less than the large commercial quantity. The charge was laid under s 23(2)(a) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). By s 33 subss (1) and (3)(b) of that Act the maximum penalty is 20 years or 5,000 penalty units ($550,000) or both.
	
	
	Police attached to the State Crime Command Drug Squad had commenced investigations into possible cultivation of cannabis at a property at Schofields sometime in July 2014. On 27 July 2014 surveillance was conducted on a shed on that property and on vehicles driving to it and from it. During that day a search warrant for the property was executed. Police found within the shed a sophisticated two level multi-room cannabis plantation. Each room was walled with insulation and plywood or fibre board. The cultivation of cannabis plants was being enhanced by artificial lighting and an irrigation system. A large amount of chemical fertilizer was found within the shed. Cannabis plants at various stages of growth were located and there was a significant amount of harvested cannabis laid out on racks in the process of being dried.
	
	
	The interior of the shed had been partitioned to some extent to create two rooms which were referred to by the people who used this property as trimming rooms, one at ground level and one at an upper level. In these rooms a process was carried out of cutting the heads or buds off the cannabis plants with scissors, trimming leaves and the like, preparing the product for sale and distribution.
	
	
	On 28 July 2014 an agronomist working with police identified within this shed at Schofields 664 cannabis plants at various stages of growth, comprised of 598 plants in plastic pots and 66 in rock wool blocks on propagation trays. Police estimated that all of the plants identified when fully grown could yield a crop with a maximum street value of just a little under $3 million. The offender was recently tried on a charge of having been an accessory to the murder of a co-worker (Jacob Munro) at the crop site. In evidence given in that trial one of the others involved in the enterprise, a principal named Donald Cameron, said the value of the plants to his understanding would be more like $1,200 to $1,500 each which would yield at maximum about $720,000 to $900,000. Different views on value may depend upon how the plants would be disposed of. It appears from the evidence given during the trial to which I have referred there may, in addition to the value of the plants upon sale as a whole, have been some value in the crop for its capacity to yield recurrent harvest. The value is not particularly important to the objective degree of criminality. On any view the size of the enterprise was very substantial.
	
	
	The part played by the offender in this hydroponic cultivation was revealed in his own evidence in chief during the aforementioned trial. That trial commenced on 7 November 2016 and ended with discharge of the jury – unable to agree upon a verdict – on 17 November 2016. The evidence given by the offender which is relevant to the cultivation charge to which he has pleaded guilty and for which he is now to be sentenced was given on 11 November 2016 and is recorded at pages 378 and onwards of the trial transcript. From that evidence it appears in 2013 the offender was 24 years old. He was then using and had for some time used cannabis extensively. He lived at Gorokan on the Central Coast in Housing Commission accommodation and he was supported by a Commonwealth Disability Benefit. In 2013 a neighbour at Gorokan introduced the offender to one Phillip Holder who offered him work growing cannabis hydroponically. Holder lived at Merrylands.
	
	
	In mid to late 2013 the offender commenced to live at Holder's house and he remained there for two to four weeks sleeping on a couch. Holder was growing cannabis seedling plants in a spare bedroom on this property. He was a man in his sixties. At this time the offender also met Donald Cameron, then aged 61. Cameron had had considerable experience in cultivating cannabis and had served terms of periodic detention and full time custody for offences of cultivation on a substantial scale committed in February 1996, October 2002, January 2003 and July 2009.
	
	
	Cameron came to Holder's house to tend to the cannabis seedlings whilst the offender was living there. The plants were being grown out to a maturity sufficient for them to be transported to a larger growing space. In the second half of 2013 Cameron arranged to lease land at Schofields with a large industrial shed, being the shed in respect of which the warrant was executed on 27 July 2014 as already referred to.
	
	
	Adjacent to the land on which the shed was located was another block with a three bedroom residence. The plants from Holder's house were moved into the shed and Cameron and the offender, with the assistance of others, commenced to fit it out with fans to force ventilate the crop, lighting to promote growth, pots containing growing medium, tents for the cultivation of small plants and so on. The offender moved in to live in the shed when the plants were moved there. He worked from the outset on the establishment of this as a sophisticated growing operation. A tenant occupied the adjoining residence when the establishment of the growing operation in the shed commenced. As soon as the tenant vacated, the offender moved into that residence. He did not contribute capital to the establishment of the growing operation or to its recurrent expenditure requirements. He was a labourer in the venture, working under direction and acquiring skills as taught by Cameron. He worked six days per week for about eight hours per day from some time in the second half of 2013 until the raid by police on 27 July 2014, at which time the operation was shut down.
	
	
	His work included watering, fertilizing, cloning new plants and trimming the heads of the plants as they came to maturity for harvest. He was not paid at all until the first cycle of growing and harvesting was completed. As soon as revenue from sales began to come in he was paid $500 per week. His accommodation in the residence, after the tenants vacated, was without charge. As he lived on site he attended to watering the crop for about two hours each Sunday in addition to the six eight-hour days per week.
	
	
	The scale and profitability of the operation may be gathered from evidence which Cameron gave in the aforementioned trial. He said each of he and Holder derived between $5,000 and $15,000.00 per week after expenses from the sales of product from the crop site. When the cannabis had been harvested and prepared for sale it was apparently the practice for one or other of the principals of the operation, Cameron or Holder, to drive a quantity, so many pounds each time, to Port Macquarie where there was a buyer who would make regular purchases. Fluctuations in net revenue from the operation were attributable to variations in demand.
	
	
	Throughout his period of working on the crop from its establishment in the second half of 2013 through to late July 2014 the offender smoked one to two ounces of cannabis per week. He gave evidence that he smoked a hundred ""bongs"" per day, commencing when he rose in the morning and continuing throughout the day. He was permitted by Holder and Cameron, the principals, to keep the residue of resin which accumulated on scissors used to trim the plants. This was potent with a high THC concentration and the offender collected it and smoked it.
	
	
	When the shed was being fitted out suitably for the growing operation the offender contributed to the building work. Another older employee, Ian David Wilkinson, with construction skills was recruited in about April or May 2014. He supervised and helped to carry out the construction of an upper floor in the building which thus doubled the growing area and provided the second trimming room.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offender's involvement is of course increased by the circumstance of it having been part of a planned activity in concert with others. Illegal cannabis production on such a significant scale would be difficult other than by the co-operative effort of a small work force. The offender was a very important part of that work force, living on site and working the hours that I have described in a variety of aspects of the business, in which he acquired what appear to have been increasing skills.
	
	
	I sentenced Cameron, Wilkinson, and another co-worker, Stanley Forward, for their parts in this operation on 22 September 2016: R v Cameron [2016] NSWSC 1342. I consider the objective seriousness of the offender's conduct greater than that of either Forward or Wilkinson. All of these three were labourers in the enterprise, not principals. However the offender was on site for longer than either of the other two. He worked longer hours per week than Forward. He derived more income and fringe benefits from his involvement than Forward. All three of them were at an entirely different and lower level from Cameron who was a full partner of Holder and acted as an executive director of the undertaking.
	
	
	The offender's subjective circumstances attract significant weight in mitigation of penalty. He was born with spina bifida, a condition in which the spinal cord is incompletely enclosed within the vertebral column. This was surgically closed when the offender was a baby but it is likely to have contributed to subsequent nervous system disorders which continue to afflict him. It has left him with a weakened back which is of course fundamental to his overall physical strength. He has not developed to full stature and, without tracing through the medical causation precisely, I infer that that is, at least in part, due to the spina bifida. The disorder of the central nervous system to which I have referred causes the offender to thrash his arms and his upper body involuntarily. He has to be constantly medicated to try to control these spasmic muscular movements.
	
	
	Reverting to his early years, his mother was only 16 years old when he was born. She was already by that age abusing alcohol and drugs. She had abused these substances during the pregnancy. She had had a very difficult early life herself, having lost her mother when she was four years old. The offender lived with his mother until he was eight years old during which period he moved around the State with her from place to place. His early childhood was evidently very unsettled. His father is reported to have suffered drug induced psychosis and schizophrenia but the father had no contact with the offender. Rather, his mother took up with a man who thereby became the offender’s stepfather. The stepfather physically assaulted the offender with angry severity from time to time. He became a ward of the State from the age of eight. From then through to the age of 14 he moved from town to town around the State as he was placed with various foster carers. Between the ages of 14 and 17 he was taken in by his mother's older sister and her partner. From the age of 17 he moved into accommodation in refuges and subsequently into a Housing Commission tenancy. It hardly needs to be said on that history that his early childhood was extremely unsettled, chaotic, disruptive and adverse.
	
	
	It would be fair to conclude that these circumstances denied the offender any chance of learning or developing socially or mentally at school. Unsurprisingly this resulted in behavioural problems. He gave a history to a psychiatrist, who interviewed him for the purpose of preparing a report which has been tendered in these sentence proceedings, that he had on a number of occasions harmed himself and attempted suicide during his late teens. He was admitted to a Mental Health Unit on one occasion and to hospital on another as result of ingestion of illicit and dangerous drugs. He has misused various drugs since his mid-teens but since about 2012 at age 23 this has been limited to cannabis, albeit in the extraordinarily high dosage to which I have already referred.
	
	
	His criminal record commenced at the age of 15 in the Children's Court with an assault charge which must have been minor in view of the penalty imposed, a bond. He had a subsequent course of minor offences in his late teens: damaging property and affray. He has once prior to the present charge been convicted of possessing a prohibited drug and cultivating a prohibited plant. That offence occurred on 15 October 2011. It must have been of a minor order because he received only a fine. On that criminal history he is not disentitled from considerations of leniency. He is still a young man. He is in prison for the first time. He is not without hope of rehabilitation and his criminal record of a minor nature does not tell against that conclusion.
	
	
	I take into account as relevant to the severity of the sentence I should impose his very disadvantageous background from birth. I have had regard to the considerations spelt out by the High Court in Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525; [1990] HCA 18. There is no doubt that his prison time is and will be difficult because of his spinal disability and the symptoms of the central nervous system disorder. His involuntary movements will make life very difficult for him sharing a cell, especially as those movements continue throughout his sleep and disturb both himself and likely anyone else in a small room with him. The symptoms which I have described are exacerbated by nervousness and stress, as was evident when he gave evidence in his recent trial. This will give rise to some measure of a vicious cycle in the prison setting, where anxiety would be the order of the day and his responses to it may make life more difficult for him with fellow inmates and may lead to further stress. For the purposes of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) I find that the offender’s relative youth, prospects of rehabilitation, severely disadvantaged early circumstances, offer of support (following his release) from his aunt and medical disabilities combine to constitute special circumstances which warrant some adjustment to the proportion of his sentence which must be served without parole.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty to the present charge at what may be taken to be the earliest opportunity. His sentence will be reduced by 25% of what it otherwise would have been, on that account. Nothing has been said specifically about his remorse for the offence but I am prepared to accept that his plea of guilty exhibits remorse. Most promisingly it exhibits his recognition and acceptance of the commission of the crime. This is a step towards him getting off the track he has been on and doing something about it. His prospects of rehabilitation have been urged upon me. He has a long, entrenched involvement in the cannabis world. He has on his account been a dealer from the age of 16 when he first knew his co-offender, Forward, as a customer for cannabis. He has had the disadvantage to this point of only having had very limited gainful employment. At the age of 14 he worked in food retail and at the age of 17 in fibre glassing, doing some technical work with his hands. His future for rehabilitation will be heavily dependent upon him choosing his company more carefully, ceasing the indulgence in cannabis and acquiring skills for work and for life.
	
	
	Taking all of these factors into account, after allowing a reduction of 25% for the plea of guilty, adjusting the ratio of the non-parole period under s 44 and with a view to fixing a penalty which reflects a fair relativity to the sentences already imposed on his co-workers, Wilkinson and Forward, the offender is sentenced as follows:
	



	
	For the offence of knowing concern in the cultivation of prohibited plants being not less than the large commercial quantity of such plants at Schofield on 27 July 2014 Shaun Steven Zanker is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months to commence on 2 March 2015 and to expire on 1 September 2017 and a balance of term of 1 year 3 months to commence 2 September 2017 and to expire 1 December 2018.
	
	
	The offender is to be released on parole at the expiry of the non-parole period in respect of the offence of cultivation of prohibited plants subject to any remand in custody in respect of any other charge which may be pending against him and/or subject to the unexpired non-parole period of any other sentence which he may then be serving.

2986476,PB v R [2016] NSWCCA 258,"Judgment


	
	ROTHMAN J: The applicant, in relation to whom there is an order restricting publication of any matter that would identify him so as to protect the names and identities of the two victims, seeks leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, appeals the sentence imposed upon him by the District Court on 17 October 2014. The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 14 years’ imprisonment commencing on 22 April 2014 and concluding on 21 April 2028 with a non-parole period of eight (8) years’ imprisonment, concluding on 21 April 2022.
	
	
	The sentence imposed related to five counts, for which an indicative sentence was set, in the following circumstances:
	


Count 1: Aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of eight (8) years’ imprisonment and to which were attached four further offences described on a Form 1, each of which was a contravention of s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act and for which his Honour set an indicative sentence of three (3) years’ imprisonment.

Count 2: Sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years, contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and to which was attached, on a Form 1, a further three offences, being a common assault (s 61 of the Crimes Act); an aggravated indecent assault (s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act); and sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years (s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act). His Honour set an indicative sentence of four (4) years’ imprisonment.

Count 3: Sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years, contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and to which was attached, on a Form 1, a further two offences, namely an aggravated indecent assault (s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act); and sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years (s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act) for which his Honour set an indicative sentence of four (4) years’ imprisonment.

Count 4: Sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years, contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and for which his Honour indicated an indicative sentence of four (4) years’ imprisonment.

Count 5: Sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years, contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act, for which there is a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment and attached to which, on a Form 1, were a further six offences, namely four counts of aggravated indecent assault (s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act); one count of incite act of indecency (s 61N(1) of the Crimes Act); and one count of sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16 years (s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act) and for which his Honour set an indicative sentence of four (4) years’ and six (6) months’ imprisonment.


	
	The applicant pleaded guilty to each of the above mentioned Counts and received approximately 20% discount for his plea of guilty (Remarks on Sentence, p 13.9).
	


Grounds of Appeal


	
	The applicant relies on two grounds of appeal (the first of which is divided into two parts) in or to the following effect:
	


Ground 1: His Honour erred in that he failed:


	
	to engage in an assessment of the criminality of Counts 2 – 5; and
	
	
	to indicate how he took into account the Form 1 offences attached to Counts 2, 3 and 5 in arriving at the indicative sentences.
	


Ground 2: The aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive in the circumstances.


	
	During the course of the oral argument, it was pointed out that the indicative sentence in relation to Count 1 did not include an indicative non-parole period in circumstances where the offence had prescribed a standard non-parole period. Further, the indicative sentences, if applied consecutively, would give rise to a total sentence of 19½ years and his Honour fixed a total of 14 years with a non-parole period of 8 years. In other words there is “concurrency” amounting to some 5½ years, and no explanation or express reference to the principles of totality.
	


Facts


	
	Because a plea was entered, the Crown and the applicant were able to agree upon facts which were tendered before the sentencing judge (Exhibit A) and which the sentencing judge summarised in his Remarks. The learned sentencing judge’s summary of the facts is not in dispute and is in the following terms:
	


“The complainant, [SA], turned sixteen on 22 May 2013. The offender was her step father and at the time of the commission of the offences was between 50 and 51 years of age.

The complainant had apparently moved back in with her mother and the offender in February 2013. On 22 May 2013 the complainant attended the police station to complain about the offender having sexual intercourse with her.

COUNT ONE

In early February 2013, almost immediately after the complainant had come to live with her mother and the offender, the offences commenced. The offender drove the complainant to a bridge over the river in [suburb omitted], they were alone and both out of the car sitting on the rocks by the river. The offender kissed the complainant on the mouth, putting his tongue into her mouth. He complained that she was not kissing him back. He grabbed her by the face and slapped her. He told her he would drown her in the river. The complainant then told the offender that she did love him and that she would kiss him back.

COUNT TWO

In February 2013 after the offence in count one, the offender drove her to a beach at [suburb omitted]. It was a secluded area. He took her to the sand hills. He kissed her on the breast, moving aside her swimmers. He performed cunnilingus on her and then had penile vaginal intercourse with her. He ejaculated in her vagina and he was not wearing a condom. He said to her, ‘That wasn’t bad, was it?’

COUNT THREE

Between February 2013 and 30 April 2013, the offender drove the complainant to a motel in [suburb omitted]. The offender asked the complainant to take her clothes off. She did so and the offender moved her over to the bed. He sucked and licked her breasts. He then kissed her stomach. He performed cunnilingus and then had penile vaginal intercourse with her. He asked her to play with his nipples as it would make him finish faster. He then ejaculated inside the complainant and was not wearing a condom.

The act of cunnilingus is a matter that is to be taken into account on a Form One Schedule.

COUNT FOUR

Between 19 and 22 May 2013 the offender was at home at [suburb omitted] with the complainant. The offender told the complainant to go and get the blanket ready in the shed. She complied. The offender came out to the shed, took his shorts off, asked the complainant to take her clothes off. He had penile vaginal intercourse with her. He ejaculated and the complainant saw semen on the blanket. The offender was not wearing a condom.

COUNT FIVE

In respect of count five, it was, as I understand it, later on the same day following the commission of count four, that the offender came to the complainant’s bedroom. She was asked to take off her clothes and the offender took off his clothes. He moved her legs apart and had penile vaginal intercourse with her until he ejaculated. He was not wearing a condom.

This is the offence which comprises count five.

The following offences are to be taken into account on a Form One Schedule.

On that same day, the complainant after the act giving rise to count five went out to the lounge room. The offender followed her, he kissed her putting his tongue inside her mouth, he pulled up her shirt, moved her bra kissing her on the breast. He told her to get down on her knees and had her kiss his nipples. He then kissed her on the mouth and again put his tongue inside her mouth.

The complainant recalled another occasion when the offender leant her forward over a chair and put his penis in her vagina. This occurred in May 2013.

After the above offences being counts four and five, and the related Form One offences occurred the complainant left the house and walked half an hour, then caught a taxi to her father’s residence at a caravan park. The complainant’s father is intellectually delayed. The complainant then went to report the offences to the police.

She was taken to hospital for a medical examination and swabs were taken. High and low vaginal swabs were taken and there was a mixed DNA profile developed. It was consistent with a DNA profile of the offender.

Her underpants were also seized and sent for examination. The analysis showed semen. The DNA profile once again was consistent with that of the offender.

The facts state that the offences are representative counts as the offending against her first commenced when she was about ten years of age.

Having been asked to take into account four offences on a Form One Schedule when dealing with count one of the offence against the complainant, [SA], it is appropriate to also place on record the facts giving rise to those four counts against [JA]. Those facts have been set out in exhibit D.

During the time of these offences which dated between April and May 2013, [JA] was about ten or eleven years of age.

OFFENCE ONE

In April 2013, the complainant was in the kitchen at her home making lunch. The offender was watching pornography on television. He walked into the kitchen, stood behind the complainant. He placed his arms around her waist and slid both hands down her front towards her vagina. When he reached the top of her underwear the complainant said, ‘No’ and moved away. The offender yelled, ‘Come back I’m not finished with you.’

OFFENCE TWO

Immediately following this the complainant walked out to the shed on the land built to house chickens. The offender followed her. He put his hand down her top and moved his hands over her breasts. She asked the offender to leave her alone and again moved away from him. She climbed a tree to get away from him. The offender shouted, ‘Come back here you cunt I’m not finished with you. When you come down I will do it again.’ The complainant replied that she would not come down.

At the time of both of those offences she was about ten years of age.

OFFENCE THREE

Sometime in May when she had turned eleven she was watching television having an evening meal and then she went to bed. Through the night she woke up to find the offender lying next to her in bed. The offender put his hands under the blankets, slid his hands down the complainant’s body and put his hand underneath her underpants and touched her on the vagina. The complainant got out of bed and she asked the offender ‘What are you doing?’ The offender told her to come back and said, ‘I’m not finished with you.’ The complainant was afraid she went to the bathroom and then to her mother. After some time the complainant returned to her bed and found the offender had left her room.

OFFENCE FOUR

The complainant recalled that some time after this in 2013 she woke and

went to the lounge room, she saw the offender and her mother had brought

mattresses out to the lounge room. She saw her old sister, [SA], lying on

one side of the mattress. Her mother was in the middle and the offender on

the other side. The complainant went to the bathroom and then returned to the lounge room. The offender told her to get on the mattress beside him. She did as she was told. The offender started to rub her on her back, slid his hands down to her vagina, touching her vagina. He used his fingers to ‘play with her vagina.’ The complainant told him to stop. The offender told her that he would not. The complainant got up and returned to her own bedroom.

Those facts reveal that the mother of the complainant remained supportive of the offender and maintains a relationship with him.

In May 2013 the complainant approached her sister, [SA], about running away. They indeed then left the house together on 22 May 2013. They walked for half an hour together and apparently called a taxi from [suburb omitted]. A driver agreed to take them to the caravan park where their natural father lived for no fee. The police were contacted on their arrival at their fathers (sic). Their natural father apparently has a significant intellectual disability.”

Consideration of Appeal


	
	The learned sentencing judge is an extremely experienced criminal lawyer and judge. One must have some regard to the workload and expertise of the judicial officer in drawing any inference as to what his Honour may or may not have had regard. Nevertheless, there is a need to display a level of transparency sufficient to allow an offender and the community, including the victim and the victim’s family, to appreciate the reasons for the sentence that has been imposed and otherwise to comply with the requirements of the law governing the sentencing process.
	
	
	The sentencing judge did not, as alleged, express a view as to the level of objective seriousness of the offences. I have no doubt that his Honour took the issue into account and expressly described the offences in adjectival terms that disclosed the serious view that he took. Nevertheless, there was, unfortunately, no assessment made of the objective seriousness in terms of the range of seriousness for each of the offences.
	
	
	I also have no doubt that his Honour took account of the Form 1 offences attached to Counts 2, 3 and 5. However, having expressly referred to the Form 1 offences for Count 1, his Honour did not expressly refer to any Form 1 offences for the other relevant counts. Nor did his Honour express in a manner that was sufficiently clear the manner in which the Form 1 offences were factored into the sentence to be imposed. If the only issue were the last mentioned aspect, I would, in the light of the comments otherwise made by his Honour, be inclined to refuse leave. In the light of the other issues however, I accept that error has been disclosed.
	
	
	Further, the learned sentencing judge was not assisted by the manner in which the charges were structured. The Form 1 offences were, in some instances, more serious than the offence to which they were attached.
	
	
	During the course of the appeal, it was pointed out that Count 1 was an offence for which a standard non-parole period applied and the terms of the s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 required a sentencing judge to express a non-parole period, even in respect to an indicative sentence: s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The learned sentencing judge did not do that. Notwithstanding the point being raised, no attempt was made to amend the grounds of appeal.
	
	
	The failure to indicate a non-parole period is an error, although it is not an error that, in any sense, can affect the aggregate sentence imposed. It is from the aggregate sentence that the appeal lies (with leave). Further, the terms of s 54B(7) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act make clear that the failure to indicate a non-parole period does not invalidate the sentence. That provision does not relieve a sentencing judge from the obligations imposed by the provision. Nor does it overcome error for the purpose of an appeal.
	
	
	For the foregoing reasons, error has been disclosed. I have not dealt with manifest excess, but, given the existence of error, re-sentencing is necessary and the submission on manifest excess is overtaken and dealt with in that process.
	


Resentence


	
	It is necessary to reiterate a number of matters. First, as a matter of principle, there can be few worse breaches of trust than a breach of trust of the kind involved in these circumstances. A parent and step-parent offending against a minor is inconsistent with every notion of trust that is required of them. These offences, in particular, are, in each case, above the mid-range of objective seriousness.
	
	
	Further, each offence is said to be a “representative” offence. In the case of SA and JA, the offending conduct commenced when each complainant was about 10 years of age and continued for some time thereafter or until apprehension.
	
	
	The breach of trust associated with the offending against SA is exacerbated by the fact that PB was aware that SA had been sexually abused by her own father in earlier years. I agree with the learned sentencing judge below, who, in turn, cited Badgery Parker J in R v Phillip Sea (Court of Criminal Appeal (NSW), 13 August 1990, unrep), that a significant aspect of the degree of seriousness relating to offences of this kind depends upon the degree to which the offender has, or is seen to have, exploited the youth of the victim. The present charges involved, as is clear from the facts of Count 1, the actual and threatened use of violence. Indeed, the applicant not only hit the complainant but threatened to drown her if she were not to comply.
	
	
	While there is authority for the proposition that the aggravating feature associated with the commission of an offence in the home of the victim does not apply where that home is one shared by both the offender and victim, in this case, as is made clear by the learned sentencing judge, the applicant exploited a vulnerable young child, his step daughter, in circumstances where she was entitled to feel safe and protected in her own home and he abused the circumstance that he was living in the same house that she was.
	
	
	That aspect of the offence is different from the breach of trust to which I have otherwise referred, in that it would apply to a person who was a flatmate of a parent. As already stated, however, the offender did abuse a position of trust, and also took advantage of the fact that the victims were vulnerable and, in the case of SA, particularly vulnerable because of the known previous sexual abuse.
	
	
	There is no doubt that the offences involved a series of criminal acts against more than one victim and was committed for the most selfish of reasons, being the sexual gratification of the offender.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge took into account the good behaviour and lack of record of the applicant. As was said by this Court in R v TWP [2006] NSWCCA 141 (a Crown appeal), offences of this kind are, in some senses, similar, in relation to “previous good character”, as most white-collar crime. The non-apprehension of the applicant (or his prior good behaviour) is almost a necessary condition to the commission of the crime. The sentencing judge, as can be seen later in these reasons, expressed a similar view.
	
	
	If the applicant had been sentenced previously for conduct of this kind, he may never have had the opportunity to commit the offences in question here. Moreover, SA returned to live with her mother and the applicant in or about February 2013 and the offences commenced almost immediately thereafter.
	
	
	Were it not for the fact that the two victims ran away from this place on 22 May 2014 and reported the matters to the police, the offending conduct, no doubt, would have continued. As indicated earlier, the charges preferred are representative charges and the offending occurred on a weekly (if not daily) basis over the whole of the three to four month period.
	
	
	In those circumstances the prior good behaviour is not as significant as it would be for an offence that was committed once and once only.
	
	
	However, notwithstanding the foregoing comment, this is the first time that the applicant is before the courts for any serious offence and the first time that the applicant will be incarcerated and he is, as a consequence of that, entitled to some leniency and consideration.
	
	
	The Form 1 offences attached to Counts 1, 2, 3 and 5 cannot increase the sentence beyond that which is appropriate. The Court is imposing a sentence only for the charges that have been preferred.
	
	
	Nevertheless, the Form 1 offences may indicate a greater degree of offending associated with the charges to which they are attached. This may have the consequence of disclosing a greater need for specific deterrence and a greater need for more severe punishment in the preferred charges, than might otherwise be the case.
	
	
	Given that the Form 1 offences are offences against the two victims of the preferred charges and that the Court is taking into account that the charges are “representative”, it is not permissible to double count the effect of both the representative nature of the offences charged, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the Form 1 offences insofar as those Form 1 offences are offences of the same or similar kind and would fall within conduct that was “represented” by the offences charged. As I have already taken into account the “representative” nature of the offences, the Form 1 offences have no additional impact.
	
	
	As earlier stated, each of the charges is above the mid-range of offences for the particular charge.
	
	
	I accept, except as otherwise dealt with above, the subjective matters to which the sentencing judge referred. No further material has been put to the Court which would satisfy me that the finding by the sentencing judge, that the applicant has not displayed any genuine remorse, should be overturned.
	
	
	The subjective circumstances to which the learned sentencing judge referred were the offender’s age (52 years of age) and his lack of significant criminal offences, the last offence being in 1982 for goods in custody and remaining upon inclosed lands for which small fines were imposed. Apart from those two offences, the record is, as described by the learned sentencing judge, inconsequential.
	
	
	As earlier noted at [19], the sentencing judge also went on to suggest that good character is usually of little weight in offences of this kind, with which comment I would agree, save that, if these were repeat offences, different considerations might apply.
	
	
	The offender worked as an Aboriginal Education Officer and was successful in that work and promoted. Leading up to the offences in question, the offender was said to be suffering from stress and sleep deprivation due to the responsibilities surrounding his employment. He was, at the time, abusing sleeping tablets.
	
	
	In the Pre-Sentence Report on which the learned sentencing judge relied, the applicant was quoted in terms which sought to condone his own behaviour but did acknowledge the effect of the behaviour on the victims. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the ages of the victims, he seemed to suggest that the relationships were consensual.
	
	
	I also agree with the learned sentencing judge’s comments that the offending in relation to the younger sister undermines the claims the applicant makes in relation to the nature of the relationship with SA.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicant pleaded to the charges and agreed upon the facts and gave full and complete admissions to the conduct involved in those offences (and the Form 1 offences). Such conduct avoided the necessity of each of the two young victims having to give evidence and face their abuser in Court. He was aware of the fact that his actions were wrong and was aware of it at the time that he engaged in the conduct for which he is to be sentenced. The plea was taken into account and the learned sentencing judge discounted the sentence by “about 20%”. I allow the same discount.
	
	
	I have dealt with the aggravating and mitigating factors outlined in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and note that sentencing in any offence, but particularly in offences of this kind, can be a most difficult task. It involves goals or purposes that are often pulling in different directions and to some extent may be inconsistent. Those purposes include the protection of society, the deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform: s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465.
	
	
	Those purposes are consistent with the well-known purposes of sentencing and include the principles of proportionality and totality: see Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610; Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616; Mill v The Queen [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59. Those latter principles require a sentence that, overall, reflects the total criminal conduct and is proportionate thereto.
	
	
	In the case of multiple sentences for multiple offences, the totality principles adumbrated by the High Court in Pearce, supra, are well known and ought to be applied. Nevertheless, a sentencing judge is entitled to the flexibility to which the High Court referred to in Johnson, supra, and Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357; namely, that a sentencing judge should be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is to be effected.
	
	
	The appeal in the present matter is an appeal technically and strictly against the aggregate sentence that has been imposed. The appeal is not against the indicative sentences.
	
	
	In my view, the indicative sentences to which his Honour the learned sentencing judge referred were, in light of the period of offending, the fact that there was more than one victim and the fundamental breach of trust, inadequate. However, that comment is made in circumstances where the sentence would be fixed in accordance with the principles set forth by the High Court in Pearce, supra.
	
	
	The learned sentencing judge commented on the “absurdity” of having a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of eight years’ imprisonment. The relationship there between the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period certainly restricts the flexibility that might otherwise apply, assuming, for present purposes, that the standard non-parole period were given effect.
	
	
	Nevertheless the standard non-parole period discloses the legislature’s view of the seriousness of the offences and, together with the maximum penalty, should be treated as guideposts. It is not for the Court to ignore the prescription.
	
	
	As the High Court made clear in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the standard non-parole period and the maximum penalty are each a guidepost to be taken into account by the sentencing judge. Even if one were to ignore the standard non-parole period, a maximum penalty of 10 years’ imprisonment, in circumstances where one is imposing a sentence for an offence that is above mid-range in objective seriousness and for which there are good reasons for a greater role for specific deterrence, does not equate with a head sentence of three years’ imprisonment.
	
	
	I accept that the aggravated indecent assault is generally a less serious offence than the sexual intercourse, being the conduct involved in Counts 2, 3, 4 and 5, in each case with a person between the ages of 14 and 16 years by a person of much older age and in a position of trust.
	
	
	Statistically, and one must be careful with the use of statistics, the mean non-parole period for an offence under s 66C of the Crimes Act is two years’ imprisonment and the mean offender is sentenced to a head sentence of three years’ imprisonment. Where there are multiple offences, the non-parole period for each seems to be the same (in mean terms) but in head sentence terms seems to be three years’ and six months’ imprisonment. I reiterate that these offences are above mid-range. However, the most severe sentence (Count 5) imposed, has an indicative head sentence of four years’ and six months’ imprisonment.
	
	
	Notwithstanding the less serious nature of Count 1, this offence was the first in time and involved the applicant threatening SA with physical violence and death, if there were non-compliance with his requests. This involved a different level of seriousness and inferentially that threat carried through to the other offences in relation to SA. In my view notwithstanding the subjective factors, the indicative sentences are inadequate, given the seriousness of the offending and the lack of remorse.
	
	
	I would set the following indicative sentences:
	


Count 1: taking account of the Form 1 offences attached, six (6) years’ imprisonment as the head sentence, with a non-parole period of four (4) years’ imprisonment (i.e. a starting sentence of seven (7) years’ and six (6) months’ imprisonment before the 20% discount);

Counts 2 – 4: a sentence of four (4) years’ and 10 months’ imprisonment each (being, before discount, a starting point of six (6) years’ imprisonment), taking account of the Form 1 offences attached to Counts 2 and 3;

Count 5: taking account the Form 1 offences attached thereto, five (5) years’ and six (6) months’ imprisonment (rounded down after reducing by 20% the starting head sentence of seven (7) years’ imprisonment).


	
	The offending in question took place over three, almost four, months and involved two courses of action, one with each victim. Nevertheless each offence involved a separate intention to commit the offence in the knowledge that the conduct was wrong. Further, each offence, in and of itself, was representative of a course of conduct. As a consequence, ordinarily, I would accumulate to a greater degree than did his Honour, the result of which would be a sentence that was more severe than that imposed by his Honour.
	
	
	In the absence of a Crown appeal and in the absence of a warning (see, Parker v DPP (1992) 28 NSWLR 282), it is inappropriate (if not impermissible) for this Court to impose a more severe sentence than the sentence imposed at first instance. In those circumstances I propose that the Court determine that no less severe sentence is warranted in law and the appeal be dismissed.
	
	
	None of the foregoing should be taken as authority for the proposition that it is necessary, when determining that no lesser sentence is warranted in law, to express in the detail above, the sentence that would otherwise be imposed.
	
	
	Since the original drafting of the foregoing reasons and the orders that follow, I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the reasons for judgment of each of Davies and Garling JJ. In my view, the error in reasons below was manifest, even though not in any way the fault of the sentencing judge.
	
	
	I am grateful for the more complete treatment of the errors below in the reasons of my colleagues. I reiterate my ready acceptance (see [8] above) of the proposition that an experienced sentencing judge, such as in this case, would take account of objective seriousness. However, if “instinctive synthesis” is to be other than “an arcane process into the mysteries of which only judges can be initiated” (Markarian at [39]), there remains a necessity for sufficient transparency and express reference to objective seriousness. Otherwise, I agree fully with the reasons for judgment of both Davies and Garling JJ.
	
	
	I propose that the Court make the following orders:
	



	
	Leave to appeal granted;
	
	
	Appeal dismissed.
	



	
	DAVIES J: I agree with the judgment of Rothman J and the orders his Honour proposes. I also agree with the additional remarks of Garling J. In particular, I join with Garling J in his view that the way in which the counts on the indictment were presented and the inclusion of the number and range offences on the various Form 1 schedules meant that the sentencing judge had a difficult task to perform.
	
	
	This Court has on more than one occasion expressed strong views about the approach taken to the inclusion of offences on a Form 1 in cases where a separate victim is involved and where the offences carry standard non-parole periods: SGJ v R; KU v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [24]-[29] and Karel Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254 at [17]-[19].
	
	
	In the present case it was inappropriate for four offences of aggravated indecent assault against a different victim to have been placed on a Form 1 when the offence to which that Form 1 was attached charged one count of aggravated indecent assault against the principal victim. The second victim was younger than the principal victim being aged 10 or 11. The principal victim was aged 15. The age of the second victim was a matter of some significance and made the offences on the Form 1 objectively more serious than the principal offence charged: Shannon v R [2006] NSWCCA 39 at [28]; Eedens at [17]. Further, the offences against her were committed at a different time and in different circumstances from the offence against the principal victim.
	
	
	In respect of counts 3 and 5 charging sexual intercourse with a child aged between 14 and 16, an offence which does not carry a standard non-parole period, each such count had a Form 1 which charged (inter alia) aggravated indecent assault which carries a standard non-parole period. As the Court said in SGJ at [26] it is illogical to include crimes relating to one victim on a Form 1 where the offence to which it attached was charged against another victim, and it made it difficult for the sentencing judge to give such offences any real weight when sentencing on the count relevant to the Form 1. Further, as the Court made clear in Eedens at [19] the significance of the standard non-parole provisions loses its impact when the offence is placed on a Form 1.
	
	
	I have little doubt in the present case that the approach taken by the Crown in the regard to which I have referred contributed to the applicant being given a more lenient sentence that was in all the circumstances appropriate.
	
	
	GARLING J: I agree with orders proposed by Rothman J, that leave to appeal should be granted and that the appeal be dismissed. I have had the benefit of reading the remarks of Davies J. I express my entire agreement with those remarks.
	
	
	The way in which the counts on the Indictment were presented and, in particular, the inclusion of the number and range of offences on the various Form 1 schedules, meant that the sentencing Judge had to grapple with an unduly and particularly complex sentencing exercise. As well as this complexity, the counts charged were regarded as representative counts.
	
	
	The approach by the sentencing Judge, namely to impose an aggregate sentence, was one which most readily enabled him to consider and apply the sentencing principles of totality and proportionality. Notwithstanding the absence of express reference to these principles in the Remarks of the sentencing Judge, I am not in any doubt that his Honour did have due regard to those fundamental principles.
	
	
	In the course of a sentencing exercise of the kind undertaken here, there is a clear and compelling need for the sentencing Judge to consider, assess and set out his evaluation of the objective seriousness of the criminal conduct involved in the offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty. Unless he did so, it is impossible to understand how, if at all, the sentencing Judge took into account the statutory guidepost of the standard non-parole period. Nor is it possible to understand how the very serious offences included on the Form 1 schedules were given their proper attention and weight.
	
	
	It is for that reason that I am satisfied that error has been demonstrated, and Ground 1 should be upheld.
	
	
	I wish to make it plain that I do not intend by these remarks to indicate that error can be demonstrated by pointing to mere infelicities of expression, or an absence of an express reference to basic sentencing principles in short and succinct remarks on sentence, nor do I wish to discourage the entirely commendable practice of delivering sentence remarks either ex tempore or shortly after the conclusion of sentencing hearings. Having regard to the workload and sentencing burden placed on judges of the District Court, to impose such requirements would not be in the interests of justice. However, the complexities of this particular sentencing matter required an exposition of the matters to which I have earlier referred.
	
	
	Whilst the identification of error on Ground 1 necessitates re-sentencing, and means that the Court does not have to consider Ground 2, I wish to record my view that any contention that this sentence was manifestly excessive is wholly without merit. The aggregate sentence imposed was, in my opinion, unduly lenient. In my view, this applicant ought to have received a much lengthier sentence than he did.
	
	
	However, as Rothman J points out in [49] above, it is not open to this Court to re-sentence the applicant to any lengthier sentence than that imposed by the sentencing Judge.
	
	
	Accordingly, I agree that the appeal ought be dismissed.

2986557,R v Wells (No 2) [2016] NSWDC 313,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Mrs Katina Mihailidis died on 18 October 2012 because the offender did not want to lose the momentum of the vehicle he was driving. He did not want to have to change down to first gear. He did not want to stop. He did not want to wait the 11 seconds that it would have taken for the car in which Mrs Mihailidis was a passenger to have gone past him. Had he done those things, had he waited the 11 seconds for the car to pass, Mr and Mrs Mihailidis would have made it to their home in Mangrove Mountain in safety. She is now dead as a direct result of the actions of the offender. That 11 seconds was the difference between life and death for Mrs Mihailidis. Of course if he had known what was about to happen he would have waited but it was clearly negligent of him to fail to do so.
	
	
	I am now to sentence him for an offence of negligent driving causing death, a summary offence carrying a maximum penalty of 18 months imprisonment, and an offence of breaching Road Rule 38 by making a U‑turn without giving way to a vehicle, which carries a maximum penalty of a fine of $2,200.
	
	
	He was charged with two offences, dangerous driving occasioning death and dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, the latter offence relating to grievous bodily harm suffered by Mrs Mihailidis’ husband Peter, the driver of the car. He was found ‘not guilty’ of those offences by a jury.
	
	
	The offences with which I am now dealing appeared on a s 166 certificate. I convicted the offender of those offences.
	
	
	For some reason there was no backup charge relating to Mr Mihailidis’ injuries and so despite their severity I must ignore them for the purposes of sentencing the offender.
	
	
	The following description of the relevant facts which have led to today is taken from my judgment of 17 August 2016 when I convicted the offender of these offences.
	
	
	He was a volunteer rural fire fighter with the Kariong brigade of the Rural Fire Service, and indeed, continues to be the Deputy Captain of that brigade.
	
	
	One evening in 2012 he was at his home. He was paged and, together with other RFS members, went to an incident at the Mount White weighbridge station on what was then called the F3 Freeway. It appeared that some concentrated orange juice had been spilt. The offender travelled to the scene of the spillage in an RFS vehicle designated Kariong 1. That vehicle was a Category 1 fire tanker which carried a substantial quantity of water, it was thus heavy, weighed about 13 tonnes, and slow to accelerate.
	
	
	Before the task involving the orange juice spill was completed the offender and another of the RFS personnel at the weighbridge, Paul Barwick, were asked to attend a motor vehicle accident closer to Sydney but also on the F3 Freeway. The offender and Mr Barwick arrived at that incident and performed various duties.
	
	
	Around 10.21 the offender and Mr Barwick were asked to return to the weighbridge station where the incident regarding the spillage of the concentrated orange juice was ongoing. To get back to the weighbridge station the offender, who was driving Kariong 1, needed to turn the tanker around so that it could head north. He thus drove along the F3 southbound until he reached what was called ‘U-turn bay 10’. He decided that he would perform a U-turn through that gap in the median divide. There was a sign at the U-turn bay which said “no U-turn” but a supplementary sign positioned underneath said, “Police, RTA, NRMA and emergency vehicles accepted”. There was no other traffic heading south so the offender was able to begin his U-turn by moving to the left of the southbound carriageway before turning the steering wheel to the right. He activated the red and blue flashing lights on the top of the tanker and applied full right lock to the steering wheel. He was in second gear.
	
	
	There was some north bound traffic which had gone past the U-turn bay but a Toyota Corolla driven by Mr Mihailidis with his wife Katina in the passenger seat had not. It was approaching the U-turn bay from the south and thus heading north. It was visible to the accused and would have taken about 11 second to pass him. It was initially in lane 3 and it was Mr Wells intention to also turn into lane 3, the lane nearest the centre of the roadway. When the Corolla driven by Mr Mihailidis was about 350 metres south of the U-turn bay he flashed his car’s high beam headlights. At about the same time the Corolla moved from lane 3 to lane 2, the centre of the northbound lanes. Both Mr Barwick and the accused noticed this and interpreted this as an indication from the driver of the approaching vehicle that he or she was aware of the presence of the RFS vehicle and, in effect, indicating to the driver of that vehicle that he could complete his U-turn and that he, the driver of the approaching vehicle would give way.
	
	
	As I mentioned before, the RFS tanker was heavy and slow to accelerate, it had remained in second gear as it went through the U-turn bay at walking pace. As the accused told police in his interview conducted early the following morning, it was easier for him to keep the momentum going rather than stop and go back into first gear. As the tanker moved into lane 3 of the northbound carriageway the Corolla also moved back into lane 3. The accused saw this manoeuvre in his review mirrors and so steered the tanker left intending to get out of the way of the Corolla. He had partly entered lane 2 at the time the Corolla collided with the rear left-hand side of the fire tanker. The tanker was moving slowly at the time of the collision, its speed being in the order of 10 to 15 kilometres an hour. After the collision the accused drove the tanker into the breakdown lane. The Corolla was left stationary in lane 3 with its electrical system damaged to the extent that none of its lights operated, it was thus completely unlit.
	
	
	Mrs Mihailidis while perhaps injured in the collision was alive. She opened the passenger door and released her seatbelt. She was in the process of getting out of the car when she was struck by a third vehicle, this, a Mazda driven by another driver who was also travelling northbound. She was driving her Mazda in lane 3. As she approached the scene she looked towards the flashing lights of the RFS tanker to her left and did not see the stationary Corolla until it was too late to avoid colliding with it. It was the collision between the Corolla and the Mazda which caused Mrs Mihailidis’ death.
	
	
	Clearly relevant to the gravity of the offences and the objective criminality of the offender’s conduct concerns the level of urgency for the offender to get back to the checking station. There was evidence that about 2,000 litres of concentrated orange juice had spilt. It was classified as a chemical spill. Crew attending had to wear breathing apparatus.
	
	
	I was asked, when considering whether the offender was guilty of the charge of negligent driving occasioning death, to infer that the evidence was such that there was a threat of damage to property. As I said earlier, whilst I may have been prepared to infer that fact at the time of Kariong 1’s first attendance at the weighbridge station, there is a dearth of evidence as to whether such threat continued at the time when the accused performed the U‑turn.
	
	
	The urgency or, indeed, lack of urgency for the offender to get back to the Mount White checking station is important in assessing his objective criminality. There was no need for him to fail to wait the 11 seconds that I have spoken about earlier, and indeed, probably no need for him to perform a U‑turn in any of the U-turn bays on the F3 at all.
	
	
	In his interview with police conducted in the early hours of the morning after the collision he spoke of having to return to the Mount White checking station to finish tidying up and to pick up the crew. He had also told police that he and other members of the RFS crew had consumed pizza at the weighbridge before he left, bought for them by the owner of the truck which had spilt the concentrated orange juice. There is no reason to doubt his description to police of the reason that he was heading back to the Mount White checking station, so whatever threat there had been to property, by the orange juice spill had abated, and more importantly, there was no urgency in the offender and Mr Barwick getting back to the weighbridge station to assist with tidying up and picking up the crew, there was no emergency, or even urgency, which required the accused to have not waited the 11 seconds which would have allowed him to perform the U-turn in safety and allow Mrs Mihailidis to return to her home alive.
	
	
	In assessing the moral culpability of the offender there are two particular features to which I have had regard. On the one hand and very much in the offender’s favour is the nature of his driving. His negligence, as I found earlier, consisted of failing to foresee that by entering the high speed lane of the F3 he presented a threat to oncoming vehicles and that Mr Mihailidis might respond to the threat in the way that he did. On the other hand, and this is not in Mr Wells favour at all, why he did that, why he entered into the fast lane of the F3 was simply to avoid having to stop and start again. There was absolutely no urgency which required him to do what he did.
	
	
	Notwithstanding, a very strong subjective case put on his behalf today, and I will speak about that in some detail soon, I am satisfied that the threshold in s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has been met.
	
	
	Anyone, or any normal person, who has been involved in a motor vehicle collision would be deeply upset where a person has died in that collision. That remains the case whether or not the person perceives himself or herself to have been at fault. I have no doubt, at all, that Mr Wells feels remorse in that sense, deep remorse at having been involved in a collision in which Mrs Mihailidis was killed. He spoke about his change in behaviour as he gave evidence, and other evidence adduced today very much supported that Mr Wells is a changed man as the result of the events of 18 October 2012. But nowhere is there evidence that he has accepted responsibility. Nowhere is there evidence that he regards himself in any way at fault for what has come about. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act says that I am to take into account as amitigating feature ‘remorse’ but only where he accepts responsibility. I do not accept that that has been demonstrated by Mr Wells.
	
	
	There is also no doubt that the collision and its results has had a deep and significant impact on him. The psychological report tendered today speaks about consequences for Mr Wells of having been involved in a fatal motor vehicle collision. Despite that, he continues to do much good, even attending fatal motor vehicle collisions on, what is now, the M1 despite the traumatising consequences for him.
	
	
	Mr Wells has remained a member of the Rural Fire Service and continues to do a great deal of good work in the community in that regard. It goes without saying that those living in rural New South Wales benefit greatly from the actions of RFS personnel. Even those who live in urban areas benefit too because the responsibilities of RFS personnel extend far beyond simply putting out bushfires. Mr Wells is a member of the busiest brigade in the Gosford area. One of the references tendered on his behalf today notes that he has performed a 1065 hours of service and responded 860 times. That is a significant contribution of which Mr Wells is entitled to be justifiably proud.
	
	
	Other evidence demonstrates that he is a well-respected member of the Rural Fire Service, that many of his duties involved driving a fire tanker like Kariong 1 without any complaints as to his manner of driving have been made. It goes without saying that Mr Wells is prepared to do dangerous work because it benefits others. As Mr Higgins submitted, it goes also beyond volunteering out of sense of excitement. Mr Wells is responsible for much less exciting duties within the RFS such as training. In particular he now assists in training driving, training RFS drivers and speaks about his experience. As part of that he explains to drivers that they cannot simply rely on the provisions of the Road Rules which exempt the drivers of emergency vehicles to save them from legal consequences such as those which have befallen him.
	
	
	In a sense, I suppose, he is using his experience for good, bringing home to all RFS drivers to whom he speaks a need for them to recognise that they are subject to the laws as much as any other driver is.
	
	
	In this regard, I want to make a comment about one aspect of one of the references tendered today. The author of that reference says this, “This decision will have a negative effect on volunteers overall”. If that is somehow a suggestion that volunteer fire fighters should be held to a lesser standard of behaviour than others, that it is an attitude which I immediately reject. Being a volunteer does not give anyone a licence to break the law.
	
	
	The offender has no criminal history. He does have a traffic record which shows a number of traffic offences, including one of negligent driving, albeit in 1997, about 20 years ago.
	
	
	There has been something of a delay in this day arriving. Even though Mr Wells has, as I found, never accepted responsibility for his offending, he has for some time been aware that this day might come, that he might face sentence. As Mr Higgins said, he has had the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head for a number of years. At least part of that delay is not of Mr Wells’ making. It appears that committal proceedings of some length were held and it took some time for a decision to be made as to whether Mr Wells would be committed for trial or not. I will take that delay into account in assessing the sentence to impose upon the offender.
	
	
	I must also mention, because it is highly significant, another challenge which Mr Wells and his family now face. Mr Wells’ wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer. She has had surgery and is due to commence a significant period of chemotherapy in the near future. She lives at Kariong and will be treated at either Gosford or Wyong Hospital. Although public transport is available, no one would suggest that that is appropriate for a woman undergoing chemotherapy. Her mother lives in Sydney. Mr Wells’ parents live on the Central Coast at Gwandalan, and so if they are able and willing, I am sure that will assist by transporting Mr Wells’ wife to her chemotherapy sessions. I mention the situation facing Mr Wells’ wife and the rest of his family because it is particularly relevant to a period of disqualification which I must impose.
	
	
	There is a three year period of disqualification to be imposed unless I am satisfied that it should be reduced, but it cannot be reduced to less than 12 months unless of course I were to impose a s 10 which is well outside what I consider to be the appropriate outcome in the present matter.
	
	
	The loss of Mr Wells’ licence will not only impact on the need for family and friends to step into the breach and assist Mrs Wells to get to her chemotherapy, but it will also at least risk his continuing employment. Since February Mr Wells has been employed under contract with the RFS as a district technical officer. It is a condition of that contract that he needs a driver’s licence, so it is quite possible that his contract may be terminated. That will represent, of course, a loss of income to the family. It will make it harder for Mr Wells to obtain alternative employment.
	
	
	The Crown in its submissions emphasised the need to impose a sentence on Mr Wells which will deter others. It is very important that drivers of all vehicles, perhaps particularly drivers of emergency vehicles, understand the responsibilities they have to avoid driving in a way which risks the safety and wellbeing of other road users.
	
	
	The sentence must also reflect, as of course all sentences for the offence of negligent driving occasioning death must, that another human being has died.
	
	
	In Bonsu v R [2009] NSWCCA 316 Justice Howie spoke about the level of sentencing for offences of this type in the Local Court, a role I am effectively playing at the moment. His Honour said;
	


“It seems to me, that these statistics reveal that little regard or insufficient regard is being paid in the Local Court or the District Court on appeal to the fact that the offender being sentenced has caused the loss of life.”


	
	I share his Honour’s concern but that does not entitle me to ignore the sentencing statistics which the Crown has provided to me. It is a relatively rare event for a full-time custodial sentence to be imposed upon someone convicted of negligent driving occasioning death. I do not regard the manner of the offender’s driving in the present case as requiring that ultimate sanction.
	
	
	I am, however satisfied, particularly in order to bring home to other road users the consequences of negligent driving occasioning death that a sentence of imprisonment is required. That must be less that 18 months because that is the maximum sentence.
	
	
	I am satisfied, also, that it is appropriate, that if suitable, Mr Wells serve that sentence by means of an Intensive Correction’s Order.
	
	
	I will therefore adjourn these sentencing proceedings to a future date and order that he be assessed as to his suitability to serve his sentence of imprisonment by means of an Intensive Corrections Order.
	
	
	ADJOURNED TO FRIDAY 2 DECEMBER 2016 FOR SENTENCE

		24 November 2016",2016-09-15 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2986591,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 62) [2016] NSWSC 1215,"Judgment


	
	Jamil Qaumi is standing trial for murder and a number of other charges arising out of his alleged membership of a criminal street gang called the Brothers for Life, Blacktown Chapter. He gave evidence in the trial. On four occasions in the course of that evidence he was charged with contempt of the Supreme Court. On each occasion, the basis of the charge was his refusal to answer questions when directed to do so. No plea was taken and the hearing of the contempt proceedings was stood over until the conclusion of the present trial proceedings.
	


The First Count of Contempt


	
	The first count arose out of evidence given on 23 August 2016. It was unusual in that Mr Qaumi refused to answer a question asked by his own barrister. It became apparent that counsel was aware that this was going to occur. Counsel did not withdraw the question and I directed the accused to answer it. The transcript records the following exchange: [1] 
	


“Q. There was a third person shooting at the garage that night, is that right?

A. Yeah, there was.

Q. Who was that person?

A. I can't answer that question.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, you can.

CARROLL

Q. Who was the person?

A. I can't answer that question.

Q. Why are you saying that you can't answer?

A. Well, if I answer that question everyone's going to call me a dog. I'm in gaol and my life's going to be in danger in gaol.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Qaumi, you are in the witness box on trial for murder. Your counsel is asking you a question that is highly pertinent and you can answer it. I direct you to answer the question. Can you do so, please?

WITNESS: I'm very sorry, your Honour, but I can't answer that question.

HIS HONOUR: All right, members of the jury, we're going to adjourn briefly.”


	
	There was discussion in the jury’s absence and counsel was given the opportunity to confer with Mr Qaumi. [2]  After adjourning for that purpose, I sought submissions as to why the accused should not be charged with contempt of the Court. [3]  Mr Qaumi was then charged as follows: [4] 
	


“Jamil Qaumi, I charge you with being in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales arising out of your wilful failure to answer questions asked of you in the present proceedings when required to do so and when directed by me to do so.”


	
	The accused was not asked to enter a plea. Bail was refused and the accused was remanded in custody for the contempt matter to be dealt with at the conclusion of the trial. I note that he is bail refused in relation to the charges for which he is presently standing trial. All of this took place in the absence of the jury.
	


The Second Charge of Contempt


	
	Having been charged with the first count of contempt, I indicated that I proposed to give Mr Qaumi the opportunity to purge the contempt by answering the question when the jury returned. The following is recorded in the transcript: [5] 
	


“IN THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY

HIS HONOUR: Thank you, members of the jury. Mr Qaumi, you remain on the oath you took earlier this morning. Do you understand me?

WITNESS: Yes, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR.

Q. Before the adjournment, Mr Qaumi, you were asked these questions by Ms Carroll:

“Q. There was a third person shooting at the garage that night, is that right?

A. Yeah, there was.

Q. Who was that person?

A. I can't answer that question.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, you can.

CARROLL

Q. Who was the person?

A. I can't answer that question.

Q. Why are you saying that you can't answer?

A. Well, if I answer that question, everyone's going to call me a dog. I'm in gaol and my life's going to be in danger in gaol.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Qaumi, you are in the witness box on trial for murder. Your counsel is asking you a question that is highly pertinent and you can answer it. I direct you to answer that question. Can you do so, please.

WITNESS: I'm very sorry, your Honour, but I can't answer that question.”

By saying, ""I can't answer that question"", are you really saying that you refuse to answer that question?

A. I can't answer that question, your Honour.

Q. Do you refuse to answer it upon my direction for you to answer it?

A. Yeah, I'm very sorry, your Honour, but I can't answer that question.

Q. I am not interested in your apology. I am asking whether you are refusing to answer the question?

A. Yes, your Honour.

Q. If I ask you again, as Ms Carroll did, who was that person, that is the third person shooting at the garage, what is your answer? I direct you to answer the question.

A. I can't answer that question, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Ms Carroll, proceed.”


	
	At the next adjournment and in the absence of the jury, I asked counsel whether there was any reason that the accused should not be charged with a second count of contempt. He was then charged as follows: [6] 
	


“Following your answers after the short adjournment in which you again refused to answer questions, I am charging you with a further count of being in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales arising out of your wilful refusal to answer questions asked of you in the present proceedings when required to do so.”


	
	Bail was refused and the contempt proceedings adjourned until the conclusion of the trial.
	


The Third Count of Contempt


	
	The third count arose on 24 August 2016 in the course of cross-examination by the learned Crown Prosecutor. The transcript records the following: [7] 
	


“Q. And you told what you have got to do, you have got to kill LC?

A. That's what my brother wanted, yeah.

Q. And the third shooter is not Witness I?

A. No.

Q. The third shooter is not Witness J?

A. No.

Q. The third shooter is Nasser Zarshoy?

A. I can't answer that question, sir.

CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY: I would ask that he answer the question, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes.

Mr Qaumi, you are being asked a question that has relevance. There has been no objection to it. I direct you to answer the Crown's question.

WITNESS: Yeah, I am very sorry, your Honour, but I can't answer that question. I am in gaol. My life is going to be in danger if I answer that question.

HIS HONOUR: Mr Crown, what do you propose at this stage?

CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY: I will move on at the moment, your Honour.”


	
	At the next adjournment when the jury retired, counsel was asked whether there was any reason why Mr Qaumi should not be charged with a third count of contempt. He was then charged as follows: [8] 
	


“Based on your refusal to answer the questions and wilfully do so, I again charge you now with a third count of being in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales arising out of your wilful refusal to answer the questions, having been asked them and been directed by me to answer them.”


	
	He was told that no plea would be taken until the conclusion of the proceedings. Bail was refused and the contempt proceedings adjourned.
	


The Fourth Count of Contempt


	
	The fourth count arose from the following exchange in cross-examination: [9] 
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY

Q. In relation to the shooting, the third shooter, was he a bigger person with a beard?

A. I can't answer that question.

HIS HONOUR: I am going to go through the process. I direct you to answer the question, Mr Qaumi.

WITNESS: Yeah, I can't answer that question, sir, your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: Yes, thank you.”


	
	At the next adjournment, and in the absence of the jury, counsel was given the opportunity to address the question of why a fourth charge of contempt ought not to be instituted. Jamil Qaumi was charged with a fourth count as follows: [10] 
	


“Being in contempt of the Supreme Court of New South Wales arising out of your wilful refusal to answer a question this afternoon from the Crown Prosecutor to the effect of:

‘Was the third shooter a bigger person with a beard?’

When that question was asked of you, I directed you to answer it and you refused to do so.”


	
	I went on to say:
	


“As with the other three charges of contempt, I won't call upon you to plead at this stage. The matter will be adjourned until the conclusion of these trial proceedings and there may be some reformulation of the charge or charges at that time. Thank you, take a seat.”

Conduct of Proceedings


	
	It is necessary to make certain directions to ensure the efficient conduct of the hearing of the contempt proceedings.
	
	
	Proceedings for contempt in the face of the court are somewhat unusual and often not the subject of the ordinary adversarial process. Rather, they are disposed of by way of a summary procedure under Part 55 Division 2 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW). The summary procedure was described by Kirby P in European Asian Bank AG v Wentworth (1986) 5 NSWLR 445 at 457-458 as “extraordinary and exceptional, involving as it does a departure from normal curiel procedures and in a case criminal in nature where the penalties are at large”. Usually there is no prosecutor (although the practice varies depending on the manner in which the matter comes before the particular Judge).
	
	
	An alternative to this summary procedure is for the matter to be referred to the Registrar for the institution of contempt proceedings. That is a more appropriate procedure in cases where there may be some controversy surrounding the facts or where it may be necessary for witnesses to be called. The present case is one where the facts are clearly established by reference to the transcript. Whether the refusal to answer in each instance amounts to a contempt is not a matter that requires further evidence.
	
	
	As presently advised, the summary procedure appears to be the most appropriate one in the circumstances of this case. However, I will seek further submission on that issue.
	
	
	In cases where there is no prosecutor, counsel is often briefed to act in an amicus capacity: see, for example, Re Lonrho [1990] 2 AC 154, R v Rudd (unreported, 10 November 1994, NSWSC), Trad v Pickles Auction Pty Ltd; In the matter of Carl Trad [2006] NSWSC 1177 and, most recently, In the matter of Steven Smith (No 2) [2015] NSWSC 1141. In such cases, counsel is briefed by the NSW Crown Solicitors Officer acting on behalf of the Attorney General.
	
	
	In the present case, it is appropriate that counsel be appointed as amicus and I will make certain directions to facilitate that course.
	
	
	It is also appropriate to ensure that the accused is represented and receives advice as to his plea and the procedure that will be adopted. He should also have the opportunity to adduce evidence if appropriate and make submissions. I call on counsel who appears at the trial to indicate whether she is to appear at the contempt hearing and, if not, that she takes steps to ensure the accused receives legal representation as soon as possible.
	
	
	I make the following orders and directions:
	



	
	The Prothonotary is to contact the Crown Solicitors Office to facilitate the appointment of counsel to act as amicus in contempt proceedings against Jamil Qaumi.
	
	
	The Prothonotary is to provide the Crown Solicitors Office with:
	



	
	A copy of this judgment.
	
	
	A copy of the transcript of proceedings on 23rd and 24th August 2016.
	



	
	Current non-publication orders are varied to facilitate order (2) above.
	
	
	The Crown Solicitors Office should be asked to provide submissions specifically in relation to:
	



	
	The preferred procedure.
	
	
	The correct or best form of the charge and, in particular, whether there should be one charge of contempt with four particulars or four charges of contempt.
	



	
	I vacate the orders made on 23-24 August 2016 adjourning the contempt proceedings until the conclusion of the trial and, in lieu thereof, list the matter for mention at 10am on Monday 20 September 2016.

		24 November 2016",2016-09-01 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986607,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 63) [2016] NSWSC 1216,"EX TEMPORE Judgment


	
	At the conclusion of the prosecution case, a number of issues were ventilated by the parties.
	


Tendency Evidence


	
	The first issue concerned an application by the Crown to rely on evidence of tendency. After an exchange of submissions and other documents, that issue was resolved. The evidence, which at one time was identified as tendency evidence, is to be relied on by the Crown but not as tendency evidence as that expression is defined in the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The particular circumstances and evidence are set out in a document MFI 206. The evidence will now be relied on by the Crown as part of a circumstantial case, and also to support aspects of various witnesses' credibility, and also to place the events in their true context. I do not suggest by that, that this is the limit of the use to which the Crown can put the evidence and, in particular, the Crown will be able to make submissions in relation to the evidence relating to one count as relevant to, and possibly supportive of, the evidence and prosecution case and Crown witnesses insofar as their evidence relates to other counts.
	
	
	However, the Crown will not contend, and as presently advised will not be permitted to contend, that any relevant tendency or state of mind established by evidence of any accused's ""character, reputation or conduct"" can be used to prove that the accused ""has or had a tendency, whether because of the person's character or otherwise, to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind"", for example, to form a particular or specific intention.
	


Self-defence on counts 1 and 2


	
	The second issue was whether Jamil Qaumi could rely on self-defence in relation to counts 1 and 2. It was accepted by the Crown that self-defence would properly be able to be put to the jury in respect of count 3, which is a conspiracy count, and the conspiracy being to murder Mohammed Hamzy.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the issue of self-defence should not go to the jury in respect of counts 1 and 2 for a variety of reasons. Count 1 is an allegation of murder of Mahmoud Hamzy and count 2 is an allegation of the infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent on a man called Omar Ajaj.
	
	
	The first reason put by the prosecution that self-defence could not go to the jury in Jamil Qaumi's case was based on Jamil Qaumi's own evidence, which was that he believed, at some stage immediately before entering the garage, that it was not necessary to kill Mohammed Hamzy and yet he continued to take part in a joint criminal enterprise which, at its outset, involved just that intention, that is to say, a deliberate attempt to kill Mohammed Hamzy. The Crown submitted that unless Jamil Qaumi actively withdrew from the enterprise, he was liable for the actions of the other participants under ordinary concepts of joint criminal enterprise or under concepts of accessorial liability. He could not rely on self-defence because he did not have the relevant belief, that is, that it was necessary to do what he did in defence either of himself or his brother when he entered the garage where the shooting take place.
	
	
	Secondly, the Crown submitted that the original agreement involved a direction to kill anybody who happened to be in the garage where the target was expected to be. It was submitted that self-defence did not arise because it could not be held by the jury that it was necessary in self-defence to kill any person who happened to be present.
	
	
	The evidence in respect of both issues raised by the Crown is, in its very nature, confusing and in some cases contradictory.
	
	
	There are at least three possibilities arising from the evidence as to what the scope of the original enterprise was. One was that it was a specific enterprise designed to kill one person, that person being Mohammed Hamzy. The second version is that it was an enterprise to kill Mohammed Hamzy and ""his boys"", which could properly be understood as a reference to members of Mohammed Hamzy's criminal gang. The third possibility is that the agreement or enterprise encompassed killing anybody who just happened to be in the presence of Mohammed Hamzy in the garage that night.
	
	
	I accept that the Crown has presented strong arguments against a jury accepting self-defence or, more correctly, for it to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that self-defence has been negatived.
	
	
	Ms Carroll, on behalf of Jamil Qaumi, took me carefully through a large number of parts of the transcript to support the proposition that self-defence at least arises and should be left with the tribunal of fact to determine. I accept that there is some evidence capable of supporting the proposition that immediately before the gunmen, which included Jamil Qaumi and Witness L, entered the garage, the nature of the enterprise changed such that the jury could conceivably accept that self-defence is not excluded. [1] 
	
	
	In respect of the second of the Crown's arguments, there is a variety of pieces of evidence. As I have said, it may be that the jury will accept that the enterprise include d killing anybody who happened to be present. If it comes to that finding, self-defence would not arise in the sense that it could not be held to be a reasonable response to the threat as it existed. However, it is equally possible, or at least also possible, that the agreement was to kill Mohammed Hamzy himself, or Mohammed Hamzy and his boys or fellow gang members.
	
	
	There is evidence from a number of sources that there was a contract out on Farhad Qaumi's life and that that contract had been taken out by Mohammed Hamzy and, also, that there had been an earlier plot or attempt to kill Farhad Qaumi by Mohammed Hamzy who was present with other members of the Bankstown Brothers for Life.
	
	
	Those facts give rise to an occasion where the defence of self-defence at least arises. Whether the jury will be able to exclude it beyond reasonable doubt will ultimately be a question for it, bearing in mind the other alternatives that may have been available, but it is, I think, when all is said and done, a question for the tribunal of fact rather than for a trial Judge to take the case from the jury.
	
	
	The circumstances in which a trial Judge will do that, that is to say, take a case from a jury, are significantly circumscribed and that fact has relatively recently been confirmed in the case of Lane v R [2013] NSWCCA 317; 241 A Crim R 321 where their Honours referred to the decision of the High Court in Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107:
	


“39. Since 1971, with respect to charges of murder, however, there is an important qualification to the Alford v Magee principles. Notwithstanding Mraz, it is now well established that, where a person is on trial for murder, and where the evidence in the trial is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter, it is the duty of the trial judge to direct the jury of its entitlement to acquit the accused of murder and return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter. That is so even if the accused person does not seek such a direction, and even where the accused person actively opposes the direction.

40. That has been the position since the decision of the High Court in Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107. In that case, Barwick CJ, for example, said, at 117:

""... There is no doubt that the course taken by counsel for the appellant at the trial contributed substantially to the form of the summing up. If the trial had been of a civil cause, it might properly be said that the trial judge had put to the jury the issues which had arisen between the parties. But this was not a civil trial ... Whatever course counsel may see fit to take, no doubt bona fide but for tactical reasons in what he considers the best interest of his client, the trial judge must be astute to secure for the accused a fair trial according to law. This involves, in my opinion, an adequate direction both as to the law and the possible use of the relevant facts upon any matter upon which the jury could in the circumstances of the case upon the material before them find or base a verdict in whole or in part.

Here, counsel for the defence did not merely not rely on the matters now sought to be raised; he abandoned them and expressly confined the defence to the matters he did raise. However, in my opinion, this course did not relieve the trial judge of the duty to put to the jury with adequate assistance any matters on which the jury, upon the evidence, could find for the accused ..."" (italics added)

In the same case, Menzies J said:

""An appeal court is not, of course, concerned to investigate the actual basis upon which a jury has returned its verdict, but the events which I have outlined emphasize that the conduct of a case by counsel does not impose any limit upon the course which the jury may take and cannot make superfluous a full and accurate direction covering all that must be proved before a verdict of guilty can be returned ...

... Furthermore it is always in the power of a jury to acquit and that power cannot be denied ... Moreover, counsel for the defence cannot effectively disclaim a defence open to the accused upon the evidence. The judge must submit that defence to the jury. Even less can counsel concede a matter of law to the disadvantage of the accused. The law is always for the judge as counsel for the defence rightly told the jury ..."" (italics added)

Windeyer J said:

""... Of course this appeal cannot depend upon the form which advocacy took or upon the issue counsel presented to the jury ...""

Finally, Owen J said:

""... On several occasions during his address to the jury the solicitor appearing for the appellant disclaimed any suggestion that his client should be acquitted of both murder and manslaughter. He asked the jury to acquit his client on the charge of murder and to return a verdict of guilty on the charge of manslaughter. The case was thus fought on the basis that the only question was whether the appellant was guilty of murder or not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and it was in this way that the learned trial judge charged the jury ...""

41. In that case, the verdict of guilty of murder was set aside and, by majority, a verdict of guilty of manslaughter was substituted. The Court divided as to the outcome, and as to the reasoning processes. The commonality is in the passages extracted above - the duty of the trial judge, notwithstanding tactical or other decisions taken by an accused or counsel, to give the jury directions as to verdicts available on the evidence. It will be noted that, in the passages extracted, and in the foregoing statement at [39], words to the effect of ""on the evidence"" have been italicised. They are a critical element of the principle.

42. This Court has concisely stated the current position, in four propositions, as follows:

""(1) Manslaughter cannot be left for the determination of the jury as an alternative verdict in a murder trial unless there is evidence to support such a verdict (or unless the case on manslaughter is 'viable').

(2) However, if in a murder trial the jury nevertheless returns a verdict of manslaughter where there is no evidence to support it, the judge may request them to reconsider the matter but, if they persist in that verdict, the judge must accept it.

(3) If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, the judge must leave that issue to the jury - notwithstanding that it has not been raised by any party, and even if a party objects (or all parties object) to the issue being left to the jury.

(4)(a) If there is evidence to support an alternative verdict of manslaughter, and if the judge has not left that issue (for whatever reason), there has been an error of law.

(b) Subject to the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Rules 1952 (NSW), r 4 (see [99]-[100]), the appellant is entitled to a new trial unless the Crown establishes that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

(c) In determining whether there has been such a substantial miscarriage, it is not permissible to reason that the jury's verdict of guilty of murder at the first trial excludes any consideration of the alternative verdict of manslaughter at the new trial."" (italics added)

R v Kanaan [2005] NSWCCA 385; 64 NSWLR 527 per Hunt AJA, Buddin and Hoeben JJ.”


	
	The fact that the wrong person (that is, Mahmoud Hamzy) was killed and another apparently innocent attendee (that is, Omar Ajaj) was shot and that the assassins did not manage to kill Mohammed Hamzy does not detract from the availability of the defence at law. The evidence allows for an inference that the shooters shot at Mahmoud Hamzy believing him to be Mohammed Hamzy and that Omar Ajaj was sitting in a position where he was shot by mistake.
	
	
	For those reasons, in Jamil Qaumi’s case on counts 1 and 2, I propose to leave the defence of self-defence for consideration by the jury. That decision encompasses instructing the jury as to the availability of verdicts of not guilty, guilty of manslaughter by excessive self-defence and, of course, guilty if self-defence is excluded both objectively and subjectively.
	
	
	The third issue was whether self-defence should be left to the jury in respect of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi on counts 1 and 2. For much the same reasons as I have just given in respect of Jamil Qaumi's case, but without the complications that arise as a result of the evidence given by Jamil Qaumi, I have decided that self-defence should be left to the jury in both cases and on the same basis as I have described in Jamil Qaumi's case.
	


Manslaughter by Unlawful and Dangerous Act


	
	The fourth issue was whether manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act should be left to the jury in Jamil Qaumi's case. Neither Farhad nor Mumtaz Qaumi made a similar submission or application. I propose, unless somebody persuades me otherwise, to leave for determination that issue until I have heard counsel's addresses. Some of the submissions made in respect of that issue were untenable, [2]  but it is unclear at this stage whether it would be open to the jury to conclude that if the shooting was unlawful, that is not done in self-defence, the shooting may nevertheless fall into an unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter because it was done without a murderous intent.
	


Self-defence on counts 4-16


	
	The fifth issue was whether or not the defence of self-defence should be left to the jury in respect of the counts arising out of an incident referred to throughout the trial as the Chokolatta Café shooting. That is to say, counts 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. The Crown ultimately conceded that there was evidence capable of giving rise to the issue of self-defence and I propose to leave that issue to the jury to decide.
	
	
	The sixth issue was whether self-defence should be left in relation to shootings described throughout the trial as the Odisho and Zakaria shootings. Those shootings comprise counts 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 on the indictment. The issue was raised on behalf of Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi, although faintly (initially at least), and was also raised on behalf of Jamil Qaumi, whose counsel again took me through the evidence in some little detail.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi also pointed me to the evidence which is the foundation for the whole plan which resulted in those shootings. That involved a meeting that was said to have taken place shortly after the original murder of Mahmoud Hamzy and following a larger meeting of the gang at the Sydney casino. The meeting at the casino is not disputed, but the meeting that took place afterwards is subject to real dispute. It is the defence case that no such meeting occurred. It is the defence case that the particular accused did not give the directions or provide encouragement to any of the people involved in the shooting. Indeed, both through the cross-examination and also the evidence of Jamil Qaumi, the defence case is that the idea of shooting Michael Odisho and Masood Zakaria came from some of the Crown witnesses themselves who, it was said, were fearful that they had been identified as having participated in the Mahmoud Hamzy shooting. Nevertheless, the evidence of what allegedly happened at the meeting upon which the Crown case against Farhad Qaumi and the others rests did involve at least the suggestion that it was thought to be necessary to shoot Odisho and Zakaria because they were ranking members of the Brothers for Life at Bankstown.
	
	
	The Crown submits, quite cogently, that if that is self-defence, it is a funny [3]  kind of self-defence because it is self-defence being relied on by the initial aggressors (that is, the perpetrators of the Hamzy shooting). The reason for targeting Odisho and Zakaria is that there was a belief that the targets knew that the Blacktown Chapter was responsible for the Hamzy shooting. In those circumstances, it is not terribly surprising that Senior Counsel for both Mumtaz and Farhad Qaumi indicate that they do not intend to address the jury on the issue of self-defence in respect of those counts. Counsel for Jamil Qaumi indicated that she may mount such an argument in the course of her submissions.
	
	
	However, the fact that counsel elects not to conduct a defence does not relieve a trial Judge from at least leaving to the jury matters that might be seen to arise on the evidence (or where there is a viable defence): Pemble v The Queen. While self-defence, in my assessment, is a defence with almost no prospects of success in relation to counts 4-9, I am of the opinion that the defence does arise on the evidence and I propose at least to direct the jury in respect of each of those counts that it is for the Crown to rebut or negative the issue of self-defence in respect of Odisho and Zakaria shootings. There will also be directions as to the fact that the accused themselves do not appear to rely upon it and other issues of fact that may suggest that the defence is not the real issue in those counts but it will ultimately be part of the legal directions concerning the things that the jury needs to be satisfied of beyond a reasonable doubt; namely, that the acts were not done in self-defence or in defence of another.
	


Duress in Mr Kalal’s case


	
	The final issue concerned the accused Mohammed Kalal. It is a difficult issue to resolve because of an absence of authority on a particularly pertinent part of the argument and, insofar as there is authority, I am at this stage unpersuaded that the authority represents the law of New South Wales. The issue is whether or not, in Mr Kalal's case in respect of the Zakaria and Chokolatta Café shootings, an issue of duress should be left to the jury.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor concedes, or accepts, that there is clear evidence of threats, if not immediately before, at least a very short time before each of those shootings. He also accepts that the evidence supports the proposition that Mr Kalal acted as a result of those threats. I am grateful to the learned Crown Prosecutor for taking me carefully and fairly through the evidence establishing both the threats directed at Mr Kalal and the evidence that supports an inference that he acted as a result of those threats. I will identify a few of the threats made to Mr Kalal.
	
	
	Witness I gave evidence of threats given before the Zakaria shooting: [4] 
	


“Q. Farhad said to the three of you, 'If you don't get Masood, one of youse are going to get shot'. That's what he said to you, isn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. So when you talk about it was him or us, that's what you mean, the threat one of you was going to get shot if you don't get him.

…

Q. After Farhad said that to you, did anybody say anything in relation to that or not?

A. Jamil said, 'Whoever doesn't get him I'm going to shoot him'.

And then at 3701, line 5:

Q. Got the Odisho mess up, now we have got you are not shooting. He is unhappy with you, isn't he?

A. Yes.”


	
	There is also evidence that before the Chokolatta Café shooting Jamil Qaumi said to Mr Kalal:
	


“If you don't do it I'll have to get your family, sorry bro, like it's effectively not a game.”


	
	However, even though the prosecution accepts that such threats exist, it is submitted that the defence of duress is not available for two reasons.
	
	
	The first is that Mr Kalal voluntarily joined an illegal organisation knowing, or where he ought reasonably to have known, that he may be the subject of compulsion by those people who were members of the organisation. He points to a body of evidence that has been elicited by counsel for Mr Kalal in which it is said that his client became aware of other acts of violence and threats and intimidation engaged in by the leadership of the Brothers for Life at Blacktown. In making that submission reliance is placed on a decision of the House of Lords in Hasan v R [2005] UKHL 22:
	


“38. …The policy of the law must be to discourage association with known criminals, and it should be slow to excuse the criminal conduct of those who do so. If a person voluntarily becomes or remains associated with others engaged in criminal activity in a situation where he knows or ought reasonably to know that he may be the subject of compulsion by them or their associates, he cannot rely on the defence of duress to excuse any act which he is thereafter compelled to do by them. It is not necessary in this case to decide whether or to what extent that principle applies if an undercover agent penetrates a criminal gang for bona fide law enforcement purposes and is compelled by the gang to commit criminal acts.

39. I would answer this certified question by saying that the defence of duress is excluded when as a result of the accused's voluntary association with others engaged in criminal activity he foresaw or ought reasonably to have foreseen the risk of being subjected to any compulsion by threats of violence...”


	
	Hasan, decided in 2003, purported to overrule an earlier case of Baker and Ward [1999] 2 Cr App R 335. Baker and Ward presented a different test at 344:
	


“What a defendant has to be aware of is the risk that the group might try to coerce him into committing criminal offences of the type for which he is being tried by the use of violence or threats of violence.”


	
	[In Hasan, Lord Bingham held that this test misstated the law. There are two significant differences between the law as stated in Hasan on the one hand and Baker and Ward on the other. The first is that Baker and Ward required subjective awareness or foresight on the part of the accused while Hasan said that an objective test was sufficient. The second is that Baker and Ward required knowledge or foresight that the accused may be forced to commit criminal offences of a similar kind to that under indictment while Hasan merely required that the accused ought to have known that he may be subject to compulsion by threats of violence.] [5] 
	
	
	Neither counsel was able to take me to any Australian authority where that conflict of authorities, or change in the law of the United Kingdom, has been considered by an Australian Court. Both counsel referred to the case of Nguyen v R [2008] NSWCCA 22; 181 A Crim R 72. Unfortunately, the comment in that case appears to misstate the law that it purported to apply. That case, decided in 2008 (after both Baker and Ward and Hasan), referred at [28] to a submission by the Crown in which reliance was placed on the decision in Baker and Ward. Nguyen was a case in which a trial Judge took the defence away from the jury and the Crown set out the basis upon which it was submitted that the defence was properly taken away from the jury and why it was not available:
	


“Where an accused knowingly joined an illegal organisation or otherwise voluntarily put himself or herself in a position where he or she was likely to be subject to an illegal compulsion.”


	
	Then reference is made to Baker and Ward. That test, as stated in the submission reproduced by Hodgson JA, appears to be the test from Hasan, and not the test from Baker and Ward. [6]  When Hodgson JA decided that the defence was available and should have been left to the jury, his Honour made the following obiter remark at [40]:
	


“The defence would be excluded if the appellant voluntarily joined an illegal organisation.”


	
	That observation represents a limitation on the defence of duress which goes well and truly beyond either of the decisions that had preceded it in the United Kingdom.
	
	
	Ultimately I am going to have to make some sense of all of that but, at this stage, I simply have to make a decision as to whether or not the defence should at this stage be left to the jury to determine. However, I do not accept that the statement at [40] of the judgment of Nguyen should be followed. It is clearly an obiter comment and, with respect to his Honour (who was not really called upon to determine the issue) it clearly overstates the limitation if such a limitation exists.
	
	
	Taking into account Hasan, it is, in my assessment, a question of fact for the jury to determine in the circumstances of the present case whether Mr Kalal knew or ought reasonably to have known that he may be the subject of compulsion by Farhad Qaumi or his brothers. The evidence does not demonstrate that he had previously been subject to any such compulsion, or that those who participated in the earlier shootings (that is, the Hamzy shooting and the Odisho shooting) had been subject to any unlawful compulsion. It seems, he was otherwise involved in selling drugs for the organisation and had been specifically excluded from the Hamzy plan or shooting.
	
	
	The second basis upon which the learned Crown Prosecutor submitted that the defence of duress did not arise for the jury's consideration was the opportunity that Mr Kalal had to withdraw; first from the criminal organisation itself when he became aware of the violence in which it was involved, and then, after the specific and direct threats to participate in the Zakaria and Chokolatta shootings (but before the shootings were carried out). There are strong factors in support of that contention, but it is an argument that should be made to the jury. It is, as the Crown I think conceded, a question of degree and it will be a matter for the jury to determine whether the defence of duress has been excluded, as it must be, beyond a reasonable doubt by the Crown and, in particular, whether there was some option available to Mr Kalal such as withdrawing from the criminal group or withdrawing from the particular enterprise.
	
	
	For those reasons, I propose to leave the defence of duress for the jury's consideration.

2986622,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 59) [2016] NSWSC 1159,"Judgment


	
	At the close of the prosecution case the accused Farhad Qaumi sought a directed verdict of not guilty in relation to count 20 on the indictment which is in the following terms:
	


“FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI

20. Between 7 October 2013 and 12 December 2013 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales did supply a prohibited drug, namely N-(2-methoxybenzl)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine, being an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for that drug.”


	
	This is an offence charged under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The Crown calls in aid the deeming provision in s 29 of that Act.
	
	
	The drugs that are the subject of count 20 were located in a bag referred to throughout the trial as the “bag of guns and drugs”. Two firearms were located in the bag that are connected by ballistics evidence to some of the shooting incidents comprising a number of the other offences on the indictment. A relatively small quantity of white powder was also located within the bag which was thought to be cocaine but later tested negative for any prohibited drug. Relevant to the present charge was a a substantial quantity (many thousands) of tablets marked with a lightning motif which, on analysis, proved to comprise of an analogue of a drug prohibited by Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The quantity of the tablets, analysed by weight, is far in excess of the trafficable quantity, meaning that any person in possession of those drugs is deemed to have been in possession for the purpose of supply unless the accused establishes on the balance of probabilities that they had the drugs for some other purpose. The quantity of the drugs also exceeds, by a substantial degree, the amount specified in the schedule as a large commercial quantity relevant to those drugs.
	
	
	Farhad Qaumi’s case is that he was not in possession of the drugs. There is no suggestion, as I understand it, that he was in possession for some lawful purpose.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi submitted that there was no evidence capable of establishing possession of these particular drugs by his client. He conceded that there was some evidence from a witness (known as Witness G), that at a time prior to 7 October 2013 Farhad Qaumi provided a number of tablets with a lightning bolt imprint. However, it was submitted that there was no evidence capable of establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs referred to by Witness G were the same drugs that were found in the bag of guns and drugs.
	
	
	Senior Counsel referred to the evidence of Witness A who surrendered the bag to police in December 2013. It was submitted that there was no evidence connecting Farhad Qaumi with that bag. Even if the evidence was capable of establishing a connection to the bag, or other items within the bag, the evidence did not suggest that Farhad Qaumi knew that the bag contained the drugs subject of count 20. As I understood the submission, the suggestion was that Farhad Qaumi’s interest in the bag (which is disputed but which the jury might find on the available circumstantial evidence) related to the guns that were found in the bag. Even if the evidence was capable of establishing that Farhad Qaumi had some knowledge of the contents of the bag, including the tablets, knowledge alone was not enough. Accordingly, it was submitted that there was no case to go to the jury that Farhad Qaumi was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of supply. I am unable to accept that submission and have concluded that there is evidence capable of establishing count 20 against Farhad Qaumi beyond reasonable doubt.
	
	
	The Crown referred to the evidence of Witness I who gave evidence of drug dealing within the group. He referred to tablets that were “light orange or pink” and which had a lightning bolt on them and there is evidence that he “got them from Farhad when I needed it” [1] . The evidence of when this occurred was rather vague but it was “at least a couple of months I think, month or two” after the first meeting of the group. The first meeting was “around June, July” of 2013. Witness I gave evidence that he got the pills from Farhad and passed them on to other members of the group who would sell them. The money would come back, the witness took “30% per cent of the cut” and the rest went to Farhad.
	
	
	Reference was also made to the evidence of Witness A who described pills with a lightning bolt logo that were sold by other members of the group. He gave evidence of hearing a conversation involving Farhad Qaumi in which Mr Qaumi said “that any time he wanted more pills come see him”. [2] 
	
	
	Reliance was also placed on the evidence of Witness C. [3]  He gave evidence of receiving the bag from Jamil Qaumi who told him that it contained guns and “thousands of pills”. He and Witness A took the bag from Jamil Qaumi and Witness A took the bag with him. The evidence of Witness A is that he went away for a period and when he returned he contacted the police and showed them where he had hidden the bag. Witness C gave evidence of Farhad asking about the whereabouts of Witness A. This was after Farhad returned from overseas. Other evidence in the case gives rise to an inference that Mumtaz Qaumi was making attempts to retrieve the bag of guns and drugs.
	
	
	There is evidence of telephone intercepts on 5 December 2013. [4]  Witness J and Farhad Qaumi were parties to some of these calls. Witness J said that some of these calls related to Farhad Qaumi’s attempt to contact Witness A (that is, the person in whose physical custody the bag was supposed to be).
	
	
	Taken as a whole, this evidence is capable of supporting an inference that Farhad Qaumi was taking steps to locate Witness A and the bag of guns and drugs.
	
	
	Finally, there is evidence in a listening device recording made in the Wyong police station cells after the arrest of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi. This recording is open to the interpretation that the two brothers were referring to the contents of the bag of guns and drugs in such a way as to suggest that they were aware of the contents of the bag and were attempting to construct an innocent explanation (that it contained steroids) for Mumtaz Qaumi’s (recorded) attempt to recover it.
	
	
	In R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74; 44 A Crim R 404, the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal considered the question of when a trial Judge has the power to direct a jury to return a verdict of not guilty. Gleeson CJ (with whom Maxwell and Wood JJ agreed) rejected a line of authorities suggesting that a trial Judge may direct a verdict of guilty if they form the view that a verdict of not guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. The Court accepted that the narrower view was correct and held that that:
	


""A judge should only direct an acquittal if [they conclude] that there is no evidence upon which a jury properly directed could properly convict. It is sometimes expressed by saying that the question is whether there is evidence on which the accused could lawfully be convicted.""


	
	The power to intervene if the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory (i.e. unreasonable and unable to be supported on the evidence) is reserved to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
	
	
	As conceded by the accused in his submissions at [5], the trial Judge is required to take the Crown case at its highest. Reference was made to the decision of the High Court in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 where it was said at 214:
	


“It follows that, if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.”


	
	In a case based on circumstantial evidence, it has been held that the question of whether the Crown has negatived all other reasonable inferences consistent with innocence is a question for the jury, not the trial Judge on an application for a directed verdict: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.
	
	
	The Crown case that Farhad Qaumi was in possession of the drugs is a circumstantial one. It is not suggested that he physically had custody of the drugs or the bag. Rather, it is suggested that at the relevant times he owned the drugs that were in the custody of other people.
	
	
	Based on the circumstantial evidence, it would be open to the jury to accept that is the case. It will be for the jury whether there is some other innocent explanation for the evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, I refuse the application for a directed verdict in respect of count 20.

		23 November 2016",2016-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986624,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 60) [2016] NSWSC 1160,"Judgment


	
	At the conclusion of the prosecution case on Day 85 of the trial, three of the accused (Mumtaz Qaumi, Jamil Qaumi and Mohammed Kalal) made an application that the jury be directed to return verdicts of not guilty in relation to two of the twenty four counts on the indictment. Those are counts 13 and 15 and are in the following terms:
	


“FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI and MOHAMMED KALAL

13. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did shoot at Khalil KHALIL with intent to murder Khalil KHALIL.

FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI and MOHAMMAD KALAL

15. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did shoot at Hassan Soueid with intent to murder Hassan Soueid.”


	
	The incident giving rise to counts 13 and 15 was the fourth of five shooting incidents with which the current trial is concerned. The target of this shooting was a man called Abdul Abu-Mahmoud. The shooting took place near the Chokolatta Café in Bankstown when two men (Mohammed Kalal and Witness D) opened fire at, or into, a car occupied by Abdul Abu-Mahmoud, Khalil Khalil and Hassan Soueid. There are seven counts on the indictment arising out of the “Chokolatta Café shooting”. These include charges of soliciting and attempting to murder Abdul Abu-Mahmoud (counts 10 and 11) and alternative charges of shooting at the three victims with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (counts 12, 14 and 16). I summarised the evidence of the events leading up to the Chokolatta Café shooting in a judgment concerning the (successful) application for directed verdicts made by Farhad Qaumi: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 57) [2016] NSWSC 1157. That summary should be incorporated into this judgment.
	
	
	It is the Crown case that Jamil Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi directed those who carried out the shooting and that Mohammed Kalal was one of the shooters.
	
	
	Counsel for Jamil Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Mohammed Kalal concede that there is a case to answer in respect of counts 10, 11, 12, 14 and 16 and there is no application for directed verdicts in relation to those counts. It is thereby (and otherwise) conceded that the evidence is capable of establishing the specific intention to kill Abdul Abu-Mahmoud and to inflict grievous bodily harm upon Khalil Khalil and Hassan Soueid. At the heart of the present application is the proposition that the evidence is not capable of establishing the specific intent to murder Khalil Khalil and Hassan Soueid. This is reflected in the following written submission made on behalf of Jamil Qaumi and adopted by the other applicants for directed verdicts:
	


“7. In relation to Counts 11 and 12, those involving Abdul Abu-Mahmoud as the victim, these counts are arguably part of the original criminal enterprise agreed to prior to the Mazda leaving for the shooting, as supported by the above evidence.

8. It is submitted however, that the original agreement involving [Witness M], Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi, who might be considered secondary principals not at the scene, did not include an intention to shoot and murder Khalil and Souied. Therefore the Crown can only rely upon the principals of extended joint criminal enterprise to establish culpability for those offences, said to involve the additional two victims Khalil and Souied.

9. In applying the principals of extended joint criminal enterprise to these facts, it is conceded that if the original joint criminal enterprise was to “to shoot Abs” then it may have been a foreseeable possibility for the secondary parties, that in discharging the firearms other persons may be injured in the process. On this basis the secondary principals would remain liable to Counts 14 and 16, even though this was outside of any original agreement. It is submitted that the overall evidence of the informers involved in this offence supports that they fired at the car with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm to those inside the vehicle. These are also the offences that the jury have heard evidence that [Witness D] and [Witness I] have pleaded to and been sentenced for, which supports acknowledgment by them in their evidence that this was their intention.

10. Counts 13 and 15, to which the accused seeks directed verdicts, are charges of specific intent. It is submitted that the evidence of the principals in the first degree in this trial ([Witness D and Witness I] does not establish the specific intention to murder Souied and Khalil.”


	
	All five shootings took place in the context of what the prosecution alleges was a turf war between two rival chapters of a criminal gang known as the Brothers for Life (BFL). The accused in the present trial were members of the Blacktown chapter. The targets of the shootings were members of (or associated with) the Bankstown chapter. To understand my decision in respect of the present application, it is necessary to set out in very brief and general terms the circumstances of the first and third shooting incidents.
	
	
	The first shooting involved a conspiracy to murder Mohammed Hamzy (count 3) and resulted in the alleged murder of Mahmoud Hamzy (count 1) and the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon Omar Ajaj (count 2). This occurred on 29 October 2013 at Revesby Heights. In the context of the present application, it is important to observe that the target of the shooting escaped unharmed and that the persons killed and injured just happened to be at the premises when the shooting occurred.
	
	
	The third shooting occurred on 4 November 2013 at Blacktown. The target of that shooting was Masood Zakaria. He was not injured when two men opened fire at or into the house in which he and his family were present. However, his fourteen year old sister received grievous (but not fatal) gunshot wounds.
	
	
	In each of those shootings, people who were not the target of the shootings received fatal or really serious gunshot wounds.
	
	
	The accused rely on evidence given by two of the people who carried out the Chokolatta Café shooting. There is evidence that, as they travelled in a car to carry out the shooting, Witness D, Witness I and the accused Kalal discussed the possibility of just “[shooting] at the car”. However, Witness D said that he got out of the car and “shot at him” (i.e. Abdul Abu-Mahmoud). There is no dispute that the three victims were inside the car when the shots were discharged. There is forensic and ballistics evidence that the windows of the car were struck by projectiles from the firearms. Further, the headrest of the driver’s seat received substantial damage from the pellets discharged from the shotgun. It is common ground that the man Khalil Khalil was sitting in that seat and leaning forward when that damaged was occasioned. That he escaped uninjured was fortuitous. The evidence is capable of supporting an inference that the person who discharged the shotgun (Witness D) did so with an intention to kill.
	
	
	In addition to the ballistics and physical evidence, there is also evidence that two of the occupants of the car (Abdul Abu-Mahmoud and Hassan Soueid) received gunshot injuries.
	
	
	In determining whether there is a case to answer, the Crown case is to be taken at its highest. In Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 the High Court said at 214:
	


“ … if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.”


	
	In R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39 it was held that in a circumstantial case, the question of whether there is an innocent explanation (or an inference inconsistent with guilt) is a question for the jury.
	
	
	In putting its case to the jury, the Crown will be entitled to rely on the doctrine of common purpose (or joint criminal enterprise). It will no doubt rely on the concept sometimes referred to as “extended joint criminal enterprise” as that concept was explained in cases such as McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108, Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 and Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; 168 A Crim R 174. [1]  In McAuliffe the Court said at 113-114:
	


“The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms - common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise - are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime. The liability which attaches to the traditional classifications of accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree may be enough to establish the guilt of a secondary party: in the case of an accessory before the fact where that party counsels or procures the commission of the crime and in the case of a principal in the second degree where that party, being present at the scene, aids or abets its commission. But the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.

Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary object of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes were contemplated by the parties to that venture. However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose.”


	
	Given the events that preceded the Chokolatta Café shooting, the jury would be entitled to reason that it must have been in the contemplation of those who organised and planned the shooting that innocent associates of the proposed target might also be shot. That is precisely what had happened in the Hamzy shooting and the Zakaria shooting a few days or a week earlier.
	
	
	Whether the person who discharged the firearm had an intention to kill is a question of fact for the jury. In spite of any evidence given by the shooters to the contrary, the physical evidence is capable of supporting the inference that there was an intention to kill. It is difficult to rationalise the submission that the evidence is capable of supporting an inference of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm but not capable of establishing an intention to kill. Some of the submissions seemed to proceed on the erroneous premise that the latter was a crime of specific intent whereas the former was not.
	
	
	The accused relied on the fact that Witnesses D and I pleaded guilty to, and were sentenced for, offences involving an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm (rather than attempted murder). However, that fact does not resolve the question: see Likiardopoulos v The Queen [2012] HCA 37; 247 CLR 265. In Likiardopoulos, the accessory was charged with murder while the prosecution had accepted pleas of guilty to manslaughter by those that had carried out the killing. Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ said at 273:
	


“On the principal case, the appellant was liable for the murder of the deceased under the principle of criminal responsibility variously described as joint criminal enterprise, common purpose or concert. On this analysis, it was necessary to prove that the appellant was a party to an understanding or arrangement, whether formed expressly or tacitly, with John Likiardopoulos, Aydin and Singh, to inflict really serious injury on the deceased and that, while that arrangement was on foot, one or more of the parties to it did the acts which caused death intending thereby to do really serious injury to him. The appellant's participation in the enterprise while possessed of the requisite intention (here, to inflict really serious injury) operates to fix him with liability for the acts of the other parties carried out in pursuance of it. On the principal case, the appellant's liability is direct and, as his argument acknowledged, his amenability to prosecution for murder is unaffected by the Director of Public Prosecutions' (""the Director"") acceptance of pleas to lesser offences from all of the other parties to the joint criminal enterprise.”


	
	The accused also relied on the fact that “[Witness D] never stated that he intended to shoot and kill Hassan Souied nor Khalil Khalil”. [2]  The same submission was put in respect of the driver (Witness I). [3]  However, the jury is entitled to draw inferences from the physical evidence. Even if the shooters and driver had specifically denied an intention to kill, the jury would be entitled to reject those assertions and act on inferences arising from the physical evidence.
	
	
	The accused also submitted:
	


“The evidence of Witness I in fact changes the original agreement ‘to shoot Abs.’ The plan appears to have varied when the shooters and driver were waiting in the car. Witness I says that the plan becomes to ‘just shoot at the car and drive off’ (XXN Clarke 27/6/16 p.3717). Witness D could not recall.” [4] 


	
	It is difficult to reconcile reliance on that evidence with the concession in relation to counts 11, 12, 14 and 16. In any event, the physical evidence and evidence of injury to two of the occupants of the car is inconsistent with an intention to “just shoot at the car”.
	
	
	The written submissions refer to Jamil Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi as “secondary principals not at the scene” and as “secondary parties”. It is not completely clear what these labels are meant to convey or what legal impact they have on the current application. Under traditional notions of accessorial liability, the person who carries out the crime is the principal in the first degree. A person present at the scene aiding and abetting the principal is the principal in the second degree. A person who counsels and procures the commission of a crime but who is not present at the scene is referred to as a principal in the third degree or as an accessory before the fact. Each is liable for the acts of the principal in the first degree but their liability is derivative and dependent on proof of the guilt of the principal in the first degree: see, for example, R v Phan [2001] NSWCCA 29; 53 NSWLR 480 at [68] (Wood CJ at CL).
	
	
	Putting aside the somewhat confusing labels adopted in the submissions, the derivative nature of the liability is at the core of the application for directed verdicts. Thus the written submission conclude as follows:
	


“12. It is submitted that for the extended joint criminal enterprise to apply to secondary parties, the principals in the first degree must actually commit the other crime. The Crown must have to establish prima facie evidence that the principal offenders have in fact committed another crime outside of the original joint criminal enterprise.

13. In this case, the attack upon the other two males in the car, Souied and Khalil are a clear extension of the original agreement, however there is no prima facie evidence which supports that the principals [Witness D] and [Witness I] formed an intention to murder Souied and Khalil. Therefore there is no evidence to support that the principals have committed these offences (Count 13 and 15).

14. It is submitted that the secondary parties cannot be liable, pursuant to extended joint criminal enterprise, to offences that the principal participants did not commit.”


	
	Whether the Crown elects to put its case on the basis of traditional accessorial liability or on the basis of extended joint criminal enterprise (or both), it will be required to establish that the shooter(s) acted with an intention to kill. It will also be required to establish that the attempted murder of Khalil Khalil and Hassan Soueid was “crime falling within the scope of the common purpose” and that the accused “foresaw that the incidental crime might be committed”. [5]  It will have to establish that the accused contemplated the possibility that the principal(s) would act with a murderous intention. [6] 
	
	
	The question at this stage is whether the evidence is capable of establishing those things. Even if it was considered that the case was “tenuous or inherently weak or vague”, the case cannot be taken away from the jury unless there is no evidence capable of supporting the inference that the shooters acted with an intention to kill and that the other accused were aware of the possibility that they would do so. The combination of the physical and ballistics evidence, damage to the car and injury to two of the men sitting in the car, is capable of supporting that the principal acted with an intention to kill. The events that preceded the Chokolatta Café shooting are capable of supporting the inference that the organisers of the shooting knew that people other than intended target may be shot and, given the extreme nature of the enterprise, that the principal would carry out the shooting with an intention to murder.
	
	
	There is evidence capable of supporting each of the charges and the case must be left to the jury.
	
	
	The applications by Mumtaz Qaumi, Jamil Qaumi and Mohammed Kalal for directed verdicts of not guilty in respect of counts 13 and 15 are refused.

		24 November 2016",2016-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986625,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 57) [2016] NSWSC 1157,"Judgment


	
	On the 85th day of a jury trial, in which five accused men are charged with 24 offences, the prosecution closed its case. Four of the accused made applications that the jury be directed to return verdicts of not guilty in relation to some of the charges on the indictment. One of those applications was by the accused Farhad Qaumi who seeks a directed verdict of not guilty in relation to counts 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. All of those charges arise as part of a single incident, which took place on 7 November 2013 outside of the Chokolatta Cafe in Bankstown.
	
	
	The charges are in the following terms:
	


“FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI

10. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown and elsewhere, in the State of New South Wales, did solicit Mohammad Kalal and other known persons to murder Abdul Abu-Mahmoud.

FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI and MOHAMMED KALAL

11. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did shoot at Abdul ABU-MAHMOUD with intent to murder Abdul ABU-MAHMOUD.

(IN THE ALTERNATIVE to Count 11) that

12. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Abdul ABU-MAHMOUD.

FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI and MOHAMMED KALAL

13. One or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did shoot at Khalil KHALIL with intent to murder Khalil KHALIL.

(in the Alternative to count 13)

14. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Khalil KHALIL.

FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI and MOHAMMAD KALAL

15. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did shoot at Hassan Soueid with intent to murder Hassan Soueid.

(In the alternative to Count 15)

FARHAD QAUMI and MUMTAZ QAUMI and JAMIL QAUMI and MOHAMMAD KALAL

16. On or about 7 November 2013, at Bankstown, in the State of New South Wales, did discharge a firearm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Hassan Soueid.”


	
	It is the Crown case that the target of the shooting outside of the Chokolatta Cafe was the man named in counts 10, 11, and 12, that is, Abdul Abu-Mahmoud. He has been referred to throughout the trial by his nickname “Abs”. He was shot when he was sitting in the passenger seat of a BMW motor vehicle. He was in the company of the other victims named in the indictment. Mr Khalil occupied the driver’s seat while Mr Soueid was seated in the back seat of the vehicle. Mr Abu-Mahmoud and Mr Soueid suffered shotgun wounds while Mr Khalil escaped uninjured. There was damage caused to the BMW vehicle when it was struck by the projectiles of a shotgun and .38 calibre revolver.
	
	
	The prosecution case is that the shooting was carried out by three members of a criminal gang known as the Brothers for Life Blacktown. Those men were the accused, Mohammed Kalal, and two prosecution witnesses known as Witness D and Witness I. The Crown case, which appears to be uncontested, is that Witness I drove the shooters to the vicinity of the shooting and parked his car in such a position that a BMW vehicle occupied by the three victims was unable to move from where it was parked. Witness D discharged a shotgun at or into the driver’s side of the BMW while the accused Kalal fired a 0.38 calibre revolver from the passenger side of the vehicle. It appears that no injury was caused by the discharge of the revolver and the evidence suggests that the bullets from that gun struck the side of the BMW. The Crown case is that Mr Kalal, Witness D and Witness I acted with intent to kill the man Abs and, incidentally, the two men with him.
	
	
	The case against Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi in respect of counts 10, 11 and 12 is that they either directed or organised the shooting or were part of a joint criminal enterprise which contemplated or encompassed the shooting. There is evidence that Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi, along with another prosecution witness (Witness M), gave the three men who carried out the shootings directions and instructions as to who the target should be and how the murder should be carried out. This occurred a relatively short time before the shooting and there is evidence of an earlier reconnaissance where the target was identified.
	
	
	In respect of the victim of counts 13 and 14 (Khalil Khalil) and counts 15 and 16 (Hassan Soueid) the Crown case is that the accused Mohammad Kalal (as principal in the first degree or principal in the second degree) and the accused Jamil Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi (as accessories before the fact) are guilty on the basis of the application of the principles often referred to as extended joint criminal enterprise or extended common purpose: see for example McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108, Gillard v The Queen [2003] HCA 64; 219 CLR 1 and Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; 168 A Crim R 174. In other words, in respect of Mohammed Kalal, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi, the prosecution attempts to establish that in the course of carrying out an agreed criminal enterprise (that is, the murder of Abdul Abu-Mahmoud) the participants contemplated the possibility that other persons in the vicinity would also be killed or receive injuries constituting grievous bodily harm and that those injuries or deaths would arise as the result of the shooter (in this case, witness D) forming a murderous intention.
	
	
	Mumtaz Qaumi, Jamil Qaumi and Mohammed Kalal made an application for directed verdicts in relation to counts 13 and 15 on the basis that there is no evidence that the participants had an intention to kill Khalil or Soueid. Those charges require proof of an intention to kill and proof that the participants in the joint criminal enterprise contemplated the possibility that the shooters would act with a murderous intention. Those applications were refused: see R v Qaumi & Ors (No 60) [2016] NSWSC 1160.
	
	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi contends that there is no case to answer in relation to any of the counts arising out of the Chokolatta Café shooting. It is common ground that the accused Farhad Qaumi was not in Australia at the time of the shooting at the Chokolatta Cafe. He was in Thailand. However, the prosecution case is that, before his departure, he gave directions to other members of the criminal gang to carry out a number of “public shootings” to advance the interest of the criminal group known as the Brothers for Life, Blacktown Chapter (BFL Blacktown). Farhad Qaumi contends that there is no evidence that he gave any such direction in respect of the target Abdul Abu-Mahmoud.
	
	
	The prosecution accepts that there is no evidence that Farhad Qaumi gave any direction that the man Abdul Abu-Mahmoud should be targeted in the course of the spate of shootings in relation to which the present trial is concerned. However, it is submitted that he is criminally liable, or at least that there is a case to answer, based on the principals of (extended) joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	For present purposes the critical meetings as alleged by the prosecution occurred on 2-3 November 2013. The evidence of these meetings came from Witness L and Witness M. It is common ground that a large group of the BFL Blacktown met at the Sydney Casino on the evening of 2 November 2013. That was a day or so after the killing of Mahmoud Hamzy at Revesby Heights (count 1) and the wounding of Omar Ajaj (count 2). Those men were shot in the course of a failed attempt to murder the leader of a rival gang (the BFL Bankstown), Mohammed Hamzy. While at the casino, Farahd Qaumi spoke with two members of the BFL Bankstown. It is the prosecution case that the Revesby Heights shooting occurred in the context of some kind of “turf war” between the rival chapters and that the BFL Blacktown were attempting to take over some of the territory in which the BFL Bankstown was dealing in drugs and conducting other criminal activity. It is the defence case (or at least the case of Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi) that the cause of the conflict and the motivation for the shooting was the fact that Mohammed Hamzy had taken out a contract on the life of Farhad Qaumi. There seems to be little dispute, and at least it is the Crown case, that Farhad Qaumi was the self-appointed leader of the BFL Blacktown Chapter. In any event, the meeting at the casino followed that shooting.
	
	
	There is a significant body of evidence that Farhad Qaumi and his brothers were concerned that the BFL Bankstown may seek to retaliate after the failed attempt to kill Mohammed Hamzy. This is alleged to be the motive for the shooting of Michael Odisho on 3 November 2013 (count 4-5) and a shooting at the home of Masood Zakaria on 4 November 2013 (counts 7-9). The targets of those shootings were members of the BFL Bankstown. However, Abdul Abu-Mahmoud was not a member of the BFL Bankstown although he had some association with that group.
	
	
	After the meeting at the casino, the prosecution case is that a smaller group attended a park, possibly in the area of the Botanic Gardens or that part of the Domain adjacent to Mrs Macquarie’s Chair. The evidence of Witness L is that in the course of this meeting Farhad Qaumi formulated a plan to embark on a series of shootings of persons associated with the Brothers for Life Bankstown. A number of people were specifically nominated. However, there is no evidence that Mr Abu-Mahmoud was not nominated as a target. Witness L’s evidence on this subject was as follows:
	


“Q. What was said? If you could tell us who is talking?

A. Farhad's talking. Basically what he's saying, he goes to me, ‘We have to retaliate before the Lebos gonna get us, we got to get them first’. That's why when he made the list about who we're going to get, he start mentioning names of persons we have to get before they gonna get us.

Q. Do you recall names that were said?

A. Yes.

Q. Who said them?

A. Farhad.

Q. What names did he say?

A. He wanted to get LC again but he was under the police custody after the time, I don't know, they put him in hotel or somewhere, but he wanted to still get him. Then he wanted to get LC's brother. He wanted to get Omar Ajaj again. He wanted to get Mikey.

Q. Who's Mikey?

A. Michael Odisho. Then Masood, I don't know, Zakaria, whatever his name is. Then he wanted to get Khaled Hamzy, this other bloke, I forget his name at the moment, he had the money. He goes, ‘We have to get him too cause he's gonna put up the money for people to come get us’. That's roughly what I remember at the moment.” [1] 


	
	It will be seen that there is no suggestion that Abdul Abu-Mahmoud was to be the target of the shooting.
	
	
	The other relevant evidence comes from Witness M. She gave an account of a meeting that occurred in the days following the Hamzy shooting and before Farhad Qaumi’s departure for Thailand:
	


“Q. You said Farhad had a conversation. What was said, if you could tell us who is talking?

A. Farhad told me that he was going overseas to Thailand, that he wanted to get off the radar because of what had just happened with the Hamzy murder and what was about to happen. He told me that he had formed three squads which had, I don't know how many people in each squad. He said he would put ‑ his first was the stronger squad, he was going to put them into play first and if something happened to them then he would use the second, then the third.

Q. Did he say anything about what these squads were going to do?

A. He had a list, like not a list, like a written down list, but he said that he wanted to get Michael Odisho, Mohammed Sanoussi, Abs, Masood Zakaria and LC's brothers.

Q. How many brothers does LC have?

A. Three.

Q. Sorry?

A. Three, three.

Q. Was there anything else said at this point?

A. He said ‑ he was talking to me about Abs. He said that he's ‑ at first he said Abs was on the list and then he changed his mind because he said that if he got Abs, then people would definitely know that it was him that was behind the Hamzy murder, because Abs wasn't, like, a proper part of them, he was like a proper part of LC and that. So‑‑

Q. You have got to do your best to tell us the words that were said by Farhad. What did he say?

A. Abs wasn't with them so that then they would suspect it was him and that Bas wouldn't be happy. He didn't want to upset Bas.

Q. Did you take that to be a reference to Bassam Hamzy?

A. Yes.” [2] 


	
	Again, Mr Abu-Mahmoud was not nominated to be the target of any of the proposed shootings.
	
	
	In terms of the events immediately preceding the shooting outside the Chokolatta café, Witness M gave evidence of meeting Jamil Qaumi at the Thornleigh McDonalds and then meeting with Mumtaz Qaumi, “maybe Jamil”, Witness D and Witness I in a street parallel to the BP station at Rosehill. She gave the following evidence:
	


“Q. No, from when you met him, go through what the conversation was?

A. Mumtaz told me that he had heard that Abs has got his or Farhad's address on the Central Coast. I said to Mumtaz that wouldn't be hard considering Abs has got friends in real estate. And he said ‑ Mumtaz said that they're gonna shoot him, their gonna shoot Abs. He said that he was angry because he was left there to deal with all of this while Farhad was partying in Thailand.

…

Q. Okay. What happened after the conversation?

A. Then he told Witness I and Witness D and Jamil that ‑ sorry, he was telling them that they had to go to shoot Abs.

Q. Yes.

A. He was asking me what time the shop shut or what time he finishes work. I said I didn't know, it was late.

Q. Who asked you that?

A. Mumtaz. When he said that he ‑ they were gonna shoot Abs, I told him that Farhad didn't want him shot and he said, well, its different now because they've got the address. And then he was just trying to get ‑ they were trying to organise a screwdriver to change the number plates.” [3] 


	
	Witness I also gave evidence about the meeting at “Rosehill Maccas”:
	


“Q. So in this street a couple of streets away from the Maccas, who was present?

A. Mumtaz, Jamil, Witness M, me, Witness D, Kalal and Masood was sitting in the car.

Q. What happened when you were in this location with these people?

A. Well, Witness M was talking to Jamil and Mumtaz first. Me, Witness D were on the side.

Q. Right. So did you hear any of that conversation?

A. Not at the beginning but later on Witness M was saying ‑ I heard Witness M saying that Abs is getting everyone's address and we got to get Abs.

…

Q. What happened after that?

A. Mumtaz and Jamil ‑ Mumtaz told us, told me and Witness D that we have to get Abs. We didn't know how to get there or what to do so Witness M says she's gonna show us the shop or the way to get there. Jamil told me to call my friend, Rokhzayi, to get the guns ready. And I called him. We went to Bankstown, Witness M showed us the shop.” [4] 


	
	Witness L gave evidence of a meeting that appears to have been on the night of the Chokolatta Café shooting:
	


“Q. What happened after you handed the gloves over?

A. I asked them, ""What's going on?"". They go, ""We're getting ‑ we're getting Abs today. We're getting Abs"".

Q. Who answered you, when you said‑‑

A. Mumtaz.

Q. What did Mumtaz say?

A. He goes, ‘We're getting Abs today’.

Q. Did you know a person named Abs?

A. Yes.

Q. Who did you know that to be?

A. I met him once near the Bankstown area with Farhad.

Q. Was anything else said?

A. Basically they said, ‘We're gonna get Abs tonight’. Then apparently he's given our ‑ he's talking, Mumtaz is saying, ‘He's given our addresses from up there, from the coast to the Lebos’. He goes, ‘We got to get them first’.

Q. He's giving out addresses up there, up the coast?

A. Yeah. Like, Farhad and Mumtaz's addresses.

Q. At that time, or as far as you know, did Farhad and Mumtaz live up‑‑

A. Yes.

Q. Out of Sydney, up the coast?

A. Yes.

Q. Had you been to their‑‑

A. Not inside the house but I been up the coast, yes.

Q. Anything else said to you?

A. I think that's about it. Then I said, ‘Okay’. I think that's when I seen Witness I, I said hello to him and I left. I jumped back in my mate's car and took off. Q. Did you have any more involvement with any of the members‑‑

A. No.

Q. ‑‑that night?

A. No.” [5] 


	
	Witness D’s evidence of the meeting before the shooting was vague but included the following:
	


“Q. Whilst near this petrol pump place, do you recall any conversation? Anything said?

A. At that time?

Q. Yes?

A. No.

Q. You can't recall?

A. Yeah, I can't recall.

Q. How long did you stay there?

A. It was fair while until it got dark.

Q. Was there people talking whilst you were there?

A. Yeah, people were talking.

Q. Any recollection at all of anything said?

A. No, I don't remember.

Q. What happened then?

A. Then we ‑ I went in a car and me and Witness I went in a car and that guy, a guy got pointed at, then we had to shoot him.”  [6] 


	
	There is nothing in the evidence of events leading up to shooting outside the Chokolatta Café on 7 November 2013 to suggest that Farhad Qaumi ordered the shooting of Mr Abu-Mahmoud or was part of a criminal enterprise to commit that shooting. Witness M’s evidence suggests that he had specifically ruled out Mr Abu-Mahmoud as a target.
	
	
	The Chokolatta Cafe shooting was so poorly planned and executed that it was the beginning of the end of the Blacktown Chapter of the Brothers for Life. In its immediate aftermath, a number of the gang members were arrested and two guns used in the shooting (later connected with other criminal activities involving the gang) were seized by police. Witness L gave evidence of a conversation he had with Farhad Qaumi after the latter returned from Thailand:
	


“Q. Who was present for the conversation?

A. Mumtaz, Farhad and myself.

Q. Did Farhad say something about the Chokolatta matter?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was he talking to?

A. Mumtaz.

Q. What did he say?

A. He was going off at him.

Q. He was going off at him; what do you recall him saying?

A. Basically he was telling him, ‘You dumb cunt, why'd you believe Witness M for. Because of her my brother's locked up now’.

Q. Did you understand him to be referring to Jamil‑‑

A. Yes.

Q. ‑‑being locked up?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there any mention of Abs in the conversation?

A. Yes.

Q. What do you recall and who said something about Abs?

A. So Mumtaz wasn't saying nothing, everything was Farhad telling him, he's saying, ‘Witness M’s got a vendetta against Absy’.

Q. Who said that?

A. Farhad's telling that. ‘Because of that you won't believe that ‑ Absy and LC, they don't like each other, why would he give my address to them for?’

Q. Who was he talking to?

A. Mumtaz.

Q. And did Mumtaz respond, say anything?

A. No.” [7] 


	
	In light of that evidence it is difficult to understand how Farhad Qaumi might be criminally responsible for the shooting outside the Chokolatta Cafe, either by reference to traditional principles of accessorial liability or by application of the doctrine of extended joint criminal enterprise as explained in cases such as McAuliffe, Clayton and Gillard.
	
	
	However, the prosecution submits that his criminal liability arises in the following way:
	


(1)    Farhad Qaumi was the undisputed leader of the Brothers for Life at Bankstown.

(2)    Farhad Qaumi ordered a number of shootings directed at members of the Bankstown BFL and persons associated with that group.

(3)    In the course of the Revesby Heights shooting and the Zakaria shooting, people other than the targets were shot, wounded and in one case killed. Those victims (Mahmoud Hamzy, Omar Ajaj and H) were innocent bystanders who just happened to be in the vicinity of the shooting that Farhad Qaumi had ordered. Accordingly, Farhad Qaumi in ordering the shootings was aware that other persons may be killed or injured in the execution of those criminal acts.

(4)    When Farhad Qaumi left Australia in the midst of this spate of shootings he left his brother Mumtaz Qaumi in charge of the group. He told one or more of his subordinates in the group to follow the orders and directions of Mumtaz Qaumi.

(5)    Mumtaz Qaumi ordered the execution of Abdul Abu-Mahmoud.

(6)   Those carrying out the orders of Mumtaz Qaumi believed, or were entitled to believe, that they were carrying out the orders that ultimately derived from the leader, that is, Farhad Qaumi.


	
	According to the Crown Prosecutor this gives rise to criminal liability pursuant to the principles of extended joint criminal enterprise as articulated by the High Court in cases such as McAuliffe, Gillard and Clayton. The Crown provided a proposed direction that articulated the case that it proposed to put to the jury:
	


“The Crown alleges the accused Farhad Qaumi was a participant in a joint criminal enterprise with other members of the Blacktown Brothers for Life to commit a series of offences to take place over a number of day. The offences involved the shooting with intent to kill or at least inflict grievous bodily harm on persons who were members of the Bankstown Brothers for Life or persons who could assist Bankstown Brothers for Life to retaliate against Blacktown Brothers for Life members including himself for their involvement in the Revesby Heights shootings . The objective of the shootings was to advance the interests of the Blacktown Brothers for Life in their conflict with the Bankstown Brothers for Life.

It is the Crown case that Farhad Qaumi was the leader of the Blacktown Brothers for Life and as leader formulated the plan to commit a series of shootings targeting Bankstown Brothers for Life members and others who may assist that group in retaliating. It is the crown case that Farhad Qaumi put in place an arrangement that after the first two shootings he would be overseas and that his brother Mumtaz Qaumi would give the orders for the shootings that followed. Further it can be inferred that he authorised Mumtaz Qaumi to use the Blacktown Brothers for Life personnel and arsenal of weapons to commit the offences. Prior to departure overseas Farhad Qaumi knew that in shootings already committed by his group persons that the shootings were committed in circumstances where persons other than the intended target were present and such persons were shot in the attacks.

The targeting and shooting of Abdul Abu-Mahmoud outside Chokolatta café was because it was believed that he could provide addresses to Bankstown Brothers for Life of the Qaumis so that Bankstown could retaliate by attacking them in their homes. It is the Crown case that the shootings in the early hours of 7/11/2013 was in pursuance of the joint enterprise in which one of the objectives was to shoot and kill or cause grievous bodily harm to persons they believed could assist Bankstown Brothers for Life in retaliating. The Crown case is that the accused foresaw the possibility that in carrying out the joint criminal enterprise persons his members would shoot with intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm persons other than those specifically targeted.

The crown case is that if it is found that the shooting was pursuant to the ongoing joint criminal enterprise it does not matter if they accept evidence that Farhad Qaumi at a time before the shooting and a time subsequent to the shooting expressed that he did not wish or intend the person Abdul Abu-Mahmoud to be shot.” [8] 


	
	In McAuliffe v The Queen, the doctrine was encapsulated in the following passage from the judgment of the High Court at 113-114:
	


“The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms - common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise - are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime. The liability which attaches to the traditional classifications of accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree may be enough to establish the guilt of a secondary party: in the case of an accessory before the fact where that party counsels or procures the commission of the crime and in the case of a principal in the second degree where that party, being present at the scene, aids or abets its commission. But the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.

Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary object of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes were contemplated by the parties to that venture. However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose.”


	
	After referring to Johns v The Queen (1980) 143 CLR 108 and the Privy Council’s decision in Chan Wing-Siu v The Queen [1985] AC 168, their Honours continued at 117:
	


“In Johns this Court was concerned with the common purpose of a joint criminal enterprise. In particular, it was concerned with whether the scope of the common purpose extended to possible as well as probable incidents of the venture. The scope of the common purpose is no different from the scope of the understanding or arrangement which constitutes the joint enterprise; they are merely different ways of referring to the same thing. Whatever is comprehended by the understanding or arrangement, expressly or tacitly, is necessarily within the contemplation of the parties to the understanding or arrangement. That is why the majority in Johns in the passage which we have cited above spoke in terms of an act which was in the contemplation of both the secondary offender and the principal offender. There was no occasion for the Court to turn its attention to the situation where one party foresees, but does not agree to, a crime other than that which is planned, and continues to participate in the venture. However, the secondary offender in that situation is as much a party to the crime which is an incident of the agreed venture as he is when the incidental crime falls within the common purpose. Of course, in that situation the prosecution must prove that the individual concerned foresaw that the incidental crime might be committed and cannot rely upon the existence of the common purpose as establishing that state of mind. But there is no other relevant distinction. As Sir Robin Cooke observed, the criminal culpability lies in the participation in the joint criminal enterprise with the necessary foresight and that is so whether the foresight is that of an individual party or is shared by all parties. That is in accordance with the general principle of the criminal law that a person who intentionally assists in the commission of a crime or encourages its commission may be convicted as a party to it.”


	
	The Crown placed reliance on the following passage of the majority in Clayton [17]:
	


“A person who does not intend the death of the victim, but does intend to do really serious injury to the victim, will be guilty of murder if the victim dies. If a party to a joint criminal enterprise foresees the possibility that another might be assaulted with intention to kill or cause really serious injury to that person, and, despite that foresight, continues to participate in the venture, the criminal culpability lies in the continued participation in the joint enterprise with the necessary foresight. That the participant does not wish or intend that the victim be killed is of no greater significance than the observation that the person committing the assault need not wish or intend that result, yet be guilty of the crime of murder.”


	
	The United Kingdom Supreme Court recently declared that the law took a “wrong turn” in Chan Wing-Siu and McAuliffe: R v Jogee [2016] UKSC 8. There are currently two cases pending before the High Court in which the appellants contend that R v Jogee should be followed and that the Australian cases in which the concept of extended joint criminal enterprise was formulated should be overruled. Cases of Miller and Ors v The Queen was argued before the Full Court on 10-11 May 2016 and judgment is pending: [2016] HCATrans 107. Special leave was granted in a case called Bucca & Castle v The Queen and the matter is listed for argument on 31 August 2016: [2016] HCATrans 121. A perusal of the submissions (which are available on the High Court’s website) [9]  shows that the appellants will similarly argue that the law of extended joint criminal enterprise as it has been applied in Australia, at least since the decision of McAuliffe, is wrong and should be changed. In spite of these developments, the law as it currently stands is that stated in McAuliffe. Senior Counsel submitted that McAuliffe and the cases following it were wrongly decided. However, he made this submission to protect his client’s position but it is accepted that I must apply the law as it currently stands in determining each of the applications for directed verdict that were argued on 18-19 August 2016.
	
	
	In determining the current application I must take the Crown case at its highest. As it was put in in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 214:
	


“ … if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.”


	
	In a circumstantial case, the question of whether the Crown has negatived all other reasonable inferences consistent with innocence is a question for the jury, not the trial Judge on an application for a directed verdict: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.
	
	
	Even taking the prosecution case at its highest and giving effect to the extension of criminal responsibility as represented by the Australian law of extended joint criminal enterprise, I am unable to accept the Crown’s submission that there is a case capable of establishing Farhad Qaumi’s guilt in relation to counts 10 – 16. There is no evidence upon which the jury could conclude (and I emphasise the word “could”) that Farhad Qaumi contemplated the possibility that Mumtaz Qaumi would make the decision to set upon a plan to kill Mr Abu-Mahmoud. Whilst there appears to be evidence that Mr Abu-Mahmoud had some association with members of the Bankstown BFL, he was not a member of that organisation and there is no evidence that Farhad Qaumi was aware of any threat that he apparently posed (at least in the rather erratic thinking of Mumtaz Qaumi and Witness M). The only evidence of Farhad Qaumi’s intentions in respect of Mr Abu-Mahmoud is that he did not want him to be a target of the shootings.
	
	
	I am unable to accept the Crown’s submission that the fact that Farhad Qaumi directed a series of shootings, as a pre-emptive strike against a feared reprisal or to take over the turf of the Bankstown BFL, gives rise to a case that he contemplated the possibility that Abdul Abu-Mahmoud would be targeted by Mumtaz Qaumi and his cohorts, let alone that others would be shot with murderous intent in the process. There is no evidence that Farhad Qaumi authorised or directed an unspecified series of “public shootings”. Rather, on the Crown case, he nominated or specified a number of potential targets for these shootings and left his brother in charge of organising and executing those shootings.
	
	
	There is no evidence that he gave directions to members of the Brothers for Life Blacktown that they should follow Mumtaz Qaumi’s orders in respect of any crime or shooting that Mumtaz Qaumi decided to commit. The “scope of the common purpose” was determined by reference to a group of named targets. Mr Abu-Mahmoud was specifically excluded from that group. This is a different situation to that considered by the High Court in paragraph [17] of Clayton where an accused might be convicted of murder even though he did not want the victim to be killed but foresaw the possibility that a participant in the enterprise may act with murderous intent. Rather, this is a case where the solicitation and attempt to murder Mr Abu-Mahmoud was outside the scope of the criminal enterprise of which the accused was a participant. The evidence is not capable of establishing that Farhad Qaumi contemplated or foresaw the possibility that Mumtaz Qaumi and others would target people outside the scope of the criminal enterprise or one who was specifically excluded from it.
	
	
	Accordingly, I have concluded in respect of counts 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 that there is no case for Farhad Qaumi to answer. I intend to direct the jury to enter verdicts of not guilty in respect of those seven counts.

		24 November 2016",2016-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986626,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 58) [2016] NSWSC 1066,"Judgment


	
	At the close of the prosecution case Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi submitted that the jury should be directed to return a verdict of not guilty in respect of count 18 which is in the following terms:
	


“On or about 29 November 2013, at Greenacre in the State of New South Wales, did, in the course of an organised criminal activity, fire a firearm at a dwelling house or other building with reckless disregard for the safety of others.”


	
	The trial involves five accused charged, in various combinations, with a total of 24 offences and has been proceeding for well in excess of four months. There have been several other applications for directed verdicts and judgments in respect of each have been published at the same time as this judgment: R v Qaumi & Ors (No 57) [2016] NSWSC 1157; R v Qaumi & Ors (No 59) [2016] NSWSC 1159 and R v Qaumi & Ors (No 60) [2016] NSWSC 1160.
	
	
	In respect of count 18, the case against both accused is that they directed two other people (Witness L and Witness M) to carry out a “drive-by” shooting at the residential premises of the mother of a rival gang leader. Those premises were located at 142-150 Greenacre Road, Greenacre. This is a complex consisting of a number of townhouses situated on either side of an elongated U-shaped driveway on the southern side of Greenacre Road. The case against each accused consists largely of the evidence of Witnesses L and M. Evidence was also given by a number of people who were in the vicinity of the shooting and a body of physical evidence consisting of plans, photographs and ballistics material.
	
	
	The background to the Greenacre shooting is that Farhad Qaumi was the leader of a criminal gang known as the Blacktown Chapter of the Brothers for Life (BFL Blacktown). Mumtaz Qaumi was the second in charge of that organisation. A man called Mohammad Hamzy (also known as Little Crazy) was the leader of the Bankstown Chapter of the Brothers for Life (BFL Bankstown). In late October 2013, information came to Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi that Mohammad Hamzy had taken out a contract on the life of Farhad Qaumi. This information came from a person known as Witness M. Further, it is the prosecution case that Farhad Qaumi wanted to take over the “turf” controlled by BFL Bankstown for the purpose of expanding his criminal empire.
	
	
	There is a dispute in the trial as to the motive for what followed but it is common ground that on 29 October 2013, at the direction of Farhad Qaumi, Witness M and three members of the BFL Blacktown went to the home of Mohammad Hamzy and attempted to murder him. In the course of that bungled enterprise, Mahmoud Hamzy was killed and Omar Ajaj was injured while Mohammad Hamzy escaped without injury. There are a number of charges on the indictment arising out of that event (counts 1-3).
	
	
	There followed a series of other shootings directed at the membership of the BFL Bankstown. This included the attempted murder of Michael Odisho on 3 November 2013 (counts 4-6), the attempted murder of Masood Zakaria on 4 November 2013 (counts 7-9) and a shooting in the vicinity of the Chokolatta Café in Bankstown on 7 November 2013 (counts 10-16).
	
	
	After that series of shootings, a former member or associate of the BFL Blacktown, a man called Sina Mirzaei, was a target in a shooting allegedly perpetrated by the BFL Bankstown. The prosecution case is that the shooting at Greenacre on 29 November 2013 was in retaliation to the shooting of Sina Mirzaei.
	
	
	The critical evidence in the present application comes from Witness L and Witness M. Witness L was a member of the Brothers for Life Blacktown and was involved in the original attempted murder of Mohammad Hamzy at Revesby Heights in October 2013. Witness M is a woman who had connections to both sides of what appears to have been an intense, if brief, gangland war. She had connections to the Hamzy family going back many years when she was involved in a relationship with the original founder of the Brothers for Life organisation, a notorious criminal called Bassam Hamzy. Mohammed Hamzy is Bassam Hamzy’s nephew.
	
	
	As at 2013, Witness M remained in contact with the Hamzy family and knew a number of members of the BFL Bankstown. Through those connections she came to know the Qaumi brothers and a number of members of the BFL Blacktown. There is some suggestion, of no present relevance, that she had a romantic involvement with Farhad Qaumi. Witness M knew the residential addresses of many relevant people and was, on both the prosecution and defence cases, instrumental in a number of the shootings that took place between October and late November 2013. She drove the shooters to Revesby Heights on the night of the Hamzy murder. She was involved in a reconnaissance of the Chokolatta Café on the night of that shooting. She also drove Witness L to the townhouse complex on Greenacre Road because she knew where Mohammed Hamzy’s mother lived.
	
	
	There is no dispute that Witness L discharged a firearm several times while in the vicinity of the Unit complex at 142-150 Greenacre Road. Several witnesses gave evidence of this and there was bullet damage to a garage at Unit 28 and to a car outside of Unit 29. Anthony Elkadi was struck by a bullet while standing outside of Unit 29 and blood was located outside Unit 28. Several fired cartridges were found in the area and ballistics examination determined that these were from a .45 calibre weapon that was also used in the Hamzy shooting.
	
	
	Mrs Hamzy lived in Unit 18. There is no evidence that her premises were fired upon or struck by any bullets.
	
	
	To put the current application in its simplest form, the accused submit that the crime or criminal enterprise that the Crown alleges was procured or directed by the two accused charged in count 18 was never completed. Rather, having arrived at the scene, Witness L decided that he would not shoot at Mrs Hamzy’s house as directed by the accused. Then, at Witness M’s instigation and urging he carried out a different shooting, that is, the shooting of Mr Elkadi. Accordingly, it is submitted, that the crime that is charged in count 18 and in relation to which Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi were alleged to be principals in the third degree (or accessories before the fact), was never completed. The crime that was completed was a different crime and not one in relation to which the Qaumi brothers have any criminal liability either as accessories or by application of the principles of common purpose or joint criminal enterprise.
	
	
	To understand those submissions it is necessary to consider in a little more detail the evidence that Witnesses M and L gave in the trial.
	
	
	Witness M gave evidence of a meeting at a park in Villawood with “Mumtaz, Witness L and Farhad” on 29 November 2013:
	


“Farhad was very angry, he was screaming because Sina Mirzaei's house got shot and --

Q. Is this something he's saying?

A. Yes, this is what he's telling me.

Q. Doing your best --

A. Yes.

Q. -- what was said by Farhad?

A. Farhad told me that Sina Mirzaei's house got shot and that he thought it was from - like LC's crew because they - he thought that they, he said that he thought that they would have thought that because Witness I and Witness G, that Sina was also linked to Farhad, so they were retaliating. And that even though he hated Sina, he had to - he's not gonna let anyone laugh at him and he needed to retaliate.

Q. Was anything else said?

A. He said he's gonna shoot at - he wants [Witness L] to shoot at LC's mum's house.

Q. So who said that?

A. Farhad.

Q. Was there further conversation?

A. He said that he only had to shoot at the house, like to send a message, and he asked me where the mum lives.

Q. Who asked you that?

A. Farhad. I can't remember what I said to him but he told me, ‘Don't fucking lie, you've been there heaps of times.’ And he told me that I'm gonna drive [Witness L] to do it.

Q. Did you know at the time? Did you know where Mohammed Hamzy's mother lived?

A. Yes.

Q. And had you been to that location?

A. Yes, plenty of times.

Q. Whereabouts was that?

A. Greenacre.

Q. What happened?

A. He went and got a - Farhad went and got a gun. He came back five minutes later and handed it to [Witness L]. It was wrapped in something. When [Witness L] looked at it, he said that it's the same gun that was used in the murder and that he didn't want to get pulled over with it. Farhad said that he didn't give a fuck and stop making excuses, he has to do it. I can't remember. Then we left I think.” [1] 


	
	Witness L and Witness M then travelled by car to Greenacre. Her evidence continued:
	


“Q. What happened when you got to that area?

A. When we got there we stopped at the - like, the top of the driveway because it was - his mum lives in like a complex so there's all houses going down the driveway.

Q. So you're saying ‘his mum’, whose mum?

A. LC's mum. [Witness L] jumped out of the car and went down and had a look. I could see all lights on. He came back and he said that there's too many people down there so we went and we parked somewhere for like half an hour. Me and [Witness L] discussed not doing it but [Witness L] had told him that Farhad had threatened him and his family and Farhad had also threatened me and my family, so. And then [Witness L] said, ‘Look, we can't wait any longer, we're taking too long, Farhad's gonna get angry’. So we drove back again. I stopped on the main road at the top of the driveway. [Witness L] ran down. And I heard gunshots and then he ran back and jumped in the car and we drove back to Farhad and Mumtaz in Villawood.

Q. When you say to Villawood, was it to the same location --

A. Yes.

Q. -- you came back from? What happened when you got back to Villawood?

A. Farhad took the gun and went somewhere and put it wherever it came from and they said to meet them at Blacktown at this dead end where they always used to meet.” [2] 


	
	Witness L’s evidence was somewhat different. He said that there was a meeting at his house in Penrith with Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi and gave the following version of events:
	


“Q. Just go through that again?

A. He's calling me saying, ‘Hey, how are you?’, stuff like that. Then he goes to me, ‘What's your address? I want to come see you.’ I gave him my address. I don't know whether I text him or verbally told him, I don't know, I got my missus to do it, then they came.

Q. Who came?

A. Mumtaz and Farhad.

Q. When you say they came, is that to the address you gave?

A. Yes, came to the address I gave them.

Q. So they came to your house, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And this is this new address?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened when they arrived at your house?

A. So basically they ask me, ‘Have you watched the news?’. I told them, ‘No, what happened?’ Goes, ‘….got shot last night’. So I goes to him, ‘No, I didn't know’. He goes to me, ‘You have to retaliate about that.’

Q. Is that Witness G?

A. Yeah, Witness G, Witness I's …., Sina Mirzaei got shot.

Q. Did you know about it?

A. I didn't know until they told me.

Q. Who was it that said that to you, ‘Have you watched the news?’

A. Farhad.

Q. Was it him that told you that Witness G's… got shot last night?

A. Yep.

Q. Who was it that said, ‘You've got to retaliate’?

A. Farhad.

Q. Was anything else said?

A. Then after that I told him, ‘What do you care Farhad? Witness G and Witness I's locked up. What do you care?’. He goes, ‘Nah, nah, nah, I want to do it for Witness G’. I go to him, ‘They're locked up, what do you care?’ He goes, ‘You know what, fuck this, the hairy cunt, I was using him anyway’. He goes, ‘…had an argument with LC inside the prison so you have to retaliate because of that’.

Q. When he said, ‘I want to do it for…’‑‑

A. Yes.

Q. ‑‑who did you understand that to be?

A. Witness G.

Q. Witness G?

A. Yes.

Q. At that time you said Farhad is speaking to you, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Where is Mumtaz?

A. Next to him.

Q. What happened after Farhad said those things to you?

A. He goes, ‘We have to retaliate’, this, that. ‘I was using him. You have to do it for…now’. He goes, ‘You have to do it’. So I went inside and got changed. I came out, so after that I was wearing dark clothing. So I came outside, I jumped in their car, then we went next to my house. Like not racing but about 10 minutes’ drive from my view, a little spot that they took us there. He took us there. Then he called Witness M to get there.

Q. Who called Witness M?

A. I don't know, Farhad or Mumtaz, one of them, they called Witness M to come there.

Q. You said he said that ‘you have to do it’ ‑‑

A. Yep.

Q. – ‘for… now’. Was anything said about what he wanted you to do?

A. Basically want me to go shoot someone.

Q. Did you know who at that stage?

A. At that stage, no.

Q. You said there was a call to [Witness M], is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. This is where you're in a spot about 10 minutes' drive from your house?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you speak further with either Farhad or Mumtaz whilst at that location?

A. So as we waiting there, he goes to me ‑ as we're waiting for [Witness M] to get there, he goes, ‘Go shoot LC's mum's house’.

Q. Who said that to you?

A. Farhad's telling me that. I go to him, ‘But I don't want to shoot a girl, you know’. He goes, ‘No, no, you have to do it’. I said, ‘But I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna shoot the woman’. He goes, ‘Okay then, do a drive‑by.’

Q. Who is telling you that?

A. Farhad.

Q. Anything else said?

A. By then [Witness M] came, so they ask her, ‘Do you know where she lives and everything?’. She goes, ‘Yes’.

Q. There is a conversation when [Witness M] arrived, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Who spoke to [Witness M]?

A. Farhad.

Q. What did Farhad say to [Witness M]?

A. ‘Do you know where LC's mum lives?’. [Witness M] said, ‘Yes’. He goes, ‘We're gonna shoot LC's mum's house’. That's when we jumped in the car, we went to near Granville area, we were waiting in the park. So he's telling me what to do. Farhad's telling me now what to do.” [3] 


	
	Witness L said that there was a further discussion at a park in Granville:
	


“Q. At that location, so what happened there?

A. Basically Farhad's telling me what to do now.

Q. What did he tell you?

A. He's telling me, as I said before, he goes, ‘Go get his mum’ again. I said, ‘I don't want do the woman, I don't want to shoot the woman,’ you know. Then [Witness M] said, ‘LC's mum and sister, they live next to each other,’ you know what I mean. Farhad goes to me, ‘Okay, do the drive‑by on both their house then.’ Then [Witness M] described the house, how's the house gonna go and everything. Goes, ‘It's down the hill, all the way at the end, that's where they live.’ Then that's when I went jumped in [Witness M]’s car.” [4] 


	
	Witness L said that Farhad Qaumi gave him a gun that was wrapped in a tea towel [5]  and gave the following evidence of what occurred when they arrived at Greenacre:
	


“Q. What happened?

A. So basically [Witness M] goes to me the last ‑ like, from the shoot, she goes, ‘Last house on the right, second last is his sister, the last one is his mother.’

So I jumped out of the car, I started walking towards ‑ like there was a downhill sort of thing. I started walking towards there, I seen one of the neighbour's door open, they were eating dinner. So I turned around, I went back in the car. I told [Witness M], ‘The door is open, there is people there. When I shot it, they can hear it. So let’s go around come back.’ So we went jumped in the car, she drove around.

I don't know how long after, we came back again. Then I seen about four boys standing at the front of, like on top of the houses, you know, they were standing at the front of the street.

Q. Standing at the front of the street?

A. Yes.

Q. Where were they in relation to the house?

A. They were at the top of the street. LC's mum’s house is all the way down. So they were just standing out the front, there was about five of them standing out the front.

Q. Okay. What happened?

A. Then I told [Witness M], ‘There's people there.’ So we just waited around a bit more. Then [Witness M] goes to me, ‘Why don't you get these people.’ I go, ‘Who's these people?’ She goes, ‘Some of them are from Bankstown and they are his cousins,’ talking about LC. So that's when I jumped out of the car, I went towards them. I started shooting at them.

Q. What did those persons do?

A. Just obviously they start running.

Q. How many shots did you fire?

A. I emptied the gun.

Q. Sorry, you emptied the gun?

A. Yes.

Q. How many shots was that?

A. I wouldn't have a clue.

Q. How did you know the gun was emptied?

A. I think it might have been a 45. I'm not sure exactly what, 38 or 45. Cause if it was a 45, because the barrel sticks out. And‑‑

Q. When it's empty?

A. Yes. And when it's 38, when you click is nothing else will come out, you know. That's why I knew it was empty but I'm not sure which gun was it.

Q. But whatever gun it was, you‑‑

A. Emptied the clip.

Q. ‑‑knew the gun was empty?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you do then?

A. I ran back to Witness M's car, we drove off.

Q. Did you know if you hit any person?

A. At that time, no.” [6] 


	
	Witness L was cross-examined by Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi as follows:
	


“Q. Did you and [Witness M] go together by car to Greenacre?

A. Yes.

Q. You looked into what you understood was a house occupied by relatives of LC, is that right, at Greenacre?

A. Yes.

Q. Did [Witness M] say to you, ‘Why don't you get these guys, that's LC's cousin and his mates’?

A. Yes.

Q. Did [Witness M] say, ‘Get them, just get them’?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you then start firing your gun at the house?

A. Not at the house.

Q. What did you fire your gun at?

A. People.” [7] 


	
	He was also cross-examined by Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi:
	


“Q. And there was mention of there being a drive‑by then on both their places, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. So is it the case that when you left that meeting where Farhad and Mumtaz had been, that the only arrangement that was in place at that stage was that the houses of both Little Crazy's mother and sister were going to be the potential targets, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. When you got there in the car, you say that you got out of the car and walked down the driveway some distance where you saw an open door and you saw people eating, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. You decided you weren't prepared to do any shooting in the circumstances and went back to the car, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Whilst you're waiting you saw some people, I think you describe them about four or five boys standing out the front?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is up closer to the roadway from where you understood Little Crazy's mother to be, which was right down the back, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. So at that stage you were simply planning on sitting in the car, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it [Witness M] that said to you at that stage, ‘Why don't you get these people?’

A. That's correct.

Q. And you said, ‘Who are these people’ and [Witness M] said, ‘Some are from Bankstown and they are his cousins.’ They're [Witness M]’s words, is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. At that stage it was your intention to simply shoot at a house, is that right? Hold on. Up until she said that‑‑

A. Yes.

Q. ‑‑it had been your intention to simply shoot at a house?

A. Yes.

Q. And after she said those words, that's when you got out of the car‑‑

A. Yep.

Q. ‑‑and decided to take some shots at the group?

A. Yes.”


	
	Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi submitted that this evidence demonstrates the following:
	



	
	The agreed criminal venture settled upon by Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Witnesses L and M was to shoot at a particular house, that is, Mrs Hamzy’s house. By the time that Witnesses L and M left for Greenacre, there was no understanding, agreement or joint venture that involved shooting at people.
	
	
	That criminal venture was not completed. Witness L decided at the scene that he would not commit that crime.
	
	
	At the scene, Witnesses L and M decided to commit a different crime, namely shooting at people identified by Witness L as being associated with Mohammed Hamzy.
	



	
	Accordingly, it is submitted that there is no evidence capable of establishing the crime charged in count 18. Reliance was placed on the length of time (estimated by the witness to be around half an hour) between the decision not to complete the “drive by” shooting of Mrs Hamzy’s townhouse and the distance between, or different location of, the townhouse that was actually struck (No 28) and the townhouse that was supposed to be the target of the shooting (No 18). There is no clear evidence of the distance between the two townhouses, but the evidence of police officers who attended the scene was that units 18-25 were on the eastern side of the driveway while units 26 to 30 were on the western side. [8]  The evidence of Witness L was that unit 18 was the last townhouse from the end (that is, looking at a number of photographs tendered in evidence, furthest from Greenacre Road at the top of the “inverted U” that is the driveway to all of the townhouses). The same photographs suggest that unit 28 and 29 were much closer to Greenacre Road. [9] 
	
	
	Against those submissions are a number of factors:
	



	
	The shooting took place in the same townhouse complex as that which was subject to the agreed criminal venture.
	
	
	A dwelling house was in fact struck, albeit that Witness L said he was firing at people, rather than “at a dwelling house or other building”.
	
	
	Witness L would not have been in the vicinity with a gun had it not been for the directions he received from Farhad Qaumi. According to Witness M’s account, his last words before committing the shooting were “we can’t wait any longer, we’re taking too long. Farhad’s gonna get angry.”
	
	
	In three of the four earlier shootings, people other than the true targets were shot and received injuries. This was true of the Hamzy shooting, the Zakaria shooting and the Chokolatta Café shooting.
	
	
	The particular townhouse is not nominated in count 18. At best, it is a particular of the charge.
	



	
	In other judgments published today, I have referred to the fact that there are currently challenges before the High Court to the accepted Australian doctrine usually referred to as “extended joint criminal enterprise”: see R v Qaumi &Ors (No 57) [2016] NSWSC 1157 at [28]. On the present application, as on the other no case submissions determined on this day, counsel has preserved their clients’ position by challenging the correctness of the authorities currently binding upon me. However, it is agreed that I must apply the law as it stands. The doctrine is set out in other judgments but it is worth setting out again the following passages from McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; 183 CLR 108 at 113-114:
	


“The doctrine of common purpose applies where a venture is undertaken by more than one person acting in concert in pursuit of a common criminal design. Such a venture may be described as a joint criminal enterprise. Those terms - common purpose, common design, concert, joint criminal enterprise - are used more or less interchangeably to invoke the doctrine which provides a means, often an additional means, of establishing the complicity of a secondary party in the commission of a crime. The liability which attaches to the traditional classifications of accessory before the fact and principal in the second degree may be enough to establish the guilt of a secondary party: in the case of an accessory before the fact where that party counsels or procures the commission of the crime and in the case of a principal in the second degree where that party, being present at the scene, aids or abets its commission. But the complicity of a secondary party may also be established by reason of a common purpose shared with the principal offender or with that offender and others. Such a common purpose arises where a person reaches an understanding or arrangement amounting to an agreement between that person and another or others that they will commit a crime. The understanding or arrangement need not be express and may be inferred from all the circumstances. If one or other of the parties to the understanding or arrangement does, or they do between them, in accordance with the continuing understanding or arrangement, all those things which are necessary to constitute the crime, they are all equally guilty of the crime regardless of the part played by each in its commission.

Not only that, but each of the parties to the arrangement or understanding is guilty of any other crime falling within the scope of the common purpose which is committed in carrying out that purpose. Initially the test of what fell within the scope of the common purpose was determined objectively so that liability was imposed for other crimes committed as a consequence of the commission of the crime which was the primary object of the criminal venture, whether or not those other crimes were contemplated by the parties to that venture. However, in accordance with the emphasis which the law now places upon the actual state of mind of an accused person, the test has become a subjective one and the scope of the common purpose is to be determined by what was contemplated by the parties sharing that purpose.”


	
	Later at 117, the Court said:
	


“In Johns this Court was concerned with the common purpose of a joint criminal enterprise. In particular, it was concerned with whether the scope of the common purpose extended to possible as well as probable incidents of the venture. The scope of the common purpose is no different from the scope of the understanding or arrangement which constitutes the joint enterprise; they are merely different ways of referring to the same thing. Whatever is comprehended by the understanding or arrangement, expressly or tacitly, is necessarily within the contemplation of the parties to the understanding or arrangement. That is why the majority in Johns in the passage which we have cited above spoke in terms of an act which was in the contemplation of both the secondary offender and the principal offender. There was no occasion for the Court to turn its attention to the situation where one party foresees, but does not agree to, a crime other than that which is planned, and continues to participate in the venture. However, the secondary offender in that situation is as much a party to the crime which is an incident of the agreed venture as he is when the incidental crime falls within the common purpose. Of course, in that situation the prosecution must prove that the individual concerned foresaw that the incidental crime might be committed and cannot rely upon the existence of the common purpose as establishing that state of mind. But there is no other relevant distinction. As Sir Robin Cooke observed, the criminal culpability lies in the participation in the joint criminal enterprise with the necessary foresight and that is so whether the foresight is that of an individual party or is shared by all parties. That is in accordance with the general principle of the criminal law that a person who intentionally assists in the commission of a crime or encourages its commission may be convicted as a party to it.”


	
	The issue of whether there is a case to answer on count 18 is not an easy one to resolve. However, the question of whether the criminal venture agreed upon, or instigated by, Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi had come to an end by the time the shooting actually took place is a question of fact. Likewise, it is a question of fact whether the shooting that Witness L actually carried out fell within the scope of the original enterprise, or was incidental to it, and whether the Qaumi brothers contemplated the possibility that Witness L might shoot at another townhouse within the same complex while targeting people in the vicinity Mrs Hamzy’s home.
	
	
	I have concluded that there is evidence capable of establishing those matters although I consider the case on this charge to be relatively unconvincing. However, I must take the Crown case at its highest and it has been held by the High Court in Doney v The Queen [1990] HCA 51; 171 CLR 207 at 214:
	


“ … if there is evidence (even if tenuous or inherently weak or vague) which can be taken into account by the jury in its deliberations and that evidence is capable of supporting a verdict of guilty, the matter must be left to the jury for its decision. Or, to put the matter in more usual terms, a verdict of not guilty may be directed only if there is a defect in the evidence such that, taken at its highest, it will not sustain a verdict of guilty.”


	
	Further, the Court of Criminal Appeal long ago rejected the proposition that a trial Judge could take a case away from a jury on the ground that a view was formed that a conviction based on the evidence would be unsafe or unsatisfactory – that is a question for a Court of Criminal Appeal if the jury convicts: R v R (1989) 18 NSWLR 74. Where a case is based on circumstantial evidence, it is for the jury (not the trial judge) to determine whether there is an inference inconsistent with the guilt of the accused: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39.
	
	
	On one view, the criminal enterprise in relation to Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi came to an end outside the premises at Greenacre when Witness L decided that he would not carry out a particular shooting. However, on another view, the shooting that was in fact carried out was carried out as a result of the directions given by Farhad Qaumi. In my view, it is for the jury to determine whether the criminal enterprise came to an end and whether a new enterprise undertaken by Witnesses L and M commenced. It would be open to the jury to be satisfied that the shooting carried out was within the scope of the joint criminal enterprise or at least an undertaking that was incidental to the original scope of the enterprise. As the Crown put it, in view of the history of innocent bystanders being shot in the course of the shootings that had preceded the Elkadi shooting, it is open to the jury to find that it was within the contemplation of Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi that somebody or some house other than the agreed upon target would be shot at by Witness L once he got to the scene.
	
	
	For those reasons, the applications by Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi for a directed verdict of not guilty on count 18 are refused.

		23 November 2016",2016-08-21 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986646,R v Ian Macgillivary [2016] NSWDC 312,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: The offender is before the Court for sentence following his plea of guilty to an offence of intentionally importing child exploitation material into Australia. This is an offence contrary to s 233BAB(5) of the Criminal Code and as such carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.
	
	
	The relevant facts are that on 13 February 2016 the offender came into Sydney International Airport on a flight from Manila in the Philippines. He is an Australian citizen but had been living in the UK for 20 years. He had arrived in Melbourne from the UK on 4 February 2016 for a short stay in Australia with the intention of taking a two week visit to the Philippines from 12 February. He had return tickets to the Philippines, which he had bought on 15 December 2015. On his incoming passenger card for the visit on 4 February 2016 he indicated that he was intending to visit friends in Australia and then go for a trip to the Philippines.
	
	
	He left Melbourne on 12 February for Manila but was refused entry into the Philippines, no doubt because of his criminal record for offences of indecent assault and the possession of child pornography from the United Kingdom. After spending five hours apparently at the airport in Manila he was returned to Australia by the authorities there because he was an Australian citizen. He had in fact left Melbourne the previous day for the Philippines but was denied access and returned immediately on the flight which arrived which arrived on 13 February.
	
	
	He presented an incoming passenger card which inter alia denied that he was bringing in any prohibited items, and specifically denied that he was importing any illegal pornography. He was selected for a search and in his luggage there was located a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 tablet which was sent for examination. The offender, as I have said, had a conviction in the United Kingdom from 2012 for indecent assault and numerous charges of possessing child pornography and other pornography, which was no doubt what alerted him to the authorities and gave rise to the search. It would appear to be the reason that he was refused entry to the Philippines.
	
	
	When questioned he told police that in fact he had been refused entry to the Philippines but that absent that, he had intended to stay there for about two weeks and then come to Australia for about five days to meet up with family and friends, to look around, and then return to the United Kingdom.
	
	
	Australian Border Force officers located an item on his tablet. He was cautioned. He told officers that he was the only person who used that tablet. It would appear that from the outset he was cooperative with the authorities. On the tablet officers found two files of the same video entitled “USA 2015” which was a video date stamped 3 January 2016 lasting for 10 minutes 21 seconds. It was a recording of an interaction between the offender and others on an online web chat room called Omegle. This operated by allowing a person like this offender, who is known as an operator, to enter that chat room and various people then became available for a chat, presumably from anywhere throughout the world and also apparently willingly participating because they are transmitting vision of themselves via a webcam. The system allows the operator, in this case the offender, to also have his image and voice transmitted to the person at the other end, but also allows him to turn off the camera and microphone so that his picture and voice are not broadcast to the person at the other end. This is what this offender did. In those circumstances, communication with the other person occurs by text.
	
	
	The video showed the offender accessing the web chat room. The system works by allowing the operator to move quickly from one person to another if he does not wish to have contact with that person. It appears that this offender did that for up to seven minutes and 17 seconds into that interaction, moving through a number of people, both male and female, and not having any interaction with them until at seven minutes and 17 seconds a girl appeared on the screen via her web cam. I accept from the facts that she appears to be between about ten and 12. This analysis of her age is something, I accept, that has been done on closer examination of the video by Commonwealth officers after the offender was charged. Initially the arresting officer who conducted the interview at the airport assessed her age as seen on the video as between 11 and 15.
	
	
	During the record of interview the offender initially denied that the person depicted was a child, but apparently when the interviewing officer suggested that the girl looked to be between about 11 and 15, he agreed and thereby acknowledged that she was a child. The age has been assessed down to between ten and 12 on the facts presented to court on a closer inspection by the officers and, in particular, by an estimate made of her age on the basis of her apparent sexual development and facial appearance. She was however, I accept, whether she be ten or 15 nonetheless obviously a child and that must have been obvious to the offender. He would appear to have acknowledged as such by agreeing that to him she appeared between 11 and 15. The fact that he has from time to time denied that she was a child does not change the fact that when interviewed at the airport he acknowledged that she appeared to be between 11 and 15.
	
	
	She was sitting on a bed in a pink room with cartoon characters appearing on the wall in the background. She is wearing a pink T-shirt with pictures of the cartoon character Bambi on it. She could not see the offender because his camera and microphone were turned off. He engaged in a chat conversation with her by text. After stopping at her image he complemented her and encouraged her to engage in sexual activity. This occurred in these circumstances at about eight minutes and 36 seconds into the video. She revealed her stomach by lifting up her top and then appears to have, by using her thumbs pointing up or down, asked for his view. The offender encourages her by typing “Yes please”. She then revealed her breasts and rubbed and fondled them. The offender then sent a text, “Can I see your pants?” She pulled down her trousers to reveal her underwear and placed her left thumb inside her underwear and pulled them away from her body. She put her right hand into her underwear and appeared to rub her genitals. She imitated that she was moaning whilst doing this. She then placed her middle finger up and ended the transmission. Her involvement with the offender lasted for just a little more than three minutes.
	
	
	The offender recorded the whole of his interaction on this chat room of over ten minutes, including the specific portion involving the girl. He used a program called Game Capture to do that. He informed the police that he had used this program to record it. It is the image of this girl for just over three minutes that is the subject matter of this charge of intentionally importing child exploitation material.
	
	
	I accept that this sexual activity involving the child is capable of being classified on the Oliver Scale. I accept that it is appropriate to classify this as level 2. The agreed facts assert that it is level 3. That on my finding is an error made by both of the parties in this sentence. This child exploitation material does not display sexual activity of any type between an adult and child. The child is displayed alone engaging in solo masturbation which is level 2 on the Oliver Scale as set out in the facts.
	
	
	The offender was arrested when this material was discovered at the airport and engaged in an interview with the officer as I have said. As I have said also, right from his initial stopping, he admitted that the tablet was his and that no one else used it. He admitted that he regularly used this particular chat room.
	
	
	This is a Commonwealth offence and as such I must sentence in accordance with pt 1B of the Crimes Act and in particular s 16A of that Act. The nature and circumstances of this offence are to be determined by the recitation of facts just undertaken. It is an importation offence, not a charge of possessing child pornography. The objective seriousness of this offending must be assessed on that basis.
	
	
	On my finding, this is an offence at the bottom of the range of offences capable of being charged as an offence of importing child exploitation material. The reasons for that are many. The first is that the gravamen of this offence is that this offender intentionally imported the tablet and as such imported the contents of the tablet. There is no evidence that there was any other pornography, legal or otherwise, on that tablet apart from this video. The second file was just a copy of the first. There was one video and one item of just over three minutes involving a child as a part of that video. The fact that the file was there after having been recorded in January 2016 was more probably than not reckless. In his interview with the ABF he admitted that he had recorded it, but I accept that he did not remember doing so in detail. He gave the impression, from the portion of the interview provided to me in the agreed facts, that he had not in fact remembered that the file was still there on his tablet when he intentionally imported the tablet into Australia. His importation of the tablet was clearly intentional, but the fact that the video was on it, it seems to me, was reckless.
	
	
	There is only one piece of child exploitation material, the subject matter of this charge. The Court is regrettably all too familiar with the fact that charges brought under this section involving the importation of child exploitation material generally and more often involve the importation of hundreds, if not thousands, of such images. It is, on my finding, at Oliver Scale level 2. That is not of course to indicate that this is anything other than serious. All child pornography charges, whether it be for importation, possession, creation or the like, are extremely serious offences.
	
	
	General deterrence is an important aspect of sentencing for these offences. The ability to apprehend those involved in child pornography offences, whether in the nature of importing, using, creating or possessing, has become more and more complicated as electronic access to such material has increased. Children who are victims of these offences are frequently from underprivileged backgrounds and third world countries, and are exploited generally as well as being the subject of sexual exploitation. Those who would access, import or use this sort of material add to this exploitation.
	
	
	For those reasons, even though this is an incident of child pornography towards the bottom of the Oliver Scale and overall is an offence of importing child exploitation material towards the bottom of the scale in terms of the seriousness, it is nonetheless an offence sufficiently serious in its own right that only full time custody would suffice to deal with the objective seriousness. As I have said, general deterrence is a matter that must play an important role in sentences for offences like this so that it is obvious that even for relatively minor versions of such offending, those who would use child pornography can expect to be sent to gaol in Australia.
	
	
	Further, the importation in my view is of the most technical type. The offender was not intending to stay in Sydney. He was only back in Sydney on 13 February because he had been sent back from the Philippines. Even his original intention was only to stay in Australia for a very short period of time and then return to live in the United Kingdom. His importation of it was at the most for his own use only. There is no indication or evidence that he intended to disseminate it to others, to obtain any benefit financially from it, or to use it for any other purpose than at most to access it himself. The fact that he recorded it in my view leads inevitably to an assumption that it was likely he would access it at some stage in the future. But that finding is limited to an extent by a matter to which I have already referred, namely that he would appear to have probably forgotten that it was there during the course of his interview with the police.
	
	
	The offender comes to court as a person with a prior criminal history for offences of almost identical type committed in the United Kingdom. He was sentenced in 2012 to a series of sentences for what would appear to be two charges of indecently assaulting a female under 14. That would appear to have been sentenced in 2012, but relating to what in New South Wales would be referred to as an historical offence in a sense, apparently occurring between 1992 and 1994. He was also at the same time sentenced in relation to a number of child pornography offences including creating child pornography and possessing child pornography. Those would appear to be - some of them at least - relatively serious examples of those sorts of offences. He received a term of imprisonment of four years with what would be referred to in New South Wales as a non-parole period and he was released after serving two years and three months in custody.
	
	
	He has been subject to a sexual offences prevention order, the details of which are before the Court. Amongst the conditions involved in that order was one that required him to make available to the authorities in the UK any new electronic equipment that he possesses, and as I understand it, he did in fact advise the authorities in the UK about his purchase of this new tablet which he brought to Australia in February 2016. Whether or not they inspected it is not before the Court. If they had done so I accept that they would have discovered this file, it having been created in January 2016.
	
	
	It has been submitted on behalf of the Commonwealth that I would accept that he was to an extent attempting to avoid detection when interacting with this young girl, because he turned off the video and microphone. At first blush that may well be an available inference but it seems to me that it is not an appropriate inference to draw in this case, in circumstances where there would appear to have been no attempt to hide the fact that this whole interaction was recorded on his tablet, which he admitted to the authorities immediately on his apprehension. He admitted it was his, was used only by him and appeared regularly under a file entitled “USA 2015”, not apparently hidden in any way on the computer, or encrypted, or in any way attempted to be hidden from anyone who might wish to look at it.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty to these offences in the Local Court. It seems to me that that indicates a willingness to assist in the facilitation of justice to an extent. It is true that he is pleading to what is otherwise a relatively strong case against him, namely his admitted possession and ownership of the tablet and all that was on it, however, as I have said, he did appear to cooperate with the authorities very early on at the time of his apprehension and they are matters which I am entitled to take into account in determining the appropriate penalty, and I do.
	
	
	His commission of the offence is aggravated by the fact that he was on this form of conditional release, namely serving the balance of his sentence in the UK and the sexual offences prevention order. However, I do also take the point raised on his behalf that whilst it operates to aggravate the objective seriousness of the offending, that aggravation should not be elevated to an extent that it is likely to give rise to double punishment. It is not clear what, if any, action might be taken on his eventual return to the United Kingdom because of his commission of this offence. Whatever it might be however it does not appear that it is likely to lead to any form of re-incarceration given that his term of imprisonment has now ended.
	
	
	Specific deterrence is important in cases such as this where this offender has committed similar offences in the past. However, it seems to me that this offending is both at the bottom of the range in terms of objective seriousness for an offence capable of being charged under this section, and also significantly apart in date from the offences that gave rise to the four years term of imprisonment in the United Kingdom, in fact some 30 years apart.
	
	
	His prospects of rehabilitation would seem to be fair in the circumstances. I make that guarded comment simply because on the material that is before me he would seem to be a fairly isolated person and something of a loner. The Court is only too aware that they are exactly the sort of people who are likely engage in this sort of behaviour, so that raises some concern on his eventual release from custody. However, he comes to court as a person who, albeit a loner, has engaged in appropriate employment in the past. Apart from the offending that occurred in 1992 or thereabouts, he otherwise was a member of the community in which he lived in the United Kingdom. He has no mental health or substance abuse issues that would be likely to increase the prospect of his reoffending. There is an opinion offered in the psychologist’s report that his prospects of reoffending are low and I accept that opinion in the circumstances that are known to me.
	
	
	It would appear that he has a house to go back to in the United Kingdom when he is able to do so. He is now 67, probably the chances of him engaging in paid employment again are relatively slim, but he does have access to United Kingdom social security benefits.
	
	
	I have been provided with copies of decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal and decisions of a similar court in Western Australia in relation to similar matters. Comparative sentences of course are not determinative necessarily of an appropriate penalty, but it is clear that there is something of a range of sentences for offences of this type. One of the many factors to take into account is the number of images. This is an unusual case in that there is one image only that has been imported.
	
	
	Bearing all of that material in mind I have concluded that the appropriate penalty should be one of 14 months imprisonment . I will be setting a recognisance release order after seven months, so therefore a recognisance release order of seven months. It seems to me, given the circumstances of this offending and the earlier offending, that it is appropriate that there be some conditions attached to that recognisance release. Presumably, as soon as he can, the offender will return to the United Kingdom, but whilst ever he remains living in Australia there should be some conditions placed on him so that the risk of his having access to any child pornography or any reoffending of this type is reduced as close as possible to zero.
	
	
	I have invited the Commonwealth to suggest some conditions.
	
	
	For those reasons I make the following formal orders. The offender is convicted. He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 months commencing 13 February 2016 and expiring 12 April 2017, with a recognisance release order of seven months commencing 12 September 2016. The recognisance will be formally in the sum of $500 subject to the following conditions:
	


1. Accept supervision of the New South Wales Community Corrections and obey all reasonable directions of that organisation.

2. Not access the website Omegle.

3. Not access any other websites for the purpose of communication with persons who appear to be under the age of 18 or for the purpose of accessing child pornography material.


	
	I make the forfeiture order in terms of the short minutes provided to the Court.

		23 November 2016",2016-08-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2986663,R v Wardhaugh [2016] NSWDC 314,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: One only has to visit any Local Court in this State to understand that there are many people like the offender, people who drink alcohol and then knowing that it is not safe to do so, decide to get behind the wheel of a car. They are gambling, gambling with the lives and welfare of other road users. They understand that their decision to drive represents a risk, a risk that they will injure or even kill other innocent users of the road. They hope that these consequences will not come about but they do take the risk that they will. It is therefore appropriate that when drink drivers do kill and injure others significant and even harsh sentences should be imposed. Those who are tempted to drink and drive must have it made to them in very concrete terms that if they lose the gamble their driving represents, their punishment will reflect the awful harm that they have caused.
	
	
	On 7 June 2015 the offender, Brook Wardhaugh went out to a pub for a work function. She says she drank five alcoholic drinks but it could have been less and it could have been more. When the time came for her to go home she knew she had had too much to drive. She had never planned to do so, so she got a taxi home. When she got home she felt alone, she wanted to speak to someone but she could not contact anyone by phone. She therefore made the criminal decision to drive to her parent’s home, more than an hour’s drive away.
	
	
	That same night Mr John Bussing and his wife, Marisa Cochran had also been out. They had been to dinner with friends and were driving home. It came about that the car driven by the offender and that driven by Mr Bussing were on the same stretch of road, the Princes Highway at Waterfall. The road was straight and dry. Sober drivers would have had no trouble negotiating it safely. The offender was not a sober driver. She had a blood alcohol content of at least 0.110 and most likely 0.124. For reasons no one can identify, but by her plea the offender admits that it was due to her dangerous driving, the offender drove her vehicle into the rear right‑hand corner of the car in which Mr Bussing and Ms Cochrane were travelling. The impact, which must have been a forceful one, caused Mr Bussing to lose control of his car, so that it ran off the road and hit a tree. The offender’s car also ran off the road but she was uninjured.
	
	
	The collision caused the death of Ms Cochrane who was on a life support system for some time before her family made the heartbreaking decision to switch it off. She died on 28 August last year without having ever regained consciousness. The collision also caused a great level of injury to Mr Bussing and led to a cascading series of medical procedures and interventions. He is physically and mentally a very changed man from the man he was before this tragic event, a tragic event which could have been so easily avoided.
	
	
	The injuries Mr Bussing sustained were numerous, they appear in the agreed statement of facts as follows. Mr Bussing was placed in an induced coma. He needed a transfusion of three and a half litres of blood. Surgeons were successful in establishing a blood supply to his right foot to avoid amputation. He had multiple muscle, tissue and skin grafts performed on his lower right leg to replace extensive tissue loss from the knee to the ankle torn away in the collision. A large section of muscle tissue was harvested from the right half of his stomach area with a 25 centimetre incision which required support mesh to be inserted to maintain the abdominal wall. Skin grafts were harvested from Mr Bussing’s upper left thigh to cover the multiple tissue transplants of his lower right leg.
	
	
	He also sustained the following injuries: Multiple fractures to all the bones in his right leg; his right ankle and many bones in his right foot which have required multiple rods, nails, plates and screws to be inserted throughout; nerve damage causing an almost complete lack of sensation from the knee down to the toes of his right lower leg; a broken fibula of his left leg at the ankle; a broken left heel which had screws and plates inserted; deep gashes to his left ankle, severing nerves, causing complete paralysis of the heel, making it very debilitating for walking; shattered left humerus, elbow and ulna that were successfully repaired with extensive surgery, involving plates and screws being inserted; four broken ribs; crushing to the bridge of his nose and a fractured nasal septum that required reattaching a large section of the end of the nose and requires ongoing surgery; blockage in the left eye tear duct which requires ongoing surgery; laceration under his left eye that cut through facial nerves and required plastic surgery; limited feeling in the left side of his face, from the lower left eyelid down to and including his upper left lid; a deep laceration to his mid-forehead causing touch sensitive nerve spasms in the left facial area; and two crushed vertebrae, L3 and L4 where, if there is no improvement with pain and mobility, spinal fusion may be performed.
	
	
	I described a cascading series of interventions and procedures. During his extended treatment and his forced inability lying prone in the hospital bed he suffered a pulmonary embolism caused by deep vein thrombosis in his left leg. He was therefore administered blood thinning medication. After a period of weeks on that medication a large pool of blood formed in his skull. He was rushed into surgery and underwent a craniotomy where the blood was drained. A section of his skull was replaced which resulted in a large scar and a significant indentation at the top of his head.
	
	
	He has had further surgery to insert a vascular filter in the main blood vessel below his heart, to prevent any further clotting from his legs and future surgery. That filter will need to be removed and further surgery is required.
	
	
	He spent about four months in hospital after the collision. His recovery is going to take an extended period of time with further surgeries required in the months and possibly years hence.
	
	
	Mr Bussing made an eloquent victim impact statement which he read to the Court. He required crutches and had difficulty getting up the steps to the witness box. He spoke of the numerous effects upon him of the offender’s wrongdoing. The Crown suggested that the harm he suffered was just short of the most serious category of harm covered by the offence of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm. Mr Macedone did not challenge that assessment, I agree with it.
	
	
	Ms Cochrane’s twin brother also made a victim impact statement which was read on his behalf. It is appropriate that I acknowledge the enormous loss felt by Ms Cochrane’s family, friends, students and others. She will be greatly missed.
	
	
	The offender is now 23 and was 22 at the time of the collision. She grew up in a close and loving family in Wollongong. She completed her HSC and then a nursing degree and was at the time of the offence working for Justice Health at Long Bay gaol. She has struggled with anxiety for many years, indeed as long as she can remember. She first attended a psychologist at seven years of age, she developed bulimia at 15. She has been medicated for anxiety and depression for a long time. She has attempted suicide twice. She has a lengthy history of psychological treatment.
	
	
	Her decision to drive that night has to be looked at in the context of her psychological state at the time. She had only recently moved out of home and found herself unexpectedly alone, late at night after having been drinking at a work function and consuming cannabis at an indeterminate time before that. This was not a decision to drive made by a person who just, for example, decided to go and get more take away food. Her decision to drive was affected by her mental state which was consistent with her longstanding psychological issues. The offender’s moral culpability has to be assessed accordingly. Also, as conceded by the Crown, this is a case where the offender will do her time in custody harder than would otherwise have been the case.
	
	
	She has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and so the sentence I impose upon her will be 25% less than it would otherwise have been. She has expressed her deep remorse for her criminal behaviour because of the awful consequences it has had. She was of prior good character too and I am satisfied she has good prospects of rehabilitation. On the other hand almost all cases of this type involve a remorseful offender of good character who is unlikely to offend again. So in deciding the appropriate sentence to impose it must be remembered that almost all sentences for crimes of this type involve offenders of this nature.
	
	
	The Court of Criminal Appeal has handed down two guideline judgments. Indeed the very first guideline judgment handed down by the Court of Criminal Appeal, R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, concerned these offences. That guideline judgment was a response to a perceived leniency whereby sentencing judges would impose sentences which failed to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. This case has much in common with the frequently recurring case postulated in Jurisic and R v Whyte[2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 but there are some differences. In the offender’s favour her pleas came early but on the other hand there are a number of factors which work the other way. The length of her intended journey, over an hour. Associated with this is the large number of people put at risk. The offender had smoked cannabis on top of her intoxication by alcohol. The harm suffered by Mr Bussing was just short of the highest level. Perhaps most importantly the offender knew it was not safe for her to drive when she did so. That factor alone would be enough for me to find that she has effectively abandoned her responsibility by her knowing decision to drive when that driving represented a risk to others as a result of her intoxication.
	
	
	Mr Macedone quite properly conceded that a custodial sentence was required, the only question was how long that sentence should be. He also fairly faintly, I must say, argued that two wholly concurrent sentences would be imposed. To do so would be quite contrary to principles and authority. By her criminal act the offender has caused enormous harm to Mr Bussing and the death of Ms Cochrane. Such harm should be reflected in sentences which are not wholly concurrent.
	
	
	The Crown concedes that there are special circumstances, primarily arising from the offender’s age and psychological history.
	
	
	It is necessary that I, as well as sentencing the offender to custody, disqualify her from driving, I will do that. I disqualify her from driving for five years from 7 June 2015.
	
	
	I will impose an aggregate sentence of imprisonment. Were it not for that circumstance I would have imposed the following sentences. For the offence involving the death of Ms Cochrane four years in gaol. For the offence involving grievous bodily harm to Mr Bussing, two and a half years in gaol.
	
	
	Instead I impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of two and a half years and a head sentence of 5 years, to commence today 21 July 2016. The non-parole period will expire on 20 January 2019, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		24 November 2016",2016-07-20 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2986676,R v CF [2016] NSWDC 315,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: At the offender’s trial on four charges alleging the sexual assault of his wife’s niece’s daughter, a great deal of character evidence was called on his behalf. Those who knew him spoke highly of his kindness, his honesty and his integrity, but this is yet another example of a situation where a person who is thought by those who know him to be the type of person who would not commit such criminal offences is, in truth, not only capable of doing so but has actually done so.
	
	
	The offender appears to have taken a particular sexual interest in a particular member of his extended family. At the trial, the offender was described as her grand uncle. She was 12 years of age at the offences, I will shortly describe. The families were very close. The offender and his wife lived north of Newcastle but would regularly visit the complainant’s family and stay overnight. One of the consequences of this closeness was that the offender clearly knew just how young the complainant was.
	
	
	The first of the offences for which the offender must be sentenced, occurred in 2011. The evidence would suggest that it was probably on 23 December 2011 when the offender and his wife came down to Newcastle for a pre‑Christmas get together. That evening, it came about that the offender and the complainant were alone together in the back room of the complainant’s family’s house. That room was adjacent to the kitchen. It was possible to see from the kitchen into the backroom where the offender and the complainant were seated although there was some furniture in the way. The offender was showing the complainant something on his mobile phone when, without any warning or any other form of preliminary activity, he put his hand into her pants and penetrated her genitals with his finger, wriggling it around for some three or four minutes. The complainant did not call out but instead she froze. One can well understand that reaction. Although her mother and offender’s wife were nearby, the offender was a well‑respected and much loved family member and the complainant, although at times appearing to be older, was in reality quite a young girl.
	
	
	At trial, the offender denied doing what he was alleged to have done, but by their verdict the jury were clearly satisfied that he did exactly what the complainant alleged. At the time, she was between the ages of ten and 14, and so I am to sentence the offender for an offence against s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is 16 years’ imprisonment. At the time the offence was committed, there was no standard non‑parole period and so I ignore the current sentencing regime which does have a standard non‑parole period.
	
	
	Shortly after this offence was committed, the complainant’s family moved next door while their house was being renovated. There continued to be social interaction between the complainant’s family, the offender and his wife, with regular visits still taking place. One particular visit in August 2012 was memorable because on that night, a glass of red wine was spilt on light‑coloured carpet. Everyone could remember that occurring. Later that night, the offender, the complainant and the offender’s wife were seated on an L‑shaped lounge while the television was on. The complainant was in between the offender and his wife. What occurred can be discerned by the evidence given by the complainant and also from something the offender said to the complainant’s father in a conversation that was secretly recorded by the police. The offender told the complainant’s father that he was massaging the complainant’s leg when his hand touched her private parts. At first he told the complainant’s father that the touching was accidental but as the conversation continued, it became clear that what the offender was admitting to, was deliberately rubbing the complainant’s genitals with his hand outside her underpants. On the basis of that evidence, the jury found the offender guilty on an offence of indecently assaulting a child under the age of 16. The maximum penalty for this offence is ten years’ imprisonment with a standard non‑parole period of eight years.
	
	
	After that, and while the offender’s wife was distracted by the Google Earth application on her new mobile phone, the offender put his hand up the complainant’s jumper and touched her breasts. This is another offence of indecently assaulting a child under the age of 16.
	
	
	He then put his hand inside the complainant’s pants and touched her external genitals. Perhaps conscious of what had occurred around Christmas the year before, the complainant then got up and went to bed.
	
	
	She said nothing about what the offender had done to her for some time. It was noted that on one occasion, she was particularly rude to the offender but she did not say why. Matters came to light when the complainant was chatting to her cousin, a young girl of about the same age, over a chat program called, “KIK”. In that conversation, she told her cousin what the offender had done to her. Recognising the seriousness of what she had been told by her cousin and despite promising not to, the cousin told her parents who then told the complainant’s parents. The complainant’s cousin is to be commended for taking a very mature decision in revealing what she had been told by the complainant. Police were contacted and as part of the investigation, a listening device was used to record the conversation between the offender and the complainant’s father to which I earlier referred.
	
	
	The offender is now 63 years of age and he has no criminal convictions at all. Quite noticeably, none of the character witnesses called at trial suggested that the offender massaged the legs, let alone the thighs of any other young girl and yet it was part of both the accused’s and the Crown’s case that he had massaged the complainant in that way on a number of occasions. It does appear as I said earlier, that the offender has singled out the complainant because he had a sexual interest towards her, a sexual interest that he clearly acted upon, on these four occasions. These offences may have been opportunistic but I would describe the offender’s actions, in massaging the legs and thighs of the complainant, as actions consistent with him grooming the complainant, or at least acting on a sexual desire.
	
	
	It goes without saying that these offences represent a significant breach of trust. The offender was a family member invited into the complainant’s home after he had married the complainant’s aunt. He came to be treated as a trusted family member who, it was falsely believed as it turned out, could be relied on to protect the complainant, and not abuse her for his own sexual gratification.
	
	
	The offender was born in Egypt in 1953. He has one sister. He had a brother who passed away in 1964 at the age of 16. He is estranged from his sister because of a family dispute involving an inheritance after their father’s death. His parents have passed away. The offender’s father was a pharmacist. He came to Australia and requalified as a pharmacist, working in Newtown.
	
	
	The offender has had two long term relationships. He married his first wife at the age of 20. They were married for 19 years until around 1992. They separated, with the offender then bringing up his two children. He met his second wife, the complainant’s mother’s aunt, in 1994. They have had a close relationship which has been of benefit to both of them. The offender is still in contact with his children. They have visited him in custody.
	
	
	One thing which is undeniable is that the offender has been a hard‑working and industrious person. He was employed for a while and then started his own business in 1996, importing and installing security gates and other security products. He appears to have been, in all respects but the one which has led to his offending, an outstanding member of the community. He was as I have said, hard‑working, and many of the character witnesses spoke of his willingness to go out of his way to assist others. A great deal of evidence of his good character was given in his trial which was not really challenged by the Crown.
	
	
	It is important to bear in mind however, that his good character allowed him to commit these offences. It was the fact that he was trusted by the complainant’s family that had led to him being invited into their home. He would not have been in a position to commit these offences were he not of the good character which he was believed to have been. In particular, he would not have been able to commit these offences were the truth known, namely that he had sexual interest in the complainant and was prepared to act on it.
	
	
	He pleaded not guilty at trial and of course he is not to be punished for that, but there can be no suggestion that he is remorseful for what he has done.
	
	
	It is ordinarily difficult to make a finding that a person has good prospects of rehabilitation when they do not admit their wrong doing. Ordinarily, there is nothing to suggest in the absence of an admission of guilt, and an expression of remorse, that given the same circumstances an offender will not act in exactly the same way in the future. However, I am prepared to make a finding that there are good prospects of rehabilitation, but only because he has shown no sexual interest in any other child apart from the complainant, and he will certainly have no opportunity to further sexually assault her upon his release from custody.
	
	
	It remains the case that he has not accepted responsibility for his actions despite what was, to my mind, an overwhelming Crown case, particularly when one listens to the recorded conversation between the offender and the complainant’s father, in which, as I said earlier, the offender is quite clearly admitting to deliberately rubbing the external genitals of the complainant.
	
	
	These offences have had an impact on the complainant. She expresses the consequences for her of the offender’s crimes in an eloquent victim impact statement. The consequences for her are entirely foreseeable and regrettably common place. Once again the facts of this case demonstrate the harm that offences of this type cause.
	
	
	There was an unusual aspect of this case and that is that count 2 was based on something the offender said to the complainant’s father; it was not based on any allegation made by the complainant. In one sense I suppose I have to recognise that it was a voluntarily disclosure of the offender’s misconduct which led to count 2 being laid against him, but the effect of that is minimal given the offender’s attempts, clearly rejected by the jury, to explain his obvious admissions when giving evidence at his trial.
	
	
	Counts 2, 3, and 4 all occurred at the same time and clearly count 2 was a precursor to the commission of count 4. Although I will be imposing an aggregate sentence I will take into account that there should be little accumulation as far as counts 2, 3, and 4 are concerned. The same cannot be said in relation to count 1 which involved a completely separate sexual assault upon the complainant.
	
	
	I have mentioned already that there are standard non-parole periods for three of the counts for which the offender must be sentenced. I have taken those standard non-parole periods into account as well as the maximum penalties for all four offences in determining the appropriate sentences. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole periods appear in these remarks on sentence.
	
	
	When I spoke about the offender’s subjective features before, I did not mention his medical conditions. He has physical and psychological symptoms, most importantly as far as his physical matters are concerned, he has a cardiac problem. His time in custody will be harder than it would otherwise have been due to this circumstance. The psychological report also speaks about his anxiety and depression, these are of course not uncommon when people are facing a lengthy sentence of imprisonment for the first time.
	
	
	It has to be said that like many who go to gaol for the first time in their 60s, gaol will be particularly difficult for him. Gaols are terrible places, particularly so when a person has not grown up in the criminal milieu. It is an experience for which life has completely unprepared them, to be mixing with criminals - often violent criminals - in a place of confinement. As well, the offender’s wife has benefited from his assistance over the years. She too suffers from both physical and psychological problems and the offender will know that he, through his crimes, has denied her the assistance which he has previously provided.
	
	
	I receive helped from submissions both from the Crown and Mr Wasilenia who continues to appear for the accused. Both of them referred me to comparative cases. Of course no two cases are the same but I did find some assistance in those cases. I noted the differences between the cases relied on and the present case; some of those differences are significant, but all of the cases have been of assistance to me in determining the appropriate sentences to impose. I take into account obviously the differences and similarities between the cases that the parties relied on and the present one before me.
	
	
	Mr Wasilenia also provided me with some statistics from the Judicial Commission. They are statistics revealing sentences imposed for an offence of sexual intercourse with a child between ten and 14. That is the offence to be found on count 1 on the indictment. Mr Wasilenia points out that a third of such sentences do not involve full time custody but as Mr Wasilenia properly acknowledged, we know nothing of the circumstances behind those cases. In my view the statistics are thus of very limited application. Quite clearly this is a case where nothing other than a full time custodial sentence should be imposed for each of the counts on the indictment. That is particularly the case because of the need to reflect general deterrence in the sentence I will impose.
	
	
	Time without number the Courts have spoken about the need to impose sentences to protect the vulnerable members of our community from sexual exploitation by people like the offender who simply wish to obtain sexual gratification from abusing children, in this case a child who is entitled to expect protection from him, not abuse. The Courts must do what they can to deter others who may be tempted to give in, as the offender has clearly given in, to unlawful and clearly inappropriate desire. General deterrence is of prime importance in the present case.
	
	
	I will make a finding of special circumstances. They relate to the offender’s age, his health, and this being his first time in custody, but the non-parole period I will shortly announce is the least which properly reflects the object gravity of his criminal conduct.
	
	
	As I have said, I will impose an aggregate sentence. Were it not to be an aggregate sentence I would have imposed the following sentences.
	
	
	Count 1: Imprisonment for five and a half years.
	
	
	Count 2: A non-parole period of 18 months with a head sentence of three years.
	
	
	Count 3: A non-parole period of 12 months with a head sentence of two years.
	
	
	Count 4: A non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of four years.
	
	
	The aggregate sentence is to date from 6 May 2016, I set a non-parole period of five years with a head sentence of eight years. The non-parole period will expire on 5 May 2021, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		24 November 2016",2016-06-30 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2986688,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 37) [2016] NSWSC 740,"Judgment


	
	At the conclusion of the cross-examination by Mr Driels (counsel for Mr Zarshoy), the Crown Prosecutor sought leave to cross-examine Witness M pursuant to s 38(1)(a) of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It was submitted that part of her evidence was unfavourable to the Crown. Mohammad Zarshoy opposed the granting of leave. I refused the Crown’s application, while leaving it open to the Crown to make a further application depending on the evidence given in re-examination. These are my reasons for refusing leave to cross-examine and also for refusing to make a direction under s 38(4) of the Evidence Act that such cross-examination take place after the cross-examination of the accused.
	
	
	Witness M [1]  was the driver of the vehicle that drove the shooters to Revesby Heights on the night of 28 October 2013. It is the Crown case that there were four people in the car and that three of them were armed. When the car arrived outside the Hamzy residence, the three armed men entered the premises and discharged their weapons with murderous intent. As a result, Mahmoud Hamzy was killed and Omar Ajaj was wounded. The three men were driven away from the scene by Witness M. It is the Crown case that the three armed men were Witness L, Jamil Qaumi and Mr Zarshoy. Witness M nominated Witness L and Jamil Qaumi but did not identify or nominate Mr Zarshoy.
	
	
	The Crown sought leave to cross-examine Witness M to put to the witness that the third man in the car was Mr Zarshoy. In making the application the Crown made the following submissions:
	


“CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY: In relation to cross examination by Mr Driels of Witness M, I have just spoken to my friend and clear understanding of the Crown case will be that on other evidence the jury can be satisfied that Mr Zarshoy is present and we have put there will be some reasons why Witness M only saw him on the one occasion and some time after that Witness M saw another person. I have just spoken to my friend about that because if there is no issue that the Crown can go to the jury on that basis, then I wouldn't make an application under 38 on this part of the evidence.

HIS HONOUR: Is somebody going to say that Mr Zarshoy was there?

CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY: Two witnesses will be saying that.

HIS HONOUR: Okay. Then it will be up to the jury, won't it, to assess the conflict.

CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY: Exactly. I wanted to make sure that it wouldn't be raised at a later point that the Crown should have made an application under 38 and put to the witness that what you said about that is not correct, mistaken. If there is no problem, my friend doesn't have a problem that the Crown can still go to the jury based on other evidence, then I don't need to make that application.” [2] 


	
	When asked whether Mr Driels took the view that the Crown was required to put to Witness M that Mr Zarshoy was the third man in the car, Mr Driels responded:
	


“How the Crown runs its case is a matter for the Crown. How I go to the jury and how the Crown goes to the jury are matters for each of us.”


	
	Based on that absence of concession, the Crown made the application under s 38 of the Evidence Act. Section 38 provides:
	


“(1) A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question the witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about:

(a) Evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party, or

(b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably be supposed to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence, or

(c) Whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.

(2) Questioning a witness under this section is taken to be cross-examination for the purposes of this Act (other than section 39).

(3) The party questioning the witness under this section may, with the leave of the court, question the witness about matters relevant only to the witness’s credibility.

(4) Questioning under this section is to take place before the other parties cross-examine the witness, unless the court otherwise directs.

(5) If the court so directs, the order in which the parties question the witness is to be as the court directs.

(6) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in determining whether to give leave or a direction under this section, it is to take into account:

(a) Whether the party gave notice at the earliest opportunity of his or her intention to seek leave, and

(b) The matters on which, and the extent to which, the witness has been, or is likely to be, questioned by another party.

(7) A party is subject to the same liability to be cross-examined under this section as any other witness if:

(a) A proceeding is being conducted in the name of the party by or on behalf of an insurer or other person, and

(b) The party is a witness in the proceeding.”


	
	Because of the provision in subsection (4), the Crown also (implicitly at least) sought a direction that the cross-examination take place after the cross-examination by Mr Driels.
	
	
	In the course of Witness M’s evidence in chief, Witness M described the fourth person in the car that went to Revesby to commit the Hamzy killing:
	


“Q. When you say ""planning it"" ‑ just before that, did anyone else arrive at the park?

A. Someone else arrived but I don't know when.

Q. Can you describe that person?

A. Fat with a beard, dark eyes and a hood.

Q. Do you know the name of that person? 

A. They're saying it's Mohammad Zarshoy but from what I know, like, when I got arrested and met him for the first time in the witness box, to me that's not the guy from that night. 

Q. All right. But you‑‑

A. They didn't introduce me to him. They didn't say his name.

Q. Did you see that person again after that night?

A. Not after that night. I saw him again that night but I didn't see him after that night.

Q. So this person you referred to as fat with a beard, dark eyes and a hood, by a hood, is that some top he was wearing?

A. A hooded jumper.

Q. Was the hood up on the head?

A. Yes.

Q. The colour of the beard that you could see, what colour was it?

A. Dark.

Q. Was it dark in the park?

A. Yep. Yeah, but I could see. Like, there's light in the park but it's dark at night.” [3] 

(My emphasis)


	
	Witness M’s subsequent evidence in chief was that the fat man with dark eyes was the third armed man.
	
	
	In cross-examination, Witness M agreed that Mr Zarshoy was not present on 28 October 2013 at the incident that occurred at the Hamzy shooting.
	


“Q. You have told this Court that Mohammad Eimal Zarshoy was not present on the night of 28 October 2013 at the incident that occurred at the Hamzy's.

A. Yes

Q. You've been accused of telling lies here in Court?

A. Previously, not in this court case.

Q. People have said you've told lies here?

A. Yeah, they're calling me a liar.

Q. Is that the truth that you said about Mr Zarshoy when you gave that evidence?

A. I don't know him. I met him here in the dock when I was at Court.” [4] 


	
	The portion of the evidence in chief that I have italicised and emboldened in [7] should have put the Crown Prosecutor on notice, if he was not already on notice, that Witness M’s evidence was unfavourable to that part of the Crown case that asserts that Mr Zarshoy was the third man who entered the Hamzy premises on the night of the murder. I was not provided with the statements of the witness on this application (although I have seen them in other contexts). There is nothing to suggest that Witness M had said anything relevant to this issue that was inconsistent. In any event, because Witness M’s italicised answer is directly contrary to the proposition that Mr Zarshoy was the third armed man, it may have been appropriate to grant leave to cross-examine on that issue if an application was made before the witness was cross-examined.
	
	
	However, the application came after Mr Driels had engaged in a very brief and targeted interrogation. Mr Driels told the Court (and I accept) that he deliberately did not go into evidence (consistent with Witness M’s current account) that the Witness M gave at the NSW Crime Commission on the same subject. No doubt, the refreshing sparseness of the cross-examination (which came after the witness had been cross-examined over several days by three other counsel) was tailored to the circumstances and guided by the manner in which the evidence in chief was elicited.
	
	
	Section 38(4) of the Evidence Act makes it clear that, ordinarily, a party that seeks to cross-examine its own witness ought to do so prior to the other party’s cross-examination. I could see no basis in the circumstances to make a direction that this order of examination not be followed. Neither the matters referred to in s 38(6) nor the catalogue of matters to be taken into account under s 192 of the Evidence Act dissuades me from that conclusion. Some of the matters in s 192 support the conclusion. For example:
	


(a) Granting leave would have unduly lengthened the proceedings.

(b) Making the direction for the cross-examination to occur after the cross-examination by the accused would have been unfair to the accused. The extent to which to do so would be likely to add unduly to, or to shorten, the length of the hearing.

(c) The cross-examination was not important in the sense that the Crown sought to attack the truthfulness of the witness.

(d) The nature of the proceedings could not be more serious. That consideration cuts both ways. While it is important to give the Crown every opportunity, within the rules of evidence and procedure, to establish its case, it is equally important that the citizen receives a fair trial.


	
	As to the importance of the evidence, it seemed that the Crown’s application was really an attempt to avoid criticism for failing to comply with its obligation of fairness; that is, to put to the Witness M that the evidence was not correct in order to be able to make submissions to the jury in that regard: see, for example, R v Kennedy [2000] NSWCCA 487; 118 A Crim R 34 at 41 and Livermore v R [2006] NSWCCA 334; 67 NSWLR 659.
	
	
	In view of the fact that the application has now been made and refused, it seems unlikely that such criticism (either from the bench or counsel) could be justified. While the Crown has not suggested (and, as I understand it, did not intend to suggest) that Witness M was deliberately writing Mr Zarshoy out of the script, it has led as calculated to undermine the reliability of Witness M’s evidence. This included the fact that Witness M had only met the third armed man once, had not met Mr Zarshoy before and did not see him in the dock for 2 years after the Hamzy shooting. It will be no breach of the rules of fairness discussed in Livermore and Kennedy for the Crown to go to the jury on the basis that the evidence of other witnesses should be preferred of that of Witness M on this issue.
	
	
	In re-examination, the Crown elicited to the following evidence:
	


“Q. Just in relation to evidence you gave before lunch where you referred to Mr Zarshoy and said, ""I met him here in the dock when I was at court.""

A. Yes.

Q. It was October 2014 that you were arrested by police, is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. How long after that did you see Mr Zarshoy in court?

A. I don't know. Only met him in court.

Q. I understand that, what you are saying. But how long after you were arrested did you see him, Mr Zarshoy?

A. Maybe a year. I can't tell you exactly. I don't know.

Q. A year after being arrested?

A. Yeah. I can't say a hundred per cent but roughly a year.

Q. Would that make it almost two years after the Hamzy shooting?

A. Yes.

Q. You said in evidence that one of the persons in the car, you weren't introduced so, is that right?

A. Yeah.

OBJECTION (DRIELS)

HIS HONOUR: It is an introductory question reminding Witness M of the evidence the Witness gave in chief.

DRIELS: Yes, which car when?

CROWN PROSECUTOR MCKAY

Q. The night of the Hamzy shooting, there was one person in the car you said you weren't introduced to?

A. Yes.

Q. Other than that night, did you have any other involvement with that person?

A. I wasn't introduced to Witness L either but I had met him afterwards so I came to know that was Witness L.

Q. But this other person?

A. No, never met him again after that. Never met him.

Q. You gave a description of that person?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that your best recollection of the person?

A. Yes.

Q. Apart from saying never met him again, had you met that person before that night?

A. Never.

Q. Or even seen that person before that night?

A. Never.”


	
	No further application was made for leave to cross-examine Witness M or for a direction that such cross-examination take place after counsel for Mr Zarshoy had completed his cross-examination.

		24 November 2016",2016-06-05 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2986708,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 27) [2016] NSWSC 551,"Judgment


	
	Counsel for Jamil Qaumi raises objection to evidence expected to be elicited in the course of the testimony of the Crown’s next witness who is expected to give expert evidence in relation to parts of the ballistics material seized in the course of the police investigations into a number of shootings, five of which are subject to the current 24 count indictment. The objections fall into two categories. The first is an objection to the tendering of four firearms that were seized in the course of the police investigation. The second is a series of specific objections relating to two charts that are proposed to be tendered by the Crown in the course of the officer’s evidence.
	


tender of the firearms


	
	Two firearms were seized in the search of a Mazda motor car shortly after the shooting that has been referred to throughout as the “Chokolatta Café shooting”. The Crown case is that a shotgun was located by police when they examined a Mazda motor vehicle at the scene and that the revolver was located after the car was taken back to a police garage. Two other firearms were located along with some drugs in a “duffle” bag. This bag was effectively surrendered to police by one of the informant witnesses. There are various ballistics links between some of the weapons and some of the shootings and it is anticipated that a number of the informant witnesses will give evidence as to which guns were used, where they were stored and by whom they were possessed and used. Some of the witnesses have given evidence describing the guns.
	
	
	As I understand it, the submission is that the evidence is not relevant or that the probative value in the case is very limited and outweighed by its capacity to distract the jury from its task. It was put by counsel for Jamil Qaumi:
	


“My objection is on the basis first and foremost that the Crown has a significant amount of evidence already tendered in relation to each of the guns, sufficient that there is no value or no probative value to be gained from the tender of the actual physical guns themselves.”


	
	Counsel went on to detail the evidence that the jury already has in relation to these weapons. This consisted of detailed photographs taken by the police either in the course of seizing the guns or in the course of examining them. Senior Counsel for Mumtaz Qaumi supported the objection, noting the “plentiful array of photographs” and the fact that a number of witnesses will (or have already) described the weapons. He submitted:
	


“Your Honour, unless the Crown can point to some forensic point that the actual handling of the weapon can establish, in my submission the use of photographs, as they have been up to date, is a sufficient way of dealing with the problem.”


	
	It was suggested that “the safer course is to delay the tender at this stage and see whether some forensic issue arises.” Senior Counsel for Farahd Qaumi supported the objection, particularly the suggestion of delaying the tender, but made no further submissions. Counsel for Mr Kalal supported the objection and adopted the submissions of his colleagues. Counsel for Mr Zarshoy did not seek to be heard.
	
	
	Counsel for Jamil Qaumi submitted that “if the jury are given these items then a number of things adverse can occur”. The first concerned the “safety of the jurors”. No cogent submission was made in support of that submission that the guns posed any danger to the jury. They have been, to adopt the phrase employed by the police, “rendered safe” (which I take to mean not armed or loaded with ammunition). The fact that they remained unloaded would be confirmed before the items went into evidence, let alone into the jury room. The Court would also ensure that no ammunition was available in the jury room.
	
	
	The second “adverse thing” that was identified was that the jury might be “distracted” by the exhibit. They would be “stand out exhibits”, in a very different category to the other exhibits such as photographs, documents and plastic coated maps. It was submitted:
	


“I think they can be cocked and the trigger can be fired, creating a noise, even though they're empty and have no bullets. Effectively they can turn into, one might think, a toy. A toy that can be played with or messed about with.”


	
	I am unable to accept these submissions. There is no basis upon which one could properly or sensibly conclude that the jury would treat the items as toys. Assuming the weapons are admissible, the jury is entitled to inspect them, consider their size and colour and gain some understanding as to how they work.
	
	
	Another problem identified by counsel is that the weapons have been subject to forensic testing, including finger print examination. This means that there may be chemicals on the weapons. While this is probably so, it is a matter that commonly arises in criminal trials and the jury can be provided with gloves.
	
	
	Another argument was to the effect that the integrity of the exhibits should be maintained in case further forensic testing needs to be undertaken. Counsel conceded that the accused do not seek to undertake such testing but that the investigators or Crown may, at some future time, need to examine the weapons and to undertake DNA or other forensic testing. This is a matter of speculation and a matter for the Crown to consider. It is not a matter that gives rise to some unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	There is no real substance to the objection to the tender of the weapons. They are obviously relevant – it is the Crown case that they were used in the shootings or form the basis of the possession charges. The photographic evidence is no substitute for the items themselves. There has already been evidence that demonstrates that the photography itself and the method of printing means that the colours depicted in the photographs can be misleading.
	
	
	While counsel eschews any dispute relating to the nature, appearance and function of the weapons, the Crown is entitled to prove its case. As the Crown Prosecutor put it, rather bluntly:
	


“For a start, the relevance is that they are said to be the weapons used in offences. When Mr Young says if the Crown be on stronger ground, if some forensic purpose, what more do you need than it is the actual firearm said to be used in offences?”


	
	Given the questions that have been asked of the eyewitnesses and crimes scene police to this point and the attack that is anticipated to be made on the informant witnesses, the evidence has real and significant probative value.
	
	
	I am unable to identify any danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	The Crown pointed out that the items are currently in sealed plastic bags and the jury would not actually have access to the weapons. This was in answer to the submission that the jury might use the weapons as “toys”, or be exposed to chemicals or interfere with the integrity of the exhibits if future testing is required. These points are all validly made. However, if the jury requested that the sealed bags be opened, as presently advised and subject to further submissions, I would be inclined to allow the jurors to access the actual exhibits. However, it is unnecessary to decide that point at this stage.
	
	
	For those reasons, I am unable to uphold the objection to the tender of the weapons. The items themselves are admissible.
	


the charts


	
	The Crown seeks to place before the jury a number of charts in order to make the ballistics evidence more readily understandable. I understand that there is a ballistic chart in relation to each of the four weapons. In the course of the lengthy pre-trial hearing I was provided with copies of drafts of these charts. However, there have been substantial changes made to the charts since that time. When the argument commenced there was a little controversy over the precise form of the charts because changes had already been made following correspondence between the parties. Once this controversy was resolved, it emerged that objection is taken to a single part of the chart relating to the “Bentley Sawnoff Shotgun – serial number A548924” and to a number of parts of the chart relating to the “0.38 Revolver Serial Number J 117163”.
	
	
	The two relevant charts were tendered on the voir dire by counsel for Jamil Qaumi and became exhibit VD 31(1) (the .38 revolver) and VD 31(2) (the shotgun). The parts to which objection was taken were highlighted in orange. The Crown tendered the current version of the charge relating to the 0.38 revolver. It became exhibit VD QQ. It demonstrated that a number of the complaints were acknowledged and amendments had been made.
	


The Bentley Sawnoff shot gun


	
	There was only one objection to the chart relating to this firearm. In a box at the bottom of the chart it refers to a “Blue Mazda 3 used in the Chokolatta Café shooting and recovered in Railway Street, Parramatta”. The objection is to the italicised words and the basis of that objection is that the ballistic evidence does not establish that the car was used in the Chokolatta Café shooting.
	
	
	This basis of the objection is correct. There is a circumstantial case that the car was used in the shooting and there will be (as I understand it) direct evidence that the car was used in the shooting. However, the ballistics evidence does not establish that fact.
	
	
	Accordingly, the words “used in the Chokolatta Café shooting” in the bottom box of exhibit VD 31(2) is not admissible.
	


The 0.38 revolver J 117163


	
	Most of the objections taken and identified by orange highlighting in exhibit VD 31(1) have been catered for in the amended document, exhibit VD QQ. However, the most significant objection remains in issue. This concerns the link between this 0.38 revolver and the shooting at the Chokolatta Café.
	
	
	The chart in question has a photograph of the weapon in the bottom right hand corner. That has a series of lines leading to (i) a photograph of the Mazda (in which gun was located), (ii) three fired cartridge cases located in a drain 79 metres away that have been ballistically linked to the weapon and (iii) a series of boxes and a photograph concerning the Hamzy shooting and a number of bullets that have been ballistically linked to that shooting. There is no objection to those parts of the chart.
	
	
	The objection concerns what is depicted in the top left of the chart. Here there is a photograph of damage to the BMW car that was targeted in the shooting outside the Chokolatta Café and a dialogue box noting two bullets recovered from the inside door of that vehicle. There is then a line that leads to a dialogue box that states:
	


“Alan Dusting concludes that the bullets [with reference to two exhibit numbers] have insufficient detail to eliminate or identify that they were fired from the revolver …”


	
	The complaint is that there is no ballistic link between the bullets recovered in the BMW and the weapons that is the subject of the chart. In the original version of the chart, there was a line between the photographs of the gun, the dialogue box as just described and the photographs of the damage to the BMW and the dialogue box describing recovery of the bullets. The Crown has removed the line. This highlights the point that is made by counsel for Jamil Qaumi. Any link between the particular weapon and this shooting is not based on the ballistics evidence.
	
	
	There is a circumstantial case that links the 0.38 revolver to the Chokolatta Café shooting. In summary that circumstantial case includes:
	



	
	The revolver was found in the same car as the shotgun.
	
	
	The shotgun is linked (ballistically) to the shooting.
	
	
	Fired cartridge cases found 79 metres from the car are linked ballistically to the gun.
	
	
	A fingerprint said to match Mr Kalal was located on the weapon.
	
	
	One of the two bullets located in the BMW was identified as 0.38 calibre ammunition (a fact that is not mentioned in the chart but which emerged in the course of argument).
	



	
	The Crown also points out that it can reasonably be expected, given the opening statements, things said in argument and the approach to cross-examination, that Mr Kalal’s case is that he was present and fired the weapon.
	
	
	It is also expected, as I understand it, that informant witnesses will give direct evidence relevant to the issue.
	
	
	I accept that there is likely to be a strong case that the 0.38 calibre revolver was used in the Chokolatta Café shooting. However, that case is not dependent on the ballistics evidence, and only receives faint support in that evidence. The faint support is the calibre of one of the two damaged bullets recovered from the BMW.
	
	
	I accept Jamil Qaumi’s submission that the reference to the “EVENT: Shooting of blue BMW (registration plate CD 858B) outside of the Chokolatta Café in Bankstown on 7 November 2013” should not appear on the ballistics chart relating to 0.38 Revolver J117163. While the removal of the line linking the gun to the event reduces the potential for the chart to mislead the jury, it does not eliminate it. The potential for the chart to be misleading arises from the very fact that the “EVENT” is on the chart that relates specifically to a particular weapon when there is no direct ballistics evidence linking the gun to the event.
	
	
	The Crown did not refute the suggestion that it attempts to elicit the evidence in this form pursuant to s 50 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). That section provides:
	


“50 Proof of voluminous or complex documents

(1) The court may, on the application of a party, direct that the party may adduce evidence of the contents of 2 or more documents in question in the form of a summary if the court is satisfied that it would not otherwise be possible conveniently to examine the evidence because of the volume or complexity of the documents in question.

(2) The court may only make such a direction if the party seeking to adduce the evidence in the form of a summary has:

(a) served on each other party a copy of the summary that discloses the name and address of the person who prepared the summary, and

(b) given each other party a reasonable opportunity to examine or copy the documents in question.

(3) The opinion rule does not apply to evidence adduced in accordance with a direction under this section.”


	
	It is clear that the purpose of this provision is to facilitate the understanding by the tribunal of fact of evidence considered to be complex or voluminous. None of the accused seek to argue that the use of the charts does not otherwise comply with the purpose of s 50 or that the pre-requisites of that section are not met. However, the possibility that a summary (or, in this case, a chart) might mislead the tribunal of fact is directly contrary to the purpose of the section. That is the situation here.
	
	
	In its current form, the chart is not admissible. However, if the EVENT, photograph and dialogue boxes relating to the bullets recovered from the BMW were removed and made as part of a separate chart, both charts would be admissible. I understand that there is no objection to the evidence if it is adduced in that way.
	
	
	For those reasons, my ruling is that the chart (Exhibit VD QQ) in its present form is inadmissible. However, as part of that ruling I note that a separate chart relating to the bullets would be admissible. That separate chart could also refer to the evidence relating to the calibre of one of the bullets.
	


orders


	
	In summary, my rulings on these objections are as follows:
	



	
	Allow the tender of the four firearms.
	
	
	The words “used in the Chokolatta Café shooting” in the bottom dialogue box in exhibit VD 31(2) is not admissible.
	
	
	The chart (Exhibit VD QQ) is inadmissible in its present form. Note that two separate charts in conformity with this judgment would be admissible.

2986735,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 20) [2016] NSWSC 391,"EX tempore Judgment


	
	Objection is taken to part of paragraph 10 of a statement of a police officer called Jacob Cavallaro which involves an interaction between the accused Farhad Qaumi and that police officer. The statement sets out a conversation in part of which Farhad Qaumi is attributed to have said:
	


“You will need more police to control my boys. All I need to do is make a phone call and get the whole country here.”


	
	The evidence, it is submitted on behalf of Farhad Qaumi, is not relevant or if it is relevant its probative value is very slight in the context of the issues in the trial. It also has a capacity to cause prejudice.
	
	
	The issue to which the Crown says the statement is relevant is the issue of whether Farhad Qaumi is in a leadership role in the criminal group as Crown will allege it is called the Brothers for Life at Blacktown.
	
	
	I asked Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi whether or not there was any other evidence of his client’s leadership role and whether there was any dispute about the issue. He said there is not to be any dispute in relation to the issue that Farhad Qaumi was both a member of the group and also in a leadership role. However, he also told me that the only evidence on the issue is to come from ten “rollover” witnesses, as described.
	
	
	In the course of the morning, I have heard the opening addresses of four of the five accused and what is plain and not at all surprising is that there will be a substantial attack on those rollover witnesses and even though it may not be specifically put to them that Farhad Qaumi was not in a leadership role, it is obvious that the accused, at least those who have to this point opened the case, will be making a significant and sustained attack on the credibility of those witnesses. So even though the matter may not be specifically in dispute, the Crown is entitled to establish by evidence the leadership role of Farhad Qaumi.
	
	
	I do not perceive the prejudicial impact of that evidence to be particularly great. It certainly has the hallmarks of grandiosity and exaggeration but the words ""my boys"" does give rise to a possible inference of leadership. I think it has that relevance that the Crown contends for and that the probative value it has to that issue clearly outweighs any prejudicial effect that it may have.
	
	
	I propose to allow that part of the evidence.

2986771,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 6) [2016] NSWSC 113,"Judgment


	
	Objection is taken by the accused Farhad Qaumi (and in so far as it touches upon him, Mumtaz Qaumi) to evidence which the prosecution intends to adduce from eight of the informant witnesses. I will refer to those witnesses by the letters that were allocated to them earlier in the voir dire. [1]  The particular witnesses are those known as A, B, C, D, G, I, K and L. It is anticipated that each of those witnesses will give evidence concerning their fear of Farhad Qaumi and his use of intimidation and threats to exercise control over the other members of the Brothers for Life at Blacktown (Blacktown BFL). The accused does not object to such evidence per se but does raise objection in relation to specific items of evidence that suggest that he (Farhad Qaumi) was involved in three previous killings.
	
	
	To understand the context in which this objection is taken, the summary of facts, charges and evidence undertaken in earlier judgments should be incorporated into these reasons. [2] 
	
	
	The evidence as it is presented in the statements and interviews of the witnesses [3]  take various forms. In some instances the evidence is to the effect that Farhad Qaumi was in fact involved in, or responsible for, three previous murders. For example, witness A states (as a fact) (at Q1188) that “he’s got away with murder”. Similarly, witness D said (at Q254) “he or his brother already killed three people.” There are other examples of statements by witnesses which assert as a fact that the accused Farhad Qaumi was involved in three previous homicides and had successfully avoided conviction in relation to those earlier killings. In other cases the witnesses assert a belief that Farhad Qaumi was responsible for three earlier killings. For example witness C said (at Q1073) “cause I believe he’s killed three people before and I think he wouldn’t hesitate to do it again.”
	
	
	The learned Crown prosecutor indicated in the course of argument that he does not propose to lead evidence in that form and does not seek, by this evidence, to establish that Farhad Qaumi had in fact previously killed three people.
	
	
	Rather, it is proposed to lead evidence of things that Farhad Qaumi said to the other members of the Brothers for Life at Blacktown about the earlier killings in order to instil fear and intimidation. For example, when asked if they had seen Farhad Qaumi use violence against any other person, witness A said (at Q332):
	


“Yeah, and I know because of, in the media and his reputation and he’d told us himself, at meetings he’d show us, on the Internet, on Google like that he’d beaten three murder charges and show us pictures of dead people that he’d killed.”


	
	Witness B said (at paragraph 9 of a statement of 30 September 2015) that
	


“Farhad Qaumi used to boast about all the knee cappings he had done and the three murders that he had gotten off. Two of the murders he told us he had gotten off on self-defence and the other one he told us he had chopped some Turkish guy up and buried him under the house.”


	
	The Crown submits that the evidence is relevant in that it provides the context in which a number of the informant witnesses simply obeyed orders and directions given to them by Farhad Qaumi and by his brothers. Without evidence of the intimidation and fear instilled by Farhad Qaumi, a jury would find it difficult to accept the evidence of the witnesses and to understand the willingness of the other members to follow orders to shoot and kill people. I accept that the evidence is relevant to the proceedings in this way. I do not understand the accused to contend that the evidence is not relevant. Rather, the accused argues that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	It appears to be common ground between the parties (although there is no specific evidence of this) that Farhad Qaumi was previously been tried for and acquitted in relation to two counts of murder. From what I have been told, he was acquitted in a jury trial having raised a defence of self-defence. The details of the other alleged killing are sketchier but it appears that he was at some stage charged with a third murder offence in relation to which the prosecution ultimately did not proceed.
	
	
	Other material received in the course of the pre-trial hearings (on different issues) shows that there have been a number of media reports concerning the earlier allegations of murder against Farhad Qaumi. [4] 
	
	
	As I said, the Crown does not intend that such evidence be admitted to establish that Farhad Qaumi was involved in earlier killings. Nor is it said that any previous killings are admissible to establish a tendency to be violent, to use weapons or to commit murder. Rather, the prosecution seeks to rely on the evidence to establish that by boasting about his previous violent conduct and establishing a fearsome reputation, Farhad Qaumi was able to intimidate and instil fear in the other members of the BFL Blacktown. In this way, he was able to have them carry out his orders and directions.
	
	
	Mr Stratton SC on behalf of Farhad Qaumi and Mr Young SC on behalf of his co-accused brother (Mumtaz) submitted that any probative value that the evidence has is relatively slight when account is taken of all of the other evidence in the case and that the unfair prejudice of leading evidence suggesting that Farhad Qaumi was responsible for three previous homicides could not be overcome by direction. Rather, the evidence would simply overwhelm a jury and distract it from its task of considering the particular charges in a dispassionate way. In other words, the defence makes a submission under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Insofar as the Crown would seek to rely on the evidence as tendency evidence, consideration must also be given to the provisions of s 97 and 101.
	
	
	I accept the submissions made on behalf of the accused. I have been provided with a working document (Exhibit EE) in which there is recorded a “list of incidents relied upon as background, context, relationship and tendency”. Included in that document is a paragraph entitled:
	


“4. Assaults/threats on members or observed by members on other people.”


	
	Under this heading, there are some 18 dot points detailing evidence of incidents (or kinds of incident) in which intimidation of members of the BFL Blacktown by threats and violence was employed by the leaders of the group. These points include a number of areas that are not subject to objection (at least on the part of Farhad Qaumi). These areas not subject to objection include, adopting the shorthand in the document:
	



	
	The assault of a member who refused to involve himself in a drug run.
	
	
	The assault of a member who indicated that he no longer wished to stay with the group including a threat that he might be shot and the suggestion that he must choose whether he was to be shot in the right or left leg.
	
	
	The bashing of a member (including threats with a gun) in response to the member doing an “unauthorised drug run”.
	
	
	Threats of shootings if a member failed to pay the $50 weekly membership fee.
	
	
	The pulling of a gun on witness B and being required to indicate which leg he wanted to have shot.
	
	
	An assault on witness I for refusing to be involved in the murder of Mohammed Hamzy.
	
	
	The bashing of the brother of witnesses G and I for “disrespecting [Farhad and Jamil Qaumi] in front of their wives.”
	
	
	An order that witness C be bashed for failing to answer his phone.
	
	
	An assault of witness C by Farhad Qaumi during which the witness was struck in the head with a dumbbell. This occurred because witness C failed to arrange finance for a car.
	
	
	Threats of violence if a person should leave the Brothers for Life.
	
	
	The bashing of Masieh Amiri by Farhad Qaumi because of a failure to obtain a gun.
	
	
	Farhad Qaumi telling members that former member Mustafa Shanasa had “gone out with a bang” and would not be returning to the group. [I a note that this is a peripheral detail of offences originally charged in counts 12 and 13 of the indictment and which have been severed.]
	



	
	There are multiple witnesses to each of these incidents. The nature and extent of this body of evidence is such that a jury will readily understand the prosecution case on this issue. In conjunction with the evidence pertaining to the counts on the indictment – which includes evidence that witnesses were threatened if they failed to obey directions – the jury will appreciate that the Crown case is that the witnesses acted as a result of fear and intimidation instilled by the use of violence and threats of violence. I accept that the evidence that Farhad Qaumi boasted of being involved in three earlier killings would increase the impact of this evidence, but the extent to which it would do so, given the volume of the other evidence is not as great as if it were the only evidence of Farhad instilling fear in the other members.
	
	
	The learned Crown Prosecutor fairly and correctly accepted that a proper assessment of the probative value of the impugned evidence involved necessarily a consideration of the other evidence going to the fact in issue to which that evidence is specifically directed. Having undertaken that evaluation, I accept the submission made by Mr Stratton SC that the probative value of the evidence is such that it is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to Farhad Qaumi (and also his brothers Mumtaz and Jamil).
	
	
	The risk of unfair prejudice is obvious and may be stated with brevity. A jury confronted with the body of evidence upon which the Crown seeks to rely would inevitably speculate as to whether Farhad Qaumi was in fact guilty of three previous killings. It might be tempted to disobey directions in relation to conducting internet research. If it did disobey such directions, it would inevitably find reference in the electronic media to the earlier killings. But even assuming that the jury obeyed such directions, the evidence to be led would lead the jury to wonder whether or not Farhad Qaumi had committed the killings of which he boasted and whether such evidence was being hidden from it for some reason. There is a distinct likelihood that a direction as to the limited use that could be made of the evidence, and an exhortation that the jury not speculate on whether Farhad Qaumi had been involved in the earlier incidents, would fall on deaf ears.
	
	
	Farhad Qaumi would be confronted with an impossible forensic election involving two bad choices. He could elect not to respond to the evidence and to trust that the jury would use the evidence in the limited way that the Crown proposes and obey directions that it should ignore the possibility that the accused had previously been responsible for the deaths of three people. Putting aside the obvious prejudice in this, there would also be unfairness in the fact that the jury would not be told that he was, in fact, acquitted in respect of two of the killings and that the prosecution had insufficient evidence to justify putting him to trial on the third. The other bad choice would be to re-litigate those offences for which he had already been acquitted or to rely on the outcomes of the earlier prosecutions. This would involve bringing to the jury’s attention the fact that he was in fact involved in three earlier killings.
	
	
	In my view, these matters give rise to the “danger of unfair prejudice” for the purpose of s137. The question is whether that danger outweighs the probative value of the evidence. In many cases, prejudice such as this can be cured by direction. However, the evidence in this case is of such a nature that I am unable to contemplate a direction that would overcome the unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	Having conducted the balancing exercise required by s 137, and noting the assessment of the probative value that I have made, I am left in no doubt that the section requires the evidence to be excluded.
	


Rulings


	
	As I said in the course of argument, and following observations by counsel for some of the co-accused as to whether the other evidence of threats and violence to club members would be objected to in their cases, if it transpires that my understanding of the admissible evidence of other acts of violence and intimidation is incorrect in a significant way, it will be open to the Crown to re-ventilate the question of the admissibility of this evidence.
	
	
	Also, Senior Counsel then appearing for the co-accused Kalal indicated that there may be an attempt to adduce some of this evidence in Kalal’s case through the cross-examination of witnesses A, D and I. This would not be “in respect of proving the content of the conversation but rather the fact that it was said as a mechanism for dominance and fear and duress”. [5]  Mr Kalal is now represented by different counsel and whether she takes the same approach is not yet known. In any event, the present ruling does not preclude an attempt by Mr Kalal to adduce this evidence in his case. I would expect before doing so, the lawyers for Mr Qaumi would be advised so that any argument might take place in the absence of the jury.
	
	
	Subject to the provisos in the last two paragraphs, and for the reasons set out above, I rule that the evidence is not admissible.

2986772,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 4) [2016] NSWSC 114,"Judgment


	
	Two of the accused (Farhad Qaumi and Mumtaz Qaumi) object to the tender of evidence relating to telephone conversations between them and a third man (Mahmoud Atwa) on 11 April 2015. The learned Crown prosecutor presses the tender of the evidence. It is not suggested that the evidence is admissible against the remaining four accused persons. Details of the Crown case and some of the evidence proposed to be adduced by the Prosecutor have been set out in earlier judgments, in particular the judgment in relation to whether the counts on indictment should be severed or separated: see R v Qaumi (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 15.
	
	
	Summaries of the telephone intercepts were tendered on the voir dire as part of exhibit CC. Four of the recordings (identified by reference numbers PN809, PN814, PN816 and PN826) were tendered as Exhibit DD and played in Court. I was also provided with the full transcripts of the calls as an aide memoir. The prosecution submits that some of the things said by Mumtaz and Farhad Qaumi constitute an admission or, at least, would be capable of being used as an admission by a jury acting reasonably. This submission is based on the accused saying at various times that one of the co-accused (Mr Zarshoy) may “roll on us” or “snitch on us brother, he’ll give us up, I swear to god he’ll give us up”. Those words were spoken by Mumtaz Qaumi in a telephone conversation with Atwar at around 10:27 pm on 11 April 2015. Later that day Mumtaz Qaumi sought the advice and counsel of his older brother (Farhad) and, in the course of a lengthy conversation, Farhad said “look what he’s charged with brother, what if he rolls on us bro.”
	
	
	There is also discussion in the calls of the possibility that Mr Zarshoy may be murdered. However, contrary to submissions made by Senior Counsel for each of the accused, I do not understand that the prosecution will seek to establish that the Qaumi brothers hatched a plot to kill Mr Zarshoy because they were concerned that he would “roll” on them. That does not seem to be the Crown’s position and such a position could not be sustained given the full context of the conversations and considering the evidence contained in the telephone intercepts read as a whole. The true circumstance in which the observations were made by first Mumtaz and then Farhad Qaumi are as follows.
	
	
	It appears that Mr Zarshoy or his brother owed money ($5,000 or $7,000) to the man Atwa and his family and/or associates. At the time of the telephone calls Atwa, Mumtaz Qaumi and Farhad Qaumi were in custody but each seemed to have access to telephones late at night. Atwa called Mumtaz Qaumi in an attempt to obtain Mumtaz’s support in the financial dispute with Mr Zarshoy and his brother. In the first relevant conversation at 10:07 pm on 11 April 2015, Atwa made threats against the lives of the Zarshoy brothers (Faisal and “Nasser”). There seems to be no dispute that the reference to Nasser is a reference to the co-accused Mohammed Zarshoy. Atwa said, amongst other things:
	


“I’m going to fuckin’, I’m gonna, I’m going to kill him, I’m gonna kill Nasser and whoever wants to back him, I’ll fuckin kill them too, huh, so get ready, I’m gonna fuckin’ go to war with all of youse, huh, tell that fucking cock sucker Faisal, yeah.”


	
	He complained to Mumtaz in the most strident and colourful terms of the fact that these “fucking little dogs are trying to rip me and trying to rip Hakim.” He said that “I gonna fucking cut his brother Nasser and if he wants to get involved I’m gonna chop them…”
	
	
	In a subsequent telephone conversation at 10:27 pm, after similar complaints and threats were made by Atwa, Mumtaz Qaumi made the first comment said to constitute an admission. The context (as recorded in the transcript) is as follows:
	


“Atwa: he’s a fucking little dog. Uh …

Mumtaz: Yeah, yeah.

Atwa: If you want, if you want, brother, that, that Nasser, yeah?

Mumtaz: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, listen, bro, what you do …

Atwa: I’m gonna chop him, brother, I’m gonna chop his (unintelligible), I’m telling you now.

Mumtaz: … oi listen. If, if you, if you’re gonna get him, don’t call out to him through the fence, because then he’s gonna know something’s up, yeah? Don’t give him no heads up then. Don’t give him heads up. Let him just come here, and just do, do what you’ve got to do in the showers, brother. But, listen …

Atwa: Yeah.

Mumtaz: … make sure, Atwa, make sure he doesn’t survive, yeah?.”

Atwa: Yeah, I’m gonna get him. I’m gonna fucking (unintelligible) …

Mumtaz: Because, because, listen, I’ll talk, I’ll talk to you tomorrow, but if he survives he’s gunna snitch on all of us, hey. And he’s on some big changes with me, yeah, that’s the only reason I need him underneath my eye so he doesn’t roll on us, brother.”


	
	Later in the same conversation and in a similar vein, Mumtaz said “he’s gonna snitch on us, brother. He’ll give us up, I swear to god he’ll give us up … Brother I am innocent, I’m innocent brother, we’ve done nothing wrong.”
	
	
	There is a call recorded at 10:32 pm in which Mumtaz Qaumi spoke to Faisal Zarshoy and then a call recorded at 10:39 pm when Mumtaz again spoke to Atwa. In those conversations, Mumtaz appears to be playing both sides against the other and on a benevolent view attempting to broker some kind of peace. Thereafter he seeks the advice of Farhad Qaumi in a call recorded at 11:01 pm. Early in that conversation Farhad said:
	


“What’s fucking Atwa saying bro? Tell him that blokes charged with fucking, tell him whatever, he’s a gronk, or whatever, the blokes, look what he’s charged with brother, what if he rolls on us bro?”


	
	While I accept the defence submissions that the evidence is capable of a variety of meanings, and while I specifically accept that Mumtaz Qaumi appears to be playing the role of mediator, I do not accept the submission that the evidence is not relevant. I accept that the evidence is relevant in the sense that it “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.” At the very least, it supports an inference that Mr Zarshoy knew things about the Qaumi brothers that could be passed on to police and used against them. It suggests he was aware of criminal activity and that he had taken part in such activity with the Qaumis. Accordingly, the evidence is relevant.
	
	
	The prosecutor seeks to assert that the conversations have specific relevance to the shooting at Revesby Heights and the murder of Mahmoud Hamzy. This is based on the words used by both Farhad and Mumtaz (“look what he’s charged with” and “he’s on some big charges with me”) and the fact that the only substantive offences with which Zarshoy is charged arises out of the Hamzy shooting. I accept that it is possible that the evidence could be used in that way. However I am of the view that to use it so would be to engage in a degree of speculation. Controversy still attends to the extent to which a trial Judge assessing the “probative value” of evidence may or should consider the reliability of the evidence [1]  but it seems that, even in New South Wales, a trial judge might properly have regard to the existence of competing or alternative inferences that arise from the evidence. [2] 
	
	
	As I have said, I accept the defence submissions that, taken globally, Mumtaz (and Farhad indirectly) are attempting to resolve the dispute between Atwa and Zarshoy. It is critical to observe that the entire dialogue arises as a result of that dispute. Mumtaz Qaumi’s primary hope appears to be that the debt will be repaid and that there will be no further violence. His motive appears to be selfish. First, violence may interfere with his classification “in the main” gaol. Second, violence that leaves Mr Zarshoy alive, may result in Zarshoy “rolling” or “snitching”. It is in that context that he tells Atwa that, if it does come to violence, Atwa should make sure that Zarshoy is killed.
	
	
	While I am unable to accept the defence submission that the evidence is not relevant, I do accept the alternative submission that its probative value is “outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused”.
	
	
	The probative value of the evidence is reduced by virtue of a number of factors. First, it is unclear whether the brothers are concerned that Mr Zarshoy might “roll” or “snitch” specifically in relation to the Hamzy murder although the context may suggest that this is the most likely explanation for their concern. However, there are other inferences that could be drawn given the chronology of events and the details of Zarshoy’s involvement in the Brothers for Life, Blacktown Chapter. [3] 
	
	
	Secondly, as Senior Counsel for Farhad Quami submitted, a concern that a witness might “roll” does not necessarily carry with it the meaning that they will roll and tell the truth. It is also possible that a witness might “roll” and provide false information to the authorities.
	
	
	Thirdly, the context in which the comments are made give rise to the possibility that the concern that he might “roll” would arise if the violent plot by Atwa (which had nothing to do with the Quami brothers) failed and Zarshoy was left having been attacked but still alive. In those circumstances, Mumtaz expresses concern that Zarshoy might be motivated to go to the police and provide information (whether it be true or false, it is not canvassed in the conversation).
	
	
	Accordingly, while I accept that the evidence has some capacity to be used by a jury as an admission, the probative value of the evidence is not particularly high.
	
	
	Against that the potential prejudicial effect is substantial. Mumtaz Qaumi demonstrates a high degree of callousness towards his former colleague. There is a danger that a jury confronted with evidence that Mumtaz merely acquiesced in the threat to “cut” or kill Zarshoy, it would use the evidence improperly against him. While warnings could be given as to the limited use of the evidence, these would serve to highlight what is otherwise a very small part of the prosecution case. The evidence also discloses or suggests an ongoing involvement in gangland activities even after being incarcerated. I gather from earlier submissions that the telephones were illegally obtained or contraband within the gaol.
	
	
	Taking all of those matters into account I am satisfied that the probative value of this evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. In those circumstances the terms of s 137 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) are mandatory and I “must refuse to admit the evidence”.
	
	
	Accordingly, I rule that the evidence of telephone conversations between Mumtaz Qaumi, Mahmoud Atwa, Faisal Zarshoy and Farhad Qaumi on 11 April 2015 (reproduced in the summary behind Tab 3 of voir dire Ex CC) is not admissible.

2986773,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 5) [2016] NSWSC 115,"Judgment


	
	Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi each raise objections to evidence sought to be led by the Crown from two informant witnesses (known respectively as L and G). The evidence is in a narrow focus and relates to conversations said to have occurred after the arrest of the accused. The conversations relate to comments about a co-accused (Witness M). To understand the context in which this ruling is made, and to obtain an overview of the prosecution case and some of the evidence to be led to prove it, the reader should refer to my earlier judgments and in particular to the judgment on severance: R v Qaumi (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 15. Each of the pieces of evidence arises out of a similar subject matter (an unfulfilled plan to kill Witness M) although the basis of admissibility in each case, and the nature of the objection, is slightly different.
	


Conversation between Witness L and Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi


	
	The evidence proposed to be adduced from witness L concerns a conversation between the witness and Farhad Qaumi during which the co-accused Mumtaz Qaumi was present. In the conversation Farhad is alleged to have said rather unsavoury and abusive things about Witness M and, in the process, abused his brother (Mumtaz) for having believed information provided by Witness M to Mumtaz. On the prosecution case, it was this information that led to a series of offences arising out of an incident referred to as “Chokolatta Café shootings”. These were counts 20-26 on the indictment to which Qaumi (No 3) related. The Crown case is that the target of the Chokolatta Café shootings (and one of the ultimate victims) had access to information concerning the addresses of the Brothers for Life at Blacktown and that there was a fear that he would provide that information to Mohammed Hamzy (also known as “LC” or “Little Crazy”) in order that Hamzy might organise reprisal attacks on those associated with the Brothers for Life at Blacktown. It is worth observing in passing that Farhad Qaumi was not in Australia at the time of the Chokolatta Café shootings and the rather ill-considered venture appears to have been planned (on the prosecution) case by Mumtaz Qaumi and Witness M.
	
	
	The conversation to which the present objection relates involved Farhad Qaumi complaining that the information provided by Witness M was patently bad information and that it had, in turn, led to a number of members of the Brothers for Life at Blacktown being incarcerated. For example, when speaking about Witness M he called her a “fucking dog, the fucking slut, because of her my boys are locked up” and “she’s a fucking devil” (statement of witness L at Q843-844).
	
	
	In the course of the same conversation, Farhad Qaumi also expressed anger at Mumtaz Qaumi, calling him a “dumb cunt” for believing Witness M. Importantly at the conclusion of the conversation the witness was asked “and how did Mumtaz take that?” to which the witness replied “he didn’t say nothing”. According to witness L, the conversation went on and the Qaumi brothers (Farhad and Mumtaz) started to talk about the possibility of murdering Witness M. They said things like “she’s got to go” and “we’re gonna knock her off”. There then followed a quite detailed discussion as to the method that might be employed to carry out that plan.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the words of Farhad Qaumi constitute an admission on his behalf as to some knowledge of the Chokolatta Café shooting. Mr Stratton SC submits that, on the contrary, it suggests that he was innocent of that charge because it shows that he was not involved in the planning. Rather, it implicates his brother Mumtaz.
	
	
	In respect of Mumtaz, the Crown submits that the conversation constitutes an admission by silence. It is suggest that, having heard what Farhad had to say, in ordinary circumstances one would have expected Mumtaz to have responded in some way if it truly were the case that he had no knowledge of the Chokolatta Café shooting. Mr Young SC submits that the evidence “fails at the first hurdle” which I take to mean is not relevant and does not constitute an admission of any kind.
	
	
	It is established that silence may constitute an implied admission depending on the circumstances. In R v Grills (1910) 11 CLR 400  Isaacs J said at 422:
	


""It is an elementary rule of law, going to the very foundation of justice, that no man shall be adjudged to be guilty of a crime upon evidence of another person’s previous assertions. It matters not whether the assertion was made in the absence or the presence of the accused, as a mere assertion it cannot be regarded as any proof of the culpability of the accused or any confirmation of his accusers. But it is evident that upon such an assertion being made, and equally whether in the accused’s absence or presence, he may admit its truth, and if he does, then it becomes evidence against him of his guilt, not because another has said it, but because of the admission. It is then equivalent to his own statement, and is receivable in that character. And it is further manifest that the acknowledgment of its correctness may be made in an infinite variety of ways. There may be express and unqualified admission, or there may be a guarded admission, or there may be no direct but merely an implied acknowledgement or there may be conduct, active or passive, positive or negative, from which, having regard to the ordinary workings of human nature, a total denial may be considered by reasonable men to be precluded, because, if innocence existed, an unequivocal or a qualified denial would in such a situation be expected.""


	
	Although this passage appeared in a dissenting judgment, it has been described as “the classic statement” of the principle. [1]  In R v Rose [2002] NSWCCA 455; 55 NSWLR 701 Wood CJ at CL and Howie J said:
	


“259. In answer to this ground of appeal the Crown has submitted that a representation for the purpose of s 59 cannot arise from silence or, in this case, the failure of a person to come forward in answer to the Superintendent’s inquiry. The Crown relies upon Hall v The Queen [1971] 1 WLR 299 as support for that submission. In Hall the Privy Council were concerned with the application of Rex v Christie [1914] AC 545 to a particular factual situation. In Christie it was held that in some circumstances the silence of a person when confronted with an allegation might be taken as an admission that the allegation was true. But in Hall it was held that Christie could not be applied in a situation where an allegation put to suspect was met with mere silence. This was because, as the suspect had a right to silence, there was no obligation upon him to answer the police officer and, therefore, no inference could be drawn from his failure to answer the allegation.

260. But there are instances in the law where silence gives rise to an implied representation of fact. Christie itself is one. Silence in the face of an allegation can amount to a representation that the allegation is true where in the circumstances it is reasonable to expect that the allegation would be answered by an explanation or denial. In Hall the implied representation did not arise because there was no such reasonable expectation where a suspect is being confronted by a police officer. In the law of estoppel a failure to speak, where there is a duty to do so, may give rise to a representation of existing fact: Legione v Hateley (1983) 152 CLR 406 at 438-439. In R v Evans (1992) 142 FLR 319 this Court considered whether silence could amount to an untrue representation for the purposes of an offence under 29B of the Crimes Act (Cth). In deciding that it could, Gleeson CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated (at 320):

‘Whether failure to disclose information involves, or amounts to a representation, depends upon the circumstances of the case.

Whether suppression of the truth involves suggestion of falsehood is, in any given case, a question of fact.

There is no principle of law which either requires or permits that a finding of fact about such an issue may, on the one hand, be significant for purposes of the civil law, but must, on the other hand, be disregarded for purposes of the criminal law. Of course, in a criminal case questions of onus of proof may be important. However, facts are facts, whether the proceedings be civil or criminal.

It cannot be correct as a general [proposition] that it is impossible to make an untrue representation by omission. For examples of cases where it has been said that silence can amount to a representation: see Legione v Hateley (1983) 152 CLR 406 at 438-439; Union Bank of Australia Ltd v Puddy [1949] VLR 242 at 247; Westpac Banking Corporation v Robinson (1993) 30 NSWLR 668 at 688.’

261.There is no reason why the word “representation” as used in the Evidence Act should not encompass a communication made by silence or a failure to respond. As the judgment in Lee points out, in the portion quoted above, the Commission intended that the word be given a wide application so that:

‘… the term ""representation"" was used to apply to statements and to conduct and was used to encompass all that those statements or that conduct would convey to the observer.’

262. Whether a representation does arise from the silence or non-action of a person on any particular occasion will depend upon the circumstances and, in particular, whether an inference can be drawn that the person by silence or non-action made a representation of fact, regardless of whether or not the person intended to convey the representation.”


	
	I accept that in the circumstances of the present case, it would be open to a jury to find that the silence of Mumtaz Qaumi, in the face of the things allegedly said by his brother, constituted an implied admission that he did (as alleged) act on the information provided by Witness M and that this caused him “to go do a shooting” (ie the Chokolatta Café shooting). Accordingly, I accept that the evidence is relevant.
	
	
	Each of the accused submitted that, even if the evidence has some relevance, the prejudicial impact of those parts of the conversation in which there is discussion of killing Witness M is so overwhelming that the evidence should be excluded under s 137 Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The learned Crown Prosecutor acknowledges the potential for prejudice but submits that it is the fact that the accused are so concerned about Witness M’s behaviour that they engage in a detailed conversation about killing her that gives the admissions their probative force.
	
	
	It seems to me that any probative value that the evidence has is to be found in the conversation between Farhad and Mumtaz which preceded the suggestion that they might respond to the situation by arranging the killing of Witness M. I am unable to accept the submission that the ongoing discussion that they should kill her, and how they might do so, adds sufficiently to the probative value of the evidence to justify its admission given the obvious danger of unfair prejudice that arises from such evidence.
	
	
	Accordingly, I would not permit evidence to be led concerning the proposed ‘knocking off’ of Witness M. However, I cannot see any relevant prejudicial impact in the first part of the conversation going before the jury. I accept the Crown’s submission that the failure of Mumtaz to say anything at that stage is evidence capable of amounting to an admission by silence or some form of consciousness of guilt. I accept Mr Young’s submission that there may be other inferences available, such as a reluctance to interject when Farhad was in full flight, but that is a matter that a jury is capable of assessing rather than a matter that should be excluded from its consideration. I acknowledge that the existence of competing inferences is a matter that might influence an assessment of probative value, [2]  but in the absence of any clear prejudice, such as that which would arise if the subsequent conversation (concerning the plot to kill Witness M) was admitted, the balancing exercise required by s 137 is such that I would admit that evidence.
	


Witness G’s evidence of the conversation with Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi


	
	Witness G says in paragraph 22 of his statement of 14 January 2015:
	


“I would also like to add further information about Witness M. I can’t be certain if it was at Long Bay Gaol or at Silverwater MRCC but I remember having a conversation with both Mumtaz and Jamil about Witness M. This was at the end of last year or during the first half of 2014. Both Jamil and Mumtaz were talking about Witness M and saying how worried they were that she ‘knew too much.’ They spoke about wanting to ‘knock’ her, like ‘get rid of her.’”


	
	Ms Carroll on behalf of Jamil Qaumi raises various legal objections to this. One was based around the provision in s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) which concerns the exclusion of admissions where the circumstances in which the admission was made is such that it is unfair to use the admission in trial. I do not accept that s 90 has any real relevance to the present question of admissibility.
	
	
	However, I do accept Ms Carroll’s submission that the extent to which this evidence could be used as an admission is slight. In other words, Ms Carroll argued that the probative value of the evidence was minimal. This was based on a variety of factors. For example, it is not clear who said the words attributed to the pair and, more importantly, it is not possible to determine the subject matter upon which Witness M was said to “know too much”. I accept that these aspects of the evidence have the capacity to reduce the probative value.
	
	
	Further, the prejudicial impact of a jury hearing that two co-accused may have in mind to do away with another co-accused on the basis of her knowing too much is the kind of unfair prejudice to which s 137 is directed. Another aspect of prejudice is the location where the conversation was alleged to have occurred, that is in a remand gaol either in Long Bay or Silverwater. There is also an element of unfairness in the fact that both the place and timing of the alleged admission is so vague as to be impossible for the accused to have any prospect of rebutting the evidence. In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and s 137 requires that it be rejected.
	


Rulings


	
	Witness M has indicated that she may attempt to adduce evidence of the kind that I have ruled inadmissible as between the Crown and the accused Farhad and Mumtaz Qaumi. I cannot presently perceive the relevance of conversations that took place many months after the events giving rise to the charges to any issue that would arise in her case. However, Witness M withdrew her barrister’s instructions last weeks, that is around nine weeks into the pre-trial hearing. She is currently represented by a capable and well briefed solicitor who is attempting to find new counsel and has not yet taken (or had) the opportunity to be heard in relation to the admissibility of the evidence in Witness M’s case. The ruling that I now make will not preclude Witness M from attempting to adduce such evidence in the course of the trial. I would expect that if she chooses to do this, the lawyers for the Mr Qaumi will be advised to enable them to raise objection in the absence of the jury.
	
	
	In accordance with the reasons set out above, I make the following rulings:
	



	
	The evidence of the conversation between Farhad Qaumi and witness L recorded in Q and A 843-847 is admissible.
	
	
	The evidence of the subsequent conversation between Farhad Qaumi, Mumtaz Qaumi and witness L in which they discussed killing Witness M is inadmissible.
	
	
	The evidence of the conversation between witness G, Mumtaz Qaumi and Jamil Qaumi in which there was a discussion about killing Witness M is inadmissible.

2986800,R v Natoli [2016] NSWDC 316,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: In 1999 the Court of Criminal Appeal published a judgment in which it indicated an appropriate range of sentences for the commonly occurring offence of armed robbery. That was in response to what was clearly a great deal of concern shared by many in the community as to the problems caused by prevalent offences of armed robbery. What to an offender is a very limited period of offending in that an offender goes into a shop, waves a knife around and leaves with some money can have serious ongoing consequences for the victims of such offences.
	
	
	It often seems that when sentencing for offences of armed robbery, particularly before the Henry guideline judgment was passed (R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; (1999) 106 A Crim R) little attention was being paid to the consequences for the victims of armed robbery offences.
	
	
	The offender, Domenic Natoli has served a lengthy sentence for a series of armed robberies. He was released to parole in 2013 but only relatively shortly later he committed another series of offences, including one of considerable gravity. The inevitable consequence is that he must go to gaol for a significant period of time.
	
	
	These offences all occurred in the context of Mr Natoli’s drug use. I will speak about that in a bit more detail later but whist his father was dying he said that he coped by using drugs. In order to obtain money for drugs he had to commit offences of the type that I will now describe.
	
	
	On 21 February 2014 he went into a convenience store or a supermarket in Newtown. A woman was working in the shop. She was carrying her five month old baby. The offender approached her, spoke with her about dog food and then left the store. He could not have been unaware of the circumstance that she was holding her five month old baby. Despite that he returned to the store a short time later and robbed her. He even walked behind the counter where the unfortunate victim, Ms Patel was standing, holding her baby. He produced a kitchen knife with a silver blade of about 10 centimetres in length, said quite unnecessarily “I have a knife” and then told her to give him all her money. She took about $165 from the cash register and put it on the counter. The offender picked up the money, wiped down the counter with his jumper sleeve and left the store with the money and a can of dog food. The seriousness of that offence is difficult to underestimate.
	
	
	Somewhat remarkably he has also to be sentenced for a further offence committed in the very same premises. This offence, that I am about to describe, appears on a Form 1 attached to the offence of armed robbery that I have just described. This time it was not Ms Patel behind the counter but Mr Patel. This time the offender walked into the shop, again walked behind the counter to where Mr Patel was standing, produced a knife and told him to hand over all the money. Mr Patel gave him $100 in cash. When the offender demanded more Mr Patel told him he did not have any more money, so the offender took two packets of cigarettes and left the store.
	
	
	In between the two offences committed on the same store the offender also assaulted a taxi driver in an attempt to rob him. Mr Islam, the taxi driver, picked up the offender in Newtown. The offender was behaving strangely, talking into a phone which did not appear to be connected to anything until finally the offender directed Mr Islam to go to Kings Cross via Liverpool Street. As the taxi approached Forbes Street the offender told Mr Islam to turn into that street. Mr Islam said “well this is a no through road” but the offender said he was looking for a girl. It was at this stage that Mr Islam turned to look at the offender and saw that he was holding out a knife towards his neck. The blade was about 8 inches long. The offender said “give me your money first”. The victim reached out and grabbed hold of the knife with both hands, he was clearly trying to defend himself, afraid that the offender would use the knife on him. He tried to push the knife away. As he did this he felt pain in his hand and saw that it was bleeding. He felt fear that the offender would stab him and they struggled for about 10 to 20 seconds over the possession of the knife. Mr Islam yelled out for help and got out of his taxi, so did the offender and he walked quickly out of sight. Mr Islam then drove to hospital. Fortunately the laceration he had suffered was not a terribly significant one, with tendons being intact and there being no injury to any nerve. He was treated with a single suture.
	
	
	As well as that offence there is another offence for which I must specifically sentence the offender and when I do for that there is another matter on a separate Form 1. Both of the two offences I am about to describe arose in the same circumstances. A man by the name of Daniel Morali had no fixed place of abode and he was sleeping at Central Railway Station. He was woken up at about 4.40 am by the offender pretending to be a police officer and insisting that he consent to being searched. Mr Morali had some suspicions but did consent to what the offender was doing, believing him to be or at least possibly be a police officer. As part of the interaction between the two the offender took a mobile phone from Mr Morali. When he asked for it back Mr Natoli struck Mr Morali above his right eye. Mr Natoli ran away and Mr Morali noticed that there was blood dripping from his face. He spoke to the station manager, an ambulance was called and he was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital. He was found to have a 4 centimetre wound above his right eyebrow, the wound went down to the dermis layer and required seven sutures.
	
	
	So I am to sentence the offender for aggravated steal from a person causing wounding in circumstances of aggravation being the use of corporal violence. The offence of impersonating a police officer appears on the Form 1 attached to that offence.
	
	
	It is obvious these were very serious offences. They come on top of Mr Natoli serving a significant period in custody for a series of earlier armed robbery offences.
	
	
	Mr Natoli gave evidence. He initially described his offences as being silly or stupid which seriously underestimated the criminality of his behaviour. At first when expressing his remorse for what he did he focussed his answer on his problems, not those of his victims. He better expressed remorse in his later evidence, although even in a letter written to the Patels he seeks to partially excuse his actions and I note that the letter was written only shortly before today’s proceedings. Despite what Mr Natoli says I consider he has very limited insight into the consequences of his criminal behaviour. To ever contemplate describing robbing a woman carrying a five month old baby as either silly or stupid shows a serious lack of understanding as to the wrongfulness of his actions.
	
	
	Mr Natoli was raised in Newtown to parents of Italian background. His father worked as did his mother. He told the psychologist that they lived in a rough area and that his overall recollections of childhood were averse. Although he was cared for and never experienced neglect he told the psychologist that his father was an abusive and violent man who beat Mr Natoli and his mother regularly. He recalled being bashed from a young age, often without any provocation. Not surprisingly he was, as a result, nervous and hyper vigilant as a child because of the unpredictable behaviour of his father. Despite his father’s behaviour towards him he was clearly distressed by his father’s ill health at the time that he was released from custody in 2013.
	
	
	It is clear that Mr Natoli’s intellectual capacity is limited. As Ms Hall says his inability to express remorse in the way judges might prefer to hear it expressed, has to be looked at in that context. His failure to comply with conditions of parole too as regards drug rehabilitation and the like also have to be looked at in the context of someone with limited coping skills due to his cognitive difficulties.
	
	
	The offender began drug use at a relatively early age starting with cannabis at about the age of 10, binge drinking by 14 and experimenting with a wide range of more serious drugs from mid-adolescence. It was while using drugs heavily that he committed the earlier offences in 2006 and of course he committed the offences which I must sentence him also in the context of being a serious drug user. He attributes his drug use after he was released to parole in 2013 to the influence of a person with whom he was associated, she being a drug user, and distress he felt at his father’s ill health.
	
	
	He has proposals for the future but obviously there will be a significant period of time before those plans can be put into effect. He has the support of his brothers who are in Court today. One of them has suggested that upon his release from custody he should come to live with him, get him out of Sydney where there might be more positive influences. He wishes to work in the construction industry on his release. There is thus hope for the offender’s future but given his criminal history to date his prospects of rehabilitation must be regarded as being guarded. One positive factor which Ms Hall relies on is that the offender has made a decision himself to stop using drugs. He has not used drugs whilst in custody for most of his current time there. He recognises the poor outcomes that result from drug use but of course whether that attitude remains upon his release from custody remains to be seen.
	
	
	These were seriously aggravated offences, the victims were vulnerable in some cases, if not all. The lady carrying the baby behind the counter of the shop was vulnerable, the man, Mr Patel working alone in the shop was also vulnerable, the taxi driver was vulnerable because of his occupation and the homeless man was vulnerable because he was fast asleep at the time he was approached by the offender. Clearly the presence of a child in one offence was a seriously aggravating feature. No amendment to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was needed for that factor to be taken into account. There was planning of course, limited it would seem, but in each case the offender armed himself with a weapon. In the case of Mr Morali’s offence, the offender planned the way he would go about committing this offence without a weapon.
	
	
	One particular factor which is to be looked at concerns the fact that the offender was on parole. It is important not to double count by both starting a sentence from perhaps the day sentence is imposed and also regarding the breach of parole as a seriously aggravating factor. I have decided to take the fact that the offender was on parole into account as an aggravating factor and therefore I will start the sentence that I will shortly announce from 6 June 2015.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty to these offences but at different stages of the proceedings. Where he pleaded guilty after being committed for trial I will discount the sentence by about 15% and where he pleaded guilty in the Local Court I will discount the sentence by about 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas.
	
	
	I should finally mention, as I began, the Henry judgment. There are some differences between the standard offence postulated in Henry. The offender was not young, he certainly did not have a limited criminal history and in no circumstance did Henry contemplate that someone might rob another while the victim was carrying a small child. On the other hand in the offender’s favour the plea of guilty was earlier than that postulated in Henry which it is explained in a later judgment, R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 was for a late plea of limited utility.
	
	
	I have decided to impose an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	Were it not for me imposing an aggregate sentence, on count 1, the armed robbery of Ms Patel I would have imposed a sentence of 6 and a half years, that of course taking into account the matter on the Form 1. For the offence involving Mr Islam, sequence 10, I would have imposed a sentence of 5 years. For the offence involving Mr Morali, again taking into account the matter of a Form 1 I would impose a sentence of 5 and a half years. Instead I will impose an aggregate sentence consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years and a head sentence of 10 years, to date from 6 June 2015. That means that the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 5 June 2021.

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Wilkie
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By  the  verdicts  of  the  jury,  Jo  Cox  was  murdered  by  you  on  16  June  2016  and  you  caused 
 
Bernard Kenny grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Because of her position as a Member of Parliament, her death was both a personal tragedy 
 
 
and a crime with great public significance. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

To her family, friends and colleagues Jo Cox was a wonderful mother, daughter, sister, partner, 
 
and companion, her generosity of spirit evident in the selfless concern she had for others even 
 
when  facing  a  violent  death.  Their  loss,  caused  by  your  actions,  is  and  will  be,  almost 
 
unbearable. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

But because she was a Member of Parliament, the reason you murdered her, your crime has 
 
an additional dimension which calls for particularly severe punishment. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

She was just 41. before being elected as an MP she had already demonstrated herself to be a 
 
credit to herself, her community, and her country in the work she performed for Oxfam and 
 
other organisations devoting herself to seeking to better the lot of those less fortunate than 
 
her. 
  

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

She had only recently embarked on her role as an MP but had already shown herself to be 
 
passionate, openhearted, inclusive and generous as well as highly effective. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

The tributes to her from across the political spectrum were spontaneous, sincere and fulsome. 
 
The  fundamental  importance  to  our  democracy  for  Members  of  Parliament  to  be  able  to 
 
perform their duties and meet their constituents safely and fearlessly is reflected in the fact 
 
that no respectable political party contested the by‐election caused by her death. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the true meaning of the word she was a patriot. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  affect  to  be  a  patriot.  The  words  you  uttered  repeatedly  when  you  killed  her  give  lip 
 
service  to that  concept.  Those  sentiments  can  be  legitimate  and can  have  resonance  but in 
 
 
your mouth, allied to your actions, they are tainted and made toxic. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is clear from your internet and other researches that your inspiration is not love of country 
 
or  your  fellow  citizens,  it  is  an  admiration  for  Nazism,  and  similar  anti  democratic  white 
 
supremacist  creeds  where  democracy  and  political  persuasion  are  supplanted  by  violence

towards and intimidation of opponents and those who, in whatever ways, are thought to be 
 
 
different and, for that reason, open to persecution. 
  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Our parents’ generation made huge sacrifices to defeat those ideas and values in the Second 
 
World War. What you did, and your admiration for those views which informed your crime, 
 
betrays the sacrifices of that generation. 
  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  are  no  patriot.  By  your  actions  you  have  betrayed  the  quintessence  of  our  country, its 
 
adherence to parliamentary democracy. 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  have  not  even  had  the  courage  to  admit  and  acknowledge  what  you  did.  You  have, 
 
instead,  forced  the  prosecution  to  prove  this  case  in  detail,  withholding  your  agreement  to 
 
anything which would have lessened that task, thereby adding, I have no doubt deliberately, 
 
to the anguish of Jo Cox’s family and the witnesses to these awful events forced, as they have 
 
 
been, to relive them. 

 
 
 

      

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By  contrast  your  second  victim  on  that  day,  Bernard  Kenny,  acted  instinctively  and 
 
courageously  trying  to  save  a  person  he  saw  being  attacked  and  by  so  doing  was  seriously 
 
injured himself. The ongoing cost to him is evidence from his Victim Personal Statement. His 
 
actions on that day are deserving of the highest praise and commendation. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

As you know, the only sentence I can pass on you for murder is one of life imprisonment, and I 
   
do so. 
 

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I also have to consider whether to fix a minimum term or, by not doing so, to impose a whole 
 
 
 
life sentence which would mean that you would, in all likelihood, die in prison. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have to consider schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. There is no doubt that this 
 
 
murder was done for the purpose of advancing a political, racial and ideological cause namely 
 
that of violent white supremacism and exclusive nationalism most associated with Nazism and 
 
its modern forms. That is one of the indices of an offence of exceptionally high seriousness for 
 
which the appropriate starting point is a whole life term. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

This  was  a  brutal,  ruthless  example  of  such  a  murder  committed  with  determination  and 
 
persistence.  You  armed  yourself  with  a  handgun  and  a  vicious  dagger  designed  to  kill.  You 
 
attacked Jo Cox repeatedly with both of them. You repelled an attempt by Mr Kenny to stop 
 
you in a similarly ruthless manner and, when it appeared, after your first assault, that Jo Cox 
 
might survive, you returned to inflict further fatal blows upon her. Your choice of weapons, a 
 
firearm and a knife places your offending even, without the political dimension, in categories 
 
having starting points of 30 and 25 years 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 

In addition, as an aggravating feature, there was a substantial degree of premeditation and 
 
planning.  You  had,  over  a  period  of  weeks,  researched  your  intended  victim,  you  had 
 
researched the firearm which was modified to become a hand gun. You made inquiries about 
 
its ability to inflict fatal injury and you sought instruction on how to use it in that modified 
 
form.  You  informed  yourself  about  previous  murders  of  civil  rights  workers  and  a  past 
 
assassination  of  a  serving  MP.  You  contemplated  the  aftermath,  researching  lying  in  state 
 
arrangements. You even researched matricide knowing that Jo Cox was the mother of young 
 
children. You planned your escape from the scene by adopting a form of disguise to put off 
 
those searching for you and, in the course of your escape, you reloaded the firearm ready for 
 
any eventuality. Finally, as the jury has decided, you fully intended to kill Jo Cox. 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You are aged 53 and have no previous convictions both of which I must take into account. I 
   
must  consider  whether  the  seriousness  of  this  offence,  though  categorised  as  exceptionally 
 
high,  in  fact  requires  a  whole  life  sentence  or  whether  I  should  fix  a  minimum  term  which

would hold out the possibility of release on licence when you are very old to permit you to die 
 
in the community. 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I have considered this anxiously but have concluded that this offence, as I have described it, is 
 
 
of such a high level of exceptional seriousness that it can only properly be marked by a whole 
 
 
life sentence. That is the sentence which I pass. 
 

 
 

 
 

   

   

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

You  will,  therefore,  only  be  released,  if  ever,  by  the  Secretary  of  State  exercising  executive 
 
clemency on humanitarian grounds to permit you to die at home. Whether or not that occurs 
 
will be a matter for the holder of that office at the time. 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On count 2: that offence is inextricably linked with the count of murder and, on grounds of its 
 
exceptional seriousness, I pass the same sentence, life imprisonment and I make a minimum 
 
 
term order of 15 years less time on remand being one half of 30 years. 
 

 
   

 
 

 
 

   

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On count 3: that offence was committed in order to facilitate the commission of the murder of 
 
Jo Cox. Within the guidelines, it is of high harm and high culpability and the circumstances take 
 
 
it above the sentencing bracket. The sentence is one of 20 years imprisonment concurrent. 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

On count 4: the maximum sentence for this offence is 4 years imprisonment and I pass that 
 
 
sentence to run concurrently with the other sentences.

	HALL J: I agree with R S Hulme AJ.
	
	
	McCALLUM J: I agree with R S Hulme AJ.  
	
	
	R S HULME AJ: The Court has before it appeals by the Crown against sentences imposed on three offenders who, together or in different combinations, participated in a number of offences of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon or attempts to commit such an armed robbery.
	
	
	Each offender was aged 18 at the time of offending and had no previous convictions. Phegan ADCJ imposed aggregate sentences – a course permitted by s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In the case of Mr Schaafhausen the sentence imposed was imprisonment for 5 years including a non-parole of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 24 October 2014. In the case of each of Messrs Faaoloii and Tuala the sentence imposed was of imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months including a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 24 October 2014.
	
	
	The modus operandi adopted in the offending was to drive to a location near the premises intended to be robbed, generally a 24 hour service station, and gain entry to the premises with faces covered, one offender being armed with a crowbar and the other with a painted, but presumably realistic, cap gun. Sometimes entry was gained through an unlocked door although on most occasions glass in or adjacent to a front door was smashed with the crow bar. Demands and threats were made to employees and monies or other items were taken. Sometimes one of the offenders was more active or more aggressive than the others, but given the nature of the joint criminal enterprise that occurred on each occasion the particular part played by one rather than another is of limited importance.
	
	
	A short account with reference to some distinctive features of each offence is as follows.
	
	
	The first offence was on 7 October 2014 at about 5.40am at the United Service Station at Bonnyrigg and about $600 and cigarettes worth about $2,000 were taken. Messrs Schaafhausen and Faaoloii entered the premises while the door was unlocked. Mr Faaoloii was armed with a crowbar and Mr Schaafhausen with the gun with which he threatened the service station employee on a few occasions. Mr Tuala was not involved.
	
	
	The second offence occurred on 8 October 2014 at about midnight at the BP Service Station at Bonnyrigg. Mr Faaoloii used the crowbar to smash the front door. Mr Schaafhausen was armed with the gun which was used to threaten the console operator. About $450 was taken. Again Mr Tuala was not involved.
	
	
	The first Form 1 matter and which involved all three Respondents was an attempted armed robbery at the AHU Coles Express Service Station at Cabramatta and occurred at about 2.30am on 8 October 2014. Mr Tuala smashed the front door with the crow bar. He and Mr Faaoloii who was armed with the gun entered the premises and the console operator was threatened with the gun. Perhaps because he had isolated himself from the offenders, he refused to open the register or a door (presumably to the console area) and the offenders left empty handed. Sometime before the attempted robbery, Mr Schaafhausen was observed to be keeping watch or scouting.
	
	
	Messrs Schaafhausen and Faaoloii asked that this Form 1 offence be taken into account with the second offence charged. Mr Tuala asked that it be taken into account with the eighth offence charged.
	
	
	The third offence charged occurred on 8 October 2014 at about 2.55am at the United Service Station, Prariewood. Again entry was gained by the smashing of glass. On this occasion Mr Schaafhausen was armed with the crowbar and Mr Faaoloii with the gun which was pointed at the employee on duty. All three offenders entered the premises and money, cigarettes and groceries were taken.
	
	
	The fourth offence charged occurred on 10 October 2014 at about 2.50am at the Seven Eleven Service Station at Campbelltown and involved all three offenders. Again entry was gained by the smashing of the front door. The glass on seven of the nine fridges inside the premises was also smashed and a combination lock on a security door was damaged. Mr Schaafhausen was armed with the crowbar and Mr Faaoloii with the gun.
	
	
	On hearing the front door glass smash, the console operator had retreated to a cool room. Mr Faaoloii dragged him out by the collar of his jacket and hit him on the back of the head. Mr Faaoloii also seemed angry when the operator was unable to open the safe, pointed the gun at the operator and said “Open the safe or I’ll shoot you.” Money, cigarettes and groceries were taken. The console operator suffered a minor laceration to his left hand.
	
	
	The fifth offence charged occurred on 15 October 2014 at about 3am at the Seven Eleven Service Station at Minto. The console operator went outside to tidy the grounds where he was accosted by Messrs Schaafhausen and Faaoloii. The latter pushed the gun into the right side of the operator’s body as both offenders forced him back into the store. Later the gun was again pointed at the operator’s chest while demand was made that the safe be opened. When the operator told Mr Faaoloii he did not have the key to the safe, Mr Faaoloii became angry, slammed his fist on the counter, kicked a nearby tin and repeated “give me the money or I’ll kill you.” After the offenders had obtained possession of the money that seemed to be available, Mr Faaoloii told the operator “lay down on the floor and don’t call the police” and the offenders departed. In excess of $525 and groceries were taken. Inside the premises Mr Schaafhausen was armed with the crowbar and all three offenders were involved.
	
	
	The sixth offence charged occurred on 17 October 2014 at about 2.30am at a McDonalds’ restaurant at Green Valley. A fourth offender was also involved. In the restaurant were three employees and several customers. Mr Schaafhausen, carrying the crowbar, forced one employee into a corner of a store room saying “keep your head down or I’m going to kill you”. Mr Faaoloii grabbed the manager and pointed the gun towards the manager’s face, forcing him into the office and demanding that he open a safe. Later similar demands were made for the opening of a cash register. Mr Tuala had remained outside keeping watch. The fourth and unknown offender took a female employee into a store room said he was not going to hurt her but demanded she open the registers at the front of the store. About $3,000 was taken.
	
	
	The aspect involving the unknown offender and the female employee was treated as a separate instance of armed robbery and included on a Form 1. This was the second Form 1 matter and, as participants in a joint criminal enterprise, involved all three Respondents. All three Respondents asked that this Form 1 offence be taken into account with the sixth offence charged.
	
	
	The next offence, also an attempted robbery, was also the subject of a Form 1 in the case of all three offenders. The offence occurred in the early hours on 20 October 2014 at the Fast and Easy Service Station, Liverpool. Mr Schafhausen was armed with the crowbar and Mr Faaoloii with the gun. Again the glass in the front door was smashed and the attendant on duty was threatened with the gun and crowbar. The employee ran into the office, pulled down a roller door and pressed a duress alarm. The offenders left empty handed, Mr Tuala only commencing to enter the premises as the others left. Mr Faaoloii had cut his knee while climbing through the broken glass door, later presenting at the Liverpool Hospital for surgery on a laceration to the knee. He did not actively participate in later offences. All three Respondents asked that this Form 1 offence also be taken into account with the sixth offence charged.
	
	
	The seventh offence charged occurred on 22 October 2014 at about 2.30 am at the United Service Station at Prairewood, the same premises as had been the subject of the third offence charged. Again the front door was smashed with a crow bar and Messrs Schaafhausen and Tuala entered. Mr Schaafhausen was armed with the gun, threatened one of the two employees on duty and forced him to the ground where the gun was held against his neck. The items taken were some $1,700 worth of cigarettes, some condoms and at least $350.00.
	
	
	The eighth offence charged occurred at about 2.30 am and also on 22 October 2014 and was at the United Service Station at Minto. While using the crowbar to smash the front door, Mr Tuala called to the console operator to open the door or “I’ll smash you as well”. The operator then opened the door. Mr Schaafhausen pointed the gun at the operator who was told to open the cash register. He did so. Some $800, cigarettes and condoms were taken.
	
	
	A fourth incident included on Forms 1 was an attempted robbery on 22 October 2014 which occurred a short time later at the Budget Petrol Station, Moorebank. Mr Tuala smashed the front doors with the crow bar but, the console operator having active the duress alarm and said “cops”, the offenders left empty handed. Mr Schaafhausen was armed with the gun. Messrs Schaafhausen and Tuala asked that this offence be taken into account with the seventh offence charged.
	
	
	The last offence occurred in the early hours of 24 October 2014 when an attempt was made to rob the Seven Eleven Service Station at Casula. Mr Tuala smashed the front door with the crow bar. At this time the offenders were the subject of police surveillance, their activities were interrupted and they were arrested. Mr Schaafhausen was in possession of the gun. Mr Faaoloii had remained in the vehicle. This offence also was the subject of a Form 1 in the case of all three offenders. All three offenders asked that this offence be taken into account with the third offence charged.
	
	
	Insofar as the information provided details of the amounts and items taken I have referred to this above. Otherwise the information is not included in the appeal papers and seems not to have been before Phegan ADCJ.
	
	
	Mr Schaafhausen was involved in all of the eight offences charged and the five included on Forms 1.
	
	
	Mr Faaoloii was involved in all of the offences charged except those the subject of counts 7 and 8. He was involved in all of the Form 1 offences except the attempted robbery of the Moorebank Budget Petrol station on 22 October, and which I have referred to as the subject of the fourth Form 1.
	
	
	Mr Tuala was involved in all of the offences charge except those the subject of counts 1 and 2. He was also involved in all of the five Form 1 offences.
	
	
	His Honour recorded that each of the offenders pleaded guilty at a “very early stage” and “at the earliest opportunity” and that each gave evidence during the sentence hearing. Each was the subject of a report by Dr Furst, a consultant psychiatrist.
	
	
	Mr Faaoloii completed his Higher School Certificate and was described as “a keen and capable sportsman”. His family life was disrupted in consequence of his father being imprisoned, neglectful and violent towards the offender. His parents separated when he was 10. Thereafter he did have some support from an uncle and his maternal grandfather although in 2008 his mother was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.
	
	
	He became frustrated in consequence of a breakdown of a 4 year relationship and not being able to obtain a job after completing his HSC. He was also affected by being informed of the molesting of three of his sisters by his paternal grandfather, information which made him concerned that he had not done more to protect them. He began binge drinking which induced him to become aggressive. He commenced using steroids and progressed to ecstasy. His motivation in offending was to feed his drug and alcohol habits although the easy money provided an opportunity to provide financial support for his family.
	
	
	Dr Furst diagnosed him as having an adjustment disorder with depressed mood and a substance use disorder attributable to the events that led to Mr Mr Faaoloii’s offending. Dr Furst detected no intellectual disability or major mental illness.
	
	
	Mr Schaafhausen completed year 12 and then worked as a plumber, a trade which he intends to pursue. He was a rugby league player of considerable potential and the subject of a number of favourable references. Inter alia, he was described as a positive role model and a mentor to younger players.
	
	
	His Honour observed that Mr Shaafhausen displayed a complete inability to deal with adverse circumstances constituted in part by the breakdown in a 5 year relationship and turned to illegal drugs and alcohol from about February 2014. His offending was at least in part to feed these addictions. Dr Furst diagnosed him also as having an adjustment disorder.
	
	
	Mr Tuala is the eldest of four children. He completed year 12. Due to ill-health on the part of his father, Mr Tuala was under some pressure to provide financial support for his parents and undertook part time work while still at school. His employment was disrupted when without reasonable notice he left Australia to attend birthday celebrations in his home land of New Zealand and was not available on his return.
	
	
	In consequence he felt under stress and engaged in increased alcohol consumption and gambling. He became desperately in need of money to fund these habits, became aware of the plans of his co-offenders and joined them as a way of making easy money. He was diagnosed by a psychologist Danielle Hopkins with “borderline intellectual function” – a condition Phegan ADCJ regarded as contributing to his offending.
	
	
	His Honour accepted that Mr Tuala was remorseful, had a genuine commitment not to reoffend and had support from his family, the broader Samoan community and one of his previous school teachers.
	
	
	The above is a brief account of some of the Respondents’ subjective circumstances. Phegan ADCJ remarked that until the beginning of 2014 their characters were impeccable and referred to “compelling evidence of good character” of a degree he had rarely experienced. There was no challenge to these conclusions and accordingly it is unnecessary for me to detail the evidence here. It is sufficient to say that the evidence supports his Honour’s assessment of it.
	
	
	In approaching the sentencing task, Phegan ADCJ remarked:-
	


It would in my view be inappropriate, given the proximity of the offences in time, to attempt to allocate an appropriate sentence even on an indicative basis, for each and every offence. My decision is therefore that the offences should be approached on this basis. First of all there should be an indicative sentence determined on the basis of what represents the most appropriate sentence for the more serious instances of the kind that have involved all of the ingredients I have just identified. I will then differentiate between the offence which occurred between 7 October and 10 October 2014, which I regard as essentially one group of offences that can be bracketed together followed by those offences committed on 17 and 20 October which form a second category and thirdly the offences committed on 22 October.

With regard to the appropriate starting point, and I emphasise this because I foreshadowed that there are a number of different general considerations that all have to be brought to bear before the actual sentences are determined, but as a starting point and in order to identify what I regard as a sentence appropriate to the typical case, that is a case in which weapons were used and threats were made including threats of a quite serious kind, where the proceeds of the offence were substantial and where therefore the relevant factors arising from the decision in Henry were particularly prominent. The appropriate sentence in regard to those offences is one of three years and six months in total.


	
	In his remarks his Honour never specified the offences that he regarded as the “more serious instances” and it is not clear which offences his Honour so regarded. “The ingredients … just identified” were “weapons …threats made, in some instances threats of death or of serious harm, and … quite significant proceeds from a number of offences”. However the same weapons, gun and crowbar were used in all offences and in all offences was the gun pointed at the employee present. In the offence the subject of counts 4 there was an express threat to shoot and in the offences the subject of counts 5 and 6 an express threat to kill. In the offence the subject of count 7 there was an express threat to “smash” the employee and the gun was held against his neck. Later his Honour identified the offences the subject of counts 1, 6 and 7 as “typical occasions” when amounts well in excess of a small amount were taken.
	
	
	His Honour then went on to compare the offences with the category of case that was the subject of the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; [1999] NSWCCA 111. His Honour drew attention to differences, some operating in one direction and some in others and reiterated that for “the typical case in the history of this matter, the appropriate sentence, is one of three years and six months”.
	
	
	His Honour then addressed a number of matters referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act inter alia observing:-
	


Under s 21A(3)(g) the offender is unlikely to re-offend. I note that in the cases of Faaoloii and Schaafhausen, Dr Furst’s view of this are guarded in the sense that he is not absolutely confident about the unlikelihood of re-offending, although as I noted when dealing with his reports, that he does indicate that such likelihood is certainly diminished by appropriate rehabilitation measures which will be included in the conditions of sentence. In those circumstances I regard this as a further mitigating factor.

The offender has good prospects of rehabilitation, whether by reason of age or otherwise (s 21A(3)(h)). Again this is a case of three very young offenders. The prospects of rehabilitation are good. Again, Dr Furst is guarded in regard to the first two or the three offenders but again his qualifications are themselves qualified by recognition of the likely benefit of appropriate rehabilitation measures. I accept on all of the evidence that there are good prospects of rehabilitation in the case of all three offenders.


	
	His Honour then accepted that all Respondents were remorseful and continued”:
	


For all of those reasons I have struck the sentence of the typical case at the lower end of the Henry range which, in my view, is the appropriate point at which to determine the sentence of all three offenders.


	
	His Honour then addressed the multiplicity of offences. He expressed the view that the offences of 7, 8 and 10 October were within such a short period of time that any sentences imposed for them should be served concurrently. He accepted a submission that there had then been time for reflection by the offenders and took the view that the offences committed on 15th to 20th October should be treated as a second group, the sentences for offences within this second group being also concurrent with each other but aggregated to some extent with the sentences imposed for offences within the first group. His Honour determined that the extent of aggregation should be 12 months.
	
	
	His Honour then adverted to the absence of Mr Faaoloii from the offences of 22 October and thought that the sentences for the offences of that date should be the subject of a further aggregation of 6 months. So it was that he arrived at the sentence of 5 years for Mr Schaafhausen and, subject to some further remarks, also for Mr Tuala.
	
	
	In those further remarks his Honour took the view there should be reduction, inter alia because Mr Tuala had commenced offending later than the others. So it was that Mr Tuala finished up with the same 4 years and 6 months sentence as Mr Faaoloii.
	
	
	Some other features of his Honour’s reasoning must be mentioned. After he imposed the aggregate sentence on Mr Faaoloii, and then made a finding of special circumstances, his Honour remarked, “I also take into account in the sentence I have imposed of the matters on Forms 1” (sic). After sentencing Mr Schaafhausen and also made a finding of special circumstances, his Honour remarked, “I have taken into account the matters of the Forms 1”. His Honour made no reference to Forms 1 or special circumstances when sentencing Mr Tuala even though the sentence he imposed required such a decision and reasons for it – see Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s44(2). His Honour had previously on a number of occasions recognised the existence of the Forms 1 but at no stage had complied with the terms of s 33.
	
	
	Each of the Forms 1 contains a printed statement, with variation of the offender and offence, to the effect:-
	


This is to certify that, in dealing with Charlton Reeves Schaafhausen for the offence of Robbery Armed with an offensive Weapon H56170321 [Count 2] of which the person has been found guilty, the Court has taken into account the offences admitted by the person numbered 1 in the list of the back of this document.”


	
	Immediately under that statement, each Form 1 has been dated 30 March 2016 and is signed by his Honour.
	
	
	The Court was also provided with the formal District Court records of the orders made and sentence warrants for each Respondent. These last mentioned documents contain statements as to the sentences imposed that differ from statements in the formal records and also differ from the statements of the sentences contained in his Honour’s remarks. The reason for the discrepancy, which should obviously never have occurred, is not apparent but nothing turns on it in these appeals.
	
	
	However, the terms of the formal records are significant. After recording the name of the particular offender and judge, the type of matter, date, court and appearances the documents proceed (I quote that relating to Mr Faaoloii by way of example):
	


You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years and 3 months commencing 24 October, 2014 and expiring on 23 January 2017. Balance of sentence to commence at the expiration of the NPP and expire on 2 April, 2019.

You will be eligible for release to parole on the expiration of the NPP period, subject to the supervision of Community Corrections with particular regard to...

I find special circumstances.

Take into account the matters on the Form Ones.

I recommend the attention of Corrective Services to the recommendations in Dr Furst’s report of 17/10/2015 in particular to...

Indicative Sentences:

Count 1   3 year 6 months

Count 2   3 year 6 months

Count 3   3 year 6 months

Count 4   3 year 6 months

Count 5   3 year 6 months

Count 6   3 year 6 months


	
	The document then bears the signature of Phegan ADCJ.
	
	
	Other matters to be noted are that the offenders were all arrested on 24 October 2014 and have been in custody ever since. Each entered his plea at the Campbelltown Local Court on 10 June 2015. They were sentenced on 30 March 2016. The Notice of Appeal was lodged on 29 April 2016. Mr Schaafhausen’s non-parole period is due to expire on 23 April next year. The non-parole period for the others is due to expire on 23 January next year.
	
	
	The Crown has advanced 4 grounds of appeal:
	



	
	His Honour erred in his approach to indicative sentences when imposing an aggregate sentence.
	
	
	His Honour erred in failing to take into account or failing to properly take into account the offences on the Forms 1.
	
	
	His Honour erred in his approach to assessing the seriousness of the offending and the Henry guideline.
	
	
	The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate.
	


Ground 1


	
	His Honour erred in his approach to indicative sentences when imposing an aggregate sentence.
	



	
	Section 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides, inter alia:
	


(2)   A court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under this section on an offender must indicate to the offender, and make a written record of, the following:

(a)   the fact that an aggregate sentence is being imposed.

(b)   the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence (after taking into account such matters as are relevant under Part 3 or any other provision of this Act) had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence.

      (3)   …

(5)   An aggregate sentence of imprisonment is not invalidated by a failure to comply with this section.


	
	In Khawaja v R [2014] NSWCCA 80 at [18], with the concurrence of Leeming JA and Button J, I remarked:
	


Section 53A(2) is clearly directed to ensuring transparency in the process of imposing an aggregate sentence and in that connection, imposing a discipline on sentencing judges.


	
	The passage I have set out above from his Honour’s remarks commencing “it would in my view be inappropriate” makes it inescapable that his Honour elected not to accept that discipline and made a deliberate decision not to comply with the requirement of s 53A.
	
	
	In so concluding, I am not unconscious that there are passages in his Honour’s remarks that can be said to argue in the opposite direction but his Honour’s selection of 3 years and 6 months as appropriate to “the more serious instances” without any statement of the sentence appropriate to less serious instances or consideration of a difference in sentence between those offences that had a Form 1 offence taken into account and those that did not confirm the conclusion I have drawn from his Honour’s unambiguous statement. Certainly his Honour had in mind that a sentence of 3 years and 6 months was appropriate for a “typical case” of the Respondents’ offences considered individually but, despite the simplicity of doing so, nowhere does his Honour indicate to the offender(s) “the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence … had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence”. Given his Honour had earlier referred to some offences as “more serious” it is impossible to regard all of the offences as within his reference to “typical”.
	
	
	And while a “failure” to comply with s 53A is stipulated not to invalidate a sentence that reflects that failure, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that a deliberate decision to disregard the dictates of the statutory provision is such a departure from what the law requires that the sentence imposed in consequence is one imposed otherwise than in accordance with law.
	
	
	This conclusion is unaffected by the contents of the formal District Court record. The references therein to “indicative Sentences” are not an accurate reflection of what his Honour said in his sentencing remarks.
	
	
	It is an elementary principle of sentencing that it is to be done in open court and the reasons for the sentence imposed then delivered – see R v CJP [2003] NSWCCA 187 and the cases therein cited. It is inconsistent with that principle for a judge to record something different from what occurs in the formal proceedings. The inherent power which exists to alter a judgment after it is delivered extends only to alterations that do not affect the substance – see R v Glyn Morgan Jones; R v Anthony Hili (No 2) [2010] NSWCCA 195 - and, even assuming the section applied, there was no attempt made to use the statutory power conferred by s 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	There is a further matter to which I should refer. Section 101A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides:
	


A failure to comply with a provision of this Act may be considered by an appeal court in any appeal against sentence even if this Act declares that the failure to comply does not invalidate the sentence.


	
	The effect of this section was considered in R v Tuncbilek [2004] NSWCCA 139 at [33] and Panetta v R [2016] NSWCCA 85 at [35]-[37]. Those cases have made it clear that, in the event of an appeal, a “failure to comply” does not have the effect of validating a sentence affected by that failure.
	
	
	I would uphold this ground.
	


Ground 2


	
	His Honour erred in failing to take into account or failing to properly take into account the offences on the Forms 1.
	



	
	So far as is presently relevant, ss 32, 33 and 35 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provide:
	


32(1)   In any proceedings for an offence (the principal offence), the prosecutor may file in the court a document that specifies other offences with which the offender has been charged, but not convicted, being offences that the offender has indicated are offences that the offender wants the court to take into account when dealing with the offender for the principal offence.

33(1)   When dealing with the offender for the principal offence, the court is to ask the offender whether the offender wants the court to take any further offences into account in the dealing with the offender for the principal offence.

33(2)   The court may take a further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence:


	
	(a)   if the offender:
	
	
	   (i)   admits guilt to the further offence, and
	
	
	(ii)   indicates that the offender wants the court to take the further offence into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence, and
	
	
	(b)   if, in all of the circumstances, the court considers it appropriate to do so.
	


35(1)   If a further offence is taken into account under this Division:

(a)   the Court is to certify, on the list of additional charges, that the further offence has been taken into account, and

(b)   …


	
	Again the objects of the statutory provisions include ensuring transparency in the sentencing process and, in that connection, imposing a discipline on sentencing judges. Although by the certification by his Honour on the Form Ones, his Honour appears to have complied with the requirements of s 35, it seems to me that the only proper conclusion from his remarks at the time of sentencing that I have set out is that he did not do so. Expressly, in the case of Mr Faaoloii, and impliedly in the case of Mr Schaafhausen, his Honour took the Form 1 offences into account in his determination of the aggregate sentences. In the case of Mr Tuala, his Honour did not take the Form 1 offences into account at all or, more probably, did so in the same way as he had for Mr Faaoloii and simply forgot to mention the fact. Even if the terms of the legislation do not, the decision in Doumit v R [2011] NSWCCA 134 at [14] makes it clear that a Form 1 offence is to be taken into account for a principal offence and not in respect of a total term for multiple offences.
	
	
	In that connection there are the passages I have quoted that appear after the imposition of sentences on Messrs Faaolii and Schaafhausen. Secondly, having reached the conclusion by comparison with the guideline in R v Henry that an appropriate sentence for what he referred to as a typical case in the history of the matter was one of 3 years and 6 months, his Honour never compared such a case with one that had a Form 1 to be taken into account also and indeed never referred to what might be the impact of a Form 1 offence on any one of the Respondents’ offences.
	
	
	I do not need to rely on it but the bald statement in the formal District Court record, “Take into account the matters on the Form 1” tends to support the view that it was not in relation to particular offences that his Honour took the Form 1 offences into account.
	
	
	I would uphold this ground.
	


Ground 3

His Honour erred in his approach to assessing the seriousness of the offending and the Henry guideline.


	
	In R v Henry this Court indicated that sentences for offences having seven characteristics nominated (at [162]) should generally fall within the range of 4 to 5 years. The characteristics were:
	


(i)   Young offender with no or little criminal history;

(ii)   Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury;

(iii)   Limited degree of planning;

(iv)   Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof;

(v)   Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver;

(vi)   Small amount taken;

(vii)   Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.


	
	The Court recognised that aggravating and mitigating factors would justify a sentence below or above the range.
	
	
	Subsequently in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 the Court indicated that reflected in the R v Henry guideline was a discount of the order of 10% for an offender’s guilty plea. In Thomson and Houlton itself the Court held that that was an appropriate discount for a late plea but a discount of 25% might well be appropriate for a plea at an early stage.
	
	
	In the comparison which he made Phegan ADCJ recognised that the Respondents’ offences fulfilled the first, third, fourth, fifth and seventh of the characteristics nominated in R v Henry. While acknowledging the crowbar, but also that it was generally not used to threaten the victims, his Honour took the view that the weapons contemplated in R v Henry were more serious than those used by the Respondents but that some of the amounts taken were well in excess of a “small amount”. His Honour expressed the view that these factors tended to cancel each other out and accordingly the more serious of the Respondents’ offences fell within the guidelines. Then, adverting to R v Thompson and Houlton and his view that the Respondents were entitled to a 25% discount, his Honour concluded that the sentence appropriate for what he regarded as one of the Respondents’ “more serious” offences was a sentence of 3 years and 6 months.
	
	
	So far as that comparison goes, it was in my view unexceptionable. The criticism made of his Honour’s remarks was that his Honour then gave further weight to the Respondents’ good character, their youth and the impact on the Respondents that a sentence fully reflecting the totality of offending would have, and ignored the fact that the offences were committed in company (a matter recognised in R v Henry as possibly aggravating) and, to a large extent, ignored that each offence was not isolated.
	
	
	Certainly the fact that the offences were committed in company, particularly company made apparent to the victims, was an aggravating feature. On the other hand it must be remembered that R v Henry is but a guideline and the purposes of sentencing are not simply to punish but also to promote the rehabilitation of the offender. In the exercise of the wide sentencing discretion which judges have, a sentencing court is required to make an assessment of the offender and the description in R v Henry of “young offender with no or little criminal history” is so broad that it cannot be definitive of what, vis-à-vis the offender the court is to consider. It was entirely proper for his Honour to have regard to the Respondents’ good character, their youth and the impact on them of a sentence more proportionate to the totality of their offending. Whether his Honour placed undue weight on these factors is more appropriately dealt with in consideration of the next ground.
	
	
	I would reject this ground.
	


Ground 4

The sentence imposed is manifestly inadequate.


	
	There is no doubt that his Honour derived a very favourable view of the Respondents. The age of the Respondents means that each has an opportunity of re-establishing a worthwhile life for himself and there is no doubt that the longer they are imprisoned, the more that opportunity is liable to be reduced. They were entitled to have taken into account the fact that, prior to about the beginning of 2014, each had led a blameless life.
	
	
	However, the interests of the Respondents are not the only ones to be considered and it was in an attempt to balance the competing interests that arise in the case of armed robbery offences that the guidelines in R v Henry were stated.
	
	
	And one has only to reflect on what was said in R v Henry to reach the conclusion that this ground is made out. I have indicated that I regard his Honour’s derivation from that case of a sentence of 3 years and 6 months for one offence as reasonable and acknowledged that there were some further matters to be taken into account. However, Messrs Faaoloii and Tuala committed not one but ten offences and Mr Schaafhausen committed thirteen. In a number of these, victims were threatened with death and must have been terrified. No matter what the subjective circumstances of the Respondents, against these matters sentences of respectively 4 years and 6 months and 5 years were manifestly inadequate.
	
	
	His Honour’s errors were compounded by the non-parole periods he fixed. At 50% of the head sentences they were, if not unprecedented, extraordinarily lenient and the result manifestly inadequate. About, or a little more than, 25% of a proper head sentence would still have provided adequate time on parole.
	
	
	There can be no doubt that one of the errors his Honour made was to group the sentences as he did and indicate that the sentences within each group would be concurrent. In that connection remarks in Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53 at [66]-[67] may usefully be quoted:
	


66.   There may be circumstances in which such an approach is appropriate. However, I do not consider that it is appropriate in a case such as the present where the number of offences is not so numerous that to deal with them individually would be cumbersome. Indeed, in a case such as the present, involving eight offences, six of which were committed on separate occasions, there is a danger in failing to deal with each offence separately in that the criminality involved in the individual offences may be overlooked or become lost in the attempt to assess the totality of the seriousness of the offences.

67.   As was pointed out in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610; [HCA 57 “totality is considered after the individual sentences are imposed. In Pearce, McHugh, Hayne and Callinan said (at [45]):

   “A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.”


	
	Whether intended or not, the practical effect and the clear message of his Honour’s approach were that no punishment was being imposed for the second and subsequent offences in each group. To take by way of example the offences on 7, 8 and 10 October. Whatever sentence was appropriate for the offence of 7 October, the further offending on 8 and 10 October required some increase in sentence. The fact that the three offences occurred within a period of a few days did not justify proceeding in effect as if the later offences had not occurred. On those further days more damage was done to premises, more property was stolen and more persons were threatened. The criminality in those subsequent offences was effectively ignored and went unpunished.
	
	
	Similar error affects the other grouping of offences by his Honour. This ground is made out.
	


Other Matters


	
	Even though in a Crown appeal error is shown, the Court has a discretion whether to interfere, the onus being on the Crown to show that that discretion should be exercised. In this case the Court was urged not to do so. It was submitted that the principles of sentencing by way of aggregate sentences and for robberies are well known and there is no need for further instruction by way of “principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons”. This case demonstrates either that such principles are not well known or, for whatever reason, not adhered to. I am satisfied that the errors in the sentencing of the Respondents are so gross that the only appropriate course for this Court to adopt is to allow the appeals and re-sentence.
	
	
	In so doing it is well to bear in mind the remarks of Sully J endorsed by this Court in R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130 at [46]:
	


… (there) is the need to ensure public confidence in the administration of criminal justice; and, in particular, to ensure that there does not emerge in the community at large a perception that there is not all that much to choose between the person who commits one or two offences, and the person who commits six or seven offences, for the reason that somehow or other they all manage to finish up with effective sentences between or among which there is hardly anything in practical terms to choose.

It needs to be clearly understood by all concerned that a person who commits a deliberate series of discrete offences, - and the present applicant’s case, is a good example of this kind, - he must not be left with the idea that by intoning references to the principle of totality as though it were some magic mantra, he can escape effective punishment for the offences which follow successively one upon another throughout the whole course of a studied and deliberate course of criminal behaviour.


	
	If this Court is to impose an aggregate sentence as, in my view, is appropriate, it must comply with the terms of s 53A. The sentences I would impose for each offence were I to impose separate sentences are:
	


Mr Schaafhausen

Counts 1, 4, 5, 8 – imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months.

Counts 2, 3, 6 and 7 – imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months.

Mr Faaoloii

Counts 1, 4, 5 – imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months.

Counts 2, 3 and 6 – imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months.

Mr Tuala

Counts 4, 5 – imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months.

Counts 3, 6, 7 and 8 – imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months.


	
	The reason for the longer period for some counts is that they relate to offences where a Form 1 matter was taken into account. Of course there were also other differences, such as the value of what was stolen, but in the circumstances I have chosen not to differentiate on that ground.
	
	
	Appreciating that the principle of totality precludes simply adding together whatever sentences are appropriate for each of a Respondent’s offences, nevertheless the ultimate sentence should reflect some punishment for each offence. I would propose as an aggregate sentence for each offender one calculated by adding to the period of 3 years and 6 months Phegan ADCJ determined a period of about 6 months for each offence charged other than the first. Logic suggests the offences in respect of which a Form 1 offence was taken into account should attract higher increments as an incident of this aggregation but given the magnitude of the result in any event I would not make this differentiation.
	
	
	The result would be a head sentence for Mr Schaafhausen of 7 years and for Messrs Faaoloii and Tuala of 6 years.
	
	
	Interference with the non-parole periods is more complicated because, particularly in the case of Messrs Faaoloii and Tuala, the non-parole periods Phegan ADCJ imposed are soon to expire. Certainly the Respondents have known for some time of the Crown appeals but no doubt have otherwise been expecting to be released to parole in January of next year. They are still young and not hardened criminals and to be informed at this stage that release is to be postponed for a substantial period would undoubtedly be traumatic and might well interfere with their rehabilitation.
	
	
	In the result and notwithstanding that I regard the non-parole periods imposed by Phegan ADCJ as also manifestly inadequate, I would propose that in the exercise of this Court’s discretion, there be no interference with those periods. If the Respondents conduct themselves properly, those periods will have served a purpose. If the Respondents do not, then the increased full terms that I propose will operate.
	
	
	In proposing as I have, I am conscious that the non-parole periods will be even smaller proportions of the total sentences than in the case of the sentences under appeal.
	
	
	However, the factor that principally inspires my view that there should be no interference with the non-parole periods – the likely imminent occurrence of the Respondents’ release on parole – see Green v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462; [2011] HCA 49 at [43] – has no significant bearing on the length of the appropriate total sentences. Thus it is that in the exercise of this Court’s discretion in Crown appeals, I have regarded it as proper to increase the total sentences but not the non-parole periods.
	
	
	I propose the following orders:-
	


Mr Schaafhausen

(i)   Crown appeal allowed;

(ii)   Set aside the sentence imposed by Phegan ADCJ on 30 March 2016, and in lieu thereof;

(iii)   Sentence the Respondent to a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 24 October 2014 together with a balance of term of 4 years and 6 months years commencing on 24 April 2017;

(iv)   Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Respondent shall become eligible for parole, 24 April 2017.

Mr Faaoloii

(i)   Crown appeal allowed;

(ii)   Set aside the sentence imposed by Phegan ADCJ on 30 March 2016, and in lieu thereof;

(iii)   Sentence the Respondent to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 24 October 2014 together with a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 24 January 2017;

(iv)   Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Respondent shall become eligible for parole, 24 January 2017.

Mr Tuala

(i)   Crown appeal allowed;

(ii)   Set aside the sentence imposed by Phegan ADCJ on 30 March 2016, and in lieu thereof;

(iii)   Sentence the Respondent to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 24 October 2014 together with a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 24 January 2017;

(iv)   Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Respondent shall become eligible for parole, 24 January 2017.

3006044,R v Torres [2016] NSWDC 318,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: The offences for which I must sentence the offender, Antonio Torres, were committed some time ago. The explanation for the delay is simple; Mr Torres absconded and lived overseas for a number of years before being extradited back to Australia.
	
	
	The offender certainly cannot be rewarded for having delayed his sentencing proceedings in that way, but on the other hand I must sentence him as he is today, not as he was at the time he should have been sentenced many years ago.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court to two offences of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of prohibited drug. One of those offences concerned a manufacture at Lansvale and another at Hornsby.
	
	
	The statement of agreed facts tendered by the Crown was mis-named, it was a summary of evidence, not a statement of facts. I have had occasion in the past to criticise documents in the form that were tendered to me today, and I will continue to do so in the future. I am not the only one who has complained about statements of facts in that form. What happens is that a great deal of irrelevant information is recorded, precise times are given, registration numbers of motor vehicles are given, telephone numbers are given, all of which has the effect of obscuring rather than revealing what an offender actually did.
	
	
	As part of the tender bundle the Crown tendered statements of facts tendered before other Judges in relation to co-offenders. Those statements of facts did accurately summarise what those offenders did. It is disappointing that I was not given the same courtesy as those other sentencing Judges were.
	
	
	With the assistance of the Crown, who did not prepare the statement of facts she tendered, I was able to identify the criminality of the offender’s conduct. He was involved in the Lansvale manufacture by assisting in the sourcing of finance to buy pseudoephedrine, a drug that was needed in order to ultimately produce methyl amphetamine. Mr Torres told one of his co‑offenders how to purchase it, and that it should be maintained in liquid form. He had thus an organisational role in relation to the Lansvale manufacture. In relation to the Hornsby manufacture his role is somewhat unclear. The only thing the Crown knows is that he was at the premises where the drugs were manufactured and of course his fingerprints were found there.
	
	
	The offender had a far from ideal upbringing. Mr Johnston, who appears for him, tendered today a letter from his uncle which sets out the offender’s background, the abandonment of him and his brothers by their mother, and a lack of any significant effective parenting. In those circumstances it is perhaps understandable that the offender would gravitate towards organisations which offered him friendship and support even if those organisations were heavily involved in illegal activities. The offender’s uncle summarised his background this way:
	


“Your Honour he has never had the love of a mother and a father, he has never had a stable family life and through all of this found it hard to belong anywhere and really struggled with life in general. The sense of belonging that comes about through membership of the organisations which Mr Torres joined was clearly attractive to him in those circumstances.”


	
	Since committing these offences there has been a significant change in the offender, that is why I said I would have to sentence him as the person he is today rather than as he was some time ago. Much of that change I am not going to refer to in these public remarks on sentence but the offender has provided a great deal of information of great value to law enforcement authorities which demonstrate a significant change in attitude towards authority, and a realisation that at 30 years of age he needs to move forward with his life in a law abiding way.
	
	
	The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. When I take into account his assistance and his plea I will impose upon him a sentence which is approximately 60% less than it would otherwise have been. I appreciate that is a very high level of discount. In my view, however, that appropriately reflects that offender’s assistance whilst still not breaching the underlying rule that a sentence ultimately imposed must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the objective circumstances of Mr Torres’ offending.
	
	
	I am required under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to specify how much of that discount is for future assistance. It is incredibly difficult to be in any way precise given the lack of information as to what is proposed for the future. Doing the best I can I will specify that 10% of that discount is for future assistance.
	
	
	The offender has plans for the future, plans to study, and plans to have his four year old son come to live with him. I am satisfied that he is remorseful, perhaps the best evidence of that is pleading guilty to one of these offences when the only evidence of his role and his involvement in one of the manufactures consists of a couple of fingerprints located at the premises.
	
	
	The offender has done eight months and 18 days in custody solely referrable to these offences. In addition he has served a sentence in South Australia for unrelated matters where it appears that his release was delayed by a number of months, perhaps because of the need for him to be extradited to New South Wales to face sentence today. I will start the sentence I will imposed upon Mr Torres eight months and 18 days prior to today and take into account that delay in release in determining the length of that sentence.
	
	
	It is clear that a custodial sentence must be imposed. The Crown submitted that and Mr Johnston did not seek to submit otherwise. The question really facing me is whether Mr Torres needs to be returned to custody to spend more time in gaol before release on parole. I will explain my process of reasoning in reaching the conclusion that I did. Having taken into account the 60% discount and the eight months and 18 days pre-sentence custody I formulated what I believe to be the appropriate sentence. I have allowed a finding of special circumstances and came up with a result that would see Mr Torres return to custody for a matter of only a few months.
	
	
	Recognising that sentencing is not a mathematically precise activity, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to impose upon Mr Torres a sentence which will see his non‑parole period expire today such that he does not need to be returned to custody but will spend a significant period on parole.
	
	
	For each offence I impose sentences as follows.
	
	
	The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eight months and 18 days to date from 8 June 2015. The non-parole period will expire today and I order that he is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence for each matter of two years and nine months. As will be clear I made a finding of special circumstances in his favour they being his prospects for rehabilitation, and the need to assist Mr Torres in the future to avoid him relapsing into committing further offences.

		25 November 2016",2016-02-25 00:00:00,NSW District Court
3006045,R v Omar Elomar [2016] NSWDC 319,"Judgment


	
	HER HONOUR: This is the offender Mr Elomar is before the Court for sentence on two offences of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth. They are two counts in an indictment dated 26 June 2015. These offences had been committed to this Court for trial. The offender was to initially stand trial jointly with two other offenders, which was due to commence on 4 June 2014.
	
	
	On 6 June 2014 he pleaded guilty to Count 1 in that joint indictment and his application for a separate trial was granted. His trial was listed to commence on 29 June 2015. On that day he pleaded guilty to a second offence namely count 2 in the indictment. The two charges are both contrary to s 135.1(3) of the Criminal Code and each carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.
	
	
	Specifically the charges are the following:
	



	
	Count 1. That between about 25 November 2011 and 24 November 2011 at Sydney he participated in an agreement to falsely represent that container number SUDU6605852, contained ceramic tiles, with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss of Customs duty to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.
	
	
	Count 2. That between about 20 November and 21 December 2011 at Sydney he participated in an agreement to falsely represent that container, KLFU1815083 contained wet paper towel, with the intention of dishonestly causing the loss of Customs duty to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.
	



	
	When sentencing him for these two offences the offender asks that I take into account one additional offence, also being an offence of dishonestly causing the loss to the Commonwealth contrary to the s 131.1 (3) of the Criminal Code. Specifically that is a charge, sequence 19, that between about 30 December 2011 and 7 January 2012 at Sydney he participated in an agreement to falsely represent that container number HDMU2571422 contained glass and aluminium frames, with the intention of dishonestly causing the loss of Customs duty to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.
	
	
	The facts of all of the offences are to be gleaned from a document entitled statement of facts. It is a 20‑page document which is not a statement of facts, but rather a summary of evidence relied on by the Crown to prove the offences charged against the offender. Once he pleaded guilty to these charges, this material was no longer required to be tendered on sentence, and yet it was. Even that part of this document which purports to set out what the offender actually did is not in fact a summary or statement of relevant facts which would enable a sentencing judge to assess both what happened and also the role that this particular offender played.
	
	
	The District Court of New South Wales is an extremely busy court, and as at August 2016 it is impossible to obtain a sentence date in the Sydney Registry of this Court before January 2017. This means that many people remain in custody on remand, bail refused, awaiting sentence after they have pleaded. Both the Crown and the defence in my view owe a duty to the Court to make the material tendered to a sentencing judge as straightforward and brief as possible to enable an appropriate sentence to be set as quickly as possible. Requiring the sentencing judge in this matter to read 20 pages of complicated circumstantial evidence which would have been relevant to convict this offender, but which is not necessary for a sentence when he has in fact pleaded guilty, has only added to the delay here.
	
	
	The burden in my view falls on both sides of the bar table. If the Crown either does not or will not prepare a summary document, no more than about three pages, then in my view and in my experience of well-run sentences, it is incumbent on defence to do so and to provide it to the Court.
	
	
	The response to this criticism, made by me many times over a number of years, and by a number of other judges in this Court over many years, is that the material is required so that a sentencing judge can determine the role of the particular offender. That is not so in this matter in my view. Once this offender pleaded guilty, his role was easy to ascertain from an examination of what he did. There is unlikely to have been any real dispute about that, but even if there were, that should not have stopped the Crown from tendering a document which summarises the role from the Crown’s perspective, and if the defence wished to dispute that, then the defence could have had appropriate evidence tendered.
	
	
	Equally the Court has heard criticism from the defence over many years that attempts by them to summarise the facts, in a way which is actually helpful to a sentencing judge, are thwarted by the Crown. This may or may not be accurate, but even if it is so, that does not prevent the defence nonetheless from preparing a fair and proper summary of the facts and tendering it to the Court. Provided it is an accurate and fair summary, it is extremely unlikely that any sentencing judge would reject it. Sentences would be determined more quickly. People like this offender, Mr Elomar, would know their fate earlier and offenders waiting in custody, bail refused, without access to programs, would be sentenced more quickly. This request has been made by judges of this Court for many years. It seems to fall on deaf ears, but it is incumbent on the legal profession to start taking notice and to start fulfilling their role as officers of the Court, which ultimately can only be of benefit to their clients whether they be prosecuting authorities or offenders.
	
	
	With that in mind however, and doing the best I can from these so called facts, and I acknowledge substantially assisted by the judgment of Judge Bozic in relation to the co-offender, I accept that there was in place at the relevant time a joint taskforce between the Australian Federal Police, the New South Wales Police, Australian Customs and Border Protection, the New South Wales Crime Commission and the Australian Crime Commission targeting serious and organised criminal activity involved in the international sea cargo terminal in New South Wales, specifically focusing on criminal activity involving goods under the control of Customs.
	
	
	This task force identified a criminal syndicate involving the large scale receipt of tobacco, cigarettes and counterfeit cigarettes through Port Botany in Sydney. The offender, Omar Elomar was part of this syndicate. During the relevant period the offender was the proprietor of K and O Freight, which was registered with the Customs integrated cargo system, which is the portal through which industry can check the status of imported containers. This system has been in place since January 2009. The offender was a freight forwarder who was also registered on this same system as an air cargo reporter, an exporter, an exporter agent, an importer and a sea cargo reporter.
	
	
	During the period covered by all of the counts relevant to this sentence, the offender used a methodology known as piggybacking to commit the offences. Piggy backing is able to occur because Customs uses a profiling method whereby they identify importers with a good record of frequent importations of containers, properly documented, and where the appropriate Customs duty is paid on the properly and lawfully declared content of the containers. As a result these identified importers are assigned a lower risk by Customs and are less likely to have their importations stopped and examined.
	
	
	Importers must lodge full import declarations to Customs and the piggybacking method involves those like this offender falsely and dishonestly attributing the details of one of these companies identified as low risk by Customs to disguise the true nature of the importer and the goods imported, thus avoiding the payment of appropriate Customs duty. All of these three offences, the two substantive offences, and the schedule offence, involve containers of either cigarettes or loose tobacco imported into Australia by companies not in fact given or entitled to these low risk profiles by Customs, but which were disguised as being importations by one of these legitimate companies, positively profiled by Customs and disguised as being goods which they were not, and on which much lower duties would have been payable, as opposed to the very significant duties which were payable on the importation of cigarettes and tobacco.
	
	
	The offender on my finding played a significant role in the commission of these offences. The relevant specific facts for all counts are these, dealing first with count 2, because it is chronologically the first. This involves a container allegedly imported by Pakplast, container KLFU1815083, which left Singapore on 30 November 2011 and arrived in Australia on 15 December 2011. The records for it show that the consignee was Pakplast Pty Limited, a company in Smithfield, New South Wales, and the consignment was wet paper towel. The documents purporting to indicate this were not legitimate. The consignment was in fact stopped by Customs and examined on 19 November 2011, and found to contain approximately 2,899 kilograms of loose leaf tobacco with an estimate $1,249,295 of Australian duty evaded with the subsequent loss to the Commonwealth of that amount. The cargo was seized by Customs.
	
	
	To facilitate this offence the offender had many telephone conversations with the co-offender, Mr Masri, to discuss the impending importation. They used coded language in these calls in an effort to conceal the true nature of them. He prepared necessary importation documentation in the name of Pakplast containers, dishonestly purporting that they were importing a shipment of wet paper towels. This company had no knowledge of the importation. Hewas able to do that because of his knowledge, as a freight forwarder, that this company was less likely to be expected by Customs because they had been positively profiled by Customs. He used false names and identities as contact persons for these businesses to respond to the inquiries which would be made to enable the import duties to be paid so that the shipment could clear Customs. There were two others involved with him, one of them was the co‑accused Masri. The other was a person not apparently charged because it would appear he withdrew from the agreement once he realised that there was dishonesty and illegitimacy involved.
	
	
	The offender made false statements in paperwork and arranged for the payments of costs associated with the importation process, and himself attended shipping companies to lodge the necessary paperwork. He intended to take possession of the container after it was released by Customs.
	
	
	This is a brief summary gleaned from the 20 pages, assisted by the written submissions made on behalf of the Crown, of the tasks he undertook which constitute his role in relation to this offence, and as will become clear for the other offences as well.
	
	
	In relation to this Pakplast container, which is count 2, he undertook this role over a period of about a month between November and December 2011. It appears to me that it is also apparent from the intercepted calls that he played a more organisational and significant role than did Masri.
	
	
	Count 1 involves a container in the name of Alpha Tiles. It was container SUDU6605852 which arrived in Sydney on 19 December 2011. The offender used the same piggybacking method, again acting with the co-offender Masri, to make it appear that this container had been imported by Alpha Tiles and Ceramics Pty Limited which was also a legitimate company positively profiled by Customs. He dishonestly created paperwork purporting that in fact it was a container of tiles and ceramics. Alpha Tiles and Ceramics knew nothing about this importation and was not in fact connected with it.
	
	
	The container was seized by Customs on 23 December 2011 and found to contain approximately 8.8 million sticks of Golden Kings brand cigarettes on which an estimated $3,033,360 would have been levied by way of duty, which was thus evaded, giving rise to a subsequent loss to the Commonwealth. This cargo was also seized by Customs.
	
	
	Without going through the details again, I accept from the facts that the offender used the same methodology which I referred to in relation to the Pakplast container, including the use of fictitious entities as contacts, creating false commercial invoice packing lists and packing declarations to provide to Customs through an agent, so that the necessary importation declaration could be lodged on which duty would be levied.
	
	
	There would appear to have been little if any difference between the way in which he committed this offence and the way in which he committed the earlier offence relating to the Pakplast container.
	
	
	The offence to be taken into account on the schedule involved a container in the name of Alternative Glass. The offender asks that when sentencing for the two substantive offences I take into account this offence, which is sequence 19, on a schedule. It is an offence of an identical type, but committed during the period 30 December 2011 to 17 January 2012.
	
	
	Container HDMU2571422 arrived in Sydney on 11 January 2012 from Singapore. It did not contain, as the relevant documentation purported, glass and aluminium frames, but in fact contained 3,680,000 Supermatch brand cigarettes and 1,000,000 Asia Cup brand cigarettes, on which an estimated duty of $1,613,196 was payable, which was evaded, with a subsequent loss to the Commonwealth. This shipment was also forfeited to the Commonwealth.
	
	
	For this offence too, over the relevant period, the offender acted in exactly the same way as for the earlier two offences, using the piggyback method, purporting that the container was, in fact, from a legitimate company and contained glass and aluminium frames. Again he used fictitious entities as contacts. He organised for another to pay the import freight charges on the dishonestly described contents. He made false statements in an attempt to secure the release of the container and intended to take possession of it after release, together with the co-offender Masri and others.
	
	
	So it seems to me that that is a summary of the three offences, a summary of the offender’s role and more than sufficient to enable an assessment of the objective criminality to be made.
	
	
	Altogether these three containers contained 2,899 kilograms of loose leaf tobacco and 13,480,000 cigarettes, on which a total of approximately $5,895,851 ought to have been paid to the Commonwealth by way of duty, but which was evaded, because of the offender’s participation in the agreement in each case to purport that they were legitimate importations of goods other than what they were, imported by legitimate companies, using the piggybacking method.
	
	
	In July 2012 search warrants were executed at various places and on 17 July 2012 the offender was arrested at his home. He engaged in a record of interview, but made no comment in relation to the charges. Police located a mobile phone at his premises which indicated a connection to his commission of the offences. They also located some documents connecting him to the unlawfully obtained documents relevant to the Pakplast importation in his home. He used these unlawfully obtained documents to create the other false documents necessary to commit count 1.
	
	
	He was in custody bail refused from between 17 July 2012 and 15 August 2012 when he was released to bail, that is 30 days. He also spent nine days in custody in April 2015, for what I understand to be unrelated offences. In determining a commencement date for any sentence that might be imposed I would backdate the sentence to 39 days before today, taking it back to 27 June 2016. I am conscious that in doing so nine of those days apparently relate to some other matter, not the offences before me. I do so in any event and if, in the future, there might be any subsequent sentence handed down in the Local Court or elsewhere, the sentencing magistrate or judge could take into account the fact that I have, when setting the appropriate commencement date for this sentence, take into account every day that this offender has spent in custody since being charged for this offence. Any subsequent sentencing judge or magistrate could then determine the commencement date of any future sentence, taking into account issues of totality.
	
	
	There are matters to be noted in relation to these sentences. The first is that this offender is not being sentenced for the importation of these goods and is not charged with that offence. This sentence must proceed on the basis of the offence with which he has, in fact, been charged, which is for causing a loss to the Commonwealth dishonestly. It was by the use of the piggybacking method, it is complicated and there is considerable planning involved. The maximum penalty for the offences, however, is 5 years. It is in my view, however, a very serious example of such an offence, very much towards the top of the range of offences capable of being charged under this section.
	
	
	The reason for that finding is the following: the methodology being used is complex; there is considerable planning involved in the commission of the offences; each of them is committed over a period of about a month; overall the offending is for about 47 days; the amount of duty evaded is extremely large which is a potential loss to the Commonwealth of a significant amount. This offender played a very significant role in the commission of these offences and, in fact, a pivotal role in the commission of these offences. He used the identities of three legitimate companies. He undermined a system which attempts to streamline importation. He committed these offences for financial gain, albeit it might be that he intended to pay off a drug debt with that money, but nonetheless he committed the offence for financial gain.
	
	
	Overall it is a serious example of offences capable of being charged under this section. It is, however, I note an offence capable of being dealt with in the Local Court where the jurisdictional limit for each offence would be two years. It is not, however, an offence appropriately dealt in that Court, because of the large sums involved and for other reasons. In my view, only a term of imprisonment would be sufficient to recognise the seriousness of this offending. That would also be necessary to send a strong message of general deterrence in relation to these offences.
	
	
	General deterrence is very important in sentencing for offences such of this. The cost of investigating offences such as these is high. The duty evaded was huge and if these goods had been legitimately brought into Australia there would have arguably been a benefit to the community by the payment of these legitimate duties.
	
	
	Further, the profiling used by Customs means that the clearance of imported goods can be done more speedily than if every single container imported had to be stopped and inspected. Offences such as this, which take advantage of these sorts of systems, mean that these systems designed to speed up the process are less likely to be used, which ultimately slows down legitimate business.
	
	
	These are pleas of guilty and it is, therefore, appropriate to recognise the extent to which they indicate a willingness to facilitate the interests of justice. They were not entered early. As I have said, the plea to count 2 was entered on 4 June at a callover once the matter had been committed for trial and on the first day of the trial, which was meant to be a joint trial involving this offender and two others. He pleaded guilty to count 2 and was successful in his application for a trial alone for the remaining offence. The plea to the remaining count was not entered until 29 June 2015, which was to be the first day of the trial of the offender alone. Both indicate some willingness to facilitate the interests of justice, because the evidence to prove his guilt was complicated, and so he has ensured a conviction for these offences.
	
	
	However, the Crown case, albeit a complicated circumstantial case, was nonetheless strong against him, depending on a large number of intercepted calls and including the finding of documents in his possession linked to the offending. They are facts to take into account in determining his willingness to assist the interests of justice, but do not, in my view, significantly minimise the appropriate sentences here.
	
	
	The offender has a criminal record, which to some extent raises some issues in relation to his prospects of rehabilitation, but subject to other material to which I will refer soon.
	
	
	In September 2012 there are convictions for offences for similar type. Two offences are for representing the he was an authorised Customs broker, and two convictions for offences of intentionally altering or interfering with goods the subject of Customs control. Clearly enough he committed these offences also in his capacity as a freight forwarder. He was sentenced to, in my view, an unreasonably high fine for two of those offences in an amount of $802,000 in the Local Court, and more probably than not, the issues surrounding the extremely high quantum of that fine had some connection with his subsequent offending, together with his drug use at the time.
	
	
	In April 2014 he was convicted and sentenced on 21 offences of general dishonesty causing a risk of loss to the Commonwealth. Those offences had apparently occurred early between October 2008 and September 2009. He received terms of imprisonment in the District Court which were suspended pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914. All of these offences involved his acting dishonestly when dealing with Customs over a number of years. That is exactly what he was doing when committing the offences before me.
	
	
	None of the current offences however, appear to have been committed whilst he was subject to any of these other sentences. It may be that he was on a form of conditional liberty at the time he committed them, however, it is likely that he was subject to bail at the time he committed the offences, having apparently been charged with the offence of drive disqualified on 5 October 2011. That sentence, in fact, was sentenced on 4 April 2012, which was a s 12 suspended sentence of 12 months. The evidence, however, does not allow me to determine whether or not he was on bail at that time, but even if he were, it was in any event for a very different sort of offence which ought not operate as a significant circumstance of aggravation.
	
	
	He has a New South Wales criminal history, including offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, drug possession and obstructing a Commonwealth official. But from 2010 his criminal history seems to involve motor vehicle offences, albeit relatively serious ones, including five suspended driver, disqualified driver and the like. As I have said, the latter of these gave rise to a suspended sentence for 12 months from April 2012.
	
	
	His criminal record does not entitle him to any leniency. I accept that in the absence of any other evidence, his ongoing dishonesty over a long period when dealing with Customs, would require a specific deterrence in this sentence.
	
	
	Turning to the subjective circumstances surrounding him I accept He is now 33. He has been supervised by Community Corrections several times in relation to offences. Initially that was for a Community Service Order involving a motor vehicle offence. His response was, according to Community Corrections, borderline.
	
	
	Following that he was given a s 9 good behaviour bond for drive suspended and the response was favourable, to the extent that supervision was terminated early.
	
	
	The other bonds I have already mentioned. The Commonwealth suspended sentences were also subject to supervision, but that too was terminated early, because of his favourable response to supervision.
	
	
	He is Australian from a Lebanese background. He is single with no children. He is one of eight children and has been raised in a supportive and close family. He continues to have a positive relationship with his siblings and extended family. Following his father’s relatively recent death, approximately two years ago, he returned to live with his mother.
	
	
	He is fairly well educated, having a higher school certificate, and after that did a Diploma of International Trade, and from then on worked predominantly in the import/export business as the owner of an international freight forwarding company for nine years.
	
	
	He will be able to work in due course in the community. He has not been able to and will not be able to work in that field again because of these offences, but I accept that he is bright and smart enough to be able to obtain employment in due course. He continues to have the ongoing support of his family, which is good for his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I accept that he committed these offences for financial gain, but in the context of a drug addiction at the time. He started to use cocaine recreationally, but this increased when he started to make a good income from his business. At that stage in about 2010 he and his then girlfriend were spending about $1500 a week on cocaine. I accept more probably than not he amassed a debt of about $17,000 to his cocaine supplier at the time he started to commit these offences and that he saw this as a way to pay off that debt. Just how that was to occur is not the subject of any evidence and not anything that I can determine in any way. It is unlikely, in my view, that this was the only amount that he was likely to make out of his commission of these offences. The amount of organisation, the amount of duty evaded, the amount likely to be made by others down the track on the sale of these illegally imported cigarettes in the retail market indicate that this was a large scale operation likely to provide a significant amount of money to all of those involved. Having said that I accept that he was one of what was probably a significant number of people involved in this whole syndicate, ranging from those who imported it, those like him who facilitated the dishonest attribution of the cigarettes to legitimate companies as goods other than what they were, to those who would ultimately take possession of them, to those who would distribute them to retailers in Sydney and those retailers. The co-offender, Mr Masri, was a tobacconist, and no doubt along that chain somewhere. There is no evidence from which I could determine, however, what he was to gain or how much was to be made in total by this particular syndicate for these three importations, but I accept it was likely to be large and he was likely to make a considerable sum out of it.
	
	
	Since being arrested, and after four weeks in custody and his release on bail, I accept that he has turned his life around. He had, in fact, stopped using drugs for some time and he has not used drugs now for some considerable period of time.
	
	
	Since being released and following the death of his father, he became his mother’s night time carer. His sister provides that care during the day and he does at night. She is ill, and particularly since the death of her husband has a morbid fear of being alone.
	
	
	I accept that there will be considerable hardship to his family from his incarceration and I accept that he is playing a positive role in the care of his mother. The hardship to his family is not in my view however of sufficiently exceptional circumstances that would allow a reduction in the sentence from that which is otherwise necessary. I will take that into account, however, in determining an appropriate release date with a view to his being available in the community as soon as possible to resume that role.
	
	
	I accept that he is genuinely remorseful and contrite for having committed this offences. That has been expressed by him to the psychologist who provided a report. I also accept the opinion of Probation and Parole that he is a low risk of re-offending and is unlikely to benefit from a period of supervision.
	
	
	One of the most significant aspects relevant to the appropriate sentence here is the issue of parity or relativity. The co-offender, Masri, was sentenced by Judge Bozic on 17 October 2014 after trial. Therefore, he pleaded not guilty. However, he was only charged in relation to one of the offences which is before me for this offender and in fact it was the schedule offence involving the Alternatives Glass container. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 16 months with a recognizance release order of 10 months. His role, on my reading of Judge Bozic’s sentence, and in any event on my own finding from the material here, was less than that of the offender before me. Furthermore, the offender before me faces two substantive charges and the matter on which Mr Masri was sentenced is a schedule offence to be taken into account. The duty evaded by him in total is something like four times the duty the subject matter of the charge faced by Mr Masri. This offender before me has a longer criminal history than that of Mr Masri and, significantly, involving offences of dishonesty involving the Commonwealth and Customs.
	
	
	Whilst parity does not apply as such because the Masri’s sentence is not a substantive offence for this offender but rather a schedule offence, those facts need only be stated for it to be made clear that on the proper application of any relativity, the sentences for the offender before me must be longer than that for Mr Masri. He did plead guilty and that is a matter to be taken into account when looking at relativity, but it is a relatively limited impact given the timing of those pleas. The subjective case for Mr Masri would seem to be of relatively equal position to that of this offender and perhaps even more so given apparently that he was a father of six children who required him in the community as soon as possible.
	
	
	I have concluded that the sentences here for these offences are best dealt with by the imposition of aggregate sentences pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There are two offences but they are in my view part of the one overall criminal activity. Each of them however has a scheduled offence to be taken into account and given that it is an offence of exactly the same nature with over a million dollars itself in duty evaded, it must be taken into account in a meaningful way.
	
	
	With all of those matters taken into account, I have concluded that the overall sentence on an aggregate basis for each of these offences should be 2 years and 6 months. I will be setting a recognizance order of 18 months. There is no statutory length of sentence for a recognizance release order for a Commonwealth office. I set that date to take into account the need for the offender to be released as soon as possible into the community given his demonstrated rehabilitation and the need to be free to care for his mother. However, it seems to me that anything less than an 18 month period of time in custody would not reflect appropriate relativity with the co-offender Masri and would be properly perceived by him as unfair.
	
	
	I must indicate that it seems unnecessary and would be preferable if the offender before me did not have to go back into custody. I do not have any choice, however. The appropriate sentence would not allow any alternatives and even if this were a sentence of two years or less, it would not be appropriate for this sentence to be served by way of an ICO given the issues of relativity.
	
	
	All those involved in the criminal justice system know that in circumstances where there is demonstrated rehabilitation, that is likely to be undermined by a return to fulltime custody, but I have no alternative in these circumstances. Perhaps his early release to bail was one of the factors that ought to have been considered at the time. Four weeks in custody was never going to be enough to cover the criminality involved in the commission of these offences.
	
	
	I indicate the indicative sentence for each of these substantive offences would be two years overall.
	
	
	For those reasons I make the following formal orders. The offender is convicted for sequences 17 and 18. For each of them an aggregate sentence for each of 2 years and 6months with an aggregate recognizance release order of 18 months. The sentences will commence on 27 June 2016. So it will be an aggregate overall sentence of two years and six months for each commencing on 27 June 2016 and expiring on 26 December 2018. An aggregate recognizance release order of 18 months for each, 27 June 2016 expiring 26 December 2017. The recognizance formally in the sum of $500, conditions to be of good behaviour to come up for sentence at any time if called on for any breach committed during the term of the bond. I do not propose to set any further conditions of the recognizance release. I indicate I have taken into account sequence 19 as a schedule offence when sentencing for both
	
	
	To the extent that it is necessary, put indicative sentence for each two years.

3006049,Vossos v R [2016] NSWCCA 262,"Judgment


	
	MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Bellew J 
	
	
	R A HULME J: I agree with Bellew J.
	
	
	BELLEW J: Nicholas Vossos (“the applicant”) pleaded guilty before the District Court to two counts of supplying a prohibited drug, contrary to s. 21(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The applicant asked the sentencing judge to take into account two further offences on a Form 1, namely:
	



	
	participating in a criminal group; and
	
	
	assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty.
	



	
	On 18 September 2015 the applicant was sentenced by His Honour Judge Colefax SC to an aggregate sentence of 5 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.
	


THE FACTS


	
	The sentencing judge found the facts to be as follows (commencing at ROS 2):
	
	
	In March 2012, New South Wales Police attached to the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad started investigating the street level distribution of heroin by a drug syndicate operating in the south-west suburbs of Sydney.
	
	
	The main members of that syndicate were Mr Mark Younes, his brother Carlos Younes, Mr Vossos and Ms Melissa Pleasance (whom I sentenced on 24 October 2014). There were other people also involved.
	
	
	The group operated out of a granny flat connected with the premises at 44 Richmond Street, South Wentworthville. The Younes brothers' parents lived at that address in the main residence.
	
	
	Mr Carlos Younes and his brother also lived at the main premises at Richmond Street. Mr Vossos stayed at a number of places, including the granny flat to which I have just referred.
	
	
	The syndicate had a large and established client base. In the agreedstatement of facts concerning Mr Carlos Younes, it is agreed that his brother Mark managed the syndicate but that he (Mr Carlos Younes) from time-to-time provided direction to the other members, including whether to proceed with a supply, the price for the deal, the delivery location and who would make the delivery. In the statement of agreed facts for Mr Vossos, however, it is asserted that Messrs Mark and Carlos Younes ""managed the syndicate and provided direction to the other members"". However, those facts also assert that it was Mr Mark Younes who was prominently in charge. I do not regard the distinction as being a matter of material significance but I shall sentence each offender taking into account the relevant different version.
	
	
	Mr Vossos, in addition to his other functions in the syndicate, regularly took the role of ""runner"" and would deliver heroin to buyers at other locations using a motor vehicle.
	
	
	Each member of the syndicate, however, took orders for heroin through a mobile phone number and directed the relevant customer (or should I say victim) to a specified location for the exchange to occur. Taking orders involved negotiating about and agreeing and offering to supply heroin. Each syndicate member knew that the other members were performing this role; However the Crown does not allege that each syndicate member knew of the individual supply transactions carried out by the other members. This suggests that any hierarchical structure of the syndicate, subject to the slightly more dominant role of Mr Mark Younes, was not that pronounced - and that indeed a degree of autonomy was exercised by the individual members of the syndicate.
	
	
	The primary drop-off and exchange locations were: a large steel gate at the Richmond Street premises which was secured by padlocks, chains and barbed wire; a park at Pendle Hill; and public railway stations. I pause to observe that it is the participation in this criminal group which constitutes the matter on the Form 1 for Mr Younes and one of the two matters on the Form 1 for Mr Vossos. It was also the matter on the Form 1 which I took into account in sentencing Ms Pleasance.
	
	
	On 15 June 2012 Mr Mark Younes and Mr Vossos spoke on the telephone with an inmate at Emu Plains Women's Correctional Facility, Ms Bartholomew. She had made five telephone calls to the mobile phone connected with the syndicate. These telephone calls were recorded by the gaol officials. Ms Bartholomew asked Mr Younes and Mr Vossos to bring her some heroin, to which Mr Younes agreed. It was arranged that Mr Vossos and another female - not Ms Pleasance - would drive to the gaol and pass the heroin and some syringes to Ms Bartholomew through the boundary fence at night.
	
	
	Accordingly, on the evening of 15 June 2012 Mr Vossos and the other female travelled to the correctional facility. At about 10pm they met Ms Bartholomew and another inmate at the boundary fence and handed an unknown quantity of heroin and syringes to her through the fence. They left a short time later and returned to Richmond Street. This is the supply prohibited drug offence involving Mr Vossos.
	
	
	On 16 June 2012 a warrant was issued for the telephone interception of the mobile phone being used by the syndicate. The monitoring which then occurred disclosed hundreds of drug-related calls being made to that device each day.
	
	
	As a result, the police commenced both physical and electronic surveillance of 44 Richmond Street and the other locations to which the heroin was regularly delivered.
	
	
	Between 16 June and 25 July 2012 approximately 6,000 calls were made to and from the syndicate's mobile phone.
	
	
	As I have already said, members of the syndicate, including each of these offenders, entered into negotiations about, and agreements and offers for, the supply of heroin. Their customers were directed to one of the pick-up locations I have already identified. The average price paid by the customers for the heroin ranged from $30 to $1,200.
	
	
	In this period (16 June to 25 July 2012) Mr Younes supplied heroin on 90 separate occasions. The total quantity of the heroin supplied was 34.80 grams. This is the supply prohibited drug greater than the indictable quantity matter for Mr Younes.
	
	
	During the same period Mr Vossos supplied heroin on 50 separate occasions. The total quantity of the heroin supplied was not less than 12.60 grams. This is the supply prohibited drug greater than the indictable matter for Mr Vossos.
	
	
	And by way of comparison, Ms Pleasance (who was also sentenced for the same supply offence) engaged in supplying heroin on 75 occasions. The total quantity of the heroin supplied was not less than 28.80 grams.
	
	
	On 25 July 2012 police went to the Richmond Street premises. The side gate was secured in the usual manner with a padlock, chains and barbed wire. Mr Mark Younes, Mr Vossos and Ms Pleasance were in the granny flat, which was covered with a steel sheet and the doors had large bolts fixed to them. They were arrested and searched. In this regard, Constable May approached Mr Vossos in order to handcuff him. Mr Vossos started to swing his arms at the officer. Constable May directed Mr Vossos to stop resisting but the matter resulted in a wrestle. Mr Vossos then punched Constable May to his left shoulder. This is the assault police officer in execution of duty matter on the Form 1 for Mr Vossos. Ultimately, following a further struggle which involved Mr Vossos spitting a mixture of blood and saliva at the police, he was restrained and all three offenders were then taken to the Merrylands Police Station.
	
	
	It is necessary for me to make findings about the objective seriousness of these matters for offences of those types.
	
	
	However, before doing so I need to note that each offender was sentenced in 2008 to terms of imprisonment for the offence in 2005 of supplying a prohibited drug (heroin) on an ongoing basis and, in Mr Younes' case, for an additional offence of supply prohibited drug greater than the indictable quantity. These offenders were co-offenders in that regard and the nature of their offending conduct was broadly the same as the matters with which I am concerned today.
	
	
	In the sentencing hearing before me, the Crown submitted that these prior convictions would affect the assessment of that objective seriousness in the manner considered in Veen (No 2). I do not agree. The offences were committed as long ago as 2005 and although there has been other offending behaviour (both before and after that date which will be considered on the question of the prospects of rehabilitation) none of it has been drug-related. I therefore do not consider this to be a Veen (No 2) situation.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Younes, I regard his offence of supply prohibited drug greater than the indictable quantity as being just below a mid-range offence.
	
	
	In relation to Mr Vossos, I regard his offence of supply prohibited drug greater than the indictable quantity as being closer to the mid-range than the bottom of the range. But it is below that mid-range.
	
	
	In relation to his offence of supply, involving as it did the introduction of an unknown quantity of heroin into the custodial setting, I regard that as hovering somewhere equidistant between the mid-range and the bottom of the range.
	
	
	In Mr Vossos' case, his offences are aggravated by the fact that he was onconditional liberty, namely bail for the offence of goods in custody. However, there must be some amelioration of that circumstance of aggravation because it was Mr Vossos, through his solicitor, who informed the Court that he was on that bail. That fact was not otherwise known to the Crown appearing in these proceedings for some unexplained reason.
	


THE APPLICANT’S CASE ON SENTENCE


	
	Tendered on behalf of the applicant in the sentence proceedings was a report of Kathryn Wakely, Forensic Psychologist. Ms Wakely administered psychometric testing, the results of which indicated (inter alia) that the applicant’s composite IQ score was between 69 and 80, which placed him within the below average range, and at the fourth percentile. That score indicated that 96% of people within the applicant’s age range would be expected to outperform him on similar measures of intelligence. Ms Wakely also reported that the applicant’s scores on testing across the verbal and non-verbal domains were “roughly commensurate” with his IQ testing.
	
	
	Ms Wakely’s opinions included the following:
	
	
	[44]   Nicolas appears to be someone who is easily led and somewhat socially naïve. His associates and particularly those involved in the current offending, have not been a positive influence for this client and have had considerable influence on him with regard to the current matters, along with some past offending.
	
	
	[45]   The client’s below average level of intelligence, which is indicated to fall at the fourth percentile when compared to his peers, likely contributes to his vulnerability. This level of intelligence would typically suggest slowed learning abilities and cognitive functioning well below the average level. Adding to this his use and dependence upon substances would only increase his vulnerability and susceptibility as well as to further impair cognitive functioning.
	
	
	…
	
	
	[51]   Engagement in individual counselling to address the areas listed above is recommended for Nicolas. In addition participation in a Seasons for Growth program (for grief and loss) and a substance dependence program is recommended. Both of these programs are typically available within a custodial setting as well as within the community. Throughout the delivery of any group or individual treatments Nicolas’ low level of intelligence will need to be considered. Treatments may need to be altered and treatment providers will need to be mindful of this to ensure Nicolas receives the maximum benefits of treatments delivered.
	
	
	[52]   Nicolas would benefit from consistent monitoring and support within the community.
	
	
	Also tendered in the applicant’s case was a testimonial of Natalie Halime, a Director of the company for which the applicant has worked since 2012. Ms Halime stated (inter alia):
	
	
	(The Applicant’s) role is that (sic) one of the great importance and responsibility, he is the tradesmen team leader and the companies (sic) go to when staff updates or appraisals are required.
	
	
	Mr Vossos has always been professional at his workplace and upholds his position with pride, dignity and passion, his work ethic is sort (sic) after by all and works in a team environment with a mature approach, he is considered to be one of the most positive, constructive and pro-active figure (sic) and an important asset to the company.
	
	
	Rosette Utah, who has known the applicant for more than 20 years also provided a testimonial. She described observing the applicant having “become much more mature in his judgment” and having “commenced rationalising with all aspects of his decision making”.
	
	
	Written submissions were provided to the sentencing judge by the solicitor who appeared for the applicant on sentence. Those submissions included the following (at p.6-7):
	


The following matters are relevant to an assessment of the offender’s moral culpability for each offence (all references are to paragraph numbers in Kathryn Wakely’s report): -

The offender has an aggregate IQ score between 69 & 80 placing him in the range that indicates 96% of people his age range would out perform him (39).

This contributes to his vulnerability and would typically suggest slowed learning abilities and cognitive functioning well below the average level (45).

His choice of associates have had considerable influence over Nicolas since his teen years (43).

He appears to be someone who is easily led and somewhat socially naive.

His [co-accused] had not been a positive influence for this client and have had considerable influence upon him with regard to the current matters, along with some past offending (44).

His use and dependence upon substances would only increase his vulnerability and susceptibility as well as to further impair cognitive functioning (45).

The offender submits that his offending is towards the lower end of the scale, albeit not at the lowest level.


	
	Under the heading “General deterrence” the submissions stated (inter alia) the following (at p. 3):
	


“The need for general deterrence is high in cases involving dealing in and supplying prohibited drugs. It cannot however, be allowed to override, to an impermissible degree, the offender’s favourable subjective circumstances.”


	
	Finally, having made reference to other paragraphs of Ms Wakely’s report, the submissions stated (at p.11):
	


It is accepted that Mr Vossos is vulnerable to antisocial influences in custody and that his criminal history is relevant to an assessment of his prospects.

THE FINDINGS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE


	
	Commencing at ROS 11 the sentencing judge said the following:
	


Nickolas Vossos is now 47 years old.

His parents are of Greek background.

Mr Vossos' earliest childhood was spent with his grandparents in Greece. He came to live in Australia with his parents when he was eight years old. He found the emotional and schooling adjustments difficult. Subsequently, his relationship with his mother became a good one but he has had ongoing problems with his father.

At school Mr Vossos was an average student. He left school at Year 10 and thereafter worked in a series of casual jobs.

In his teen years he used cannabis and later used cocaine and ecstasy. This drug use is said not to have been problematic. For a reasonable period before his thirties he used no illicit substances at all.

However, at some stage in his thirties his best friend died and he then started to use speed and subsequently heroin. Once he started using heroin the habit rapidly escalated such that at the time of his most recent arrest he was using a couple of grams per day.

Like Mr Younes, the current offending was engaged in both to support the drug habit and also for independent financial gain. I repeat my earlier comments about the unknown amount of that financial gain and the lack of a wealthy lifestyle.

Since going into custody, however, Mr Vossos has ceased all drug use and this has been without any professional intervention. This is an impressive achievement.

He has no history of mental illness.

Unlike Mr Younes, Mr Vossos has a longer criminal history. It involves driving matters and some offences of violence and goods in custody. But like Mr Younes, the only prior drug offence of any significance was the 2005 offence.

Again, it is accepted on behalf of Mr Vossos that no sentence other than full-time custody is appropriate. And again, this is required by reference to notions of both general and specific deterrence.

Mr Vossos did not go into the witness box. As with Mr Younes, I am not prepared to give much weight to untested expressions of remorse advanced through third parties, namely the psychologist who prepared the expert's report.

The plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity and there will be accordingly a discount of 25% for the utilitarian value.

Notwithstanding the lack of remorse, by having regard to his limited prior convictions for drugs, his ability to be drug free while in custody, and his family support, I have concluded Mr Vossos' prospects for rehabilitation are reasonable.

However, I am not persuaded on the balance of probabilities that those prospects would be enhanced by a longer period on parole. Accordingly, I decline to find special circumstances.


	
	The sentencing judge did not refer to the report of Ms Wakely generally, nor did he refer to the results of the psychometric testing. Similarly, his Honour made no specific reference to the question of the applicant’s moral culpability.
	


THE GROUND OF APPEAL


	
	The single ground of appeal upon which the applicant relies is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the applicant’s limited intellectual capacity and impaired cognitive functioning.
	


Submissions of the applicant


	
	Counsel for the applicant submitted that notwithstanding Ms Wakely’s report, the submissions made on the applicant’s behalf before the sentencing judge, and the finding that the applicant had no history of mental illness, the sentencing judge had made no reference to the applicant’s limited intellectual capacity and impaired cognitive functioning. It was submitted that the only available inference in these circumstances was that his Honour had paid no regard to those matters.
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the applicant’s intellectual capacity and cognitive functioning were relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion in a number of ways. In particular, it was submitted that an offender’s impaired intellectual functioning:
	



	
	is relevant to an assessment of the moral culpability of offending;
	
	
	may render the offender an inappropriate medium for general deterrence, thereby reducing the significance of that consideration for sentencing purposes;
	
	
	may be relevant to considerations of rehabilitation, including the question of special circumstances; and
	
	
	may adversely impact upon any custodial sentence.
	



	
	It was submitted that in light of these matters, the sentencing judge had erred in failing to consider the contents of Ms Wakely’s report, and failing to assess the applicant’s moral culpability. In advancing that submission, counsel conceded that there was no evidence which established a causal connection between the applicant’s impaired cognitive function and the offending. However, it was submitted that error had nevertheless been established, and that this Court should proceed to re-sentence the applicant, exercising the sentencing discretion afresh.
	


Submissions of the Crown


	
	The Crown submitted that an offender’s reduced intellectual functioning does not automatically lead to a conclusion that such offender should be treated leniently, but that it is a matter to be assessed by a sentencing judge on a case by case basis. The Crown submitted that the circumstances of the applicant’s offending, and the applicant’s employment history, demonstrated that his intellectual functioning was not a matter of any real significance in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	To the extent that the applicant’s reduced intellectual functioning was said to bear upon, and lessen, his moral culpability for the offending, and accepting that the matter was not referred to by the sentencing judge, the Crown submitted that in light of the absence of any causal connection between such reduced function and the offending, no error had been made out.
	
	
	Finally, the Crown submitted that a number of the submissions advanced by counsel for the applicant amounted to an attempt to agitate matters before this Court which had not been the subject of submissions before the sentencing judge. The Crown submitted that in these circumstances, argument in respect of these matters should not be entertained.
	


Consideration


	
	The sentencing judge did not specifically refer to the report of Ms Wakely, nor did he refer to the issue of moral culpability, in circumstances where that issue was referred to in the written submissions with which he was provided. However, those matters do not lead to the conclusion that error has been established. In determining that question, a number of issues need to be considered.
	
	
	The applicant relied upon the report of Ms Wakely to establish his reduced level of intelligence. At its highest, Ms Wakely’s opinion was that the applicant’s reduced level of intelligence was a “likely” contributor to his vulnerability. The range in which she placed the applicant’s composite IQ score was wide, and was unaccompanied by any indication of precisely where, within that range, the applicant fell. Further, the statements of Ms Halime and Ms Utah tended completely against the results of the psychometric testing, as did the role played by the applicant in the offending. In all of these circumstances, the issue of the applicant’s intellectual functioning assumed limited significance in the sentencing exercise.
	
	
	Fundamental to the applicant’s position before this Court was the proposition that an offender’s mental state, including his or her impaired intelligence, is a matter relevant to an assessment of moral culpability. In advancing that submission, counsel for the applicant relied on a number of authorities including Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39 at [58]; Ngati v R [2014] NSWCCA 125 at [41]-[44]; McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29]; Elturk v R [2014] NSWCCA 61 at [34].
	
	
	In Muldrock the Court (at [53]) cited the principle that general deterrence should often by given very little weight in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or abnormality because such offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others. Their Honours went on to say (at [54] citations omitted):
	


[54] The principle is well recognised. It applies in sentencing offenders suffering from mental illness, and those with an intellectual handicap. A question will often arise as to the causal relation, if any, between an offender’s mental illness and the commission of the offence. Such a question is less likely to arise in sentencing a mentally retarded offender because the lack of capacity to reason, as an ordinary person might, as to the wrongfulness of the conduct will, in most cases, substantially lessen the offender’s moral culpability for the offence. The retributive effect and denunciatory aspect of a sentence that is appropriate to a person of ordinary capacity will often be inappropriate to the situation of a mentally retarded offender and to the needs of the community.


	
	Their Honours proceeded to note (at [55]) that in that case, there was unchallenged evidence of the causal connection between the appellants retardation and his offending. As counsel for the applicant properly conceded, there was no such evidence in the present case. In particular, Ms Wakely expressed no view at all about that issue.
	
	
	Whether an offender’s impaired intelligence is relevant to an assessment of moral culpability, and if not, whether it is relevant in some other way to the determination of an appropriate sentence, will depend upon the circumstances of the case. In Aslan v R [2014] NSWCCA 114 Simpson J (as her Honour then was) made reference (at [33]) to the principles governing the effect of an offender’s mental illness on sentence:
	


“Over the years, the applicable principles have evolved. They were most recently re-stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; 79 NSWLR 1 at [177]. They are as follows:

[Principle 1] Where the state of a person's mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender's moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced with a reduction in the sentence ...

[Principle 2] It may also have the consequence that an offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed ...

[Principle 3] It may mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person. Because the sentence will be more onerous for that person the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced ...

[Principle 4] It may reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence ...

[Principle 5] Conversely, it may be that because of a person's mental illness, they present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances, considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence ... Where a person has been diagnosed with an Antisocial Personality Disorder there may be a particular need to give consideration to the protection of the public ..."" (emphasis in her Honour’s judgment).


	
	Her Honour went on to say (commencing at [34]):
	


34. It will be observed that none of these principles is stated as absolute. What is recognised is the potential effect, in any given case, of a mental disability. It does not follow that, because an offender suffers from some mental impairment or disability, his or her moral culpability is reduced (principle 1); nor that he or she is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (principle 2); nor that a custodial sentence will weigh more heavily upon him or her (principle 3); nor that the significance of specific deterrence is reduced or eliminated (principle 4). Nor, on the other hand, does it follow that a person with mental impairment is a danger to the community, indicating a need for community protection (principle 5). Too often, the mere fact of mental illness is advanced to this Court as necessarily calling for a more lenient sentence. What the principles spelled out by McClellan CJ at CL do is direct attention to considerations that experience has shown commonly arise in such cases. There is, however, no presumption. It remains necessary for the sentencing court to examine the relevant facts in order to determine whether, in the specific case, the mental condition has the consequence contended for.

35. A central question (but not the only question) is whether the mental illness or other condition had a causative role to play in the commission of the offence or offences for which the offender is to be sentenced. Counsel who appeared for the applicant accepted that this was the principal issue in this case. If it is concluded that there was a causal connection, then the offender's moral culpability may be reduced (see principle 1). That connection may also warrant lesser attention being paid to the need for the sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence (principle 2) (emphasis added in each case).


	
	If an offender’s moral culpability is to be reduced on the grounds of impaired intelligence, some causal connection between that impairment and the offending must be established. In the present case, there was no evidence of any such causal connection. It follows that even though there was no specific reference to the issue by the sentencing judge, the evidence before him did not support a finding that the applicant’s moral culpability should be reduced on that basis.
	
	
	In the absence of such causal connection, an offender’s mental state may still be relevant on sentence in the various respects to which Simpson J referred. The difficulty for the applicant in the present case is that none of those matters were raised before the sentencing judge. In particular, it was not put to the sentencing judge that the applicant was an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence. On the contrary, the submission made by the applicant’s then solicitor expressly acknowledged that there was a high need for general deterrence in cases of this nature. Further, it was not put to the sentencing judge that the applicant was suffering from any mental impairment which had the capacity to impact adversely on his conditions of custody. Contrary to the submission of counsel for the applicant before this Court, the proposition put to the sentencing judge (at [12] above) fell substantially short of a submission that the applicant’s conditions of custody were materially affected by his mental state. Finally, it was not put to the sentencing judge that the applicant’s impaired intelligence was a factor relevant to the assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	The reliance on these matters by counsel for the applicant before this Court amounted to an attempt to litigate issues which had not been the subject of submissions to the sentencing judge. It is appropriate to reiterate that in determining an application for leave to appeal against sentence, this Court is not re-hearing a plea in mitigation. An application for leave to appeal against sentence is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below, and this Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been, but were not, advanced at first instance: Zreika v R (2012) 223 A Crim R 460; [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [79]-[81].
	
	
	For all of these reasons there is no merit in the ground of appeal relied upon. I propose the following order:
	



	
	Leave to appeal is refused.

		25 November 2016",2016-11-24 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
3006055,Mulvihill v R [2016] NSWCCA 259,"Judgment


	
	THE COURT: On 10 March 2014, following a trial in the Supreme Court before Fullerton J and a jury of twelve, the applicant (Paul Darren Mulvihill) was convicted of the murder on 16 July 2012 of his former lover, Rachelle Yeo. The applicant had pleaded not guilty to the sole count on the indictment, that of murder, and had raised no affirmative defences to the charge. His case, as to which he gave evidence before the jury, was that Ms Yeo’s death had been the result of an accident, the two fatal wounds (a neck wound severing her jugular vein and a penetrating wound to the heart, either of which would have been sufficient to kill her) having been inflicted by the deceased herself in the course of a struggle which had occurred in her apartment after an argument between them.
	
	
	The applicant was sentenced on 16 April 2014 to a term of imprisonment of 29 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 22 years commencing on 16 February 2013 and expiring on 15 February 2035, with a balance of term of 7 years expiring on 15 February 2042. He will first be eligible for release to parole on 15 February 2035.
	
	
	By notice filed on 22 April 2016, the applicant now seeks to appeal against both conviction and sentence. He requires an extension of time to do so, having regard to the lapse of time between the expiry on 15 October 2015 of the last of various extensions of time granted for the filing of a notice of appeal and the date his notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal was eventually filed (22 April 2016). The explanation for the delay proffered by his solicitor (by way of annotation to the notice of application for extension of time) was that the applicant was in custody and waiting for funds to finance his appeal to be released by the Family Court, after which it was necessary for his solicitor to obtain documents, brief counsel and confer with the applicant at the correctional centre in which he remains in custody.
	
	
	There was no opposition by the Crown to the extension sought for the filing of the notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal and in the circumstances an extension to 22 April 2016 should be granted for the filing of the notice of appeal and notice of application for leave to appeal.
	
	
	Pursuant to r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW), the applicant requires leave to appeal in respect of all of the grounds of appeal against his conviction, other than ground 9 (the unreasonable verdict ground which was abandoned at the hearing of the appeal) and ground 10 (which raises a complaint as to a miscarriage of justice issue), because no objection was taken at the trial in respect of the matters the subject of complaint in his grounds 1-8. Further, in respect of all of the conviction grounds of appeal, the applicant requires leave under s 5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) insofar as they include questions of fact. In relation to the sentence appeal, leave is required pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act.
	
	
	The Crown did not oppose the grant of leave for the applicant to rely on grounds 1 and 10 of the conviction appeal but submitted that leave should be refused on the balance of the grounds that required leave, variously on the basis that there was no error demonstrated or that the ground(s) have no merit. The Crown also submitted that the application for leave to appeal against sentence should be refused.
	
	
	In circumstances where the applicant has been convicted of a very serious crime for which he is serving a lengthy term of imprisonment, leave should be granted for him to rely upon grounds 1-2 of his conviction appeal grounds and to appeal against his sentence. Leave should be refused in relation to the balance of the appeal grounds for the reasons set out in due course. (Had leave been given on those grounds they would have been dismissed in any event for the reasons canvassed in respect of each of them.)
	
	
	For the reasons that follow, both the appeal against conviction and the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.
	


Background


	
	The following summary of the factual background (which does not purport to be exhaustive) is drawn from the Crown’s comprehensive summary of the trial and the written submissions provided to this Court for the applicant.
	
	
	The applicant and Ms Yeo were both employed by a pharmaceutical company (Sanofi-Aventis): the applicant as the National Pharmacy Channel Development Manager based in Brisbane; Ms Yeo as a Pharmaceutical Sales Representative in Brisbane until she commenced a new role as a Product Manager in Sydney in April 2012. They met through work and, while both had other partners, in late November or early December 2010 they commenced a sexual relationship which lasted for about 18 months.
	
	
	The applicant was 46 at the time of the trial. He, his wife, Ms Theresa Mulvihill and their three adolescent daughters lived together in Surfers Paradise. Ms Yeo was aged 31 at the time of her death. Her relationship with the applicant commenced and continued for some time while she was engaged to someone else (Mr Paul Maher).
	
	
	In January 2012, Ms Mulvihill became aware that her husband was having an affair with Ms Yeo after finding a sexually explicit text message from Ms Yeo on the applicant’s mobile phone. When confronted, the applicant admitted the affair. After a lengthy discussion, and at Ms Mulvihill’s request, the applicant telephoned Ms Yeo and told her that his wife had found out and that the relationship was over. Ms Mulvihill asked her husband to stop seeing or having any contact with Ms Yeo. Ms Mulvihill also asked the applicant to leave the house. He did so in February 2012 and took a six month lease of an apartment.
	
	
	Within about two weeks of Ms Mulvihill having discovered the affair Ms Yeo's fiancé also knew of it and his relationship with Ms Yeo ended. By mid-March 2016 Ms Yeo was planning to move to Sydney.
	
	
	Ms Yeo and the applicant remained in regular contact by text message throughout March-May 2012, and both from time to time expressed love for the other in those text messages.
	
	
	Ms Yeo made enquiries in March-April 2012 as to the possibility of starting a new position in the Sanofi-Aventis office in Sydney.
	
	
	The applicant gave different accounts to various people as to Ms Yeo’s move to Sydney. He told Ms Yeo’s manager (Ms Ward) in late April 2012 about the relationship with Ms Yeo and that he was very angry at how the relationship had ended and now he was left with nothing. He told his wife that Ms Yeo was moving to the New South Wales Central Coast and that he wanted to never see her again (and they commenced marriage counselling). He told his friend, Mr Simon Martin, that Ms Yeo was moving to Sydney and he thought it would be easier for them to maintain a relationship in Sydney “without the eyes of Queensland on him”. And in May 2012 he told another work colleague (Ms Lori Pirozzi) that Ms Yeo had moved to Sydney so they could continue their relationship and not have to “keep looking over their shoulders”. He also told Ms Pirozzi that Ms Yeo had told him she would have his baby after they returned from an overseas trip later that year.
	
	
	Ms Yeo commenced work in the Sydney office of Sanofi-Aventis on 30 April 2012. On separate occasions in May 2012 she spoke to her friends, one of whom was also a colleague, (Ms Kim Blowers, Sarah Atkins and Ms Jane Berkery) of her anxiety and fear in relation to her desire to end her relationship with the applicant. She also told them of the applicant’s persistent attempts to talk to her despite her requests to be left alone. She told Ms Blowers that after a meeting with the applicant on 16 May 2012, he became upset when she would not tell him where she was going to live.
	
	
	In mid-May 2012, the applicant returned to the family home (to stay with his children while his wife was away). He told his wife on her return that he did not want to move out and that he had subleased his unit. He then slept in the main bedroom of the house and his wife slept in her daughter’s bedroom.
	
	
	The applicant sent Ms Yeo an email on 27 May 2012 expressing his anger and hurt and accusing Ms Yeo of using him as a vehicle to “get out of a relationship that [she] wanted out of”. Ms Yeo’s response referred to her having constant anxiety and sleepless nights. She said she could not go on like this and did not want to do so.
	
	
	In early June 2012, Ms Yeo travelled to Melbourne. She had sought to keep her whereabouts concealed from the applicant. Her concern seems to have been not unfounded since, on 4 June 2012, Mr Mulvihill sent Ms Yeo a text message in which he made references to her having a new boyfriend (Mr Robert Hunt).
	
	
	On 13 June 2012, after an incident in Melbourne when the applicant had attempted to contact her at a hotel where she had checked in as a “silent guest”, Ms Yeo met with the applicant at the Sanofi-Aventis café. After that meeting she recorded in a notebook that she was keeping that she had explained to him very clearly that she did not see a future with him and wanted to be left alone; and that he was pressing for them to have a future.
	
	
	On 13 June 2012, Ms Yeo approached her work manager (Ms Ward) and told her about the relationship; that it had ended; and that the applicant had been making repeated unwanted attempts to make ongoing contact with her and had threatened to ruin her career. She had meetings with the Human Resources Manager and also the Human Resources Director the next day and made similar statements. Ms Ward made arrangements for Ms Yeo to work from home whenever the applicant was in the Sydney office and the applicant was instructed by the Human Resources department at Sanofi-Aventis not to have any further contact with Ms Yeo. (This was later his explanation for the steps he took, in advance, to conceal the fact that he was going to Ms Yeo’s unit on the night of her death.)
	
	
	In late June/early July 2012, Ms Yeo again expressed anxiety and concern to her work manager over the applicant’s behaviour. This included an incident on 27 June 2012 in Sydney when the applicant left a note on her desk at work, which Ms Yeo was not sure was meant as a threat or an apology. It also included an incident in which another work colleague had received an anonymous phone call to the effect that Ms Yeo was a marriage wrecker and having an affair with that colleague’s husband. Ms Yeo denied any such relationship and told Ms Ward that when she was in a relationship with the applicant he had been particularly jealous of her friendship with the man in question.
	
	
	On 5 July 2012, Ms Yeo attended Dee Why police station, for an unrelated purpose. There, she spoke about her concern at the applicant’s behaviour, asking about getting an apprehended violence order. However, no such application was made.
	
	
	On 12 July 2012, Ms Yeo had an appointment with a psychologist in which she said she was fearful of the applicant and that he was angry and had threatened her. Ms Yeo was tested on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and found to have moderate depression, extremely severe stress and extremely severe anxiety. The applicant was also exhibiting signs of emotion at that time. On 11 July 2012 he called Ms Ward and told her he was receiving counselling. Ms Mulvihill gave evidence that throughout June and July 2012 her husband had been crying almost daily.
	
	
	On 12 July 2012 Ms Mulvihill told her husband that she was “pretty much done”. They had had an argument. Relevantly, in light of some of the appeal grounds now raised, there was an incident that evening (the pillow incident). Ms Mulvihill said that she was in bed with one of her daughters (in her daughter’s bedroom) and her husband came into the room, put a pillow over her head and pushed it down. She said that when she told him that he was making her scared, he said “It’s not you, it’s her”. (She disagreed in cross-examination that her husband was attempting to get into bed with her with his pillow but she agreed that she told police that he used no force and that she did not think it was “real or full on”.)
	
	
	On 13 July 2012, Ms Mulvihill told her husband that she could not continue like this and was going to move out of the house. She noticed carry-on luggage that her husband had prepared to take with him at the front door. The bag was open. She rifled through some of her husband’s things and saw a Big W ticket for a “hoodie”, which she considered unusual because her husband did not have “hoodies” like that and neither she nor her husband regularly shopped at Big W. She also noticed a white plastic chain in the bag, which again she said she thought was unusual. (In cross-examination, she agreed that she had not mentioned the chain in her earlier police statements, first mentioning it in her 1 February 2014 police statement. She said she had lied to the police when she first told them that she had not seen the chain. She also said that she had previously discussed it with her husband and that he had asked her not to mention it to the police (T 748.35). She said she had lied to the police to try to protect her husband. It was put to her in that context that it was in her best interests for her husband to be convicted, with which proposition she disagreed, saying that she did not want the father of her children in gaol for the rest of his life (T 749.39).)
	
	
	About two to three weeks prior to 16 July 2012 (or possibly earlier, in late May/early June), the applicant told Mr Martin that he was devastated that the relationship with Ms Yeo was over and devastated that Ms Yeo had misled him (T 635.36-40). Mr Martin asked how Ms Mulvihill would cope with the applicant soon being away at the same work conference as Ms Yeo. Mr Martin said that the applicant responded that Ms Mulvihill “didn’t need to worry about him fucking Rachelle, she needed to be worried about what he could do to her” (T 636.8); but that the applicant also said in that conversation that he would not do anything.
	
	
	On 13 July 2012 the applicant called his friend, Ms Lynette Paisley, and told her he was suicidal. He said he had not had contact with Ms Yeo for about two months and that she had called him “out of the blue” to ask him about what he was planning to do with the lease expiring on his unit and whether he was going to move back into the family home. He wondered if that meant that she was thinking of a possible future with him. He told Ms Paisley that he had Ms Yeo’s phone number but not her address and that he still loved Ms Yeo.
	
	
	In the period leading up to Ms Yeo’s death, the applicant made a number of internet searches to attempt to discover where Ms Yeo was staying.
	
	
	Ms Yeo died on 16 July 2012. That morning, the applicant, having told his wife that he would later be flying to Melbourne, went to work in the Brisbane office. He flew to Sydney (where there was a work meeting scheduled for the following day), arriving at 4pm. He hired a car and went to the Sydney office of the company (through the basement) at 4.34pm. He left shortly after at 4.39pm. He said that he went to the office to synchronise his computer. He said that when he was in the carpark at the Sanofi-Aventis office he recognised Ms Yeo’s car and that he looked through the “relatively dark tinted windows” and saw an envelope in the passenger seat with an address of Pitt Road, North Curl Curl. He said he could not see the unit number but that the address was either 103, 105 or 108. (No such letter was found by the police in their later searches.)
	
	
	The applicant entered the Marriott Hotel in North Ryde at 4.42pm and checked into his room there at 4.43pm. The applicant’s evidence was that at some time between 5.00pm and 5.30pm he left the Marriott Hotel and went to a pharmacy at Chatswood to get “a bit of background” about what the chemist did in the market, “who they were supporting, prices, merchandisers, things like that” (T 1016), something he said was his practice in connection with his role with Sanofi-Aventis. The applicant said that he left the chemist at about 5.50pm and then drove to North Curl Curl because he wanted to see Ms Yeo (T 1016).
	
	
	The applicant said he “desperately” wanted to talk to Ms Yeo “to get some sort of closure once and for all, and get some things off my chest that I wanted to say to her about what had happened” and that he needed to do that face to face (T 1015; see also T 1018).
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence was that he knew the northern beaches area quite well; that he drove out there; that he first went to Pittwater Road and then Pitt Road; that he went to number 108 but realised this would not be the address as it was a house; then he went back up to numbers 103 and 105, which were unit blocks; and that he had a “gut feeling” that 103 was Ms Yeo’s address. He said he stood out the front “and had a bit of a look”, putting this at about 6.30pm or 6.40pm (T 1017). He said that when Ms Yeo did not come home he went back to the Marriott Hotel at 7.13pm. He said he was wearing khaki cargo type pants, a long sleeved maroon t-shirt and the black hoodie that he said he had bought from Big W (T 1018).
	
	
	At 6pm that day, a neighbour in the unit block where Ms Yeo was living at North Curl Curl (Mr Andrew Smythe), whose balcony was right next to that of Ms Yeo, was on his balcony making a telephone call. He observed a male standing on the vacant block next to the apartment building. Mr Smythe said the man was staring up at what Mr Smythe thought was his apartment and that when the man saw Mr Smythe he turned around and disappeared around the front of the vacant block. Mr Smythe said he was wearing a black jumper with a hood and appeared to be approximately six feet tall. The applicant denied that he was at that address at 6pm.
	
	
	As to Ms Yeo’s whereabouts at around that time, she had left the Sanofi-Aventis office at approximately 6.30pm wearing her work clothes. She drove to a yoga class and she spoke to her father from her car on the way there. Her father said she seemed quite happy.
	
	
	CCTV footage from the Marriott Hotel shows that the applicant entered the hotel at 7.12pm wearing a black top with a white hood, khaki pants and white runners with black vertical stripes. Shortly thereafter, he entered his room. At 7.13pm, the CCTV footage shows that the applicant walked towards the hotel bar wearing a red long-sleeve top. He replied to a text message from Mr Martin at 7.27pm to the effect that he was in the bar but “heading out soon”. At 7.43pm, he called Mr Martin and told him that he was going to catch up with another friend of his, Axel, and have a couple of beers. Mr Martin said that the applicant asked him whether he had a hire car, which Mr Martin said he thought was strange. Mr Martin said he did not (T 638.29). In cross-examination Mr Martin accepted that there had been numerous conversations between the two in the past about hiring a car or using taxis to travel on business (T 645.1ff).
	
	
	At 7.44pm the CCTV footage shows the applicant walking from the bar area past the lobby towards his room. He entered his room at 7.45pm.
	
	
	Further CCTV footage from the hotel then shows the applicant leaving the hotel through the fire escape at 7.52pm, wearing the same clothes with the addition of the black top with white hood. On the CCTV footage, he appears to have chocked the fire escape door open. (His left middle fingerprint was later detected on the internal surface of the fire door.) The applicant concedes (submissions at [9]) that he left the hotel “surreptitiously” that night and that he had attempted to prop open the fire escape door so that he would not be seen or captured on any CCTV cameras when he came back to the hotel. He said that he did this because he had been directed by the company’s human resources department not to have any further contact with Ms Yeo. He said he had it in mind that if Ms Yeo made an issue the next day about him going there he was going to deny it (T 1019).
	
	
	The applicant said that when he had returned to the Marriott Hotel earlier he had parked his car outside the carpark to the Marriott (which he said he routinely did). He drove back to North Curl Curl (T 1020), stopping at a convenience store on the way. He said that he got to the address at approximately 8.40pm or 8.45pm and that he sat in his car for about 5-10 minutes and then saw Ms Yeo’s car turn into the driveway of the building (T 1032).
	
	
	Meanwhile, Mr Hunt had called Ms Yeo at 8pm but there was no answer. He said that Ms Yeo had told him that she might be going to yoga. She called him from her mobile phone at 9.04pm but he did not answer because he was eating dinner. (He attempted to return her call at 9.34pm but there was no answer. By then, as appears from the chronology of events below, Ms Yeo was probably already dead.)
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence was that he was standing on the roadside of the letterboxes outside the unit block at the very top of the path; that he saw Ms Yeo first; that she was halfway along the path when they made eye contact; and that he persuaded her to allow him to go upstairs to the unit with her. (The Crown case was that Ms Yeo would not, in the circumstances, have permitted him inside her unit.) There was no sign of forced entry.
	
	
	Between 9-9.30pm, other residents of the unit block heard an altercation inside Ms Yeo’s unit. The accounts given by the various neighbours of the events that then unfolded are broadly consistent (and in a number of significant respects are accepted by the applicant).
	
	
	Ms Faletoese, who lived in the apartment above Ms Yeo’s, heard a loud female scream some time after 9pm and walked outside the unit block to try and determine where the noise was coming from. She heard a woman scream again about half a minute later and realised the noise was coming from her section of the unit block. She heard a male and female talking really loudly like they were arguing and realised the noise was coming from the unit below hers. She knocked on the door of the unit below and could hear two people arguing, the female screaming and the sound of furniture moving around and banging. She heard the female screaming, loud banging noises, glass breaking and furniture moving around. (The applicant points out that there was no broken glass found in the unit.) She started knocking really loudly on the door, asking if everything was alright. She told her partner to call the police and said to the people inside Ms Yeo’s unit that the police were on the way and to open the door. She said the female replied “Yes call the police”, and the female said she could not open the door, “He won’t let me”. Ms Faletoese said that it sounded like the female was struggling and was just behind the door. She also said that the male voice said “Everything is okay, you don’t need to call the police, everything is okay”. She heard further screaming from the female, glass breaking and furniture moving and then the female screams began to lessen and it became quiet inside the unit. She was unable to push the door open. She estimated the time from the first scream to the point where it went quiet as being approximately 5-10 minutes.
	
	
	Another neighbour, Ms Burrows, heard a female screaming “Oh my God, oh my God” at about 9.15pm and loud banging noises. She went out onto her balcony and heard very loud screaming. She ran down the stairwell to Ms Yeo’s unit where she saw Ms Faletoese bashing on the door and saying “Open this door now” several times. She heard the female screaming and a male voice saying “Everything’s okay, we’re okay”. She said the male voice sounded aggressive and that the female sounded as if she was begging for help and that she was crying and very distressed. She heard the female say “I can’t get to the door” and “Please help me”. She called the police on her mobile phone at 9.18pm and said that while she was on the phone the noise inside the room fell silent. She said by this time it had been approximately 5-10 minutes from when she first heard screaming. She went to the front of the unit block to meet the police. She did not see anyone or any cars taking off down the street.
	
	
	Ms Faletoese’s partner (Mr Gualtieri) went with Ms Faletoese to investigate the female screaming and was on the landing with her while she was knocking on the door of Ms Yeo’s unit. He heard a female voice inside the unit screaming for help, saying she couldn’t get to the door and asking for someone to call the police. He thought the female voice sounded like it was coming from the living room side of the corridor and the female sounded as if she was screaming as loudly as she could. He said the male voice quite calmly said there was no need to call the police and everything was fine. He said the female sounded in distress and was screaming and that whenever the male spoke he spoke very calmly. He went upstairs to call the police and when he returned Ms Yeo’s unit was very quiet.
	
	
	Another neighbour from the floor above, Mr Newcombe, heard some arguing and then shouting coming from the stairwell. When he went out to the stairwell he saw Ms Faletoese knocking on the door and saying “Let me in, open the door”. He also started knocking on the door. He could hear male and female voices. He said the female sounded extremely distressed and that she said “Call the police I need help”. He heard noises of something being pushed around or glass breaking. A few moments after, it went quiet inside the unit. Mr Newcombe heard noises from the female that sounded like rasping for air or a gurgling noise and said it sounded like the noise was coming from the other side of the door on the floor, lasted for a few minutes and was not constant. He later provided police with a hammer to break down the door.
	
	
	Finally, a neighbour from a unit on the ground floor, Ms Kubur, said she heard someone who sounded like a little girl say “Help police help” at some time between 9pm and 9.15pm. She heard a neighbour say “Let her out we are calling the police” and she went upstairs and saw Ms Faletoese knocking on the door. She heard a lot of screaming from inside the unit just behind the door and said it sounded like the female was trying to get away or open the door but someone was stopping her and it sounded like the voice was being muffled. She said the muffled screaming continued for about 2-5 minutes and she then heard something that sounded like a large object had crashed and then there was silence.
	
	
	The applicant’s account of what occurred inside the apartment is summarised later in these reasons ([82]ff). Relevantly for present purposes, he agreed that there had been screams (T 1113), though he did not recall Ms Yeo saying “Oh my God, oh my God”. He said he could clearly recall Ms Yeo saying “I can’t get to the door” and “Call the police” and he accepted that by the latter she was definitely seeking assistance (T 1114.22). He said Ms Yeo was not crying but agreed that she was very distressed (as he says he also was). Nevertheless, he also seemed to accept that words to the neighbours (that everything was okay and there was no need to call the police) were said calmly.
	
	
	The police arrived at the apartment block at 9.25pm. There was no sound from within the apartment. The police managed to open the door slightly with a hammer, saw something blocking the door and, when more pressure was applied to the door, Ms Yeo’s torso and legs were observed near the opposite wall in the hallway. She was lying on her stomach and appeared still and lifeless. There was no one else in the apartment. Bloody footprints leading from the loungeroom to the balcony were observed. There was blood on the balcony rail. There were no footprints in the kitchen or the hallway of the unit or leading from those areas. Ambulance officers arrived at about 9.36pm. After attempts to revive her, Ms Yeo was pronounced dead at the scene at 9.52pm.
	
	
	As to the applicant’s whereabouts after he left the apartment (via the balcony), CCTV footage from the Marriott Hotel showed that at 9.58pm he approached the same fire door as that from which he had earlier left the building. The door appeared to be shut. A short time later he entered the front door of the hotel with his hand covering his face, wearing a maroon shirt, khaki pants and no shoes. At 10.03pm he exited the same fire exit he had used before, wearing a white business shirt, black trousers and carrying a suitcase with another bag on his shoulder and covering his face.
	
	
	At about 10pm, the applicant telephoned his wife. She said that he said to her “She’s gone”; that when she asked him what he was talking about he said again “She’s gone”; and that when she asked “Rachelle?”, he said “Yes”. The applicant’s evidence was that what he said was that she was “gone out of my life” or “gone out of our lives”. Ms Mulvihill said that her husband also said that he had to go now to be with his parents (who were deceased). She interpreted this as meaning he intended to commit suicide. During the course of the evening the applicant made four phone calls to his wife, during some of which she heard sounds of “shushing” or “spraying”. He told his wife he was trying to send her an email. (She received it the following day. It included what appeared to be a suicide letter and some financial information.)
	
	
	CCTV footage from the International Inn at Wolli Creek shows that at 12.08am on 17 July 2012, the morning after Ms Yeo’s death, the applicant drove to the hotel and walked in the front entrance dressed in a white business shirt, black pants and black shoes. At 6.21am he entered Sydney domestic airport and checked in at the Qantas business lounge. He is shown on CCTV in the buffet area of the lounge, where he ate some food. He greeted a work colleague at 6.40am. At 6.57am he left the airport. He called his wife at approximately 7am and told her he was at the airport and there were police everywhere. His wife said that she “saw it on the news”, referring to Ms Yeo’s death, and he said “I know”.
	
	
	The applicant rented a car at 7.05am. He then sent the email to his wife referred to above and sent a work-related email to a colleague at Sanofi-Aventis. He also sent a text message to the National Sales Manager (Mr Swan), with whom he was due to meet that day, saying he would not be coming into work because he was sick. Mr Swan called him at 9.31am and was of the view that the applicant “was putting a sick voice on”.
	
	
	Meanwhile, at 9.30am, the applicant telephoned a sales representative of the company and asked if he could use his credit card details to purchase something to the value of $170 because he had left his wallet at home. He used those details to purchase a ticket in the sales representative’s name on a Virgin Australia flight to travel from Newcastle to Brisbane. He entered Newcastle airport at 10.37am. He entered and exited the airport a number of times between 10.45am and 11am before proceeding through security at 11.02am.
	
	
	The applicant was arrested at Brisbane airport when an Australian Federal Police officer on foot patrol in the airport recognised him as fitting the description of a suspect wanted by the New South Wales Police for the offence of murder.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence was that he did not know that Ms Yeo had died until he heard it on the radio. He said that she was “alive well and truly alive” when he left the unit (T 1119).
	


Forensic evidence


	
	Forensic examination of the unit revealed blood on the walls and floor of the inside hallway and blood on the internal surface of the door. There was a very large smear of transferred blood as well as projecting bloodstaining in the form of a possible arterial pattern on the hallway opposite the front door. On the wall at the end of hallway nearest to the front door, both expirated blood and transferred blood was observed. On the carpet at the end of the hallway there was a large pool of blood. There was blood on various of the items in the living area. A large pool of blood was observed on the lino floor in the kitchen, which was starting to congeal, as well as blood on the carpet at the entry to the kitchen and blood on the base and up both sides of the wall separating the kitchen from the loungeroom floor. There was a substantial amount of blood located under Ms Yeo’s pink bag (which indicated that the bag came onto the floor after the bloodshed event). Marks were observed through the pool of blood, indicating body parts moving through the blood (consistent with one or more people moving around in the area) and satellite splatter on the floor of the kitchen (indicating a prolonged period of someone standing there bleeding).
	
	
	Bloodstaining was observed on the door frame and floor of the outside balcony. A blood stained print on the balcony railing was developed and indicated to be the applicant’s right palm print in blood. On the driveway below the balcony a bloodstained white plastic chain was observed.
	
	
	A number of shoe prints were observed inside the unit (some being discernible as police or ambulance issue boots). One different style of shoe print was observed in prints leading towards the balcony. The same type of shoe print was observed on the back of Ms Yeo’s jacket hood. Personal effects were strewn on the ground in the hallway. Numerous items were scattered around the living area and there were items on the floor near the pool of blood in the kitchen (including a broken ceramic mug).
	
	
	Agreed facts at the trial in relation to the forensic examination included that: blood and DNA matching that of Ms Yeo only was detected on the northern wall near the lounge room, southern wall of the kitchen, kitchen drawer, internal balcony door, doorstep on the balcony and floor of the balcony; the applicant’s bloodied right palm print was identified on the top of the outside balcony railing with the fingers pointed outwards away from the unit; a left palm impression of the applicant in blood was identified on the lounge room wall of the unit near the kitchen and left index finger and thumb impressions of Ms Yeo were identified on the outside and inside of the entry door. The northern and southern walls of the hallway contained right and left hand and finger prints of Ms Yeo and the southern wall of the hallway contained foot and toe impressions of Ms Yeo. The white plastic chain on the driveway below the balcony contained blood and DNA matching that of Ms Yeo.
	


Expert evidence


	
	Dr Van Vuuren, the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination on the deceased, determined the direct cause of death to be multiple stab wounds: a stab wound on the right chest extending through the fourth intercostal space, through the right lung and through the right ventricle and septum of the heart; a small haemopericardium; a small haemothorax; and a stab wound on the left lateral aspect of the neck extending through the internal jugular vein through the larynx but above the vocal cords. Because the incision was above the vocal cords, his evidence was that Ms Yeo would have been able to speak “basically normal” except for swallowing blood after sustaining the wound.
	
	
	Both lungs showed evidence of blood aspiration and there was blood present in the stomach. His evidence was that there were self-defence injuries on both hands as well as multiple bruises and abrasions on the hands, legs, face and upper neck, consistent with blunt force injuries. There was an injury to the nose and blood in the nose.
	
	
	There was a “quite deep” incision from the edge of the deceased’s right thumb to halfway into her right palm, which would have been caused by a sharp object and two incisions on the top of the right hand near the knuckles which were “lined up” and relatively deep, penetrating the soft tissue and into the ligament.
	
	
	Ms Yeo had scattered petechial haemorrhages underneath her left lower eyelid (those usually being caused by ligature of manual strangulation but sometimes by resuscitation) and a few small bruises on the left side of the neck that could be consistent with force applied to the neck (either blunt force or strangulation). There was perimortem bruising on the earlobe.
	
	
	Dr Van Vuuren found no imprint of the white plastic chain on the body and expressed the opinion that the injuries sustained to the neck did not appear to be caused by the chain. Dr Van Vuuren was of the opinion that bruising along the left jawline could possibly have been caused by a forearm around the jaw or a “choke hold”.
	
	
	Professor Duflou, a clinical professor in forensic pathology at the University of Sydney, gave evidence in the Crown case. His opinion was that it was very unlikely that all of the injuries sustained by Ms Yeo were inflicted whilst she was in possession of the knife. He said that the constellation of injuries to Ms Yeo were typical when an assailant causes stab wounds and incised wounds on the deceased while the deceased tries to fend off the assailant. He considered that the injuries to the deceased were of another person having stabbed her as opposed to the hand being forced and then the knife penetrating the skin. In his report dated 30 May 2013, in his opinion:
	


The multiplicity of locations on the body, the presence of defensive injuries on both hands and the severity of the injuries overall it would be extremely unusual for self-infliction during a struggle.


	
	Professor Duflou could not exclude the possibility that Ms Yeo was holding the handle of the knife for at least part of the altercation but there was no autopsy evidence to support that proposition. He considered it extremely unlikely that the two disparately located stab wounds took place by the deceased falling on the knife during the course of a struggle. He considered it unlikely but possible that she would have been able to struggle and move around for a few minutes after receiving the wound to the chest.
	
	
	He said that the track of the stab wound to the neck being surrounded by blood and aspiration of blood into both lungs and swallowing of blood into the stomach suggested a period of survival after the stab wound to the neck which could have been anything from a minute or two to a considerable period of time.
	
	
	Professor Duflou said that either of the two stab wounds had a high potential to be fatal. He thought the stab wound to the neck occurred first, following which there would have been an indeterminate period of survival (which may have been many minutes long). He said that at some stage close to the time of death and after the loss of a large amount of blood from the neck wound, it appeared that Ms Yeo had sustained an air embolism from the stab wound to the neck.
	
	
	He said that the stab wound to the chest, although generally considered lethal in nature, may have been sustained shortly before or immediately after death because of the relatively very small amount of bleeding. Blood staining on the right side of the clothing could have been caused by the chest wound or the neck wound as a result of the body being moved. He said that there were no marks typical of strangulation or injury to the neck structures of the deceased (which would usually be expected to be seen in strangulation) but that it was possible for there to be a degree of neck compression that could not be observed.
	
	
	Professor Duflou said that the injuries sustained by the applicant were trivial in nature. Some could have reasonably been defensive injuries (such as the superficial incision or cut to the palm of his right hand) but that injury could also have been caused when the knife was in the possession of the applicant. A small number of injuries to his fingers could potentially have been the result of a defensive type injury or could have been caused in the process of stabbing someone, or by punching an object, or by general interactions during a violent confrontation.
	
	
	Professor Hilton, a consultant in forensic medicine and adjunct professor at the University of Western Sydney, gave evidence in the defence case. He could not say precisely the order in which the injuries were sustained but in cross-examination agreed that his preferred view was that the neck wound preceded the chest wound. He gave evidence that the frothy blood in the right chamber of the heart indicated that Ms Yeo had suffered an air embolism and he thought it highly unlikely that this came from outside through the chest wound. He considered it more likely to have come from the neck wound.
	
	
	He could not exclude the possibility that during the struggle the knife may at some stage have been in the possession of the deceased. He thought the cut to the applicant’s hand may indicate he was not in possession of the knife at that particular time. In cross-examination he agreed that the cut to the hand was extremely superficial.
	
	
	Professor Hilton said that the disparate anatomical sites made it unlikely that both penetrations took place by Ms Yeo falling on the knife during the course of a struggle. (The applicant emphasises that on his account of events Ms Yeo was only holding the knife at the time of one of the two main stab wounds.)
	
	
	The applicant’s account of the altercation with Ms Yeo (set out in more detail shortly at [82]ff) was, contrary to the view expressed by the expert witnesses as to the more likely sequence of events, that the stab wound to Ms Yeo’s chest occurred first (as they were wrestling over the knife when it was still in Ms Yeo’s hand) and that the neck wound occurred after: Ms Yeo had called out to the neighbours that she could not get to the door and to call the police (and, it can be added, after he had said they were all right and did not need the police); they had continued to wrestle; he had punched her in the face to make her let go of the knife; he had grabbed it; and she had moved so as to cause him to fall forward at which time she was stabbed in the neck. He was adamant that no part of the struggle took place in the kitchen, except that that was where Ms Yeo first had the knife (T 1119).
	


Conviction appeal


	
	Grounds 1-10 of the notice of appeal relate to the appeal against conviction. As already noted, ground 9 was not pressed, nor were various of the complaints the subject of ground 6. We turn to the grounds that were pressed on the conviction appeal.
	


Ground 1 – the terms in which self-defence was left to the jury

1.   The learned trial judge erred in her directions to the jury on self-defence.


	
	Under ground 1, the applicant submitted that the learned trial judge erroneously failed to direct the jury on “both limbs” of the defence of self-defence. The applicant’s contention is to be considered in the context of the well-known fundamentals of self-defence in relation to murder. In a case where self-defence is sufficiently raised by the evidence to require that it be left for the jury’s consideration as a complete defence, by force of s 418 Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) the jury may return a verdict of guilty of murder only if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that in acting as he did (in this case, inflicting the knife wounds) the accused did not believe his actions were necessary to defend himself.
	
	
	Where the complete defence is properly left to the jury, should the jury find this negative proposition proved, that will eliminate self-defence. Subject to proof beyond reasonable doubt of all other elements and exclusion of any other defences, the verdict would be guilty of murder.
	
	
	If the Crown should fail to satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe his actions were necessary in self-defence but did prove that the infliction of the knife wounds was not “a reasonable response in the circumstances as he [perceived] them” (the “second limb”, in the applicant’s terminology), he would be not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. Outright acquittal would follow only if the Crown failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt this second negative proposition as well.
	
	
	The applicant did not conduct his case on the basis of self-defence. His counsel did not open to the jury that he had inflicted the two critical knife wounds believing that this was necessary for him to defend himself. Nor did he suggest this in his evidence regarding the fatal struggle. To contend that he acted in self-defence would have involved acknowledgement of intentional wounding. The applicant’s evidence was that he did not intentionally inflict any knife wound but that Ms Yeo sustained knife penetrations of her chest cavity and then of her neck accidentally, in the course of a struggle in which she was attempting to stab the applicant.
	
	
	At T 1035-1046, the applicant’s evidence of how Ms Yeo sustained the fatal knife wounds was as follows. In Ms Yeo’s flat at North Curl Curl, the two of them commenced a discussion which developed into a heated argument. Whilst standing in the lounge room about one metre apart the applicant told Ms Yeo she was self-centred. She slapped him across the side of his face with her right hand. The applicant grasped Ms Yeo “by the scruff of her neck and held [his] fists under … her chin”. The applicant said he looked Ms Yeo in the eyes and said “I don’t know who the fuck you think you are, but don’t ever do that to me again”.
	
	
	As these words were spoken the applicant was pushing Ms Yeo backwards “firmly” from the living room into the kitchen. Whilst he was doing so the deceased turned away from him. When she turned back she had “a very large stainless steel knife” in her right hand, raised to shoulder height with the thumb extended upwards. She said “Get the fuck out of here”. The applicant said he raised his hands defensively to shoulder height and told the deceased not to be stupid, to put the knife down. She “lashed out” with the knife towards the right side of his chest. He brought his right hand across his body defensively and the knife nicked his right palm.
	
	
	The applicant gave evidence that he thought “I’m in massive trouble here because I didn’t have anything. Apart from me, I didn’t have anything to hit her with, or get the knife out of her hand” (T 1036.49). He told her repeatedly to put the knife away and not to be stupid. “[S]he just kept saying, ‘Get the fuck away from me, get out of here’”. Ms Yeo stepped forward into the living room towards the applicant and for a second time swung the knife at him. He could see in her eyes that she was angry and he again thought he was “in trouble”. He backed into the middle of the living room. Ms Yeo continued to advance and when she “lunged at me a third time”, in a “swishing motion, it wasn’t a stabbing motion”, he seized her right wrist with his left hand, the knife still being held in her right hand.
	
	
	The applicant’s evidence continued that he then seized Ms Yeo “around the scruff of her neck again, like I had before, and I had a hold of her jacket”. He continued to tell her to let the knife go and not to be stupid, she shouted at him to let her go. He said they were “literally bouncing off the walls” (of the living room, the end of the hallway, the wall separating the kitchen from the hallway and the living room wall that extended towards the kitchen) (T 1038.14). He pushed her backwards against a wall of the unit repeatedly, whilst her right hand was above shoulder height. Ms Yeo’s right hand was pushed against the wall by the accused, using his left hand applied to her wrist.
	
	
	Ms Yeo pushed against the applicant, trying to get free. She managed to push the applicant back against another wall. He thought “she was getting, I guess, the better of me up against the wall”. He then “shoved her really, really hard”, still with the same grip on her right wrist and on the clothing at her neck. As Ms Yeo went backwards she tripped and fell to the floor. The accused toppled over with her. As Ms Yeo hit the floor she rolled to her left. The applicant tried to fall to his right (her left) to avoid falling on top of Ms Yeo. As they fell “I saw the knife hit her somewhere in the right-hand side. I could feel that it had hit something hard, and it didn’t feel like it was the ground”.
	
	
	He gave these answers at T 1041.14-27:
	


Q.   Where did her right hand end up as you fell to the ground with her?

A.   As soon as we hit the ground the knife wasn’t in her. As soon as she hit the ground, the knife wasn’t actually inside her, it was out, but I could notice there was blood on her. So we hit the ground, my best guess is the knife has gone into her, but it didn’t stay inside her, if you know what I mean. It was just in and out, because I … can’t recall seeing the knife actually inside her jacket, in her. So the knife has struck her there and then it’s come out. And the first thing I knew that I remember seeing blood on the knife when we were back on the ground, and the knife was in her hand with my hand still attached to it.

Q.   So is it your evidence that the knife entered Ms Yeo’s chest in the free fall topple to the ground?

A.   No, I think it actually entered as we hit the ground.


	
	The applicant said that at this point he heard neighbours knocking on the door of the apartment but told them everything was all right. He said that he knew “the knife had gone into her side but … didn’t have any idea about the severity”. He thought he had control of the situation. He still held Ms Yeo’s right hand, with the knife, and now pressed it against the ground. He told her repeatedly to let the knife go but she did not. So he punched her in the face, thereby stunning her so that she released her grip. The applicant said that he then threw the knife on the ground away from where they had fallen, in the living room, and got up and went to the front door to leave.
	
	
	When he reached the front door the applicant saw Ms Yeo “get to her hands and knees and she was going for the knife”. The applicant “tackled her” from her right side, bringing her back to the ground, and reached out and seized the knife in his right hand before Ms Yeo could get to it. Ms Yeo grasped the applicant’s right wrist with her left hand. He struck her right hand with the knife to stop her from trying to use that hand to get control of the knife. He then “forced [Ms Yeo] down so she couldn’t use [the right] hand to grab the knife”. At this stage the applicant was on top of Ms Yeo on the floor, the two of them facing each other.
	
	
	Then, with the knife held in the applicant’s right-hand in between himself and Ms Yeo, he tried to get to his feet. He gave these answers at T 1044.42-1045.5:
	


A.   … I was sort of on my haunches … and using her as a leverage pushing down on her, not to push her away, but to push her to use her legs to get up, and once I got on my feet, I would withdraw from her, but as I was on my haunches, and I was in a really, really awkward position, one foot was sort of up on her shoulder and one foot was on her abdomen type area, because my weight was leaning forward on top of her, and I just distinctly remember it was the feeling you get when you are pushing against something, and all of a sudden there was no resistance, and I fell forward into her, and she turned, you could see the knife just going towards her face, she turned to her right and turned away.

Q.   And what did you see happen then?

A.   Just saw the blood coming out of her neck, side of the neck and the blood was just pouring out of the side of the neck …


	
	The applicant said that he knew it was bad, that he grabbed one of her hands and put her hand over the side of her neck and that he then panicked and fled the unit, jumping over the balcony rail. At T 1056.19 he said “I never once formed any intent to hurt her in any way shape or form, before, during the night of the 16th, never …”.
	
	
	In defence counsel’s address there was still no positive case of self-defence put to the jury. It was not suggested to them that either of the two critical knife blows had been struck by reason of a perception on the applicant’s part that this had been necessary to defend himself. It was submitted to the jury that they would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either knife wound had been inflicted intentionally at all. This was diametrically opposed to any notion that the critical knife wound had been inflicted with intent, in order to defend against perceived threat.
	
	
	The uncontested report of Professor Duflou established that the two critical stab wounds were as follows:
	


A 95 mm stab wound on the right side of the chest, with a wound track passing towards the midline of the body for a distance of about 18 cm, and passing between the 4th and 5th ribs, through the anterior border of the right lung and through the right ventricle of the heart. There was also a simultaneous defect in the interventricular septum of the heart. Associated with this stab wound was 230 ml blood in the right chest cavity, and about 10 ml blood in the pericardial sac.

A 45 x 5 mm stab wound on the left side of the neck, with a wound track passing through the sternocleidomastoid neck muscle, the left internal jugular vein and into the larynx above the vocal cords. Associated with this injury was inhaled blood in the trachea and bronchi, as well as swallowed blood in the oesophagus and stomach cavity. Bleeding was noted along the wound track.


	
	Professor Duflou’s report contained the following with respect to the force required for the knife to penetrate the deceased’s body to create these wounds:
	


What force was required to inflict the injuries? The amount of force required to inflict a stab wound is largely dependent on the sharpness of the point of the knife. If the point of the knife is sharp, relatively little force is required to cause both the neck and chest injury. However, if these two wounds were inflicted using a blunt tipped knife, considerable force would be required to inflict those injuries.


	
	Oral evidence of Professor Duflou regarding this was as follows (at T 777.21-29):
	


Q.   You say that a knife like that can penetrate the skin the amount of force used to sustain the wound as to the neck and chest would be quite minor, is that correct?

A.   Yes you certainly don’t need a large amount of force to get through the skin.

   Once a knife point has passed through the skin, the resistance of the remainder of the body, with the exception of bone, is less than that of skin, so once it has gone through the skin it will keep on going.”


	
	Professor Duflou did not, either in his report or in oral evidence, elaborate on the terms “relatively little force”, “considerable force”, “quite minor” force or “[not] a large amount of force”. These indeterminate descriptions were not further explained by reference to units or by comparison with the force required for other biomechanical actions which might have been within the jurors’ experience.
	
	
	On the same subject Dr Van Vuuren said at T 678.3-21:
	


Q.   The stab wound to the right chest, which you have told us was 18 centimetres deep, are you able to say what sort of force would have been required to inflict that with a knife, say a sharp knife or the type of knife you’ve seen a photograph of?

A.   There would have been moderate force definitely applied. If the tip of the knife is very sharp, you don’t need that much force to put the knife in.

Q.   Why?

A.   Because your skin is most resistant, except for bone and cartilage, so if you get the knife through the skin then it is quite easy to penetrate the body.

Q.   As you said, the knife went in between the ribs?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So it didn’t hit bone?

A.   No.

Q.   What about the neck wound?

A.   The same principle.


	
	Dr Van Vuuren also was not asked to explain his terms “moderate force”, “[not] much force” or “quite easy” as used in this passage of evidence.
	
	
	Before the commencement of addresses at T 1141.1-1142.43, 1143.30-33 and again at T 1146.18-1152.48, her Honour discussed with counsel whether manslaughter by excessive self-defence should be left to the jury in the summing up. Her Honour pointed out that the difficulty with doing so would be that upholding self-defence would depend upon the jury finding a reasonable possibility that each of the two fatal wounds was inflicted deliberately with intent either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm, albeit in the belief this was necessary for the applicant to defend himself. This would obviously run counter to the applicant’s evidence and his entire case. Namely, that the fatal wounds had not been inflicted by a deliberate act upon his part, let alone by an intentional act for the purpose of self-defence, but arose from accidental penetration of the knife into the deceased’s chest during a fall and into her neck during a subsequent struggle. The applicant’s counsel nevertheless asked that manslaughter by excessive self-defence be left: at T 1143.30-33.
	
	
	Defence counsel did not during this discussion or at any later time request the trial judge to leave to the jury the possibility of an acquittal on the basis of the complete defence of self-defence. That would have required a direction that, if they found the first two elements of murder proved beyond reasonable doubt (that a deliberate act of the applicant had caused the death of the deceased and that the applicant’s act was intended to inflict death or grievous bodily harm) they would acquit if the Crown had failed to exclude both of (a) any reasonable possibility that the applicant believed it was necessary to stab the deceased deliberately to defend himself against an attack by her and (b) any reasonable possibility that the infliction of the knife wounds was a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them.
	
	
	From the fact that neither her Honour nor defence counsel made any reference to the possibility of leaving the complete defence, it is clear that neither thought there would be any basis upon which the jury could have been left with a reasonable doubt as to whether each of the fatal knife thrusts went beyond a reasonable response to any perception of the circumstances which the applicant could possibly have held. The view of this Court, likewise, is that, whatever the jury may have taken from the evidence about “moderate” force (and similar descriptions given by the forensic medical specialists) and whatever they concluded about the applicant’s perception of his struggle with Ms Yeo, they could not have considered it a possibility that a knife thrust either laterally through the chest cavity at the level of the lungs and heart or through the neck in a position to transect the jugular vein was a reasonable response. A conclusion that either stab wound might, as a possibility, have been a reasonable response to whatever attack the applicant perceived he was under would have been perverse.
	
	
	Her Honour reserved the decision as to whether or not to leave manslaughter by excessive self-defence to the close of the defence address. The applicant’s counsel did not put self-defence to the jury either on the basis of a complete defence justifying acquittal or on the basis of excessive self-defence leading to a verdict of guilty of manslaughter. She did not suggest any interpretation of the evidence which could accommodate the view that the fatal wounds had resulted from deliberate knife blows by the applicant or that any such deliberate action had been taken with the intention of inflicting death or grievous bodily harm as a means of the applicant defending himself against perceived danger from attack. Rather, the defence closing address, especially at T 1301.15-1306.4, pressed the applicant’s account of the knife wounds as having been sustained accidentally.
	
	
	In the final stages of defence counsel’s address her Honour informed counsel in the absence of the jury that she would leave excessive self-defence as a basis for a verdict of guilty of manslaughter (at T 1330.49-1331.46) but would draw the jury’s attention to counsel’s decision not to contend for a verdict of manslaughter being available to the jury on that basis. Her Honour said she would not leave manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act, which had been raised as a possibility at T 1115.41-49 but never requested by defence counsel. At T 1331.20 her Honour gave counsel the written directions she proposed to provide to the jury on the elements of murder, including, as an element to be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt, that the accused was not acting in self-defence. The applicant’s counsel had no objection to that document (at T 1331.35 and T 1333.11).
	
	
	At T 1332.18-1333.20, her Honour discussed with counsel the then recently published decision of the High Court in James v The Queen (2014) 253 CLR 475; [2014] HCA 6 and pointed out its relevance to the question of whether manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act should be left to the jury. Her Honour provided counsel with a draft proposed “question tree” for the jury and invited counsel’s response.
	
	
	The defence address then concluded (at T 1347.25). A further draft of the question tree was provided to counsel (at T 1349.10). It became MFI 35. At T 1349.48 her Honour acknowledged what she understood to be defence counsel’s “proper concession … there is no question but that that response … was [excessive] in all the circumstances, so an outright acquittal is not an option that is open in this case”. Defence counsel did not contradict that this concession had been made. Discussion of the question tree continued from T 1349.10-1351.28. At T 1351.20 defence counsel did not take up her Honour’s invitation to make any additional submission regarding manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. Defence counsel said she had “no issue with question 6” in the question tree, which was as follows:
	


6.   In considering that question [the question of self-defence], if you are satisfied that the evidence allows for the reasonable possibility that the accused believed that it was necessary to deliberately stab the deceased to defend himself from an attack by the deceased with the knife, then you should return a verdict of guilty of manslaughter because the Crown will not have proved the accused was not acting in self-defence.


	
	During the summing up, her Honour’s written directions on elements (MFI 33) and the question tree (MFI 35) were given to the jury (see [79] and [413] respectively). The summing up dealt with self-defence at [73]-[75], [82]-[85], [335]-[360] and [412]-[416]. The self-defence direction was given with respect to both of the fatal wounds as follows:
	


[348]   If you consider on the evidence that there is a reasonable possibility, and I will repeat it, that the deceased grabbed the knife, that she used it threateningly, that he actually believed that she was going to use it against him, and that he believed it was necessary in his own defence to use it against her and that he deliberately inflicted one or both wounds with the intention to either kill her or inflict grievous bodily harm, then the appropriate verdict for you to return would be not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

…

[353]   Additionally, if you consider there is a reasonable possibility that the chest wound was actually sustained accidentally, that is in the way the accused described it, that there was a fight over the knife but that he didn’t inflict the chest wound, that she did fall onto the knife in the way that he described, but that he then obtained possession of the knife and deliberately stabbed her in the neck, in his own defence, in order to prevent her getting control of the knife after he punched her then again, if you regard that account, or that version of the facts as possible or reasonably possible and you consider that it is reasonably possible, that he believed that was necessary to do so in his defence then again, the appropriate verdict is not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

[354]   Again, I remind you, apologies for the repetition, but I am not urging that version of the facts as facts you ought to find, I am simply leaving it to you as an alternate basis upon which a verdict of manslaughter might be returned.

[355]   In considering the question of self defence, if you do, as to whether the accused may personally have believed it necessary to stab the deceased in the chest or the neck or the chest and the neck and that it was necessary in his defence to act that way, you must consider the circumstances as you believe it reasonably possible that the accused perceived them or might have perceived them.

[356]   You must take into account any particular attitude or characteristics of the accused which you think might have borne upon his perception in the flat that night, and which had a bearing, or might have had a bearing on any belief you think he might have formed.

…

[359]   I direct you also that if you find the accused did actually form a belief, or might have formed a belief that stabbing the deceased was necessary for his own defence, it is irrelevant that he may have been mistaken as to any actual threat he faced from the deceased. It is how he perceived them, it’s how he was placed in the circumstances that night, circumstances which, on any view of events, you would accept he was at least partly the author of.

[360]   If on the other hand, ladies and gentleman, you are satisfied on all the evidence that there is no basis for you finding that he might have believed that stabbing the deceased was necessary in defence of himself, whether because the Crown has proved otherwise, or because there is simply no evidence to support it, and the evidence led in support of guilt is overwhelming, in particular, the Crown has impressed upon you, his forced entry into the unit, and his attack upon the deceased, or on any other view you take of the facts, if you are of that view, of course then self-defence, which would otherwise reduce a verdict from one of murder to one of manslaughter, is not available, and in those circumstances, you would regard the Crown as having disproved self-defence as having any operating factor in this case, and you would return a verdict of murder, because that would be the only appropriate verdict.


	
	Her Honour explained that as trial judge she was obliged to raise the subject of self-defence even though the applicant had not. On this appeal it has not been contended that the directions at the above-mentioned paragraphs were deficient in any respect, concerning the partial defence.
	
	
	Ground 1 is urged by the applicant in the following submission (for which R v Kartarzynski [2005] NSWCCA 72 is cited in support):
	


36.   … The ‘defence’ of self-defence, once raised on the evidence, must be disproved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt (section 419). There are two limbs which must be disproved. Relevantly, the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not believe the conduct was necessary to defend himself, and, that the conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them. There is both a subjective test as to the accused’s belief and an objective test as to the proportionality of the accused’s response. If the prosecution fails to disprove both these matters beyond reasonable doubt the accused is entitled to be acquitted. If the prosecution fails to disprove one of them, then the accused may be convicted of manslaughter.


	
	The applicant’s complaint is that her Honour failed to instruct the jury on the “second limb” of self-defence so that the full defence could be upheld and a verdict of not guilty returned. However this direction was only required if the evidence was capable of supporting a conclusion that there was a reasonable possibility that the accused’s response to the threat he perceived was a proportionate response. The evidence was not capable of supporting such a conclusion.
	
	
	Further, given that a verdict of guilty of murder was found notwithstanding that manslaughter by excessive self-defence was left to the jury, it must follow that the jury found the Crown had rebutted beyond reasonable doubt the first component of the complete defence. Even if her Honour had instructed them as to the second aspect of the full defence, the jury, being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant did not inflict the wounds in the belief that this was necessary to defend himself, could not have reached a verdict of not guilty by reason of self-defence. Therefore failure to instruct on the second essential aspect of the full defence cannot have given rise to a miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	This is quite a different situation from that which arises where there has been a failure to leave manslaughter on some basis which was viable and the jury then returns a verdict of guilty of murder. In such a case it has been said that the verdict does not exclude the possibility that guilty of manslaughter might have been returned if properly left in the summing up: R v Kanaan (2005) 64 NSWLR 527; [2005] NSWCCA 385. Here, manslaughter by excessive self-defence was left and hence the element which is common to the direction on that subject and to a direction on the complete defence was before the jury. These facts are in contrast to those of Gilbert v The Queen (2000) 201 CLR 414; [2000] HCA 15.
	
	
	There was no basis in the evidence upon which her Honour could or should have left to the jury the “second limb” and, hence, the complete defence of self-defence. Even if there had been a basis for this in the evidence, the jury’s verdict returned on the directions they were given about the first limb shows that they would not have upheld the complete defence. The applicant therefore lost nothing by reason of the “second limb” not having been left. Leave should be given to argue ground 1. Ground 1 is rejected.
	


Ground 2 – Failure to leave manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act

2.   The learned trial judge erred in not leaving manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act to the jury.


	
	As already noted, the possibility of leaving manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act was never raised or advanced by defence counsel. She did refer to voluntary manslaughter by criminal negligence at T 1143.30. This was mentioned fleetingly on the basis that the applicant had negligently left the deceased’s apartment knowing she was bleeding profusely. Her Honour drew counsel’s attention to the fact that if murder was not found proved on the basis of the applicant’s acts up to that point, the applicant would be entitled to a verdict of not guilty (or guilty of manslaughter by excessive self-defence) and that the Crown had not opened or attempted to support a case arising from acts or omissions after the infliction of the two critical stab wounds. This was undoubtedly correct and defence counsel evidently thought better of pressing for a direction about manslaughter by criminal negligence. The subject was not raised again.
	
	
	At T 1331.4, her Honour stated she would not sum up on manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act (having come to the view that if the jury were to find proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death, then nothing less than a very serious injury could have been intended. The applicant’s counsel did not demur. In accordance with Wilson v The Queen (1992) 174 CLR 313; [1992] HCA 31, an unlawful and dangerous act is one contrary to the criminal law and which carries with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. An accused will be guilty of manslaughter on this basis if:
	



	
	the accused intentionally commits an act;
	
	
	which is unlawful and dangerous;
	
	
	which results in death;
	
	
	in circumstances where a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have realised that by the act another person was exposed to the appreciable risk of serious injury.
	



	
	Proof of intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, as required for murder, is obviously not necessary to make out manslaughter on this basis. The applicant seeks to support this ground of appeal on the basis that the infliction of the two critical stab wounds was the unlawful and dangerous act. He relies upon the evidence of the forensic medical specialists which, he submits, was that “only moderate force was needed to inflict the wounds sustained by the deceased”.
	
	
	As held in Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107; [1971] HCA 20; R v Kanaan and Lane v R (2013) 241 A Crim R 321; [2013] NSWCCA 317, the question whether a trial judge is obliged to leave manslaughter on a particular basis, notwithstanding the accused’s failure to request such a direction and/or despite positive opposition to it, turns upon whether there is evidence to support the alternative verdict. Put another way, it is whether the case for manslaughter is viable.
	
	
	Here, if the jury found that the first element of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act – intentional infliction of the two stab wounds – was proved beyond reasonable doubt, they could not fail to find that such wounds were intended to cause either death or grievous bodily harm. Whatever degree of force the jury may have thought to be comprehended by the terms “moderate” and the like, as used in the evidence of the forensic medical experts, the intentional thrusting into the chest cavity of a knife blade long enough to pass 18 cm through the right lung to the heart could not have been found by the jury to have been accompanied by an objective short of inflicting grievous bodily harm. Likewise, the stab to the neck with sufficient force to penetrate the musculature and jugular vein and to reach the larynx, if deliberate, necessarily by its nature would involve the intention requisite to support the charge of murder.
	
	
	There was no viable case to be left to the jury on this evidence that the stabbing if deliberate might have been no more than dangerous – that is, merely carrying an appreciable risk of serious injury but without intent to inflict at least grievous bodily harm. The nature of the wounds inflicted would not viably permit the jury to find that these were unlawful and dangerous acts stopping short of having been intended to inflict death or grievous bodily harm. Leave should be given to argue ground 2. Ground 2 is rejected.
	


Ground 3 – Provocation

3.   The learned trial judge erred in not leaving provocation to the jury.


	
	The date of Ms Yeo’s death, namely, 16 July 2012, preceded the amendments to s 23 of the Crimes Act made by the Crimes Amendment (Provocation) Act 2014 (NSW). Those amendments restricted the partial defence of provocation to the circumstance where the act or omission causing death was a response to “extreme provocation”, as defined. The amendments commenced on 13 June 2014 but do not apply to persons on trial for a murder allegedly committed before then (Crimes Act, s 23(9)).
	
	
	For murders allegedly committed prior to 13 June 2014, the previous form of s 23 of the Crimes Act is applicable. It provided for a partial defence of provocation which reduced murder to manslaughter where the act causing death was “done … under provocation”. Section 23(2) defined such an act as one which was the “result of a loss of self control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased ... towards or affecting the accused” (s 23(2)(a)) in circumstances where the conduct of the deceased was such “as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intention to kill, or inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased” (s 23(2)(b)) (emphasis added). The relevant conduct of the deceased could have “occurred immediately before the act … causing death or at any previous time”. The test posited by s 23(2)(a) is a question of fact whereas the test posited by s 23(2)(b) is a question of opinion or “evaluative fact” (Lindsay v The Queen (2015) 255 CLR 272; [2015] HCA 16 at [16]).
	
	
	Critically, former s 23(4) provided that where “there is any evidence that the act causing death was an act done or omitted under provocation” then the onus is on the prosecution to disprove provocation beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, the test for whether a trial judge should leave the partial defence of provocation to the jury is whether “on the version of events most favourable to the accused which is suggested by material in the evidence, a jury acting reasonably might fail to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the killing was unprovoked in the relevant sense” (Masciantonio v The Queen (1995) 183 CLR 58; [1995] HCA 67 at 67-68 per Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; Stingel v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 312; [1990] HCA 61 at 334 per the Court).
	
	
	In this case there was no submission made to the trial judge that provocation should be left to the jury. As the Crown stated in their submissions, “[t]the word [provocation] was never mentioned by anyone in the trial” (Crown submissions at [24]). Despite this, the applicant now says the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury on the issue.
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground referred to various circumstances leading to Ms Yeo’s death, which were said to be materially suggestive of Ms Yeo being stabbed under provocation. The acts of Ms Yeo “towards or affecting” the applicant instanced were: her conduct in disclosing her affair with the applicant to their employer, her alleged threats to disclose intimate texts and emails, her refusal to have any further contact with the applicant, her alleged slapping of the applicant after he told her she was an unsuitable mother (T 1035.30) and her alleged brandishing of a knife at the scene (T 1036.7).
	
	
	It is unnecessary to consider whether this material was capable of supporting a defence of provocation as discussed in Masciantonio because to raise the defence there had to be some evidence capable of suggesting the applicant’s stabbing of Ms Yeo was the “result of a loss of self-control” on his part. The written submissions did not cite any evidence capable of suggesting that the accused experienced “a loss of self-control” when Ms Yeo was stabbed. At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the applicant could not point to any evidence to that effect when he was asked to do so. The applicant’s evidence was completely to the contrary. His evidence is described in detail above. At this point it only suffices to note that he suggested that it was Ms Yeo who was out of control and that he tried to calm her by saying three times words to the effect that she was being “stupid” and should put the knife down (T 1036.25, 1037.9 and 1037.45). The accused agreed he told a neighbour that “[w]e’ll be okay, we are all right, don’t need the police” (T 1042.9). He stated that at that point he “had control of the situation, even though she had the knife in her hand” (T 1042.30).
	
	
	Even if it were permissible to leave aside the fact that the accused’s evidence was inconsistent with his experiencing a loss of self-control (see The Queen v Baden-Clay [2016] HCA 35; (2016) 90 ALJR 1013 at [57]), there was no other evidence capable of supporting such a conclusion. By contrast, in Lindsay it was common ground that there was some evidence from which a jury might have considered it possible that the accused “was provoked by the deceased’s conduct and that he lost his self-control” (at [16]). In Masciantonio there was said to be “ample evidence” to that effect (Masciantonio at 68). However, in this case there was none. Even if an application had been made to the trial judge to leave provocation to the jury her Honour would have been obliged to refuse it as there was not “any evidence that the act causing death was an act done …. under provocation” (s 23(4)).
	
	
	As this ground involves a question of mixed fact and law, leave to raise it is required (Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1)(b)). Further, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW) applies to this ground, and for that additional reason leave to rely on it as a ground of appeal is required. As it has no substance, both forms of leave are refused.
	


Ground 4 – Section 18 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW)

4.   The learned trial judge erred in not being satisfied that the wife of the appellant was aware of the effect of section 18 of the Evidence Act as it may apply to her.


	
	As this ground involves a question of mixed fact and law, leave to raise it is required (Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1)(b)). Further, as this ground is ultimately directed to the admission of evidence, no objection was made and the relevant evidence was taken at trial, then leave under r 4 is also required.
	
	
	The reference to the “wife of the appellant” in ground 4 is to Ms Mulvihill. Her evidence has been described above. It was likely to have been of great assistance to the Crown.
	
	
	This ground of appeal contends that, as the “procedure prescribed by s 18 of the Evidence Act” was not followed in relation to Ms Mulvihill’s evidence, her evidence was inadmissible. Section 18 provides:
	


18   Compellability of spouses and others in criminal proceedings generally

(1)   This section applies only in a criminal proceeding.

(2)   A person who, when required to give evidence, is the spouse, de facto partner, parent or child of a defendant may object to being required:

(a)   to give evidence, or

(b)   to give evidence of a communication between the person and the defendant,

as a witness for the prosecution.

(3)   The objection is to be made before the person gives the evidence or as soon as practicable after the person becomes aware of the right so to object, whichever is the later.

(4)   If it appears to the court that a person may have a right to make an objection under this section, the court is to satisfy itself that the person is aware of the effect of this section as it may apply to the person.

(5)   If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any objection under this section in the absence of the jury.

(6)   A person who makes an objection under this section to giving evidence or giving evidence of a communication must not be required to give the evidence if the court finds that:

(a)   there is a likelihood that harm would or might be caused (whether directly or indirectly) to the person, or to the relationship between the person and the defendant, if the person gives the evidence, and

(b)   the nature and extent of that harm outweighs the desirability of having the evidence given.

(7)   Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account by the court for the purposes of subsection (6), it must take into account the following:

(a)   the nature and gravity of the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted,

(b)   the substance and importance of any evidence that the person might give and the weight that is likely to be attached to it,

(c)   whether any other evidence concerning the matters to which the evidence of the person would relate is reasonably available to the prosecutor,

(d)   the nature of the relationship between the defendant and the person,

(e)   whether, in giving the evidence, the person would have to disclose matter that was received by the person in confidence from the defendant.

(8)   If an objection under this section has been determined, the prosecutor may not comment on:

(a)   the objection, or

(b)   the decision of the court in relation to the objection, or

(c)   the failure of the person to give evidence.


	
	No reference was made to s 18 of the Evidence Act during the trial, nor was there any suggestion that Ms Mulvihill was objecting to, or even reticent about, giving evidence for the Crown against her husband. To the contrary, prior to the empanelment of the jury, counsel for the applicant told the trial judge that Ms Mulvihill had provided a further statement to the police that had just been served (T 3.5). Counsel described her as the “estranged wife of the accused” and her Honour stated that Ms Mulvihill was “always a Crown witness”. Her Honour was not advised whether or not Ms Mulvihill was subpoenaed to give evidence. In cross-examination, counsel for the applicant suggested to Ms Mulvihill that she had an arrangement with the officer in charge of the investigation that he would “call [her] every Friday and update [her] with this matter” (T 747.5). The clear import of the cross-examination was to suggest that she was very willing to assist in the conviction of her (estranged) husband.
	
	
	At the hearing of the appeal, the Crown read an affidavit attaching numerous statements that Ms Mulvihill gave to the police to demonstrate that she willingly assisted them. This material only serves to confirm what was apparent on the material available to the trial judge although it has not played any part in the determination of this aspect of the appeal.
	
	
	The Crown contended that s 18 of the Evidence Act was not engaged because it was not demonstrated that Ms Mulvihill was “required to give evidence” (s 18(2)). It does not appear that Ms Mulvihill was subpoenaed and there is every indication she was actively assisting the Crown. However, one difficulty with this point is that it could be said that, either when Ms Mulvihill was called in Court to enter the witness box to give evidence or, when questions were posed of her in the witness box, she was then “required” to give evidence in the sense of being subject to a form of legal compulsion. In light of what follows it is not necessary to resolve this issue. The balance of the consideration of this ground proceeds (without deciding) on the assumption that Ms Mulvihill was “required to give evidence”.
	
	
	The argument in support of this ground appears to be that, notwithstanding the apparent willingness of Ms Mulvihill to assist the Crown at her husband’s trial, by reason of s 18(4) of the Evidence Act it was incumbent on the trial judge to satisfy herself that Ms Mulvihill was aware of her right to object to giving evidence, yet her Honour did not do so because there is nothing in the transcript of the trial to record her Honour being so satisfied. The effect of this, so it was said, was to render Ms Mulvihill’s evidence inadmissible.
	
	
	A consideration of this submission reveals that leave should not be allowed to raise this point on appeal when it was not raised at trial. In the absence of this ground being raised at the trial, there is no means of ascertaining whether Ms Mulvihill was not aware of her right to object to giving evidence. To the extent that there is material available, it suggests that she was very willing to give evidence against her estranged husband. She may have been advised of her right to object but decided not to exercise it. Most significantly, in circumstances where neither party raised s 18 and where it would have appeared to the trial judge that Ms Mulvihill was actively assisting the prosecution, it cannot be inferred from the absence of any express reference by her Honour to s 18(4) that her Honour was not satisfied in terms of that sub-section. Her Honour might have believed that the Crown advised all witnesses in Ms Mulvihill’s position of that right as a matter of course but Ms Mulvihill did not wish to raise it because she wanted to assist the prosecution of her estranged husband. If none of the Crown, the witness or the accused raised any issue about Ms Mulvihill giving evidence or made any reference to s 18, then it does not necessarily follow that her Honour would have felt any compulsion to record her formation of the opinion referred to in s 18(4) in the transcript.
	
	
	Further, one premise of the ground is that a failure by the trial judge to form the opinion referred to in s 18(4) renders evidence given by a person referred to in that section inadmissible. That premise is doubtful. In Gilmour v Environment Protection Authority; Tableland Topdressing Pty Ltd v Environment Protection Authority (2002) 55 NSWLR 593; [2002] NSWCCA 399 at [48] Santow JA (with whom Hidden and Adams JJ agreed) observed that “the section is not invoked by the Prosecution but can only be invoked by the spouse”. Arguably, the same applies to the accused in which case a failure to comply with the provision could not properly be said to affect his or her rights.
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant placed reliance on Demirok v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 20; [1977] HCA 21 for support of the proposition that evidence adduced as a consequence of non-compliance with s 18 was not admissible. In Demirok the accused’s wife was called by the prosecution. Section 400(1) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) then provided that a spouse of an accused was a competent but not a compellable witness at their trial. Section 400(2) obliged the trial judge to inform the accused’s wife that she was not compellable in the absence of the jury. In the absence of the jury she was advised of her right to object to giving evidence. She stated that she did not wish to give evidence. She was then recalled to give evidence before the jury and restated her objection. She was then excused. It was held that advising her of her right to object and excusing her from giving evidence in the presence of the jury was inconsistent with s 400(2) and therefore erroneous (at 31 to 32 per Gibbs J, at 33 to 34 per Stephen J, at 36 per Murphy J, at 39 per Aickin J; contra Barwick CJ). In this respect, s 18(5) of the Evidence Act is similar to sub-section 400(2) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) as considered in Demirok. However, that is of no relevance to this matter as in this case s 18 was not referred to at all in the presence of the jury. Of more assistance to the applicant is the statement by Gibbs J in Demirok (at 31) that “the course taken by the learned trial judge was erroneous, and that Mrs Demirok should not have been called to the witness box in the presence of the jury” and thus “what little evidence she then gave was inadmissible”.
	
	
	Under the statutory provisions considered in Demirok, if an objection was taken by a spouse to giving evidence then the spouse had to be excused. Hence, Gibbs J concluded that, had the section been complied with, the accused’s spouse’s evidence would not have been adduced at his trial. However, that is not the case under s 18 of the Evidence Act. With s 18, even if the applicant can raise a failure to comply with that provision as a basis upon which the evidence should have been excluded, a conclusion that Ms Mulvihill’s evidence would not have been adduced had the section been complied with can now only be reached if it could be concluded that Ms Mulvihill would have objected if she had been appraised of her right to do so and that the outcome of the weighing up process contemplated by s 18(6) would have resulted in her being excused from giving evidence. In the absence of the point being made at the trial and those matters addressed then there is no basis for either conclusion. If anything, the material suggests to the contrary.
	
	
	Leave to raise ground 4 is refused.
	


Ground 5 – Circumstantial evidence direction

5.   The learned trial judge erred in not giving the jury a circumstantial evidence direction.


	
	The applicant submits that the prosecution case of murder was circumstantial on the bases that: there was no eyewitness to the death of Ms Yeo and the prosecution substantially relied upon inferences to be drawn from the injuries to Ms Yeo, including the position of the two fatal stab wounds; the observations of the neighbours who heard yelling, screaming, and other noises; the relationship between Ms Yeo and the applicant; and the evidence of flight.
	
	
	At [47] of his written submissions, the applicant takes issue with a number of the trial judge’s directions to the jury in the context of her Honour referring to his evidence, including those at [100], [535] and [536] of the summing up, with particular emphasis on what was said at [536]. Those paragraphs are as follows:
	


[100]   Having regard to the accused’s evidence, if the Crown is to prove guilt on the charge of murder - and I am still dealing with the first element, being the primary focus and the dominant source of dispute between the parties - the Crown would be obliged, and in the course of her address Ms Crown said … she has discharged the obligation of satisfying you that the accused’s evidence, in the context of all of the evidence, is not a reasonably possible version of the circumstances in which the deceased sustained the fatal wounds and died, her death having occurred, as you would well accept I’m sure ladies and gentlemen, on any view of the evidence, some time between 9.04pm, when she left a voice message for Mr Hunt on his telephone, and 9.52, just short of fifty minutes later, when she was pronounced deceased by ambulance officers after police and emergency services effected forced entry into the unit. You would more likely accept, I am sure, that Ms Yeo died some time well before 9.52pm when, on the Crown case, she suffered cardiac arrest at the inside door of her home unit, again on the Crown case, at the time of, or very soon after the neighbours - and I will come to their evidence in a moment - heard everything in the home unit going quiet. (my emphasis)

…

[535]   Ms Traill [counsel for the applicant] identified 10 separate factual premises which, in combination, she submitted, would persuade you to accept the accused’s evidence as a reasonable possible explanation for why he came to be in the unit, and what happened in the unit. If you accept, as Ms Traill submits to you, and I remind you, if you accept the accused’s account as reasonably possible, that is, an account which you regard as open on the evidence, that would mean the Crown has not proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

[536]   The accused is entitled to the benefit of what you consider to be any reasonably possible acceptable explanation for what happened in the unit, and in those circumstances, if you regard his account of how either of the fatal wounds were inflicted as reasonably possible… the accused will be acquitted by you.


	
	The applicant contended that at [536] the trial judge erred in her use of the word “acceptable” but was not able, in oral submissions, to articulate how (as he said it does) that relevantly altered the meaning of the direction that was given. In context the expression “any reasonably possible acceptable explanation” must be understood as being any explanation of the evidence (other than the applicant’s guilt) that the jury accepted was reasonably possible. The word “acceptable” might be regarded as superfluous but it did not detract from the clear message given to the jury, which was that if they believed that the applicant’s account of how either of the fatal wounds were inflicted was reasonably possible then they should acquit him.
	
	
	The applicant maintains that her Honour should, in the circumstances of this case, have directed the jury to the effect that, even if they rejected his evidence, they could only convict if the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable explanation of the evidence other than his guilt.
	
	
	The Crown submits that this was not a case that required a circumstantial evidence direction because it was not a “circumstantial case” in the usual sense of that term, given that the applicant admitted having stabbed the deceased and thus causing her death. Pausing there, it is inaccurate to suggest (see [37] of the Crown’s submissions) that the applicant admitted stabbing Ms Yeo twice. Rather, he admitted that he was holding the knife when it penetrated Ms Yeo’s neck. Nevertheless, the gist of the Crown’s submission in this respect is that, in light of the applicant’s own evidence, the only issues for the jury were whether his acts were deliberate and whether they were undertaken with an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The Crown highlights several paragraphs of the summing up in which the trial judge directed the jury about the nature of the Crown’s onus of proof ([33]-[35], [40], [44], [46], [54]-[58], [62], [68], [76]-[78], [83], [87], [89], [94], [100]-[101], [103], [111], [136], [142], [156]-[158], [166], [168]-[169], [232], [244]-[245], [395], [409]-[411], [414]-[416], [440], [468]-[472], [522], [533], [535], [536], [553], [581] and [595]) and emphasises what was said by her Honour at [332]-[333], as well as what was said at [144]-[150] as to onus in the context of the Crown having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. It is not necessary here to reproduce those passages from the summing up. Suffice to say that there is no error there revealed.
	
	
	In oral argument, it was conceded by the applicant that this ground was not his strongest point. That concession was well made. There is no rule of law, nor any invariable rule of practice, that requires a direction of the kind the applicant contends should have been given to be given in every case involving circumstantial evidence (see Grant v The Queen (1975) 11 ALR 503; Shepherd v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 573; [1990] HCA 56 at 578 per Dawson J; The Queen v Keenan (2009) 236 CLR 397; [2009] HCA 1 at [126] per Kiefel J; see also JD Heydon, Cross on Evidence (10th ed, 2015, LexisNexis) at [9035], there citing McGreevy v Director of Public Prosecutions [1973] 1 All ER 503; R v P [2008] 2 Cr App R 6). Moreover, where the inference to be drawn is one relating to the accused’s state of mind, the usual practice is that no circumstantial evidence direction is required (see R v Tillott (1991) 53 A Crim R 46 at 50 per Hunt J, Gleeson CJ and Samuels JA agreeing; affirmed in Rogerson v R (1992) 65 A Crim R 530 at 545 per Loveday J, Hunt CJ at CL and Grove J agreeing).
	
	
	In Keenan, Kiefel J (at [126]) reiterated what was said by Dawson J in Shepherd, namely that the customary direction given in circumstantial evidence cases (i.e., that a jury can only find, by inference, an element of the offence charged if there is no other inference favourable to the accused reasonably open on the facts) is no more than the amplification of the rule that the prosecution must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. And as Dawson J made clear at [126] in Shepherd, it will be for the trial judge in the first instance to determine whether such a direction should be given in a particular case.
	
	
	In the present case, the applicant did not point to particular circumstances of the case (beyond the fact that, since there was no eyewitness, inferences were required to be drawn from the direct evidence) that might require the giving of the direction he now contends should have been made; nor was there otherwise any complaint as to the adequacy of the directions given in relation to the Crown’s onus of proof (apart from the use of the word “acceptable” at [536] of the summing up).
	
	
	The applicant’s submission that the primary judge should have directed the jury that, even if they rejected his evidence, they could only convict if the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable explanation of the evidence other than his guilt, suffers from the difficulty that his version of events was the only explanation of the evidence on which the jury could reasonably have returned a verdict of not guilty to murder. It could not sensibly have been postulated that Ms Yeo deliberately stabbed herself both in the neck and in the chest, particularly in light of the evidence of her screams and calls for assistance as well as all the other injuries that she suffered. For the reasons considered earlier in the context of grounds 1-3, if the jury rejected the applicant’s evidence that the fatal wounds had been accidentally inflicted, there was no other reasonably possible explanation of the evidence than that of murder.
	
	
	No circumstantial evidence direction was requested at the trial. Therefore, leave to raise this ground 5 is required. It should be refused.
	


Ground 6A – Prejudicial comments

Ground 6B – Rule in Browne v Dunn

6A.   The trial miscarried because of prejudicial comments made by the prosecutor.

6B.   The trial miscarried because of breaches of the rule in Browne v Dunn by the prosecutor.


	
	At the outset, a number of points should be noted about these two grounds, which were grouped together for the purpose of the applicant’s submissions.
	
	
	First, insofar as ground 6A in its terms suggests some form of prosecutorial misconduct, the oral submissions made clear that the complaint the subject of this ground relates solely to the alleged breaches of the so-called rule in Browne v Dunn (1894) 6 R 67. The applicant takes issue with a number of statements made by the Crown Prosecutor in the course of addressing the jury and contends that the matters the subject of prosecutorial comment should have been, but were not, put directly to the applicant in cross-examination. That is the sole basis for the complaint that the Crown Prosecutor breached her duty to present the Crown case fairly (as to which duty, see Wood v R (2012) 84 NSWLR 581; [2012] NSWCCA 21 at [572]ff).
	
	
	Second, a large number of the matters raised in the written submissions in relation to these two grounds were either expressly abandoned (such as the submissions at [50]; [63]-[70]) or were described as being matters of background ([58]) or general submission ([60]). It is not necessary to address any of those matters.
	
	
	Finally, as to the “rule” in Browne v Dunn, it is important to note that it is a rule of practice (see Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 16), the essential foundation of which is the requirement of fairness. The “rule” was explained by Lord Herschell LC in Browne v Dunn as follows:
	


... where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged, and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit... If you intend to impeach a witness you are bound, whilst he is in the box, to give him an opportunity of making any explanation which is open to him ...


	
	The rule in essence requires that appropriate notice be given of any imputation sought to be made against the other party or any of his or her witnesses about his or her conduct relevant to the case, or a party’s or a witness’ credit (as so articulated in MWJ v The Queen [2005] HCA 74; (2005) 80 ALJR 329 per Gummow, Kirby and Callinan JJ at [38]).
	
	
	It is not a “hard-and-fast” rule, Lord Herschell LC noting (at 71 in Browne v Dunn) that:
	


... Of course I do not deny for a moment that there are cases in which that notice has been so distinctly and unmistakably given, and the point upon which he is impeached, and is to be impeached, is so manifest, that it is not necessary to waste time in putting questions to him upon it. All I am saying is that it will not do to impeach the credibility of a witness upon a matter on which he has not had any opportunity of giving an explanation by reason of there having been no suggestion whatever in the course of the case that his story is not accepted. (my emphasis)


	
	In the present case, the applicant complains about statements made in relation to the following five matters:
	


The pillow incident


	
	In her opening address, the Crown Prosecutor, when outlining the evidence that she anticipated would be called in the Crown case, made reference to the pillow incident on 12 July 2012 referred to at [26] above, namely the occasion when Ms Mulvihill said she was in her daughter’s bed and her husband came into the room and placed a pillow on her head. In relation to that incident, in the opening of the Crown case, the Crown Prosecutor told the jury that:
	


Theresa said she wasn’t worried about it because she knew he didn’t mean anything by it, but he said to her “I am not going to do it to you, it’s her, it’s her”.


	
	The applicant now makes no complaint about this statement in the opening (see AT 27; cf [50] of his written submissions). However, complaint is made as to the fact that it was not put to him in cross-examination that the words said by the applicant were a reference to him thinking thoughts about the deceased and what he was going to do to her.
	
	
	Both the applicant and Ms Mulvihill gave evidence about the pillow incident.
	
	
	In her evidence in chief, Ms Mulvihill said (T 725) that the applicant said “It’s not you, it’s her”. In cross-examination about the incident (T 750-752) it was put to her that her husband never used the word “Rachelle” when he spoke to her that night and she said “He never does. He always referred to her as, “her””.
	
	
	In his evidence in chief, the applicant gave his version of what had occurred (T 1010-1011). He said that he did not recall what was said in the conversation. He was not cross-examined about the incident.
	
	
	In closing submissions (T 1231.15-22) the Crown Prosecutor referred to the pillow incident in the context of things that she said gave an indication that the applicant went to the unit to kill Ms Yeo and that he had decided to kill her “possibly some days before”:
	


So we have got the incident with his wife Teresa Mulvihill, where on the Crown case, he puts a pillow over her head and says “it’s not you, it’s her”, and that indicates he is already thinking thoughts about Rachelle Yeo and what he is going to do to her. On the Crown case, if he hasn’t decided absolutely what he is going to do, he is certainly well on his way, because that’s what he means when he says to Theresa, “it’s not you, it’s her”. And it is in the context of putting a pillow over her head. It must mean that he had, as I say, either formed the intention or was very close to it. (my emphasis)


	
	The applicant complains that this was never put to him.
	
	
	At T 1245.16-21 the Crown Prosecutor again referred to the pillow incident and to what Ms Mulvihill said the applicant said after he put the pillow over her head, and said:
	


From then the Crown case is that he already has in his mind that he is going to do some harm to Rachelle Yeo, and at that time or very soon after, certainly by 13 July he has planned that he is going to kill her.


	
	The applicant notes that in her summing up (at [585]) the trial judge referred to the connotation the Crown contended for in relation to the pillow incident as being that “the accused [was] revealing in an unguarded, uninhibited alcohol fuelled moment that he was planning to kill the deceased”.
	
	
	The applicant was cross-examined along the lines that he deliberately went to the unit to kill Ms Yeo: the Crown put to him that he had followed her home on a previous occasion and found out where she lived and that he went there on 16 July, concealing his departure from the Marriott Hotel, because he intended to kill her. It was also put to him that he carried on with that plan in disposing of his bloodied clothing after the incident. However, his complaint is that he was not cross-examined as to the Crown case that, by the time of the pillow incident, he had formed the intention to kill Ms Yeo. He says that if that was the Crown case it should have been put to him.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the applicant had ample opportunity to deal with the suggestion that he had decided to kill the deceased by the time of the pillow incident, since that incident occurred in the early hours of 13 July 2012 (T 723-725) and points out that at T 1105.19 the Crown Prosecutor had put to the applicant:
	


I want to suggest to you that on 13 July 2012, when you spoke to Lyn Paisley [on the evening of Friday, 13 July 2012 – T 648], you already decided that you were going to go and kill Rachelle Yeo; what do you say to that?

to which the applicant responded “I totally disagree”.


	
	There is no merit in this complaint. The applicant was aware of the evidence that his wife gave at the trial as to the pillow incident. He was aware of what the Crown Prosecutor had said in the opening about the incident. He was given the opportunity in his evidence in chief to tell the jury about the pillow incident and he did so. He said he did not recall the conversation that his wife had recounted in her evidence. There was no unfairness to him in it not being put to him that the pillow incident revealed he had formed an intention to kill Ms Yeo, particularly in circumstances where what was put to him was that the reason he went to Ms Yeo’s unit was to kill her (which he denied) (T 1070.40). Moreover, he gave evidence in chief that he had never at any time formed the intent to kill her (as referred to earlier [91]).
	


The white plastic chain


	
	The second matter to which the applicant refers relates to the white plastic chain that was found (with Ms Yeo’s blood on it) on the driveway outside her unit block. As earlier noted, Ms Mulvihill gave evidence that she had seen a white plastic chain in her husband’s carry-on bag on 13 July 2012.
	
	
	During the Crown Prosecutor’s opening address to the jury (as she was describing that, on the Crown case, the applicant had been waiting outside the unit block for Ms Yeo to get there and followed her up the stairs and rushed in behind her as she walked in the front door and attacked her there), the Crown Prosecutor held up a white plastic chain, one end of which she said was covered with what turned out to be Ms Yeo’s blood (T 110.4). The Crown Prosecutor then said:
	


The Crown case is he brought it to the apartment in order to kill Rachelle Yeo. He used it as a ligature to strangle her and that may be the way he got in behind her when she walked in through the front door (T 110.8-11).


	
	Again at T 116.24-27, the Crown Prosecutor said:
	


So what’s happened is she’s come up the stairs, the accused has come behind her, he has either used the white chain and perhaps pulled it around the neck like that, or pulled her or punched her in some way. Quite simply, he was not invited into her premises.


	
	The applicant says that there was no evidence that Ms Yeo had been strangled or had suffered any injury consistent with it having been inflicted with the white chain (referring to the evidence of both Professor Duflou and Professor Hilton) and says that the small amount of Ms Yeo’s blood on one end of the chain was consistent with the applicant having been in possession of it (something that he denied in cross-examination) or with him having trodden on it after leaving the unit.
	
	
	The applicant did not identify those parts of the medical evidence on which he relied for this submission. The Crown, however, referred to the following evidence.
	
	
	First, Professor Hilton (at T 803-804) accepted that the chain was something that could have been used as a ligature; that a neck compression was a form of strangulation and agreed that there were signs not inconsistent with neck compression on the deceased, namely two marks that might or might not represent fingertip bruises or abrasions and a collection of smaller petechiae on the left hand that were “suggestive, but by no means diagnostic, of neck compression”.
	
	
	Second, Dr Van Vuuren gave evidence to the effect that the bruises on the left-hand side of Ms Yeo’s neck could be consistent with some kind of force applied to the neck (T 663-664) and that petechial haemorrhages (some of which were observed under Ms Yeo’s left lower eyelid) could be caused by ligature and manual strangulation, though also by resuscitation (T 663).
	
	
	Third, the Crown referred to the evidence in chief of Professor Duflou (T 772-773) and in cross-examination (at T 777-778). In summary, Professor Duflou accepted that the white plastic chain was something that could be used as a ligature (though saying it was “an unusual ligature”). In cross-examination, Professor Duflou said that there were no marks typical of strangulation; that there were petechial haemorrhages (pinpoint areas of bleeding) on one eye but that on its own this was not an indication of strangulation; that at autopsy there was no evidence for strangulation having taken place but it was possible for there to be a degree of neck compression that could not be seen; that he did not see any marks on the neck of the deceased consistent with that white chain; and no indication of either manual strangulation or ligature strangulation having occurred.
	
	
	It was put to the applicant in cross-examination that he had the white plastic chain with him in the hoodie “for use if required” and that it got some blood on it during the course of the stabbing of Ms Yeo and that it fell out of his hoodie when he jumped over the balcony (T 1066.34). The applicant’s response was that he had never seen the white chain before (T 1066.39; 45; 48). The Crown Prosecutor then commented (T 1067.1) in what the applicant says was an attempt to belittle him, “That’s a good way to explain it, say you’ve never seen it before.”
	
	
	In her closing address to the jury, the Crown Prosecutor made a number of references to the white plastic chain.
	
	
	At T 1206.30, she referred to it and said:
	


It might not be the best – as I think I said to you – sort of item to use as a ligature, or some form of restraint, but it is certainly capable of being used in that way. And remember the accused travelled from Brisbane to Sydney. He had to go on an aeroplane and, as he told you, his practice was to take his luggage on board with him. That meant his hand luggage had to go through an x-ray machine. So he can’t take any metal objects with him. And he has to take something, you might think, that doesn’t immediately raise the interest of the people who are manning the x-ray machines.


	
	The applicant complains that the suggestion as to the need to take something that would pass through the airport x-ray scanning machines was not put to him in cross-examination.
	
	
	At T 1245.27 the Crown Prosecutor referred to the applicant buying the hoodie (which she said was so that he could protect his identity) and went on to say that he travelled to Sydney on 16 July with the hoodie and the white plastic chain in his bag and that “he carries those two items for the sole and express purpose of using them to assist in what he has determined to do that evening, and that is to go to Rachelle Yeo’s unit and kill her”.
	
	
	At T 1246.23, the Crown Prosecutor said that the applicant had gone to the unit “with his hands as potential weapons, the plastic chain, and …obviously in the knowledge that there would be other implements to use if necessary available in your typical domestic kitchen”.
	
	
	The Crown points out that the Crown Prosecutor did not ever suggest that the applicant had used anything as a ligature to “strangle” Ms Yeo. Rather, the Crown says that the essence of the Crown case about the white chain was that it was a possible weapon and that it was possible that there had been application of neck compression by that or some other means (such as by an arm around the throat) as was elicited in the cross-examination of Professor Hilton. The Crown case, as noted by her Honour in summing up at [374], was that there was an available inference that the applicant had gained access to the unit behind an unsuspecting victim and had used a chokehold or some sort of restraint with his arm around her neck.
	
	
	The Crown argues that there was no point putting anything, such as the suggestion that the applicant may have taken a plastic chain with him in order to avoid the airport scanning machines, to the applicant since he had sworn that he had never seen the white plastic chain before, let alone taken it to Ms Yeo’s unit.
	
	
	Again, there is no merit to this ground. The applicant was aware of the evidence of his wife that she had seen a white plastic chain in his bag, and that she had discussed it with him later and he had asked her not to mention it to the police. It was clear from the Crown’s opening address that the Crown was suggesting that this demonstrated some form of pre-meditation. The applicant had the opportunity to address that suggestion, and did so by denying that he had ever seen the chain. In those circumstances, the suggestion by the Crown Prosecutor that the plastic chain may have been brought to avoid complications that may have arisen at the airport scanning machines was not a matter that could have caused any unfairness to the applicant, particularly in light of the medical evidence that there was no sign on Ms Yeo’s body that it had been used as a ligature.
	
	
	As to the suggestion that there had been unfair conduct in attempting to belittle the applicant, any such complaint should have been addressed at the time. Without knowing the tone in which that comment or aside was said it is impossible to conclude that it was unfair for the Crown Prosecutor to have said it. Counsel for the applicant did no more at the time than say “Your Honour”. The very experienced trial judge clearly did not see the need to admonish the Crown Prosecutor for the making of such a comment.
	


The knife


	
	The next matter about which the applicant complains relates to the knife that was involved in the altercation which led to Ms Yeo’s death. The knife has never been found. The applicant says he threw it out of his car window somewhere into the bushes on Delhi Road after he left Ms Yeo’s unit. Ms Yeo’s brother gave evidence that there was a knife missing from the utensil block in Ms Yeo’s kitchen.
	
	
	First, the applicant complains that he was not cross-examined on his version that it was Ms Yeo who first took hold of the knife and threatened him with it, yet the Crown Prosecutor (T 1185.23) suggested to the jury that “most likely” it was the applicant who grabbed the knife when Ms Yeo was “putting up such a struggle against him”.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the Crown Prosecutor accepted that it was possible that Ms Yeo had grabbed the knife first, not to threaten the applicant with it, but to protect herself from his attack and says that there was nothing unexpected about such a submission.
	
	
	There is no merit in this complaint since the question of who held the knife in the course of the struggle was one on which the applicant had every opportunity to put his version of events, and did so.
	
	
	Second, the applicant complains that in the summing up (at [371]) the trial judge invited the jury to speculate when her Honour told the jury that even if the knife missing from Ms Yeo’s kitchen was the knife used, “you would not conclude that he didn’t have a knife with him, that he then took with him, along with the bloodied knife and chain when he left”. The relevant passage of the summing up ([371]) was as follows:
	


The Crown says a knife in the form, shape and dimension of Exhibit L was identified by Ms Yeo’s family as being a knife that she had in the unit. The Crown cannot say, although it may not need to trouble you too much, that that was in fact the knife used. And even if it was the knife he used, you would not conclude that he didn’t have a knife with him, that he then took with him, along with the bloodied knife and chain when he left.


	
	The applicant points out that there was no evidence that he took a knife to the unit and complains that he was not cross-examined about any such possibility.
	
	
	The Crown submits that neither this, nor the Crown Prosecutor’s submission which grounded it, invited the jury to speculate; rather, it addressed the fact that the Crown was not able to say what, other than the white plastic chain, the applicant might have brought with him to the unit.
	
	
	The passage in the summing up at [371] is clearly a restatement of the Crown case in relation to pre-meditation. The Crown submission was to the effect that if the knife that was used in the altercation came from the unit this was not necessarily inconsistent with the Crown case that the applicant had a premeditated plan to kill Ms Yeo (because the applicant could have had a knife with him which he took with him when he went there). Where there was evidence to suggest a premeditated killing (presumably this being a reference to the matters to which the Crown referred as indicative of pre-meditation), the Crown submits that the reference to a possibility that there had been another knife cannot be said to be pure speculation. (The applicant’s argument is that this is speculation just as it would be if the trial judge had referred to the possibility that he had taken a gun with him to the unit.)
	
	
	The applicant addressed the suggestion of pre-meditation in his evidence in chief by referring to his purpose in going to the unit, namely that he was going to try and talk to Ms Yeo (T 1020.21), for “closure” (T 1056.18). As the Crown submits, that evidence was consistent with a denial that he had carried a knife with him to the unit.
	
	
	The defence submission to the jury was that the applicant had formed the intention when he was in the bar at the Marriott Hotel to go and see if he could see Ms Yeo (T 1298.48) and that when she came home he did not hide or jump out at her; rather, she invited him in – something said to be established by the fact that the light was on the in kitchen and her bags were with her clothes that she wore to work that day in the kitchen (T 1300.15). Had the defence wished to do so, it was open to counsel to point out to the jury there was no evidence that the applicant had taken a knife with him and that they ought to infer that, because it appeared that the knife in the knife block already in the kitchen was the knife that was used, there was no premeditation. There is no merit in the complaint that it was not put to the applicant that he had taken a knife or a weapon of some kind other than the white plastic chain with him to the unit, in circumstances where it was clearly put to him (and he denied it) that he had gone to the unit with the intention of killing Ms Yeo.
	
	
	Next, there is a complaint that the Crown Prosecutor told the jury that it was “physically impossible” for Ms Yeo to have suffered the fatal stab wounds in the manner alleged by the applicant (T 1153.20; T 1226.31, T 1235.18). The applicant accepts that it was put to him that his description of the way in which the deceased was wounded was physically impossible. However, his complaint is that it was not suggested to him why that was so.
	
	
	In closing submissions the Crown Prosecutor referred to the demonstration that the applicant had given during his examination in chief, using a ruler, of the incident in which he said that Ms Yeo was stabbed by the knife as she held the handle (T 1226.24-37). It appears from the transcript that what the Crown Prosecutor then did was to demonstrate with a ruler how it was physically impossible for Ms Yeo’s hand to stick the knife into her body as she was falling down; and for the knife to have got under her right underarm.
	
	
	The applicant submits that the evidence of Professor Hilton was not consistent with this. He refers to Professor Hilton’s evidence about the positions of the wounds (T 807.4-23). There, Professor Hilton had been asked by the trial judge whether it was likely that either of the wounds “running at, tracking horizontally into the neck and into the chest” could have been sustained by Ms Yeo falling onto a knife. He said:
	


A:   I think it is, I will repeat, I think one is unlikely, two is much more unlikely, I don’t really want to open up another avenue but the use of the word ‘horizontal’ by Dr Van Vuuren, it has got to be understood that Dr Van Vuuren was talking as a pathologist about describing a body and wounds on it from the aspect of an anatomical body in the anatomical position. So that, to receive a chest wound, with the body in the anatomical position which is vertical, then, the wound entered into the right side of the chest and talking in these terms, when horizontally more or less, but of course, in real life the body is not always in the anatomical position, and where there is a situation of struggle, party A moves, party B moves, often quite violently and quite extensively so the fact that in the anatomical terms where the wound occurs horizontally doesn’t mean to say that the implement went in in a vertical, horizontal, oblique, diagonal, you can’t deduce how it went in, in a fluid situation”.


	
	He also said that it depended on the position of the two parties.
	
	
	The nub of the present complaint is that, when it was put to the applicant that it was physically impossible for the wounds to have occurred that way, there was no further elaboration. It is said that the applicant should have been given an opportunity to answer the question as to physical impossibility by reference to what was said was impossible. Again, no complaint was made about this at the trial.
	
	
	The difficulty with this complaint is that the jury had seen the demonstration by the applicant in the first place (using a ruler); they had heard the evidence as to what occurred; and then they were in a position to form a view as to the demonstration by the Crown as to what the applicant had said (and demonstrated) had occurred. Whether what the applicant had demonstrated was physically impossible was something that the jury was capable of assessing for themselves, having seen the demonstration and heard the evidence. If the Crown Prosecutor’s demonstration in closing address had in some way misportrayed the earlier demonstration, no doubt the applicant’s counsel would have been quick to point that out.
	
	
	The Crown also notes that the Crown Prosecutor did not have an opportunity to put questions to Professor Hilton regarding the demonstration given by the applicant because Professor Hilton’s evidence was interposed during the Crown case, at which time it was not known what demonstration the applicant would give. The Crown points out that the potential prejudice to the Crown in the presentation of its case was identified by her Honour in the absence of the jury (T 1150) and that, in the summing up (at [200]-[203]), her Honour referred to the fact that the accused’s detailed account of how the wounds were sustained was not put to either of the forensic pathologists for their comment. No issue is taken by the applicant as to the summing up in this regard and nothing turns on the interposition of Professor Hilton’s evidence for the purposes of this appeal. Therefore there is no need to address the Crown’s submission in relation to this.
	
	
	There is no merit to the complaint that the actual physical mechanism by which it was suggested that there was a physical impossibility for the wounds to have been inflicted in the way the applicant said they were was not put to him. He was clearly on notice that the Crown challenged his contention as to the manner in which the fatal injuries were inflicted. The forensic experts addressed that issue, albeit that they were not asked in detail as to the applicant’s account. If the suggestion is that the Crown Prosecutor should have conducted a physical demonstration herself during the course of cross-examination so as to give the applicant an opportunity yet again to demonstrate how he said the wounds were inflicted (which seems to be the logical consequence of the applicant’s submission) that should be rejected. There was no unfairness to the applicant in circumstances where he was well aware that the Crown challenged the physical possibility of his version of events and he had every opportunity to respond to that (himself or through expert evidence).
	


The disputed telephone call on about 9/10 July 2012


	
	The next matter relates to a telephone call that the applicant said he had received from Ms Yeo on about 9 or 10 July 2012. His evidence was that Ms Yeo rang him and asked whether everything was going to be okay at an upcoming work conference that they were both going to be attending. The applicant characterises this as a call where Ms Yeo wanted to know whether or not there would be any problem or difficulty or confrontation there. He said that during that telephone call Ms Yeo asked him whether his lease was about to expire and what he was going to do then; and he said he was moving back home (T 1008.30-1009.11).
	
	
	To put this into context in terms of the chronology of events, a friend of the applicant’s (Lynette Paisley) gave evidence (T 649.47ff) that around 13 July the applicant had rung her and had told her that Ms Yeo had telephoned him out of the blue and asked what he was going to do when his lease expired. She said that he was confused and asked if that meant that Ms Yeo was thinking about a future with him (T 653).
	
	
	The applicant’s complaint seems to be that the Crown Prosecutor mischaracterised this call as being about his lease on an apartment running out; when it was about the upcoming work conference. There is no merit to such a complaint having regard to Ms Paisley’s evidence as to what was said in the course of the call.
	
	
	What the Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury (T 1163) was that the call from Ms Yeo never happened (a submission for which there was a proper basis since there was nothing in Ms Yeo’s telephone records to show such a call having been made) and submitted that Ms Yeo would not have called the applicant to ask him whether his lease was up and whether he was going to move back home. The Crown Prosecutor then went on to postulate another possibility, clearly adverting to premeditation, namely that:
	


What is the other possibility, that the accused rang Lynette Paisley at that time because he was already thinking about what he was going to do to Rachelle Yeo, and he was setting up this diversion, if you like, already, to say oh, yes she called me out of the blue. …


	
	No complaint is made as to the submission that this call was a diversion.
	


Hire car


	
	The next complaint is as to the submission by the Crown Prosecutor (T 1167.17) that the applicant had asked his close friend and work colleague, Simon Martin, about a hire car with the intention of borrowing it and using it to see Ms Yeo. The Crown Prosecutor submitted to the jury that one reason why the applicant would ask Mr Martin about a hire car that evening was to distance himself even further from his intention of going to see Ms Yeo’s home that evening. In the closing address the Crown also noted that Mr Martin’s evidence was that the applicant had never before asked if he had a hire car (T 638.46).
	
	
	The complaint now made is that the suggestion that the applicant was seeking to distance himself by asking about the hire car was not put to the applicant in cross-examination. The applicant points out that there was no evidence that he had asked to borrow the hire car; just if Mr Martin had a hire car.
	
	
	The applicant maintains that, if this was a premeditated murder, then it would be unlikely that he would want to take someone else’s hire car to the scene or the vicinity because, if it had been seen there, it could be linked to the person who hired it who would then say that he had lent it to the applicant. Hence it is submitted that the Crown argument was not a rational one.
	
	
	The Crown points out that Mr Martin’s evidence that the applicant had asked if he had a hire car on the evening of 16 July 2012 was not challenged. It was suggested to him in cross-examination that it was said as a joke (T 645-646). The Crown submits that it was obvious that one of the reasons that Mr Martin was called by the Crown to give evidence was to suggest that the request for his hire car was unusual. The Crown points out that the applicant did not give evidence about it at all. The Crown submits that in those circumstances it was not unfair for the Crown Prosecutor to make the submission which was made. That submission should be accepted. There is no merit to this complaint.
	


How the applicant discovered Ms Yeo’s address


	
	The final matter about which complaint was made under these grounds was the submission (T 1170) by the Crown Prosecutor that the applicant had not come to know where Ms Yeo lived by (as the applicant said) seeing through the tinted windows of her car her address on an envelope in her car in the car park on the day of her death. The complaint is as to the submission by the Crown Prosecutor that:
	


One of the possibilities is what I suggested to him, and that is that he followed her home in the past, and because he had been working to find where she had lived for some time, and you see that in the objective evidence which is available to you, which also includes him doing Internet searches, clearly trying to find her address.


	
	The applicant submits that the suggestion that he had possibly followed Ms Yeo home sometime in the past was speculation and that there was no evidence to support it. The suggestion was, however, put to the applicant in cross-examination and he had the opportunity to answer it. The Crown Prosecutor also put to him that no such letter had been discovered by the police when they searched Ms Yeo’s car.
	
	
	The Crown submits that the applicant’s version of just happening to find a letter addressed to the deceased on the passenger seat of her car was nothing less than remarkable. The Crown points out that, in sentencing the applicant, her Honour said (at [50]-[51]):
	


He claimed, however, that despite coming to Sydney early in the afternoon on 16 July for the express purpose of confronting her, he only came to learn of her address when, somewhat serendipitously, after he arrived in Sydney he looked through the tinted windows of her car parked at Sanofi Aventis and saw an envelope addressed to her lying on the seat.

At trial he denied that his multiple internet searches from late May 2012 up to and including 3 July 2012 (including specific searches on real estate sites, Google maps and White Pages) were directed to finding where she lived. Instead, he claimed, amongst other equally transparent justifications, an interest in Sydney real estate. While there is no evidence in the Crown case as to when and how the offender discovered Ms Yeo’s address, I discount entirely that he found it in the circumstances he claimed in his evidence as I do his evidence concerning the internet searches.


	
	There is no merit to this complaint. The applicant had every opportunity to address the issue of how he came to be at Ms Yeo’s address. It was not unfair for the Crown Prosecutor to point to the implausibility of the applicant fortuitously seeing the address on an envelope in the car, particularly in circumstances where, as her Honour ultimately found, the applicant had been making concerted attempts to discover the address for some time. Nor was it unfair for the Crown Prosecutor to suggest to the applicant in cross-examination that he had followed Ms Yeo home in the past. There was certainly evidence that he had attempted to discover her whereabouts and, when at the Sydney office, had asked where she was.
	


Conclusion


	
	None of these matters was raised with the trial judge. There were no breaches of the rule in Browne v Dunn by the Crown Prosecutor. If there had been any unfairness perceived in the manner in which the submissions complained of were made, it is to be expected that the experienced trial judge would have intervened. These grounds are without merit. Leave to rely on them should be refused.
	


Ground 7 – Flight as consciousness of guilt

7.   The trial judge erred in her directions on consciousness of guilt relating to both “lies” and flight by not directing the jury that consciousness of guilt could relate to both murder and manslaughter.


	
	Although ground 7, as framed, encompasses both lies and flight, at the hearing of the appeal the sole complaint pressed under this ground was in relation to the applicant’s post-offence conduct in leaving Ms Yeo’s unit (by jumping over the balcony) and apparently evading arrest. Where flight is relied on as evidencing a consciousness of guilt as part of a circumstantial case, it need not be established beyond reasonable doubt (Minniti v R (2006) 159 A Crim R 394; [2006] NSWCCA 30).
	
	
	The jury must be directed as to the way it can use evidence of flight as consciousness of guilt in a similar way to the directions in relation to the use of lies as consciousness of guilt (see R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [25]). However, evidence of flight may be so connected with the offence that it may be unnecessary to give a direction on consciousness of guilt (Ristevski v R [2007] NSWCCA 87 at [34]).
	
	
	In R v Cook, Simpson J (as her Honour then was), with whom Ipp JA and Adams J agreed, referred (at [24]) to the conditions (derived from R v Lucas [1981] 1 QB 720, there in the context of lies, and adopted in the judgment of Clarke JA in R v Heyde (1990) 20 NSWLR 234) from which a jury may reasonably infer that an accused person has acted out of a consciousness of guilt, those being:
	


(i)   that the lie is deliberate;

(ii)   that it relates to a material issue;

(iii)   that the motive for the lie is a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth;

(iv)   (where relevant) that it is shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of an accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is, by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.


	
	In the case of flight, her Honour added a fifth condition, being that evidence of flight may be admitted where the jury may legitimately infer that the flight was occasioned by consciousness in the accused person of guilt – that is, of guilt of the offence with which he/she is charged (at [25]).
	
	
	In Penza and Di Maria v R [2013] NSWCCA 21 at [191] (approved in Grogan v R [2016] NSWCCA 168), Hoeben CJ at CL, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court, observed:
	


It seems to me that care has to be taken when applying her Honour’s fifth principle. On the facts in Cook, it was clearly applicable. There are, however, limits to its applicability. It does not mean that in any case where there was evidence of consciousness of guilt with regard to a major crime, and the accused accepted that he or she had committed a minor crime that therefore evidence of consciousness of guilt would be inadmissible. If there is a logical connection between the actions relied upon as evidencing a consciousness of guilt and the offence in respect of which that evidence is adduced, I would regard the evidence as admissible.


	
	In Grogan, RS Hulme AJ observed (at [72]) that Hoeben CJ at CL’s approach accords with that apparent in the remarks of the majority of the High Court in Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193; [1993] HCA 63 at 209 to the effect that “the lie must relate to a material issue because the telling of it must be explicable only on the basis that the truth would implicate the accused in the offence with which he is charged. It must be for that reason that he tells the lie”.
	
	
	Post-offence conduct may also be relevant to negative a defence of self-defence or provocation (see Gall v R [2015] NSWCCA 69 at [92]-[93]). In Gall, the appellant was convicted of a number of offences, including murder. The appellant admitted he had shot the deceased. The issue before the jury was the intention of the appellant at the time of the shooting and the relevant question was whether the Crown had negatived the appellant’s less culpable explanation for the shooting (i.e., that he was defending himself and his father out of genuine fear) to the relevant standard. On that issue, the Crown relied on the post offence conduct. Hoeben CJ at CL (with whom RA Hulme J and Davies J agreed) held (at [91]-[93]) that in those circumstances a consciousness of guilt direction would have involved circular reasoning:
	


When the issue before the jury was as clear as this, to have given a consciousness of guilt direction would have needlessly complicated the question which the jury had to decide. It would have involved a circularity of reasoning, i.e. the jury could only be satisfied as to consciousness of guilt if they were also satisfied that Kevin Gall had the intent necessary for murder.

It would involve the triumph of form over substance and an empty exercise in semantics to require a trial judge in the circumstances of this case to give a direction to the jury that the post offence conduct of Kevin Gall, while capable of giving rise to an inference of guilt of murder, was also capable of giving rise to a less serious or even innocent inference and for that direction to be couched in consciousness of guilt terminology. This is because that very issue was the fundamental question for the jury to decide. They were well aware of the competing issues as to intent as a result of the addresses by counsel and her Honour’s comprehensive summary of the competing cases in relation to which there has been no complaint. The evidence of Kevin Gall’s post offence conduct was simply part of the Crown’s case to rebut his contention that he had acted out of fear and in self-defence.

Kevin Gall’s submission that the evidence of his post offence conduct could not distinguish between a consciousness of guilt for murder or manslaughter is misconceived. At no time was it suggested by any counsel or her Honour to the jury that the post offence conduct could be used in this way or was capable by itself of establishing guilt of any particular offence. It was simply part of the Crown’s overall case to establish Kevin Gall’s intention at the relevant time and to establish the negative proposition beyond reasonable doubt that Kevin Gall did not personally believe that it was necessary for him to shoot at the deceased to defend his father and himself.


	
	In The Queen v Baden-Clay, the High Court considered whether the post-offence concealment and lies of the accused could be used specifically to prove his intent to murder. The Court held that there is no rule that post-offence conduct never serves to distinguish intent as between murder and manslaughter (at [73]-[77]).
	
	
	Where there is an alternative charge, an assessment must be made as to whether evidence of consciousness of guilt serves to prove one charge or the other (R v Ciantar (2006) 16 VR 26; [2006] VSCA 263 at [40]-[42], [64]-[68], [77]-[78], [81]-[87]). It will generally be for the jury to decide whether evidence of post-offence conduct is related to the crime charged or to some other culpable act (The Queen v Baden-Clay at [73], approving the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R v White [1998] 2 SCR 72). The issue is determined in light of the specific facts of the case, there being no “rigid prescriptive rules as to when and in what precise terms an Edwards-type direction [that the jury can take into account a lie only if they are satisfied that it reveals a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and that it was a deliberate lie told because the accused knew the truth of the matter would implicate him in the offence] should be given” (Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234; [2000] HCA 28 at [15]).
	
	
	In the present case, the complaint is that there was no distinction in the summing up on the post-offence conduct distinguishing between murder and manslaughter. Reference is made to what was said at [516]-[517] and later at [581]-[583] and [594]:
	


[516]   The Crown drew your attention to the accused’s evidence of jumping over the balcony, his evidence of having disposed of the knife in an undesignated location near a golf course or a reserve, and in different locations, his clothing, and then his explanation that he took his shoes off because he was hot, as just unacceptable. The Crown submitted that his deliberate disposition of the knife and his clothing was to ensure that there was nothing remaining in his possession which would associate him with the murderous assault on the deceased in the unit. The Crown also submitted that leaving the hotel by the fire stairs after changing into other clothes, after his unsuccessful attempt to return to the hotel by the fire stairs, forcing him to enter the hotel barefoot, and his attempts to conceal his face from security cameras at the hotel, and then at Brisbane Airport, getting off the plane and attempting, as described the by the police officer in his statement, to conceal his face, is further evidence of his determination to conceal what he well knew to be his criminal liability for the injuries that the deceased had suffered, given that he left her seriously injured.

[517]   In order for you to use what I described in that very compact way of the accused’s post-offence conduct as evidence of his guilt, you would need to be satisfied that there was no other explanation for what he did, other than to conceal his guilt.

…

[581]   As I have directed you, if you think that the commencement and the continuation of what I described as the post offence conduct, that is not to suggest that he had done anything consistent with the Crown case in the home unit, because it is not my job to find that fact, but it’s described at law as post offence conduct, because that is how we identify it from other conduct, if you think there is a reasonable possibility that the reason he went over the balcony and ran away, and threw things away, and did what he did thereafter was out of panic, and not because he knew he was responsible for what had occurred, in the sense that it was his act or acts that caused those fatal wounds, then the post offence conduct would not be available to you to reason to a conclusion of guilt because there is another explanation for it.

[582]   And people, you might think, are all different. That much is an unremarkable observation by me. People respond to stressful situations in different ways. There is no gold standard by which you might think a person should act when confronted, on the accused’s case, with what he say occur, and what had happened involving him in that home unit. On the other hand, you are entitled, and indeed both counsel urge you to look at what he did from your perspective, taking into account what you consider might have been motivating him at the time. On the Crown case there is no explanation for not going to the door and opening it and letting the people in to help his past girlfriend who was bleeding very very profusely from the neck, and who he then had seen by that stage as I recall it was bleeding from the chest.

[583]   Ms Traill submits in hindsight, and that might be so, and indeed were we to interrogate any of you you would probably very likely say you would have gone to the door. But that is not the test. The question is whether you consider it is reasonably possible that he panicked, and ran away for that reason, not as the Crown would urge you because he well knew that he could not account for himself and he proceeded thereafter to take every effort he could to conceal the fact that he was in the unit having inflicted those fatal wounds.

…

[594]   I have reminded you as to how you must deal with post offence conduct, or flight, sometimes it’s referred to as flight, before reasoning to the conclusion that that conduct objectively established by the accused’s movements over the balcony, back to the hotel, from the hotel to the airport and beyond evidences a consciousness of his guilt.


	
	The applicant submits that the jury should not have been directed that post offence conduct could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt of murder when there was an alternative charge of manslaughter to which it may also have been equally relevant (referring to SW v R [2013] NSWCCA 103 at [62]-[63]; Steer v R (2008) 191 A Crim R 435; [2008] NSWCCA 295 at [68]-[73] per Simpson J (as her Honour then was) and [76] per McCallum J).
	
	
	The difficulty with this submission is that the passages in the summing up to which the applicant pointed (at [516]-[517]) were expressed in general terms; namely whether the jury could treat the post offence conduct as having no explanation other than to conceal his guilt and whether the conduct could be explained other than as reflecting a sense of guilt. They were equally applicable to consideration of the case left to the jury for manslaughter as to the charge of murder.
	
	
	At [581], her Honour was raising whether there was a reasonable possibility that the applicant did what he did out of panic and not because he knew he was responsible for what had occurred in the sense that it was his act or acts that had caused those fatal wounds. That is not limited to the charge of murder; it would encompass responsibility arising for manslaughter by excessive self-defence (which was also left to the jury).
	
	
	The direction given by the trial judge thus covered both possible verdicts. Once the jury, as it clearly did, rejected the explanation that the stab wounds had occurred accidentally, i.e., once the jury had determined beyond reasonable doubt that the fatal stab wounds were the deliberate act of the applicant, then the question as to intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm must inevitably have been answered in the way the Crown contended and self-defence was negatived on the applicant’s own evidence as explained above, so a verdict of manslaughter by excessive self-defence would not have been open. In those circumstances no miscarriage can have occurred by her Honour not expressly referring to the two possible verdicts when giving the directions as to the use that might be made of the post-offence conduct of flight.
	
	
	There is no merit to this ground of appeal. It was not the subject of complaint at the trial. Leave to rely on it should be refused.
	


Ground 8 – Onus

8.   The learned trial judge erred in her directions to the jury both as to the onus and standard of proof and as to factual matters.


	
	Under this ground the only passage of the summing up criticised in the applicant’s submissions, as developed on the hearing of the appeal, was one sentence in [331] as follows:
	


Were you unable to accept the accused’s version of events as a reasonably possible version of events, you would find the first element of the offence proved in accordance with my directions.


	
	The applicant’s submission with respect to this was in these terms:
	


This related to the prosecution proving that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased. This direction shifted the onus of proof to the Applicant and lessened the requirement that the prosecution prove the element beyond reasonable doubt.


	
	The Court considers that submission unsustainable given the context of the balance of [331] of the summing up, not to mention the numerous other passages throughout the summing up and elsewhere in the course of the trial where her Honour made it abundantly clear that the burden of proof lay on the Crown throughout in relation to all elements. It is sufficient to refer to the two sentences of [331] which immediately preceded the sentence complained of (as quoted at [234] above):
	


In considering the accused’s evidence and what weight you give to it I remind you that the accused has no obligation to persuade you to accept his evidence as a true, or even possibly true version of events. It is the Crown’s obligation to satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that you cannot accept his evidence as a reasonably possible version of the facts either because it is inherently unacceptable or because it is contradicted by other evidence or both, or on any basis that you consider appropriate in analysis of the evidence.


	
	Numerous other points which were advanced in written submissions under ground 8 were abandoned during the hearing of the appeal. The sole remaining point, and hence ground 8 as ultimately advanced, is rejected for the reasons given above.
	


Ground 10 – Police officer/juror

10.   The trial miscarried by reason by reason of the failure of the trial judge to investigate the relationship of a jury member with a police officer who worked in the area where the deceased died.


	
	Just prior to the Crown Prosecutor’s opening address, in the absence of the jury, the Crown Prosecutor read to the Court an email that she had received from the officer in charge of the investigation into Ms Yeo’s death (T 84.20). The Crown Prosecutor stated:
	


Last night about 6pm [a Detective] who works at Northern Beaches LAC, however she is at Dee Why was picking her son up from paddle board training last night at Bayview. She spoke to a male that she knows as their sons train together.

The conversation was general about the boys and training and then … then [the Detective] said why haven’t you been at training. The male answered I can’t. I’ve been picked on a jury for a murder trial for four weeks. It is in your area. It is the one at Curl Curl. I was waiting for your name to come up when they were picking the jurors but it didn’t.

There was no further conversation regarding the trial and [the officer in charge] noted that [the Detective’s] name in fact was not read out by me during the reading of witness names.


	
	The trial judge observed that the email revealed that the juror had observed the admonition given to the jury panel before empanelment to listen carefully to the witnesses’ names read by the Crown Prosecutor and had not heard the Detective’s name. Her Honour considered that the email did not reveal anything “problematic” (T 85.14).
	
	
	Counsel for the applicant expressed a “concern” that there was a juror who lived “in the area of the alleged murder and has had contact with a police officer” (T 85.19). Counsel applied to have the jury discharged (T 86.10). Counsel stated that the basis for the application was that a juror “has had a conversation with a police officer from the area where many of the officers will be called to give evidence in this case” (T 86.15). Her Honour pressed counsel on how that could give rise to a reason for discharge. Counsel then stated that the application was withdrawn (T 87.7). Her Honour stated that the jury would be reminded of their obligation not to speak “about the events of the trial” (T 87.18).
	
	
	The written submissions in support of this ground contend that it is “a reasonable inference from the email … that there had been previous conversation between the juror and [the Detective], perhaps around the time of the death of [Ms Yeo] and that the juror believed that [the Detective] had had some involvement in the investigation of the death of the deceased”. The submissions contended that the “juror may have had information about the case, or have been told opinions about the case, which were not in evidence”. It is submitted that the trial judge erred in not taking a step that no-one at the trial urged upon her, namely, questioning the juror or the Detective who spoke to the juror “to ascertain if this was the case”.
	
	
	Section 55D of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) empowers a trial judge to examine a juror on oath as to whether they have seen or heard prejudicial material that was broadcast or published during the trial and been influenced by it. Section 55DA of the Jury Act empowers a trial judge to examine a juror on oath as to whether they have engaged in conduct that contravened s 68C. Section 68C prohibits a juror from making their own inquiries about the accused or any matter relevant to the trial. The possibility that a juror received information from the Detective about the trial in the circumstances now alleged did not fall within either of these provisions. Otherwise, the Jury Act does not confer any express power on a trial judge to examine a juror either on oath or otherwise concerning other matters which might warrant their mandatory or discretionary discharge as a juror under s 53A or s 53B respectively. Nevertheless, that a trial judge can at least make inquiries of an individual juror on such topics in the absence of the rest of the jury appears to have been assumed (Najibi v R [2016] VSCA 177 at [162]; BG v R (2012) 221 A Crim R 215; [2012] NSWCCA 139 at [87]). The authority to do so was not identified in those cases but it would be appear to be an incident to the powers conferred by s 53A and s 53B, although whether a trial judge can require a juror to answer questions on oath on such topics is a different matter that need not be decided.
	
	
	In this case there was no request made of the trial judge to make any inquiry of the juror who spoke to the Detective (or any inquiry of a Detective) and no reason for her Honour to make any such inquiry. The “inference” suggested by the applicant’s written submissions to the effect that there had been other conversations between the juror and the Detective about the trial is anything but reasonable. If the juror had previously spoken to the Detective about Ms Yeo’s death then it can be expected that the juror would have sought to be excused from the jury panel. As noted by the trial judge, it is clear that the juror followed the instructions given prior to empanelment very closely. If the Detective had spoken to the juror about the circumstances of Ms Yeo’s death and if she was seeking to act with propriety then she would have made reference to that in the email sent to the informant and read out by the Crown Prosecutor. If the Detective was not seeking to act with propriety then she would not have sent the email in the first place.
	
	
	As noted by the trial judge, the entire exchange suggests that both the juror and the Detective were acting with complete propriety. There was no reason to doubt the completeness of the account given in the email that was read to the Court (see BG at [87]). Nothing in the email warranted any basis for discharging the juror or required the trial judge to question the juror separately (or make enquiries of the Detective).
	
	
	Again, as this ground involves a question of mixed fact and law, leave to raise it is required. As it has no substance leave is refused.
	


Application for leave to appeal against sentence


	
	Grounds 11 to 13 all concern the sentence imposed by her Honour. Before addressing those grounds it is necessary to summarise her Honour’s sentencing judgment.
	
	
	After describing the Crown case and the evidence supporting it, her Honour noted that, by their verdict, the jury had rejected any reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo was fatally stabbed by accident or stabbed by the applicant in the belief that it was necessary to defend himself (at [26]). Her Honour found that there was no “reasonable possibility that Ms Yeo would have invited the [applicant] into her unit after dark on 16 July 2012 [especially] in circumstances where she knew she would be alone with him and where she was fearful of him” (at [36]). Her Honour referred to the applicant’s “obsessive and vengeful behaviour” towards Ms Yeo (at [44]) and rejected his assertion that he discovered Ms Yeo’s address “somewhat serendipitously after he arrived in Sydney” by looking through the tinted windows of her car (at [50]). Her Honour was satisfied that, on the evening of 16 July 2012, the applicant went to Ms Yeo’s house twice unannounced, taking “considered and careful” steps to conceal the fact that he left his hotel (at [52]). Her Honour found that the applicant gained entry to her apartment “against her wishes” (at [53]).
	
	
	Her Honour also accepted Ms Mulvihill’s evidence and found that the applicant took the white chain with him to her apartment “for use as a weapon” (at [56]). However, her Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the murder of Ms Yeo was premeditated (at [59]). Instead, her Honour concluded:
	


…. I am satisfied, and beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender gained entry to the unit, armed with the white chain, either with the intention of harming Ms Yeo or threatening her with it, and, in the rapidly unfolding events as Ms Yeo sought to defend herself against his attack, he took her knife and repeatedly stabbed at her and in her direction, intending to kill her. Furthermore, I am satisfied, having regard to the placement of the wounds that they were both inflicted with that intention and that the chest wound was inflicted to ensure that she would not survive the attack to identify him.

I am also satisfied that Ms Yeo sustained the secondary injuries, in particular the defensive injuries to both her hands, in the process of defending herself against the offender’s attack and that, during the course of that attack, she was screaming and calling for help while the offender was actively preventing her from accessing assistance from her neighbours, either by restraining her or otherwise preventing her from opening the door to her unit.


	
	None of the above findings was the subject of complaint on appeal.
	
	
	Her Honour concluded that the above findings warranted a conclusion that the applicant’s moral culpability for Ms Yeo’s death was “of a very high order” (at [61]). Her Honour’s assessment included a consideration of the aggravating circumstance that Ms Yeo was killed with a knife in her own home and would have experienced “extreme terror” when attacked (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW); “the Sentencing Act”, ss 21A(2)(c), 21A(2)(eb) and 21A(2)(g)).
	
	
	Her Honour then made findings in respect of evidence led by the Crown in relation to the applicant’s conduct towards his former wife, Ms Carroll, after their separation and divorce in 1991, 1992 and 1993 (at [63]). Her Honour noted that this evidence was adduced by the Crown for two reasons. First, to rebut a submission made on behalf of the applicant that he was not a violent person and should be sentenced on the basis that his killing of Ms Yeo was “out of character” (at [64]). Second, to assist in making an assessment of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and risk of reoffending (at [64]).
	
	
	Her Honour summarised the evidence given on this topic by Ms Carroll, her sister, the applicant and another person (at [63]-[74]). Her Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in 1991 the applicant presented himself at a house occupied by Ms Carroll and conducted himself in a manner that invited “sufficient fear” in Ms Carroll to cause her to leave (although her Honour was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at that time the applicant was in possession of a rifle, left a bullet at the premises or that he subsequently harassed Ms Carroll by repeatedly letting the air out of the tyres of her car: at [80]).
	
	
	Her Honour also accepted that one night in 1992, Ms Carroll arrived at her home with a male friend to find the applicant hiding under her bed (at [73]; [81]). Her Honour also accepted that the applicant had forced entry through a window and said to Ms Carroll “[w]hat are you doing here? I am going to kill you”, although her Honour was not certain whether the threats were directed to Ms Carroll or her friend (at [81]). Her Honour noted that the applicant had admitted hiding under the bed and had described his behaviour as “offensive”.
	
	
	Her Honour was also satisfied that the applicant assaulted Ms Carroll in 1993 by approaching her in her apartment complex, grabbing her around the throat and stating “[w]e need to talk” (at [74]; [81]).
	
	
	Her Honour noted that at the time of sentencing the applicant was 46 years of age, had no criminal record, was involved in proceedings in the Family Court with Ms Mulvihill who was his second wife, was a qualified teacher and had a good work record (at [85] to [86]). Her Honour also noted that the applicant’s sisters had testified that he was not a violent person but considered that assessment was diminished by the findings just noted. Her Honour accepted there was no evidence of the applicant being violent in the period 1993 to 2012 (at [86]).
	
	
	Her Honour received a psychiatrist’s report concerning the applicant from Dr Furst. Based on Dr Furst’s report, her Honour noted that the applicant had been diagnosed with depression in June 2012 (at [89]). Dr Furst diagnosed the applicant as having suffered from a major depressive disorder at the time of Ms Yeo’s death that was “likely triggered by the breakdown in [the applicant’s] marriage and what he perceived as the loss of his relationship with Ms Yeo” (at [90]). Her Honour dealt with this evidence in the following manner:
	


[Counsel for the applicant] did not rely upon Dr Furst’s evidence to ground the submission that the offender’s depression prior to 16 July 2012, or instability in his functioning in some environments in the months preceding that date operate to reduce his moral culpability for the murder, or to reduce the need for the sentence to reflect denunciation and punishment in accordance with established sentencing principles (see Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [34]-[36]). Neither was it submitted that his depression impacted adversely, or at all, on his capacity to make what I am satisfied was a series of calculated decisions on 16 July 2012 (and in the days before that date) such as might diminish the need for the sentence to reflect either general or specific deterrence. I am satisfied in any event that the evidence led at trial is to the contrary. According to Mrs Mulvihill and to Darryn Cass, a friend and work colleague who was in the offender’s company for some hours on the morning of 16 July 2012, he was in good mental and physical health. In addition, there was nothing in his presentation at the Brisbane office of Sanofi Aventis prior to when he left to fly to Sydney or his presentation following his arrival in Sydney to suggest any functional instability.


	
	Her Honour accepted that the applicant would have an ongoing need for medication to address his depression but expressed an “expectation” that it would be addressed by Justice Health (at [92]). Her Honour addressed part of Dr Furst’s report which attributed the applicant’s offending to his “relationship issues” in light of evidence given by the applicant on sentencing which her Honour described as involving him “deny[ing] personal responsibility for his actions and their effect on others” (at [94]). In light of the applicant’s lack of insight or acceptance of responsibility for the violence that the applicant perpetrated on Ms Yeo, her Honour did not accept that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were “good”. Instead, her Honour found that “at best” they were “guarded” (at [96]). Given the length of the sentence that would be imposed, her Honour stated that no meaningful assessment of the applicant’s risk of reoffending on his release could be made. Her Honour did not consider that special circumstances had been demonstrated which warranted altering the ratio referred to in s 44 of the Sentencing Act.
	
	
	As noted, ultimately her Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 29 years with a non parole period of 22 years. The sentence commenced on 16 February 2013 to account for a period in pre-sentence custody.
	
	
	Leave should be given to argue the sentence appeal. For the reasons that follow that appeal should be dismissed.
	


Ground 11 – Facilitation of the administration of justice

11.   The learned trial judge erred in failing to take into account the applicant’s facilitation of the administration of justice pursuant to section 22A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.


	
	Ground 11 contends that her Honour erred in failing to take into account the applicant’s facilitation of the administration of justice pursuant to s 22A of the Sentencing Act. Section 22A provides:
	


22A   Power to reduce penalties for facilitating the administration of justice

(1)   A court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender who was tried on indictment having regard to the degree to which the administration of justice has been facilitated by the defence (whether by disclosures made pre-trial or during the trial or otherwise).

(2)   A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.


	
	The written submissions in support of this ground were brief. They referred to the fact that during the trial a significant number of admissions were made in writing by the applicant and a number of witness statements were read without the need to call their authors to give oral evidence. In a written submission lodged after the hearing of the appeal, counsel referred the Court to the discussion of s 22A in RP v R (2015) 90 NSWLR 234; [2015] NSWCCA 215 at [88] to [97].
	
	
	The Crown’s submissions were equally succinct. They noted that no submission was made to her Honour relying on s 22A and contended that appeals to the Court are not an occasion to “rehear a plea in mitigation on different bases” when no attempt is undertaken to “explain why the approach taken by a predecessor in the court below was erroneous or misguided” (citing Abdallah v The Queen [2016] NSWCCA 34 at [133]).
	
	
	The Crown’s contention should be accepted. The hearing on sentence was a substantial exercise which involved the adducing of additional evidence from the Crown as well from the accused, including evidence from a psychiatrist. Detailed written and oral submissions were made on behalf of the applicant and the Crown. At no time was any reliance placed on s 22A. The admissions document referred to was not insubstantial but it is not obvious that it caused any appreciable reduction in the length of the Crown case. The admissions that were made only reflected the evidence that the applicant gave on oath. Most significantly, if reliance had been placed on s 22A at first instance, her Honour would have been able to assess whether the matters to which the applicant now points truly did facilitate the administration of justice. As the trial judge, her Honour was best placed to do so. In circumstances where no submission relying on s 22A was made, no error has been established by her Honour not expressly addressing the provision. As stated by Davies J in RP at [96] (with whom Johnson J and Hamill J agreed on this point at [1] and [169] respectively):
	


… in the absence of any submission made to his Honour in relation to a reduction in sentence whether by dint of the application of s 22A or generally by the facilitation of justice for the way the trial was conducted, I do not consider there is any basis for holding that error has occurred on the part of the Sentencing Judge.


	
	Ground 11 is rejected.
	


Grounds 12A and 12B – Evidence of alleged prior misconduct

12A.   The learned trial judge erred in permitting the prosecution to lead evidence of alleged misconduct by the applicant in 1991, 1992, and 1993.

12B.   The learned trial judge erred in taking into account alleged misconduct of the applicant in 1993.


	
	The evidence and findings to which these grounds are directed are summarised above at [251] to [255]. The written submissions in support of this ground submitted that the findings made by her Honour in respect of this evidence were in part relied on by her Honour to conclude that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were at best “guarded” and as discounting the evidence of the applicant’s good character, or at least non-violent character, that was adduced from his sisters. It is correct that her Honour relied on the findings concerning the applicant’s past behaviour as diminishing the assertion that the applicant was not violent and of good character (see [255]). It is less clear that her Honour relied on those findings in making an assessment of the applicant’s prospects of reoffending. That finding was based more on his lack of insight and acceptance concerning his conduct towards Ms Yeo. Nevertheless, for the purpose of addressing this ground, this aspect of the applicant’s submissions can be accepted.
	
	
	The applicant’s written submissions noted that the evidence concerned allegations of criminal conduct in respect of which the “applicant has never been charged”. Again, that can be accepted. The submissions further contend that:
	


It was submitted that it was unfair to the applicant that he be required to defend himself against other alleged criminal conduct alleged to have occurred many years previously at the sentence hearing. It was remote and not the same as conduct arising from the facts and circumstances surrounding the offence, such as Weininger v The Queen [2003] HCA 14; 212 CLR 629.


	
	In considering this approach, three matters should be noted about the approach adopted by her Honour to the evidence of the applicant’s assaults on Ms Carroll.
	
	
	First, as noted, her Honour identified with precision the basis upon which the material was tendered by the Crown. Sections 21A(3)(f) and 21A(3)(g) of the Sentencing Act respectively provide that an offender’s good character and the unlikelihood of them reoffending are mitigating factors. The applicant was seeking to rely on those provisions and the Crown adduced evidence in response. There is no legislative provision or common law principle that restricts the Crown from relying on the criminal conduct of an offender that did not lead to a conviction when seeking to rebut reliance on those provisions. To the contrary, in Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629; [2003] HCA 14 a majority of the High Court upheld a sentencing judge’s reliance on an admission by the offender that he had been involved in drug importations that he had not been charged with as undermining the contention that he was of good character (at [29] per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ).
	
	
	Otherwise, the evidence concerning the applicant’s assaults on Ms Carroll was clearly relevant in the manner that her Honour identified. While a number of years had passed since the applicant assaulted Ms Carroll, the relevant inquiry concerned the applicant’s response to the breakup of a relationship. The breakdown of the applicant’s relationship with Ms Carroll was the last known occasion that occurred.
	
	
	Second, her Honour determined under s 4(2) of the Evidence Act that the laws of evidence applied to a determination of the admissibility of the evidence adduced from Ms Carroll.
	
	
	Third, her Honour was satisfied that the risk of unfairness to the accused in having to meet Ms Carroll’s evidence was countered by the need for her Honour to be “satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct relied upon by the Crown in fact occurred” (at [79]).
	
	
	These points all illustrate the careful approach that her Honour adopted in considering the evidence of the applicant’s assaults on Ms Carroll. In neither the written or oral submissions did the applicant identify any error in the approach of her Honour beyond the generalised complaint of unfairness noted above. No error is apparent in her Honour’s approach.
	
	
	Grounds 12A and 12B are rejected.
	


Ground 13 – Mental illness

13.   The learned trial judge erred in not taking into account the applicant’s diagnosed mental illness.


	
	Ground 13 of the appeal contends that the trial judge erred in not taking into account the applicant’s diagnosed mental illness.
	
	
	Again, the written submissions in support of this ground were brief. They stated that:
	


Clear evidence was presented at the sentence hearing (and at the trial) that the applicant was suffering from depression and had been prescribed anti-depressant medication at the time Ms Yeo was killed. In her written Defence Submissions on sentence it was submitted … that the applicant’s mental state was a significant factor to be taken into account. The judge declined to take it into account as a mitigating factor.


	
	Although it is not expressly stated, it appears that this passage complains that the sentencing judge did not take into account the evidence that the applicant suffered from depression in the various ways outlined in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194; (2010) 243 FLR 28 at [177].
	
	
	It is true that the written submissions on sentence that were provided to her Honour on behalf of the applicant submitted that the offender’s depression at the time of the offence should be taken into account. However, as suggested by the passage from the sentencing judgment extracted above (at [256]), that was refined in oral submissions. At the sentence hearing, counsel for the applicant disclaimed any suggestion that there was a causal connection between the applicant’s mental health and the killing of Ms Yeo. Instead, the only suggested relevance of the material was to rebut a submission of the Crown that the applicant was not manipulating Ms Mulvihill in July 2012 when he told her he was depressed, and the fact that he was depressed in July 2012 was said to tend against a finding that the killing of Ms Yeo was not premeditated. That reliance was only placed on the applicant’s depression for limited purposes at the sentencing is confirmed by the following passage from Dr Furst’s report which recorded his instructions as follows:
	


You [the applicant’s solicitor] indicated it is not proposed to argue Mr Mulvihill was so effected [sic] by a mental illness as to effect his capacity to understand what he was doing or reduce his moral culpability or that there is some direction causal connection between any mental instability and the offence.


	
	The findings in the sentencing judgment treated the evidence of the applicant’s depression in a manner that was consistent with the stated basis on which it was adduced on behalf of the applicant. Ultimately, her Honour accepted that the applicant was suffering from depression in the period leading up to the killing. Further, her Honour was not satisfied that the killing was premeditated, although that lack of satisfaction was not based on an acceptance that he suffered from depression. No error has been demonstrated in her Honour’s approach.
	
	
	Ground 13 is rejected.
	


Conclusion


	
	For the reasons above, the following orders should be made:
	



	
	Extend the time for the filing of the notice of appeal and application for leave to appeal to 22 April 2016.
	
	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal his conviction on grounds 1 and 2 of his notice of appeal dated 22 April 2016.
	
	
	Refuse the applicant leave to appeal his conviction on grounds 3-8 and 10 of his notice of appeal dated 22 April 2016 (noting that ground 9 was not pressed by the applicant).
	
	
	Dismiss the appeal against conviction.
	
	
	Grant the applicant leave to appeal against his sentence but dismiss the appeal.

[LawNet Editorial Note: This was an appeal from the decision of the High Court in 
[2015] SGHC 287
.]
21 November 2016
Judgment reserved.
 Andrew Phang Boon Leong JA (delivering the judgment of the court):
Introduction
1       The Appellant had been convicted of the capital charge of trafficking in not less than 57.43g of diamorphine in 2010 (see 
Public Prosecutor v Rosman bin Abdullah
 
[2010] SGHC 271
). The Appellant then appealed against the conviction and sentence and this court dismissed the appeal in April 2011. On 25 July 2011, the Appellant also submitted a petition for clemency to the President, which was rejected.
2       Subsequently, on 14 November 2012, the Singapore Parliament passed the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 30 of 2012) which introduced the new s 33B into the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). We set out the relevant provisions of s 33B of the MDA (“s 33B”) below:
 
Discretion of court not to impose sentence of death in certain circumstances
 
 
33B.
—(1) Where a person commits or attempts to commit an offence under section 5(1) or 7, being an offence punishable with death under the sixth column of the Second Schedule, and he is convicted thereof, the court —
(
a
) may, if the person satisfies the requirements of subsection (2), instead of imposing the death penalty, sentence the person to imprisonment for life and, if the person is sentenced to life imprisonment, he shall also be sentenced to caning of not less than 15 strokes; or
(
b
) shall, if the person satisfies the requirements of subsection (3), instead of imposing the death penalty, sentence the person to imprisonment for life.
(2) The requirements referred to in subsection (1)(
a
) are as follows:
(
a
) the person convicted proves, on a balance of probabilities, that his involvement in the offence under section 5(1) or 7 was restricted —
(i) to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug;
(ii) to offering to transport, send or deliver a controlled drug;
(iii) to doing or offering to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of his transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; or
(iv) to any combination of activities in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii); and
(
b
) the Public Prosecutor certifies to any court that, in his determination, the person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.
(3) The requirements referred to in subsection (1)(
b
) are that the person convicted proves, on a balance of probabilities, that —
(
a
) his involvement in the offence under section 5(1) or 7 was restricted —
(i) to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug;
(ii) to offering to transport, send or deliver a controlled drug;
(iii) to doing or offering to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of his transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug; or
(iv) to any combination of activities in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii) and (iii); and
(
b
) he was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to the offence under section 5(1) or 7.
(4) The determination of whether or not any person has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities shall be at the sole discretion of the Public Prosecutor and no action or proceeding shall lie against the Public Prosecutor in relation to any such determination unless it is proved to the court that the determination was done in bad faith or with malice.
3       The enactment of s 33B, in particular s 33B(2), led the Appellant to commence Criminal Motion No 17 of 2015 (“CM 17/2015”) where he sought a re-sentencing on the basis that he fulfilled the requirements stated therein. In short, s 33B(2) of the MDA (“s 33B(2)”) read with s 33B(1)(
a
) of the same allows the court to sentence a convicted drug trafficker to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty if he proves on a balance of probabilities that: (a) his involvement in the offence was limited to that stated in s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA (
ie
, he was merely a “
courier
”); and (b) if the Public Prosecutor issues a certificate to affirm that he has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) in disrupting drug activities. In 
Rosman bin Abdullah v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] SGHC 287
 (“the GD”), the High Court judge (“the Judge”) held that the Appellant had not fulfilled the two requirements, and therefore affirmed the death sentence which he had imposed on the Appellant earlier at the trial. The present appeal is an appeal against this particular decision.
4       Before proceeding to set out the relevant background, it would be appropriate to note a couple of (significant) preliminary points that were raised.
Preliminary points
5       The first preliminary point relates to an issue that was raised in the Appellant’s Petition of Appeal but which his counsel, Mr Low Cheong Yeow (“Mr Low”), stated he was 
not
 pursuing on behalf of his client, 
viz
, the alleged unconstitutionality of s 33B(4) of the MDA (“s 33B(4)”) inasmuch as it violated Art 93 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) (“Art 93”).
6       Secondly, in his written submissions, the Appellant advanced a 
new
 point that was not raised in the court below: that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the material time within the meaning of s 33B(3)(
b
) of the MDA (“s 33B(3)(
b
)”) and that this court therefore ought to remit this particular issue to the High Court for its decision. The significance of his bringing this new point is that, if the Appellant succeeds in establishing the requirements in s 33B(3) of the MDA (“s 33B(3)”), the court must, pursuant to s 33B(1)(
b
) of the MDA (“s 33B(1)(
b
)”), sentence him to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty. Notwithstanding the fact that Mr Low was not counsel for the Appellant in the court below, we find it disturbing that the Appellant is only raising this issue on appeal. This smacks of a drip-feed approach that might result in an abuse of the process of court. Henceforth, all applicants pursuant to the re-sentencing procedure under s 33B 
must
 indicate whether they intend to rely upon s 33B(2) or s 33B(3) of the MDA – or both provisions – at first instance. This court will not hesitate to exercise its discretion to reject any belated reliance on either of these provisions should they only arise on appeal.
7       Mr Low sought to explain to this court during oral submissions the reasons for raising s 33B(3) on behalf of the Appellant only at this stage of the proceedings. Upon taking instructions from the Appellant, Mr Low stated that the Appellant had indicated that he felt that he was suffering from some mental condition at the time of the commission of the offence. It should be noted that a Report from the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”) dated 13 February 2013 (“the IMH Report”) had, in fact, already been filed and served on the Appellant much earlier (on 6 May 2013), a point which Mr Low candidly acknowledged in his written submissions. More importantly, the IMH Report stated clearly that the Appellant was not suffering from any symptoms of mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence. Nevertheless, Mr Low sought, on behalf of the Appellant, a review and assessment of the Appellant by Dr Munidasa Winslow (“Dr Winslow”), whose report (in Mr Low’s view) had (contrary to the IMH Report) stated that the Appellant was in fact suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the commission of the offence. He is now therefore asking this court to remit the issue of the Appellant’s mental state at the time of the commission of the offence to the High Court for determination.
8       Mr Low also argues that this court should not render any ruling on whether or not the Appellant was merely a courier until after the Judge had considered evidence of as well as determined the issue of the Appellant’s mental state at the time of the commission of the offence, although he (Mr Low) was prepared to argue on the courier issue at the hearing before us. However, as we pointed out to Mr Low during the hearing, the issue as to whether or not the Appellant was a courier is a 
threshold
 issue and that if this particular issue is decided against the Appellant, the present appeal would have to be dismissed, 
regardless
 of whether or not the Appellant is able to bring himself within the ambit of s 33B(3)(
b
) in relation to his mental state at the time of the commission of the offence (see above at [2]).
9       It bears repeating that, in order for the applicant concerned to avail himself or herself of s 33B(3), the applicant 
must
 satisfy 
both
 limbs therein (
viz
, s 33B(3)(
a
) and (
b
)) 
cumulatively
. Put simply, a 
failure
 to satisfy 
any one
 of the limbs would 
disentitle
 the applicant from obtaining the benefit in s 33B(1)(
b
) (see above at [6]). This is clear not only from the express wording of s 33B(3) but also from the Parliamentary debates surrounding the enactment of this new provision where the following was stated (
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (12 November 2011) vol 89 (“the 
12 November Parliamentary Debates
”) (Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs (“Mr Teo”)):
Finally, I will speak about the changes to the death penalty regime. … Under the new section 33B, the court will have the discretion to decide whether to impose a sentence of life imprisonment and caning, or the death sentence 
if the following two specific conditions are both met
. … 
First
, the offender must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that his role in the offence is restricted only to that of a courier which, in essence, is a person whose role is confined to transporting, sending or delivering a controlled drug, and who does not play any other role within the drug syndicate.
 
Second, if having satisfied this first requirement
, in order for the mandatory death penalty not to apply, either the Public Prosecutor must have certified that the person has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore, 
or the person must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that he is suffering from such abnormality of mind that it substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in relation to the offences he has committed
.
[emphasis added]
10     It follows that 
even if
 the applicant is able to bring himself or herself within the second limb of this provision (
viz
, s 33B(3)(
b
)), this would 
not
 be sufficient to invoke s 33B(1)(
b
) successfully if he or she were unable to satisfy the first limb (
viz
, s 33B(3)(
a
)) by demonstrating that he or she was merely a courier. Indeed, Mr Low candidly admitted during oral submissions before this court that that was why he had not filed a second criminal motion for re-sentencing pursuant to s 33B as he was aware that the determination of the threshold issue pursuant to s 33B(3)(
a
) (
viz
, whether the Appellant was a courier) might well be determinative of the present appeal in the manner just stated.
11     In the circumstances, it was, in our view, appropriate to proceed with hearing the arguments with regard to the 
threshold
 issue as to whether or not the Appellant was a “courier” within the meaning of s 33B(3)(
a
) because his mental condition would be relevant, pursuant to s 33B(3)(
b
), 
if (and only if)
 this threshold issue is decided in his favour.
12     We should also note that counsel for the Respondent, Mr Ng Cheng Thiam (“Mr Ng”), objected strenuously to the admission of the report by Dr Winslow (“Dr Winslow’s Report”) on the basis that it was irrelevant, inadmissible and unreliable. We will deal with this objection in a later part of this judgment.
13     This would be an appropriate juncture at which to turn to the facts as well as the decision in the court below.
The facts
14     On 20 March 2009, CNB officers raided the Appellant’s hotel room in Bencoolen Street and five packets of heroin were seized. This formed the subject matter of the capital charge which was brought against the Appellant.
15     Prior to his arrest, the Appellant had already been involved in one drug transaction which did not form the subject matter of the charge brought against him (“the First Transaction”). The facts surrounding the First Transaction are as follows. Three to four days before his arrest, the Appellant had been asked by one Mahadhir bin Chari (also known as “Mayday”) to source for heroin. The Appellant complied and contacted a Malaysian supplier known as Ah Yong, who agreed to sell two pounds of heroin for $18,000. When Mayday told the Appellant that he only had $16,900, the Appellant informed Ah Yong of the same and it was subsequently agreed that Mayday would be given a three-day credit to pay the remaining $1,100. On the night of the transaction, the Appellant met Ah Yong’s associate at a coffee shop and paid him the $16,900 while another associate concurrently passed Mayday the heroin at a housing block in Simei. Subsequently, the Appellant went to Mayday’s flat in Simei where they used a weighing scale and empty packets to pack the heroin into 8g packets. The Appellant helped Mayday to arrange the heroin deal and pack the drugs as he owed Mayday money after a failed deal to buy methamphetamine. The Appellant also took two packets of heroin for sale after the First Transaction. According to the Appellant, he would receive the drugs at a cheaper price from Mayday and this would allow him “to get more profit and repay everything which [he] owe[d] ‘Mayday’ faster”.
16     After the First Transaction, on 19 March 2009, Mayday again asked the Appellant to source for two pounds of heroin (“the Second Transaction”). Again, the Appellant called Ah Yong who quoted $8,500 for one pound of heroin. The Appellant relayed a series of messages between Mayday and Ah Yong and a price of $16,600 was eventually agreed upon. This time, however, the Appellant collected the heroin personally as Mayday was not feeling well. The Appellant, after collecting the money from Mayday, proceeded to a shopping centre in Bukit Timah where the Appellant passed the money to Ah Yong’s associate in exchange for the heroin. The Appellant then went to Mayday’s flat but there was no response at the door or to the Appellant’s calls. He therefore returned to the hotel in Bencoolen with the drugs and it was there that he was arrested.
The decision below
17     The Judge first held that the Appellant was not simply a courier and therefore did not meet the first requirement encapsulated in s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA. The Judge found that the Appellant’s conduct went beyond transporting, sending or delivery of drugs from one point to another. In this regard, the Judge took into account the Appellant’s course of conduct in the First Transaction where he had sourced for the heroin and brokered the deal between Ah Yong and Mayday. Further, the Judge noted that the Appellant would assist Mayday in repacking the heroin and would also take heroin from Mayday to sell (see the GD at [17]−[18]).
18     In the Judge’s view, the facts pertaining to the First Transaction were relevant to his evaluation of the role of the Appellant in the Second Transaction, in so far as the context and purpose surrounding both Transactions were similar. The Judge considered that in the Second Transaction, the Appellant was similarly asked to source for the heroin and he similarly brokered the deal between Ah Yong and Mayday as well. In this regard, the Judge noted (see the GD at [21]) that “it was clear that the second transaction started in the same way as the first” and that “there was no evidence that his personal circumstances had changed such that he would have no further reason to help [Mayday] in the same way”. The Judge also took into account that the Appellant had stated in his long statement that the reason he helped Mayday in the Second Transaction was likewise to get a discount when he received drugs from Mayday to sell (see the GD at [20]−[22]).
19     The Judge further found that even if the facts of the Second Transaction were examined in isolation, they still showed that the Appellant’s role had exceeded that of a mere courier given that he played an active part in sourcing for the heroin and played the role of a middleman in the negotiations between Mayday and Ah Yong (see the GD at [23]).
20     In so far as the second requirement of having substantively assisted the CNB as encapsulated in s 33B(2)(
b
) of the MDA (“s 33B(2)(
b
)”) was concerned, the Judge found that this was for the Public Prosecutor to decide and that the Public Prosecutor’s determination in this regard could only be challenged on the basis of bad faith, malice or unconstitutionality, which had not been raised by the Appellant (see the GD at [29]).
21     The Judge also declined to accede to the Appellant’s request to define the meaning of “substantively assisted” so that the Public Prosecutor could decide if the Appellant could receive a certificate of assistance after applying the elucidated meaning to the facts. The Judge noted that by providing a definition of “substantively assisted”, the courts would in effect be interfering with the decision-making process of the Public Prosecutor (see the GD at [31]). Further, the Judge found that there was no basis to accept the particular interpretation of “substantive assistance” which was advocated for by the Appellant (
ie
, there would be “substantive assistance” where an accused person provides information which is of “potential value” and it need not be assessed on the actual effectiveness of the information) (see the GD at [36]).
22     Accordingly, the Judge affirmed the death sentence imposed on the Appellant.
The parties’ arguments
The Appellant’s arguments
23     As already noted, at the hearing before us, the Appellant did not pursue the argument to the effect that s 33B(4) was unconstitutional as it violated Art 93. He has three principal arguments which were pursued in both his written and oral submissions to this court.
24     The 
first
 (and most crucial) argument is that the Appellant was only a “courier” within the meaning of s 33B (“Issue 1”). In particular, Mr Low argues, on behalf of the Appellant, that the Judge should not have taken into account the First Transaction in finding that the Appellant was not a courier. He submits that because the Appellant had not been charged for the First Transaction, it had no relevance in determining the Appellant’s role in the Second Transaction, which was the subject matter of the proceeded charge. He takes the position that the Judge should not have assumed that the Appellant’s purpose in carrying out the First and Second Transactions were the same (
ie
, that after collecting the drugs, he would help Mayday repack the drugs before taking some of the drugs for himself). He argues further that, taking into account only the facts of the Second Transaction (which constituted the charge against the Appellant), the Appellant was merely a courier.
25     The 
second
 argument is that the court can – and should – define the phrase “substantively assisted” in s 33B(2)(
b
) (“Issue 2”).
26     The 
third
 argument is one that we have already referred to earlier in this judgment: that this court should remit the issue as to whether the Appellant was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time of the commission of the offence within the meaning of s 33B(3)(
b
) to the Judge for his decision (“Issue 3”). As also noted above, this particular argument will be of no avail to the Appellant if Issue 1 is decided against him.
The Respondent’s arguments
27     The Respondent argues that the Appellant was clearly not a courier. In particular, during oral submissions before this court, Mr Ng stated that, even if the First Transaction was not taken into account, there was more than sufficient evidence for this court to conclude that the Appellant was not simply a courier in so far as the Second Transaction was concerned.
28     The Respondent argues further that the Judge was correct in declining to provide a definition of “substantive assistance” within the meaning of s 33B(2)(
b
) as the determination as to whether or not “substantive assistance” had in fact been provided by the accused lay solely within the discretion of the Public Prosecutor. Citing from the relevant Parliamentary Debates, Mr Ng argues that it was Parliament’s intention that such an approach was necessary to ensure the operational effectiveness of the CNB. He also argues (again citing from the relevant Parliamentary Debates) that acceding to the Appellant’s argument would give rise to a floodgate of future applications to the court (which was never Parliament’s intention in the first place).
29     In so far as the Appellant’s third argument is concerned, the Respondent highlights, first, that the Appellant had never raised any allegation of any abnormality of mind during the hearing below, notwithstanding the fact that he had been represented by counsel at the time. Further, the Respondent submits that, in any event, the court should not accept the Appellant’s contention that he was suffering from an abnormality of mind as Dr Winslow’s Report was inadmissible and irrelevant (see above at [12]).
Our decision
Issue 1
30     The decision as to whether or not an applicant is a courier within the meaning of s 33B is 
a fact-sensitive one in which the court must pay close attention to both the facts as well as the context of the case at hand
. In this regard, the Judge laid down the following guidelines at [15]−[16] of the GD:
 
Whether the applicant was a courier
 
15    The statutory relief provided in s 33B of the MDA does not apply to those who are involved in more than transporting, sending or delivering the drugs. However, 
mere incidental acts in the course of transporting, sending or delivering the drugs would not take a trafficker outside the scope of being a mere courier. The question of whether a particular act is necessary for the work of a courier is fact-specific but this caveat must be construed strictly
: see 
Chum Tat Suan v Public Prosecutor
 
[2015] 1 SLR 834
 (“
Chum Tat Suan
”) at [66]–[68].
16    As a general proposition, the more functions an accused person performs beyond bringing drugs from point A to point B and the longer the duration of those functions, the less he can be said to be a mere courier: 
Public Prosecutor v Christeen d/o Jayamany and another
 
[2015] SGHC 126
 (“
Christeen
”) at [71]. 
A few factors provide some guidance on whether a particular role makes an accused person more than a courier.
 In 
Christeen
 at [68], I stated that 
these included whether the role is a common and ordinary incident of being a courier, whether such involvement is necessary to deliver the drugs, the extent in scope and time of the functions, the degree of executive decision-making powers and whether the offender receives a distinct form of benefit for performing his extra functions
. 
However, these factors are non-exhaustive and non-exclusive. No one factor or group of factors is determinative. As emphasised above, the inquiry is fact-specific.
[emphasis added]
31     We agree with the Judge’s observations as cited in the preceding paragraph. In the nature of things, it is impossible to lay down more specific guidelines simply because of the myriad permutations of fact situations that could possibly arise. In this regard, we also agree with the Judge that the list of relevant factors cannot be closed.
32     As is often the case, however, the difficulty lies in the 
application
 of the relevant guidelines to the facts at hand. In this regard, we will take the Appellant’s case at its highest and disregard the facts as well as effect(s) of the First Transaction. Indeed, at the hearing before us, Mr Low pointed to the thorny difficulties surrounding the admissibility as well as probative value of what has been termed “similar fact evidence”. However, it is well-established that there is no 
blanket
 rule against the admission of “similar fact evidence”; such evidence may be utilised in the 
limited
 manner envisaged within a 
strict
 application of, for example, ss 14 and 15 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) (see Jeffrey Pinsler SC, 
Evidence and the Litigation Process
 (LexisNexis, 5th Ed, 2015) at para 3.001). That this is so is evident from, for example, the decision of this court in 
Tan Meng Jee v Public Prosecutor
 
[1996] 2 SLR(R) 178
. Hence, for example, in so far as the present appeal is concerned, it could possibly have been argued that it was appropriate for the court to take the First Transaction into account for the 
limited
 purpose of demonstrating a 
specific
 state of mind on the part of the Appellant to the effect that (as the Judge found at [22] of the GD) he did intend to assist Mayday in repacking the heroin for sale in the Second Transaction as well, especially when regard is also had to the fact that the First Transaction and the Second Transaction were 
just a few days apart
. In this regard, s 14 of the Evidence Act and (in particular) Explanation 1 thereof are potentially relevant. Explanation 1 reads as follows:
Explanation 1.—A fact relevant as showing the existence of a relevant state of mind must show that the state of mind exists not generally but in reference to the particular matter in question.
33     However, as we have already reiterated, we will take the Appellant’s case at its highest and, to this end, will 
disregard
 the facts of the First Transaction and its possible effect(s) altogether. Indeed, the Judge himself was of the view that, 
even if
 he did 
not
 consider the facts as well as effect(s) of the First Transaction and had considered only the Second Transaction in isolation, he would still have found the Appellant’s involvement in the Second Transaction to have gone 
beyond
 that of a mere “courier” within the meaning of s 33B. In this regard, it is imperative to, 
inter alia
, examine closely the Judge’s reasoning when considering the Second Transaction in isolation. He reasoned as follows (at [23]−[25] of the GD):
23     
In any event
, the applicant’s role had exceeded that of a courier 
even if
 the 
second transaction
 was 
examined 
by itself
. 
His actions 
leading up to
 the 
second
 heroin transaction were the conduct of someone who was 
more
 than a mere courier. He 
played an active part
 in 
sourcing
 for the heroin 
and played the middleman 
in the negotiations between May Day and Ah Yong
. 
He facilitated the payment of the outstanding sum of $1,100 to Ah Yong, which was required before he would supply the heroin.
 The applicant argued that he had absolutely no discretion or decision-making powers and was merely a conduit in the price discussions between May Day and Ah Yong. He said that everything he did was on May Day’s instructions. Further, the applicant dealt with Ah Yong only because he was under the misapprehension that May Day and Ah Yong were not acquainted. Therefore, the applicant argued, this was a situation where May Day had simply used the applicant as a conduit and not one where May Day was actually dependent on the applicant’s contact for drug supply. However, the facts remained that the applicant’s actions were 
not 
a common and ordinary incident of couriering 
and
 were 
not 
necessary for the delivery of the drugs
. 
Even if he had no executive decision-making powers, this did not necessarily mean that he was a mere courier.
 As an example, a person who occupies a higher position in a syndicate can still act entirely as directed but he is nevertheless not a courier. 
Similarly, a person may be used as a mere pawn but this does not mean that his conduct will necessarily be confined to acts that are incidental and necessary to couriering. In helping to 
source
 for drugs 
and in serving as the go-between
 between May Day and Ah Yong, the applicant had already gone beyond the role of a mere delivery boy. The fact that he was the lesser party in his relationship with May Day and simply followed instructions was not determinative.
24    In any event, the applicant did not seem to know that May Day and Ah Yong knew each other at the material time and therefore could deal directly with each other. 
It should be pointed out that May Day’s request was to “look for two pounds of Heroin”. The request was not to source for heroin specifically from Ah Yong.
 In fact, there was evidence that the applicant also tried to source from other suppliers. The applicant sent an SMS message to May Day on 10 March 2009. When he was asked to explain the contents of the message which was in Malay, the applicant said in his statement dated 3 February 2010, “‘Mayday’ wanted me to look for heroin so I called Seetoh and Seetoh quoted the price of SGD 8800 for one pound of heroin.”
25    On the facts, the applicant had therefore failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that he was involved in the trafficking offence as a “courier” within the meaning of s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA. The applicant’s statements showed clearly that he was involved in more than mere delivery work and anything incidental thereto.
[emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]
34     It will be immediately apparent from the paragraphs of the GD quoted above that the 
key
 paragraph is 
para 23
, which does not refer, whether directly or indirectly, to the First Transaction. Indeed, it should be noted that the Judge himself 
commenced
 that particular paragraph by noting that “
[i]n any event
, [the Appellant’s] role had exceeded that of a courier 
even if
 the 
second transaction was examined 
by itself
” [emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]. It will also be immediately apparent from that particular paragraph that what prompted the Judge to find that the Appellant’s conduct had made him 
more
 than a mere courier was, in the main, the fact that he had both 
sourced
 for the heroin concerned 
and
 had 
played an active part as a middleman or go-between with regard to negotiations between Mayday and Ah Yong
. In our view, the Judge was wholly justified in arriving at these findings. In this particular regard, Mr Ng helpfully brought our attention to the very pertinent paragraphs in the cautioned statement of the Appellant himself, which read as follows:
24    On 19 March 2009 at about 6 plus in the evening, ‘Mayday’ called me on my handphone which bears the number 81068486.1 cannot remember what number did ‘Mayday’ call from. It must be from either one of the four numbers which was shown to me earlier from my Nokia N73 handphone. 
During the conversation
, 
‘Mayday’ asked me to look for two pounds of Heroin
. 
I then told him that I will try to call my friend ‘Ah Yong’. I did not give ‘Mayday’ ‘Ah Yong’s number because only I can deal with ‘Ah Yong’ as he trust me. ‘Mayday’ will not be able to deal with ‘Ah Yong’ as ‘Ah Yong’ does not know ‘Mayday’.
25    After talking to ‘Mayday’, 
I then called ‘Ah Yong’ at the same number which I called previously. During the conversation, I told ‘Ah Yong’ that I needed two pounds of Heroin
. ‘Ah Yong’ then quoted me S$8500 for one pound of Heroin. This price was agreed during the first transaction that we have with ‘Ah Yong’. During the first transaction conversation, ‘Ah Yong’ had already told me that he will charge me S$8500 per pound if I get from him on subsequent occasions. ‘Ah Yong’ also tell me that I have got to pay up the S$1100 which I owe previously before the second deal can go through. 
After that
 I 
then called ‘Mayday’ and inform him that he will need to pay S$17000 for two pounds of Heroin and also have to clear up what he owe for the previous consignment before the second deal can go through. ‘Mayday’ told me
 that he is only willing to pay S$16500. 
I then called back ‘Ah Yong’ and convey the message to him.
 However, ‘Ah Yong’ is not agreeable to the price, and he told me the best price he can give me is S$16600. 
I then convey this message back to ‘Mayday’.
 ‘Mayday’ was not agreeable to paying that amount and he say that he want to cancel the Heroin deal. 
I then called ‘Ah Yong’ back and convey this message.
 However, ‘Ah Yong’ told me that they had already packed the Heroin in Malaysia and is on the way to Singapore. As such
, 
I then called up ‘Mayday’ and inform him about this
. 
I also told ‘Mayday’ that the deal cannot be cancel already, ‘Mayday’ then agreed to take the two pounds of Heroin for S$16600. ‘Mayday’ then asked me to go to his house to get the S$1100 to clear what was owe during for the last consignment.
 After collecting the S$1100 at ‘Mayday’s’ house, ‘Mayday’ informed me to go to his house again at 11 plus in the night to collect the money for the Heroin. After this, I then went to ‘Raffles City’ to pay the same Chinese man the money which we owe ‘Ah Yong’ for the previous transaction. 
For this deal I made a lot of phone calls between ‘Mayday’ and ‘Ah Yong’. I cannot remember exactly how many calls I made to them.
[emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]
35     In our view, it is clear, from the Appellant’s own words as quoted in the preceding paragraph that he did (as the Judge found at [23] of the GD) not only actively source for the heroin in question but also actively participated in negotiations as a middleman or go-between with regard to the price to be paid for the heroin as well as the terms of delivery of the heroin between Ah Yong as seller and Mayday as buyer.
36     It is true that, on a 
literal
 reading of the aforementioned paragraphs of his cautioned statement, the Appellant had simply been involved in passing messages. However, in our judgment, he was 
no mere conduit pipe
. Bearing in mind the need to strictly construe the question of whether a particular act is necessary for the work of a “courier” (see above at [30]), in our view, 
it could not be said that he was performing acts which were merely incidental in the course of transporting, sending or delivery of drugs
. On the present facts, not only did he 
suggest, and initiate contact with, the drug supplier
 (
ie
, Ah Yong), he was 
also systematically involved in helping to negotiate the terms of the Second Transaction
. This clearly went 
beyond
 the role of a “courier” as envisaged under s 33B.
37     In the circumstances, the Appellant’s arguments with regard to Issue 1 are without merit and he therefore fails to meet the threshold requirement of demonstrating that he was merely a courier.
Issue 2
38     As already noted, this particular issue relates to the Appellant’s argument that the court can – and should – define what the phrase “substantively assisted” in s 33B(2)(
b
) means. It is important at the outset to note that this concept of “substantive assistance” pertains to assisting 
the 
CNB
 “in 
disrupting drug trafficking activities
 within 
or
 outside Singapore”
. The 
plain language
 of s 33B(2)(
b
) could not, in our view, be clearer 
in its 
context and import
. Indeed, it is of the first importance to point out, right at the outset, that this particular provision 
relates to 
subject matter
 that is 
clearly beyond the jurisdiction and power of the courts
. Put simply, it concerns the 
extra-legal 
situation relating to the 
CNB’s 
disruption of drug trafficking activities both within as well as outside Singapore
. Such a situation pertains to 
quintessentially 
operational 
matters that concern 
the CNB
, 
and the CNB alone
. Looked at in this light, it would, in our view, be 
wholly inapposite
 for 
the courts, in the exercise of their 
judicial 
power
, to even attempt to define what the phrase “substantively assisted” in s 33B(2)(
b
) should be. Indeed, as the 
language
 of s 33B(2)(
b
) 
makes clear
, whether or not substantive assistance has, in fact, been rendered to the CNB within the meaning and scope of that particular provision is to be determined by 
the Public Prosecutor
. This is the short – and in our view – definitive response to the Appellant’s argument that is, with respect, a 
non-starter
 in the circumstances.
39     At this juncture, we pause to make an obvious point. However, it is necessary to do so because, towards the end of oral submissions before this court, the Appellant, through Mr Low, made the point most strenuously to the effect that he had furnished substantive assistance to the CNB and was therefore entitled to receive a certificate pursuant to s 33B(2)(
b
). Whilst we understand that the Appellant might 
subjectively
 believe that he had rendered substantive assistance to the CNB pursuant to this particular provision, this would 
not necessarily
 entitle him to a certificate of substantive assistance if 
the Public Prosecutor
 was of the view that there was, in fact, 
no
 substantive assistance rendered within the meaning of s 33B(2)(
b
). Indeed, as this court has observed in 
Muhammad Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v Attorney-General
 
[2015] 5 SLR 1222
 at [44]−[48]:
44    It is not entirely clear what the Appellant means by “sufficient information”. In making this argument he refers to a portion of his examination-in-chief during the criminal trial where he stated that he would have given CNB any information he had pertaining to the drug syndicate he was dealing with. Therefore, we understand him to be arguing that he should be given the substantive assistance certificate because he had been forthcoming in disclosing all he knew to CNB.
45    It is abundantly clear from the Parliamentary debates at the Second Reading of the Bill that an offender’s good faith cooperation with CNB is not a necessary or sufficient basis for the PP to grant him a certificate of substantive assistance. The Minister moving the Bill stated that “[a]ssistance which does not enhance the enforcement effectiveness of CNB will not be sufficient” (
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (12 November 2012), vol 89 (Mr Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs)). Rather, the certificate would only be granted when the offender’s assistance yields actual results in relation to the disruption of drug trafficking.
46    The question of whether the offender had cooperated with CNB in good faith is an irrelevant consideration because the purpose of giving the court the discretion to sentence “couriers” (a term used during the Parliamentary debates to refer to persons whose involvement in the trafficking offence is limited to those acts enumerated in s 33B(2)(
a
) of the MDA) who have rendered substantive assistance to CNB to life imprisonment and caning instead of death is to enhance the operational effectiveness of CNB. It was thought that providing an incentive for offenders to come forward with information would enhance the operational effectiveness of CNB in two ways. First, it would give CNB an additional source of intelligence to clamp down on drug trafficking activities. Second, it would disrupt drug trafficking syndicates’ established practices and create an atmosphere of risk for the members of these syndicates as there would be uncertainty as to whether an apprehended courier would reveal all their secrets. …
47    The fact that an offender cooperates in good faith with CNB in and of itself does not enhance CNB’s operational effectiveness. The Minister for Law explained this point in the following manner (
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (14 November 2012), vol 89 (Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)):
Some Members have asked, would it be better to say that the courier has done his best, that he has acted in good faith − should he not qualify. …
The short answer is that it is not a realistic option because every courier, once he is primed, will seem to cooperate. Remember we are dealing not with an offence committed on the spur of the moment. We are dealing with offences instigated by criminal organisations which do not play by the rules, which will look at what you need, what your criteria are and send it to you. So if you say just cooperate, just do your best, all your couriers will be primed with beautiful stories, most of which will be unverifiable but on the face of it, they have cooperated, they did their best. And the death penalty will then not be imposed and you know what will happen to the deterrent value. Operational effectiveness will not be enhanced. …
48    In the premises, we do not accept the Appellant’s first argument. In fact, the PP would be acting 
ultra vires
 if he were to exercise his discretion under s 33B(2)(
b
) of the MDA in favour of an offender simply on the basis that he was forthcoming in disclosing all he knew to CNB even though the information he gave did not lead to the actual disruption of drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore.
40     To return to the reasoning encapsulated above at [39], such reasoning was, in fact, elaborated upon in more detail by the Judge in the court below. In particular, the Judge referred to 
the relevant Parliamentary Debates
 during the Second Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill (No 27 of 2012). He referred, first (in the GD at [28]), to the following observations by Mr Teo in the 
12 November Parliamentary Debates
, where Mr Teo had stated that it was for 
the Public Prosecutor
 to determine if substantive assistance had in fact been provided in a particular case:
The aim of the “substantive assistance” condition is to enhance the operational effectiveness of the CNB, by allowing investigators to reach higher into the hierarchy of drug syndicates. “Substantive assistance” in disrupting drug trafficking activities may include, for example, the provision of information leading to the arrest or detention or prosecution of any person involved in any drug trafficking activity. Assistance which does not enhance the enforcement effectiveness of the CNB will not be sufficient. In order to ensure that this significant power is used judiciously and in a fair manner, the Public Prosecutor will determine whether there is in fact “substantive assistance” in any particular case. The new section 33B of the MDA provides that where the Public Prosecutor certifies that the defendant substantively cooperated with the CNB, the court will have the discretion to sentence the convicted person to life imprisonment with caning of at least 15 strokes, or death.
41     The issue as to whether the courts should decide on, or provide criteria for determining, whether an accused person had provided “substantive assistance” was canvassed in the Parliamentary debates. The Minister for Law, Mr K Shanmugam, made the following observations (see 
Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report
 (14 November 2012) vol 89 (“the 
14 November Parliamentary Debates
”)):
Next, on the issue of who decides cooperation 
and by what criteria
. 
The Bill provides for the Public Prosecutor to assess whether the courier has substantively assisted CNB.
I think Ms Sylvia Lim, Mr Pritam Singh, Mrs Chiam and Ms Faizah Jamal have concerns here. Their view is: it is an issue of life and death – the discretion should lie with the courts to decide on cooperation.
…
The Courts decide questions of guilt and culpability. As for the operational value of assistance provided by the accused, 
the Public Prosecutor is better placed to decide
. 
The Public Prosecutor is independent and at the same time, works closely with law enforcement agencies and has a good understanding of operational concerns.
 An additional important consideration is protecting the confidentiality of operational information.
 
The very phrase “substantive assistance” is an operational question and turns on the operational parameters and demands of each case. Too precise a definition may limit and hamper the operational latitude of the Public Prosecutor, as well as the CNB.
 It may also discourage couriers from offering useful assistance which falls outside of the statutory definition.
[emphasis added in bold-italics]
42     The observations cited in the preceding paragraph underscore the point made earlier to the effect that it is for 
the Public Prosecutor
 to determine whether substantive assistance has been provided in the case concerned. More importantly, the Judge also elucidated the negative developments which could result if the courts attempted to define “substantive assistance” (see the GD at [32]−[35]):
32    To attempt a definition will conceivably give rise to an infinite number of such applications seeking directions as to whether some fact ought to be considered or excluded. As part of its multi-faceted inquiry, the Public Prosecutor may well take into account the potential value of any information given in disrupting drug trafficking activities. However, this is just one among a multitude of extra-legal factors that it may choose to take into account. In this regard, no exhaustive definition is possible. Ultimately, whether a courier is deemed to have substantively assisted is largely a value judgment that the Public Prosecutor is better placed to make. I alluded to this in 
Ridzuan
 at [50]:
In this regard, I accept the AG’s submission that the determination of whether a person has substantively assisted the CNB involves a multi-faceted inquiry, which may include a multitude of extra-legal factors, such as:
(a)    the upstream and downstream effects of any information provided;
(b)    the operational value of any information provided to existing intelligence; and
(c)    the veracity of any information provided when counterchecked against other intelligence sources.
The overarching question will inevitably be whether the operational effectiveness of the CNB has been enhanced. This is largely a value judgment which necessarily entails a certain degree of subjectivity. In this regard, the court should be careful not to substitute its own judgment for the PP’s judgment. Realistically speaking, the PP is much better placed to assess the operational value of the assistance provided by the accused. Hence the grounds of review have been confined to bad faith, malice and unconstitutionality.
33    In the recent decision of 
Muhammad Ridzuan bin Mohd Ali v Attorney-General
 
[2015] SGCA 53
, the Court of Appeal, in dismissing Ridzuan’s appeal against my refusal to grant leave for judicial review, also held (at [66]) that “the Judge is not the appropriate person to determine the question of whether a convicted drug trafficker has rendered substantive assistance”. In my view, to attempt to define the meaning of substantive assistance would be a hindrance rather than a help to the Public Prosecutor’s determination of that question on the facts of each case.
34    In 
Ridzuan
 at [50], I was not laying down various factors that were relevant to the ascertainment of whether substantive assistance had been provided. I was merely providing some examples of extra-legal factors that the Public Prosecutor could possibly take into account in coming to his determination. The applicant’s submission that the courts had already given clarity on the factors that go toward substantive assistance was therefore not correct. In 
Ridzuan
 at [45], I also said that an offender’s criminal conduct was not relevant to the determination of whether he had provided substantive assistance to the CNB. I was simply responding to a particular argument that was made in 
Ridzuan
, which was an application for leave for judicial review. Ridzuan argued that his right to equal protection in Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1985 Rev Ed, 1999 Reprint) had been breached as Abdul Haleem received the certificate of substantive assistance while he did not, although they were both couriers who had engaged in the same criminal conduct. I was not commenting on the meaning of substantive assistance. I think it is not controversial that an offender’s actions before arrest (his criminal conduct) should have no bearing on whether he provides substantive assistance after arrest.
35    The particular interpretation sought was also of no utility because an assessment of whether the assistance given has the “potential to disrupt” drug trafficking activities similarly calls for a value judgment that the Public Prosecutor has been tasked to make and which cannot be challenged except on the grounds of bad faith, malice and unconstitutionality. …
43     We agree with the reasoning of the Judge as set out above as well as with the manner in which he distinguished the Singapore position from that in the United States and New Zealand (see the GD at [36]−[40] and [41]−[43], respectively).
44     For the reasons set out above, we find no merit in the Appellant’s arguments in so far as Issue 2 is concerned.
Issue 3
45     As already noted above, in light of our decision with regard to 
Issue 1
, Issue 3 is moot inasmuch as evidence of the Appellant’s mental condition at the time of commission of the offence will not suffice to avail the Appellant of s 33B(1)(
b
) as he has not demonstrated that he satisfies the threshold requirement set out in s 33B(3)(
a
).
46     However, 
even if
 the Appellant satisfies the threshold requirement set out in s 33B(3)(
a
), we are of the view that he would 
not
, 
in any event
, satisfy the requirement set out in s 33B(3)(
b
). At this juncture, it would be apposite for us to make certain observations about the exception under s 33B(3)(
b
). Section 33B(3)(
b
) is, in substance, a reproduction of what is the doctrine of diminished responsibility to a charge of murder pursuant to Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). 
However
, s 33B(3)(
b
) must be read and applied 
within the context of s 33B in general and s 33B(3) in particular
. Put simply, s 33B(3)(
b
) is 
not, in and of itself
, of 
general or (more precisely) standalone
 application (
unlike
 a 
general
 defence) inasmuch as 
the mere demonstration that the applicant possessed an abnormality of mind within the meaning of this provision will 
not
 avail the applicant
, as noted above, 
except to (and only to) the extent 
that his involvement in the offence concerned was as a “courier” within the meaning of s 33B(3)(
a
)
. In this regard, s 33B(3)(
b
) is not unlike Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code which similarly does not operate as a general defence. In other words, s 33B(3) encompasses 
a 
very limited 
exception
 inasmuch as Parliament was not minded, as a matter of 
policy
 , to extend the benefit of s 33B(1)(
b
) to applicants whose involvement in the offence concerned went 
beyond
 that of a courier, 
regardless
 of their mental condition. It should also be noted that the exception should be construed 
narrowly
, as is evident from the observations made by Mr Teo during the Parliamentary debates surrounding the enactment of s 33B(3)(
b
) (see the 
14 November Parliamentary Debates
):
But before I do so, let me speak about the sentencing discretion for the death penalty for drug couriers with an abnormality of mind which satisfies the diminished responsibility test. While there is strong support for the mandatory death penalty, there is also a legitimate concern that it may be applied without sufficient regard for those accused persons who might be suffering from an abnormality of mind.
The policy intent is for this exception to operate in a measured and narrowly defined way. We want to take this into account, where an accused can show that he has such an abnormality of mind that it substantially impairs his mental responsibility for his acts in relation to his offences. Such cases are worthy of special consideration. However, in Mr de Souza’s words, 
we do not want to inadvertently “open the backdoor for the offender to escape harsh punishment notwithstanding his or her understanding of the consequence of the crime”
.
[emphasis added]
47     With the above considerations in mind, we turn now to consider the content of Dr Winslow’s Report. Dr Winslow’s Report states that “[the Appellant’s] results indicated that he 
likely 
meets
 diagnostic criteria for ADHD [
viz
, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]” [emphasis added] and that the results “also indicated significant problems with self-concept, learning difficulties, inattentive symptoms, and restlessness consistent with his self-report”. 
However
, 
notwithstanding
 the fact that it was initially stated that the Appellant only “
likely 
meets
 diagnostic criteria for ADHD”, the Report proceeds (in the very next paragraph) to state a 
definitive
 diagnosis for ADHD as follows:
18    In our opinion. Mr. Rosman met diagnostic criteria for 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly inattentive presentation, Severe
 (ADHD; DSM-V; 314.00) at the material time. Mr. Rosman reported (Criterion A) a persistent pattern of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity that has interfered with his functioning and development as characterized by; (Alb) often has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks and remaining focused; (Ale) has difficulty organizing tasks and activities; (Alf) often avoids engaging in tasks that require sustained mental effort; (Alh) is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli; and (Ali) is often forgetful in daily activities. Mr. Rosman also reported (A2a) fidgeting, squirming in seat; (A2c) feeling restless; (A2e) is often ‘on the go’. Mr. Rosman’s symptoms were present prior to 12 years of age (Criterion B), and his symptoms are present in two or more settings including home, school, work, and with relatives (Criterion C). Mr. Rosman’s symptoms have interfered with and reduced the quality of his social, academic, and occupational functioning (Criterion D). His symptoms do not occur exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder. [Bold font in original]
48     The Report proceeds to state, with reference to 
the Appellant’s history of drug abuse
, as follows:
19    In our opinion Mr. Rosman also met diagnostic criteria for 
Stimulant Use Disorder, Amphetamine-Type Substance, Severe (DSM-V; 304.40)
 at the material time. He also met diagnostic criteria for 
Sedative Use Disorder, Severe (DSM-V; 304.10)
 at the material time. Mr. Rosman’s pattern of methamphetamine (ice) and sedative (Erimin) use (Criterion A) led to clinically significant impairment and distress as manifested by the following within a 12 month period: (A1) stimulant and sedative taken in larger amounts over a longer period of time that was intended; (A2) persistent desire and unsuccessful effort to cut down or control his stimulant and sedative use; (A3) a great deal of time was spent in activities necessary to obtain the stimulant and sedative; (A4) strong cravings and desires to use the stimulants and sedatives; (A6) continued stimulant and sedative use despite having persistent and recurrent social and interpersonal problems exacerbated by the use; (A8) recurrent use of stimulants and sedatives in situations that are physically hazardous; (A9) continued use despite knowledge of having physical or psychological problem that is exacerbated by use; (A10) tolerance defined by a) markedly increased amount of stimulants and sedatives to achieve desired effect; (All) withdrawal manifested by characteristic withdrawal symptoms.
20    Mr. Rosman’s long-term polysubstance use history from a very young age is likely due to a combination of factors including underlying low IQ and learning difficulties exacerbated by undiagnosed 
and
 untreated ADHD, long-term physical abuse and neglect from early childhood, and the resulting subsequent stunted emotional and cognitive development.
21    Mr. Rosman’s tendency towards using substances from an early age is extreme but somewhat typical for an individual with his developmental trajectory. He has developed a core belief of inadequacy, lack of self-esteem and self-confidence, and chronic low-mood that has been masked by a lifetime of coping with substances.
[Bold font in original; emphasis added in italics]
49     Dr Winslow’s Report then 
concludes
 as follows:
22    Mr. Rosman was assessed to be 
of sound mind and fit to plead
. His underlying ADHD symptomology, low IQ, and stunted emotional development would have 
contributed to
 the commission of his offences. Mr. Rosman’s difficulties controlling his impulses, inattention, and long-term need for substances to dull his emotional pain from a childhood of abuse were significant factors that predisposed and perpetuated his substance use. It is 
also likely
 that his heavy methamphetamine use and dependence at the time of the offenses 
would have
 impacted his judgement [
sic
] and impulse control. [Bold font in original; emphasis added in bold italics]
50     Leaving aside the point (as noted above at [47]) that there appears to be an inconsistency in the level of definitiveness in the diagnosis by Dr Winslow of the Appellant with regard to ADHD, even accepting that particular diagnosis, there is, first, 
no clear connection
 established between the diagnosis of ADHD on the one hand and the diagnosis of Stimulant Use Disorder as well as Sedative Use Disorder on the other. Put simply (and with respect), the connection (if any) is 
extremely general and vague
.
51     More importantly, perhaps, the 
conclusion
 of the Report (reproduced above at [49], and which, by its very nature, is of 
crucial importance
) is, with respect, 
also extremely general and vague – at least in so far as it purports to be relevant to the satisfaction of the criterion laid down in s 33B(3)(
b
)
.
52     In so far as the Appellant’s alleged 
ADHD
 condition is concerned, it is true that the phrase “contributed to” is used in Dr Winslow’s Report in relation to the commission of the offence for which he was charged. However, in our judgment, the use of this particular phrase does not sufficiently explain how and to what extent this condition contributed to the commission of the offence; put simply, we fail to see a causal link between the Appellant’s alleged ADHD condition and the offences which he committed. In our view, such a broad and sweeping conclusion does not come close to controverting the more contemporaneous IMH Report, wherein it was concluded that first, the Appellant “does not have any mental disorder currently or at around the material time [
ie
, the time of the offence]” and secondly, “he does not have an abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes or induced by disease, or injury) that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his act of drug trafficking”. It should be noted that the latter finding was framed in terms of the legal test for establishing whether a defence of diminished responsibility may be made out which, as noted above (at [46]), is similar to the inquiry under s 33B(3)(
b
).
53     More specifically, whilst there is 
also
 a subsequent reference to the Appellant’s 
drug use and dependence
 in Dr Winslow’s Report, the conclusion drawn is that “[i]t is 
also 
likely
 that his [the Appellant’s] heavy methamphetamine use and dependence at the time of the offenses [
sic
] 
would have
 impacted his judgement [
sic
] and impulse control” [emphasis added in bold italics and underlined bold italics]. This last-mentioned conclusion is, with respect, 
not only extremely general and vague but is also speculative in nature
. Indeed, this is why the Respondent (in relation to the point made in the report with regard to the Appellant’s drug use and dependence) argues in his Supplementary Submissions – and we agree – that Dr Winslow’s Report is 
irrelevant
.
54     The Respondent also argues – persuasively, in our view − that the IMH Report and the Appellant’s own investigation statements as well as the evidence adduced at his trial clearly demonstrate that the Appellant exhibited clarity of mind at or around the time of the commission of the offence. For example, the Respondent points to certain excerpts of the Appellant’s testimony under cross-examination where he explained his decision not to implicate Mayday in a cautioned statement he had given to a CNB officer shortly after his arrest:
A:
… I got no reason to implicate Mayday. I was thinking that if I inform the officer at that time that the drugs belong to Mayday, I will still be charged. There was no difference, Your Honour. And also, I did not implicate Mayday because I do not want to add to my problem because Mayday will look for me. Any time, he can take revenge on me. If I betray Mayday, I may face problem in prison. I may have enemies in prison. So when I informed the officer, when I gave this statement to the officer, I was thinking that this was not going to be a capital charge. So, I take responsibility to it and I do not implicate Mayday.
55     The Respondent further relies on the awareness of the Appellant as to what was transpiring when he agreed to be involved in the Second Transaction:
 
Court:
 
 
Yes. Why was there a need for you to be the middleman? Why couldn’t Ah Yong speak to Mahadhir directly?
 
 
Witness:
 
 
Because, Your Honour, Mahadhir is the boss. So he just instructed me to do all these and if I was caught, I would be the one who had---who carry this burden.
 
 
Court:
 
 
No, but these are negotiations on price. … Why don’t you let the two bosses speak to each other? ...
 
 
Witness:
 
 
Because Mayday does not want to expose himself, Your Honour.
 
 
Court:
 
 
Meaning to the police or to Ah Yong?
 
 
Witness:
 
 
To both.
 
56     In addition to the above, we note in his further statement, dated 23 March 2009, his thought process in deciding to embark on his criminal behaviour:
36    … I do know that Heroin is illegal and this amount is a big amount which will led to death penalty but I was desperate in repaying ‘Mayday’ the debt. I got no choice but to do the Heroin run.
In our judgment, the above shows that the Appellant did weigh the costs and benefits of embarking on this criminal conduct and made the conscious and informed decision to do so, notwithstanding that he was fully apprised of the consequences of his actions. It should also be noted that the debt which the Appellant owed to Mayday did not arise as a result, for example, of the Appellant having to satiate his drug addiction but was as a result of a botched deal in early 2009 when the Appellant went to Malaysia to source Ice for both him and Mayday.
57     We note that in the recent Singapore High Court decision of 
Phua Han Chuan Jeffery v Public Prosecutor
 
[2016] 3 SLR 706
 (“
Jeffery Phua
”), Choo Han Teck J held (at [15]) that even if the applicant knew that what he was doing was wrong and risky, he may still lack the will to resist the commission of the offence and a man may know what he is doing and intend to do it and yet suffer from such abnormality of mind as substantially impairs his mental responsibility. In that case, Choo J found (at [16]) that although the accused person knew that he was committing an illegal act, he still fell within the ambit of s 33B(3)(
b
) because the abnormality of mind had “an influence on the applicant’s ability to resist the act in question”. It should be noted, however, that the medical experts in that case had both diagnosed the accused person with a Persistent Depressive Disorder and a Ketamine Dependence and it was on this basis that Choo J had found (at [17]) that the accused person was probably incapable of implementing any internal rationality that might have dissuaded him from committing the offence.
58     In our view, what separates the present case from that of 
Jeffery Phua
 is that Dr Winslow’s Report is, 
at best
, as noted above, 
neutral
 and does not even support the assertion that the Appellant was suffering from such abnormality of mind that impaired his mental responsibility for his criminal act.
59      
More importantly
, given the nature of the findings in Dr Winslow’s report, we find that it cannot even be said that they are 
inconsistent 
with those in 
the IMH Report
. There was therefore nothing substantive that could, in fact, have been remitted to the High Court in order for (as the Appellant requested) further evidence to be taken. Indeed, it was 
not even new evidence
 that could pass muster under the established legal principles – not least because it would not, as already explained, have had an important influence on the outcome of the case.
60     To summarise, Issue 3 is moot in light of our decision on Issue 1. In any event, Dr Winslow’s Report is, at best, neutral and is of no avail to the Appellant as it is not inconsistent with the IMH Report.
Conclusion

 Lee Seiu Kin J:
1       On 17 February 2015, in Committal Hearing No 154 of 2011, the accused was committed to stand trial in the High Court on 15 charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). At the trial before me on 18 October 2016, the prosecution proceeded on the first charge, which is punishable by death. That charge (“the Charge”) was as follows:
 
1
ST
 CHARGE
     on 12 October 2011, at about 11:50 am, inside a car (registration number SGW 5275 L), at Jurong West Street 52, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class '”A” of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185 (“MDA”), 
to wit
, by having in your possession for the purposes of trafficking, fifteen (15) packets and six (6) bundles containing 
not less than 61.75 grams of diamorphine
, without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, an offence under s 5(l)(a) read with s 5(2), MDA and punishable under s 33(1), MDA, and further upon your conviction, you may alternatively be liable to be punished under s 33B, MDA.
2       After the Charge was read to the accused, he pleaded guilty. However, s 227(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”) states that, where the offence is punishable with death, the court shall not record the plea of guilty unless evidence is led by the prosecution to prove its case at trial. Accordingly, I called upon the prosecution to give evidence to prove the Charge.
3       The prosecution gave evidence by way of a statement of agreed facts (“SAF”) to be used as a formal admission under s 267 of the CPC. Counsel for the accused confirmed that the accused agreed to the contents of the SAF and its use under s 267 of the CPC. I set out below the provisions of s 267 of the CPC:
 
Proof by formal admission
 
 
267.
—(1) Subject to this section, any fact of which oral evidence may be given in any criminal proceedings may be admitted for the purpose of those proceedings by or on behalf of the Public Prosecutor or the accused, and the admission by any party of any such fact under this section shall as against that party be conclusive evidence in those proceedings of the fact admitted.
(2)    An admission under this section —
(
a
)    may be made before or at the proceedings;
(
b
)    if made otherwise than in court, must be in writing;
(
c
)    if made in writing by an individual, must purport to be signed by the person making it and, if so made by a body corporate, limited liability partnership, partnership or unincorporated association, must purport to be signed by a duly authorised representative of that body corporate, limited liability partnership, partnership or unincorporated association, as the case may be;
(
d
)    if made on behalf of an accused who is an individual, must be made by his advocate; and
(
e
)    if made before the trial by an accused who is an individual, must be approved by his advocate before or at the proceedings in question.
(3)    An admission under this section for the purpose of proceedings relating to any matter shall be treated as an admission for the purpose of any subsequent criminal proceedings relating to that matter, including any appeal or retrial.
(4)    An admission under this section may with the leave of the court be withdrawn in the proceedings for which it is made or any subsequent criminal proceedings relating to the same matter.
4       I was satisfied that the SAF may be used as evidence in the trial as the admissions therein were made by counsel for the accused on behalf of the latter. Accordingly, I admitted the SAF in evidence. The contents of the SAF are as follows:
 
I
.     
The accused’s arrest and background
 
1    The accused person is Mohamad Noor Bin Abdullah, a 39 year old Singaporean (D.O.B: 18 July 1977) and holder of NRIC No.: [xxx]. At the material time, he was unemployed.
2    On 12 October 2011 at about 10 am, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”), Singapore were instructed at an operations briefing to proceed to Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1, Singapore to conduct observation on the unit at #08-523. They were informed to look out for a male Malay known by the nickname “Boy”, who was suspected of involvement in drug activities. The CNB officers then proceeded to the vicinity of Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1, and kept observation. At about 11.16am, the accused, who fitted the description of “Boy”, was seen walking at the ground floor of Blk 336 with a sling bag and a plastic bag. He then entered a car bearing registration number SGW 5275L (“the Car”) which was driven by another person.
3    The CNB officers then followed the Car from Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1 to the car park at Blk 4 and Blk 5 Marsiling Road. At the car park, near to Blk 5 Marsiling Road, the accused handed an envelope, which he knew contained heroin, to an unknown female Chinese. The Car left the car park at about 11.30am. The officers continued following the Car until it reached the car park behind Blk 525 and Blk 527 Jurong West Street 52, Singapore, which was in the vicinity of Blk 523. There, at about 11.50am, the officers stopped the Car and effected arrest of the accused who was in the front passenger seat.

Search and seizure
 
4    After his arrest, the sling bag and plastic bag which the accused was seen carrying when he was at Blk 336 Woodlands Avenue 1 were searched by the Station Inspector Tay Cher Yean, and they found, 
inter alia
, the following items which were suspected to contain controlled drugs:

5    The said six bundles and 15 packets of granular substances (“the Drugs”) were placed in tamper-proof bags and handed over to Senior Station Inspector Ng David (“SSI Ng”).
6    On 12 October 2011 at about 7pm, SSI Ng handed over the Drugs to the investigating officer at the time, then Inspector Almumin Ehsan Bin Akbar Ali (“IO Almumin”).

Investigations
 
12    Investigations revealed that sometime in August 2011, the accused, Mohd Anuar bin Sujak (“Anuar”) and persons unknown had agreed to perform specific tasks in relation to procuring, storing and delivering heroin for the purpose of trafficking. Pursuant to the agreement, the accused was to deliver heroin to Anuar’s customers.
13    Sometime on 11 October 2011, Anuar instructed the accused to make a drug delivery to a place in Jurong West the next day (i.e. 12 October 2011). Anuar promised Noor $100 for the said delivery and the accused agreed.
14    On 12 October 2011, the accused received the following calls with instructions on the delivery of the Drugs:
(a)    At about 10 am, Anuar called the accused, whilst the latter was at the Flat, and told him to:
(i)    take a red plastic bag (later marked as “L1”) and a white plastic bag (later marked “L1A”) from the storeroom of the Flat. Both the accused and Anuar knew that “L1” and “L1A” contained heroin;
(ii)   wait for a call from a Malaysian male who would provide further instructions on when and who to deliver “L1” and “L1A” (with the 6 bundles) to; and
(iii)   take envelopes, which both the accused and Anuar knew that each envelope contained heroin, from the storeroom of the Flat. Anuar informed the accused that he would provide further details on the delivery of these envelopes later in the day.
The accused proceeded to assist Anuar. After retrieving the relevant items from the storeroom, the accused put “L1A” (with its contents) inside “L1”. He also placed the said envelopes into his black sling bag.
(b)    Subsequently, the accused received a call from an unknown Malaysian male who instructed him to deliver “L1” and “L1A” to one “Hassan” at Blk 523 Jurong West. The accused acknowledged the said instructions. The call was made from a Malaysia-registered phone line. The said Malaysian male informed the accused that “Hassan” was a male Chinese and also provided the latter’s contact number which the accused saved in his mobile phone as “Hassan (JW)”.
(c)    At about 11am, Anuar called the accused and told him to deliver one of the envelopes to an unknown female Chinese at Blk 5 Marsiling Road before proceeding to Jurong West. The accused acknowledged what the accused had conveyed to him.
15    At about 11 am, the accused left the Flat carrying his black sling bag (containing the envelopes of heroin) and “L1” (containing 6 bundles of heroin). At about 11.16am, the accused boarded the Car, driven by Hairil, and sat in the front passenger seat. Hairil then drove the Car to the car park at Blk 4 and Blk 5 Marsiling Road. There, the accused delivered one of the envelopes to the said unknown female Chinese, as earlier told to do so by Anuar.
16    The accused then requested Hairil to drive the Car to Jurong West. At about 11.30am, the Car left the said Marsiling Road car park. At about 11.50 am, the Car reached the car park behind Blk 525 and Blk 527 Jurong West Street 52, which was in the vicinity of Blk 523. There, CNB officers stopped the Car and placed the accused under arrest.
17    As at the time of his arrest on 12 October 2011, the accused was not authorised under the MDA or the regulations made thereunder to traffic in a controlled drug.
5       Upon admission of the SAF in evidence, the prosecution rested its case. I found that the prosecution had made out a 
prima facie
 case and called upon the accused to give his defence in accordance with s 230(1)(
m
) of the CPC. The accused elected to remain silent. Thereafter, I found that the evidence before me was sufficient to prove the accused’s guilt and convicted him of the Charge.
6       The prosecution tendered a certificate by the Public Prosecutor stating that the accused had substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. After hearing submissions by counsel, I agreed that the evidence showed that the accused’s involvement in the offence was restricted to transporting, sending or delivering the controlled drug which was the subject of the Charge. Accordingly, by operation of s 33B(1)(
a
) of the MDA, this court had a discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment with caning instead of the death penalty.
7       After considering the accused’s antecedents and his counsel’s plea in mitigation, I found that this was an appropriate case to exercise the discretion to impose the lesser punishment. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to life imprisonment with effect from the date of his arrest on 12 October 2011 and to the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane.",2016-11-18 00:00:00,SG High Court
3006262,Sentencing remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw: R v Stephen Port,"R v Stephen Port 

Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Openshaw 

Central Criminal Court 
25th November 2016 

 

Following a lengthy trial, Stephen Port falls to be sentenced following his conviction for four 
separate offences of murder; the mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment, but I must 
consider whether to fix a minimum term and if so for how long; in order to do so I must set out the 
facts of these dreadful offences, and indeed the facts of the other serious sexual assaults committed 
upon seven other victims. The evidence took fully four weeks, I seek now only to summarise the 
facts in broad outline. 

The defendant Stephen Port is now aged 41. The evidence establishes that his sexual preference is 
for penetrating very young men, whom he has rendered unconscious by the surreptitious 
administration of drugs. His drug of choice was GHB (or the closely related GBL), about which the 
evidence was given by a distinguished forensic toxicologist. The drug was originally manufactured as 
a medical anaesthetic. Now, often known simply as ‘G’, it is abused in low dosages to produce short‐
lived euphoria: however, beyond low dosages, the drug is highly dangerous, since the resultant 
toxicity, can cause dizziness, nausea, then in sequence drowsiness, unconsciousness and eventually 
coma, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest and death; the precise mechanism of death may vary, as was 
explained by the forensic pathologists who gave evidence at the trial.  

One of the particular dangers presented by the drugs is that, whether presented as a dissolved 
powder or as a liquid, it is colourless and so can readily be used to ‘spike’ a drink without detection; 
the characteristic taste can readily be masked by mixing it with other strong flavours. 

Victim A 

The earliest a victim was A, an intelligent and articulate university student who in 2012 had just 
turned 19. He made contact with the defendant on Grindr, a gay dating website. He went to the 
defendant’s flat; they chatted, the defendant seemed to him to be polite and friendly, his mood was 
relaxed; there was, he said, ‘nothing to ring alarm bells’. He was then given a glass of red wine, 
which he drank; he noticed congealed powder at the bottom of the glass, he immediately suspected 
that his drink had been spiked. He described how he became dizzy and disoriented; his balance and 
thought processes were disturbed. He then lost unconsciousness; he was aware that he had been 
taken into the bedroom, undressed and raped by the defendant but he felt mentally and physically 
unable to resist because of his drugged state.  

 

1
--------
On his return to university, he made an immediate complaint to a friend and indeed sought medical 
advice because he believed that he had been drugged. 

He came forward to the police following the report of the defendant’s arrest.  

This gives rise to the charge in count 1 of administering a substance with intent to stupefy or 
overpower the victim, so as to enable the defendant to engage in sexual activity with him contrary 
to section 61(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and to the charge of rape in count 2. 

Victim B  

B was aged 20 at the time that he met the defendant through another gay website in June 2014. He 
also said that, at first, he felt quite safe and comfortable with the defendant whom he thought to be 
‘a very nice guy’. He also was induced to take a (non‐alcoholic) drink, which rendered him 
immediately unconscious. When he came round, he described what he called the terrifying effect: it 
felt as if he had no control over his body, he was shouting and screaming and calling out for help.  

The defendant took him to the station at Barking, still in this state; there, officers from the Transport 
Police officer saw him distressed, incoherent, unsteady on his feet and producing green vomit. 
Significantly, the defendant said that he (B) had taken ‘G’. 

B was not able to say with certainty that the defendant had penetrated him in this condition, 
therefore there is no charge of rape, just a count of administering a substance with intent, as 
charged in count 3.  

When the jury came to consider the defendant’s knowledge and intention in relation to the next 
victim, Anthony Walgate, they will no doubt have had in mind the effect that he knew that that the 
administration of the drug had had upon A and B.  

Anthony Walgate 

I come then to Anthony Walgate, who was aged 23. He had come down to London from Hull to 
study. In her victim personal statement, which of course I have read with and sympathy, his mother 
describes Anthony as being clever, funny and talented; all he ever wanted was to be a famous 
fashion designer and with his passion and determination, she was sure that he would have made it. 

One of his friends said that he was not very good at managing his money with the result that he 
resorted to working as an occasional gay escort. However, he took such precautions as he could: he 
always obtained the client’s address in advance, and secured a photograph, which information the 
always posted to others so that they would know where he was and indeed who he was with.  

Through a gay website the made contact with the defendant, and arranged to meet at Barking 
station on the evening of the 17 June 2014; they agreed that he would be paid £800 for an all‐night 
session. Since the defendant had no savings of any kind, and certainly did not have access to £800, I 
do not think that he had the slightest intention of paying.  

From a later examination of Anthony Walgate’s Oyster card, confirmed by the cell siting of his 
mobile phone, it can be established that he arrived at the station just before a quarter past 10, that 
evening.  

He was never seen alive again; nor was his telephone ever used again. I think that the inevitable and 
irresistible inference is that the defendant deliberately administered a drugs overdose to Anthony 
Walgate, with the intention of penetrating him whilst he was unconscious, which I have no doubt he 
did.  

 

2
--------
For a variety of reasons, which were explained by the pathologists, it is not possible to say precisely 
when Anthony died, but I am quite sure that he was dead when the defendant calmly went to work 
on the late shift the following day.  

He returned from work at about 4 o’clock in the morning of now the 19 June. By this time he had 
dressed Anthony’s body, which was probably already stiff with rigor mortis; he then dragged the 
body to deposit it on the path outside; he had planted in his pocket a small bottle of GHB, so as to 
give the impression that Anthony had died from a self‐administered overdose; he then removed and 
disposed of Anthony’s mobile phone, by which he feared that the contact between them would be 
traced. He then telephoned the ambulance reporting that he had, by chance, come upon the body 
young man collapsed outside his house. There Anthony’s body was found. 

He then repeated that version in a witness statement.  

The pathologist reported that the GHB levels in Anthony’s body were so high as to cause death by 
drugs toxicity. 

 Later, the defendant was interviewed again; even when the police put to him that they had 
discovered that the defendant had met Anthony through an on line dating app., he denied it.  

He then changed his story to suggest that Anthony had visited him at his flat but that his death was 
the result of a self‐administered overdose. The defendant said that he moved the body outside out 
of panic, lest the police should quite mistakenly think that he had in some way been responsible for 
his death; he even suggested that he feared that they might suspect him of murder. 

His earlier lies led to his conviction for an offence of perverting the course of justice, and a short 
prison sentence; there the matter rested, his later story being apparently taken at face value. 
Whether the police were right to do so, in the light of what they knew or ought to have found out, is 
for others to decide having thoroughly inquired into the matter, which it has not been appropriate 
for us to do in the course of the criminal trial.   

He repeated his later story in the course of his evidence to the jury, which they understandably 
rejected. 

These events give rise to his conviction for murder as charged in Count 4, and administering a 
substance in count 6.  

The jury were discharged from reaching a verdict on the alternative charge of manslaughter as 
charged in count 5 (as indeed they were on other such alternatives in counts 8, 11 and 24).  

Gabriel Kovari 

Gabriel Kovari was a 22‐year‐old Slovakian, who moved into the defendant’s flat on the 23 August 
2014.  

It is, I think, quite clear that the defendant had designs upon Gabriel Kovari: the day after he moved 
in, the defendant asked a friend to come and meet ‘his new Slovakian twink flatmate’, and the next 
day he wrote, suggestively as it seems to me, that he was ‘taking good care’ of him. There are some 
indications that his feelings were not reciprocated, for example Gabriel Kovari sent a text to a friend 
saying that he had slept on the sofa and did not want to sleep in the same bed as the defendant; the 
friend warned him that the defendant would want to do so. 

The last message set by Gariel Kovari’s phone was at 5 o'clock on the morning of the 25th; he had not 
been there for two days. In the light of what happened later, I draw the inevitable inference that 

 

3
--------
shortly after that call was made, the defendant surreptitiously administered drugs to Gabriel Kovari, 
intending then to penetrate him when he was unconscious; the overdose that he administered 
proved fatal. 

The next afternoon, that is to say the 26 August, the defendant changed his telephone number, and 
then told a friend that Gabriel had unexpectedly left. He gradually developed this story, adding a 
number of unconvincing details; he then claimed to have heard that Gabriel had gone off back to 
Spain where he had formerly lived with a partner. 

Using a false name, the defendant did eventually correspond with this former partner, Thierry 
Amodio but to him he told a completely different story, to which I will turn later. 

Meanwhile, by chance, the defendant sister rang him to find him in a very distressed state saying 
that there was the body of a young man in his flat, plainly that young man was Gabriel Kovari, 
although in his evidence to the jury the defendant told the most elaborate lie attempting to suggest 
that although he was speaking in the present tense, the body to which he was referring was Anthony 
Walgate, who had died several months before. 

Gabriel Kovari’s body must have remained in the defendant’s flat for some days because it was not 
until the morning of 28 August that it was found sitting against the wall of the churchyard in the 
ruins of Barking Abbey. It is not immediately clear how he moved the body, because he denied doing 
any such thing, however he had again planted a bottle of GHB in his pocket and had disposed of his 
mobile phone. 

The cause of death was a drug overdose, with very high and potentially fatal levels of GHB. 

The murder of Gabriel Kovari is charged in count 7 of the indictment; administering a substance to 
him with intent is the subject of count 9. 

I make entirely clear that I have read the victim personal statement given by Gabriel’s brother, who 
movingly describes the impact that his death has had upon the family. 

Daniel Whitworth  

I come then to Daniel Whitworth aged 23, he was a skilled and ambitious chef, who was making his 
way in a fiercely competitive world.  Again I have read the poignant memorials to him by members 
of his family who consider that they are facing a life sentence; they observed that they ha a rich and 
fulfilling life ahead of them with Daniel which has been stolen from them.  

He and the defendant made contact through a gay dating website, called Fitlads. After very many 
exchanges they agreed to meet on the afternoon of the 18th September; Daniel left work early and 
texted his partner to say that he would be late back, but he clearly contemplated only a short visit to 
the defendant’s flat in Barking. 

As to what happened after he arrived, only the defendant now knows, but at half past 10 the next 
morning, 19th September, he deleted his Fitlads account, the obvious and inevitable inference is that 
he did so because Daniel Whitworth was already dead and he was attempting to delete traces of 
their contact. 

That night, he carried Daniel Whitworth’s body to the grounds of Barking Abbey, where he dumped 
the body in more or less precisely the same position that he had disposed of Gabriel Kovari. As he 
had done with the others, he had planted a bottle of GHB in his pocket and stole his mobile phone, 
so as to conceal the contacts that they had had the one with the other. 

 

4
--------
The cause of his death was GHB toxicity. 

However, this time the defendant went further because he wrote what purported to be a suicide 
note written by Daniel Whitworth, explaining that he had deliberately taken a drugs overdose, 
consequent upon the remorse and guilt he felt at having himself administered the fatal overdose to 
Gabriel Kovari. 

It was that this story which he drip fed to Thierry Amodio, Gabriel Kovari’s partner in Spain, adding 
ever more elaborate inventions; the eventual story, which he told to the jury, was that Daniel 
Whitworth and Gabriel Kovari had met at a party, in Ilford, which the defendant had himself 
attended;  that with his knowledge and consent, Gabriel and Daniel had gone back to the 
defendant’s flat, that from there they had gone to the churchyard of Barking Abbey to have sex, that 
there Daniel Whitworth had administered a drug overdose to Gabriel Kovari, from which he had 
died, caused him such guilt that he later decided to take his own life. 

When the police eventually pointed out to him that the handwriting expert demonstrated beyond 
doubt that he (the defendant) had written the suicide note, he continued to maintain that he had 
not. He then changed his story and claimed that he had written the suicide note at Daniel 
Whitworth’s dictation. 

These were wicked and monstrous lies, which must have caused immense distress Daniel’s family. Of 
course, under cross‐examination this story unravelled and the truth emerged, that he had killed 
them both. 

The murder of Daniel Whitworth is the subject of count 10, count 12 charges him with administering 
a substance with intent. 

C 

Counts 13 and 14 alleged rape as against the witness C, with whom the defendant had a long 
standing relationship, which included many instances of consensual sex, some of which possibly – 
and perhaps even probably ‐ occurred when C was unconscious.  

It is therefore not in the least surprising that the jury might have been left wondering if they could 
be sure that C did not consent to what happened. 

I would however pay tribute to C’s courage in giving evidence; I do not doubt that some of the 
evidence he gave and certainly the CCTV footage of his engagement with the defendant may have 
informed their decisions on other counts. 

Victim D 

Victim D is aged 22, but he looked far less than his chronological age. He had some time been 
undergoing gender reassignment, but that transition process has recently been interrupted. He was 
suffering from the long term after‐effects of a head injury caused in a criminal assault. He was, in my 
judgment, acutely vulnerable.  

He described an occasion in January 2015, when he visited the defendant’s flat and his drink had 
been spiked, which had rendered him unconscious. Yet the defendant had penetrated him in his 
condition, to which the witness had not consented. The defendant filmed the incident and even 
showed it to D the next day; D was outraged at what had happened and protested in earthly 
language.  

This was charged as administering a substance with intent in charge 15 and rape in count 16. 

 

5
--------
Victim E 

I move onto E; aged 35, E was rather older than the others. He met the defendant on Grindr in July 
2015. 

As was clear in the exchanges that have passed between the defendant and C, the defendant had by 
now experimented with administering the drug anally, which he said led to a more immediate 
absorption of the drugs into the body.  

He pretended to E that he was applying lubricant inside his anus by a syringe type device, with a 
plunger or piston, which he called an applicator. E had consented to normal anal intercourse, but he 
had strong objections to the administration of drugs. Immediately after the defendant had inserted 
the applicator, E said that he flinched, having had an unpleasant sensation of burning or tingling, 
which caused a slight numbing. He knew that this was not right and immediately suspected that an 
attempt had been made to administer drugs to him. He managed to dress and left before any 
further offence could be committed. 

This gives rise to the allegation in count 17 of assault by penetration, contrary to section 2 (1) of the 
2003 Act. 

Victim F 

Victim F gave a very similar account. He met the defendant after exchanges on Grindr in August 
2015; he had made very clear in their exchanges that he did not himself take drugs. The defendant 
also applied the applicator to his anus on the pretence that he was supplying lubrication, but he 
immediately felt a pain ‘like a bite’, he said. His mind then went completely blank; he was shocked 
and felt dizzy and whilst in this state the defendant penetrated him. He said that his brain was not 
functioning properly; he eventually fell unconscious. He repeatedly said that he had not consented 
to the administration of the drugs and neither had he consented to being penetrated whilst 
unconscious. 

This gives rise to the allegations of assault by penetration as charged in count 18, administering a 
substance with intent as charged in count 19 and rape as charged in count 20. 

Victim G 

Victim G knew the defendant before. Contact was re‐established in September 2015 after they 
encountered each other on Grindr. G was insistent that he did not do drugs and indeed had spelt 
that out in their exchanges, which were exhibited. 

Again under the pretence of applying lubrication, the defendant inserted the applicator into G’s anus 
and administered drugs, thereby causing him an intense pain after which he became dizzy, as if he 
was drunk, but fortunately he did not fall unconscious and was able to leave. 

This gives rise to allegations was assault by penetration in count 21 and administering a substance 
with intent in count 22; because the defendant did not proceed to the full offence, there is no 
charge of rape. 

I have read G’s victim statement, in which he says that he feels somewhat responsible for the deaths 
of these young men and that he could and should have done something to stop it; there is nothing 
mire that he could have done; I pay tribute to his courage in coming forward to speak up now, as he 
did. 

Jack Taylor 

 

6
--------
I come then to Jack Taylor, aged just 25 lived with his parents in Dagenham working as a forklift 
truck driver. 

There is evidence that he had accessed gay dating websites before, but he was not ‘out’; there were 
strong indications that he did not voluntarily take drugs. 

After an evening of modest social drinking at a local club, he went home and accessed Grindr. He 
contacted the defendant and they agreed to meet at Barking railway station, which they did at about 
a quarter past three on the morning of 13 September. He then went back with the defendant to his 
flat. 

Again as to what happened there the defendant is now the only living witness. 

Just before 7:30 that morning the defendant blocked Jack Taylor’s account on Grindr, thereby 
deleting the string of messages that had passed between them. The inevitable inference was that by 
that time Jack Taylor was already dead. 

Later that morning the defendant deleted his own Grindr account. 

The defendant sent a series of messages discouraging his flatmate from returning to the flat that 
morning, plainly he did not want him to return to find Jack Taylor’s dead body, which must have 
remained in the flat all that day (the 13th); later that night he took the body to the churchyard; he 
positioned the body so as to appear as if he was sitting down, just over the wall from where he had 
left the bodies of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth. 

He had planted a bottle of GHB in his pocket, he also planted a tourniquet and some medical wipes 
so as to give some credence to the story which he eventually told. As he had done with the others, 
he removed and disposed of his phone. 

The toxicologist found GHB at fatal levels; because Jack Taylor had been drinking at the club, and 
because drink and GHB can have a cumulative effect, the pathologist certified the cause of death as 
being a mixed drug and alcohol overdose. 

It is not to me to say whether the seeming bizarre co‐incidence of these three gay young men being 
found dead so close together might have given rise to suspicions that these deaths were not the 
result of ordinary self‐administered drug overdoses but that is how their deaths, including Jack 
Taylor’s death, was treated at the time; the competence and adequacy of the investigation will later 
be examined by others, as I have said. 

Accordingly, his body was released and was in due course he was buried. His family then had the 
distress – the devastation they called it ‐ of exhumation and a further post mortem to review the 
cause of death. 

When the defendant was first asked about Jack Taylor he said he did not recognise his name. He did 
not recognise his photographs. He had not been in contact with him on Grindr. Jack Taylor had never 
been to his flat; he had never had sexual intercourse with him. He had no involvement in his death. 
Indeed he even said that Jack Taylor was not the sort of person he would go for, since he said he 
tended to go for younger boys, whereas Jack Taylor looked older. 

When he gave evidence at the trial; he had changed his story. He said that Jack Taylor and indeed to 
his flat, that they had then moved into the churchyard to have sex. Jack Taylor administered drugs to 
himself, when he the defendant left him, he was alive and well and must therefore have died of his 
overdose afterwards.  

 

7
--------
Inevitably, as it seems to me, the jury dismissed this as a further pack of lies. 

I have read the joint tribute that Jack Taylor’s whole family have written in which they say he was an 
inspiration to them all: the life and soul of the family.   

His murder is charged as count 23; administering a substance is charged in count 25.  

Victim H 

I come then to victim H, who was then aged 24. He had had a sexual relationship with the defendant 
some years before. In October 2015, he was in crisis: another relationship had broken down; he was 
homeless; he had, he said, lost everything. He had taken to drink to blot out his many problems and 
turned to Stephen Port, the only friend he had in the world, for help. Mr Rees QC for the prosecution 
accurately described him as being acutely vulnerable. 

That month (October 2015), he went to stay with the defendant for two weekends. The described 
how during the first weekend, the defendant badgered him to take a line of drugs which he did; 
since this was with his consent, the taking of this drug does not form a count in the indictment. 
Following which the defendant did penetrate him, as he had done before. The witness said that he 
was too weak to argue with him. The jury, quite understandably as it seems to me, felt unable to be 
sure that this amounted to the offence of rape and acquitted on that charge as alleged in count 26. 

I come then to the second weekend, after voluntarily having snorted a line of drugs, the defendant 
using the applicator under the pretence that he was administering lubrication, injected into his anus; 
this was without his knowledge or consent and forms the subject of assault by penetration as 
charged in count 27 and administering a substance with intent as charged in count 28. The drugs 
caused him to feel drowsy, he had palpitations and lost consciousness during which time the 
defendant penetrated him, which was without his consent; this gave rise to the charge of rape in 
count 29. 

The murders  

Having set out the facts. I seek to draw together the conclusions. I accept the submissions made by 
the prosecution that the following features are present in the cases of murder.  

(i) 

(ii) 

First, there is the obvious fact that he murdered four young men and 
committed other serious offences upon them and upon others; 
 
The murders were committed as part of a persistent course of conduct of the 
defendant surreptitiously drugging these young men so that he could penetrate 
them while they were unconscious; 
  

(iii)  A significant degree of planning went into obtaining the drugs in advance and 

in luring the victims to his flat; 
 

(iv)  Having killed them by administering an overdose, he dragged them out into 
the street in one case, or took them to the churchyard in the other cases, and 
abandoned their bodies in a manner which robbed them of their dignity,  and 
thereby greatly increased the distress of their loving families; 
 

 

8
--------
the defendant removed and disposed of their mobile telephones and planted 
drugs, drug paraphernalia and even the purported suicide note, in an attempt to 
divert suspicion.  

the murders of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth were committed while 
the defendant was on bail for the offence of perverting the course of justice 
into the investigation of the death of Anthony Walgate. 

(v) 

 
(vi) 

 

As to mitigation, I accept that his intention was only to cause really serious harm rather than to 
cause death, but he must have known and foreseen that there was a high risk of death, the more so 
after the death of Anthony Wallgate, the first victim and the loss and bereavement felt by the 
victims is none the less because he intended only to cause them some really serious harm.  
  
I also accept that he has no previous convictions for violence, but that counts for little when set 
against the length and scale of his offending. 

The defendant has been convicted of the murders of four young men. Each murder was committed 
in the course of satisfying his lust for penetrating young man whom he had rendered unconscious by 
the surreptitious administration of drugs. Having regard to paragraph 4 of schedule 21 of the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003, I have no doubt that the seriousness of the offending is so exceptionally 
high that the whole life order is justified; indeed it is required. 

The sentence therefore upon the counts of murder is a sentence of life imprisonment; I decline to 
set a minimum term; the result is a whole life sentence and the defendant will die in prison. 

The rapes and other sexual offences 

I substantially accept the submission by the prosecution that the rapes and other serious sexual 
offences exhibit the following aggravating features: 

(i) 

(ii) 

 
(iii) 

 
(iv) 

(v) 
 
(vi) 

First, they extended over a period of fully 3½ years; the defendant committed 
four rapes on four different victims, and other very serious sexual offences 
upon other victims, including the four young men who died.  
 
the rapes were committed as part of a persistent course of conduct involving 
the defendant surreptitiously drugging young men so that he could penetrate 
them while they were unconscious; 

the surreptitious use of drugs, whether by way of spiking their drinks or by 
anal insertion, intended to render the victims unconscious was inherently 
dangerous, as the defendant was aware; 

there was a significant degree of planning; 
 
the rape of D was recorded; 

the rape of H, who was vulnerable and who turned to him for help, involved 
an abuse of trust; 
 

I am unable to identify any mitigating features beyond the fact that the defendant has no previous 
convictions, which accounts for little when set against the scale of his offending, as I have already 
said. 

 

9
--------
Self‐evidently, the defendant is highly dangerous; the offences of rape and assault by penetration 
are punishable with discretionary life imprisonment under section 225 of the Criminal Justice Act 
2003. I pass such a sentence on these counts, which in my judgement it is the only appropriate 
sentence to mark the gravity and depravity of these offences. 

The relevant sentencing Guideline indicates sentences of 20 years and more may be appropriate for 
campaigns of rape, such as this was. It is, in my opinion, appropriate to sentence each offence within 
the overall criminality, which requires condign punishment. The appropriate determinate sentence 
on each count of rape and assault by penetration would be 22 years; resulting in a life sentence on 
those counts with a minimum term on these counts of 11 years, less the time that he has spent in 
custody for those offences, which can be worked out administratively, and altered if it later appears 
that some mistake has been made.. 

The maximum sentence for administering a substance with intent is 10 years; this is one of those 
rare cases where the maximum sentence is justified, therefore on those counts I pass a sentence of 
10 years imprisonment. 

I direct that a transcript of these remarked is sent to the Life Imprisonment Unit at the Home Office. 

I am required to say that the statutory surcharge applies.

10",2016-11-25 00:00:00,UK Crown Court
3006465,State of New South Wales v Fernando [2016] NSWSC 1665,"Judgment

Introduction


	
	By summons filed on 7 September 2016, the State of New South Wales (the plaintiff) sought an extended supervision order (ESO) under the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (the Act) in respect of Kevin Fernando (the defendant) for a period of five years, on the conditions set out in the schedule annexed to the summons. Except where otherwise stated all references to legislative provisions in these reasons are to the Act. The plaintiff also sought an interim supervision order (ISO) against the defendant pursuant to s 10A pending the final hearing of this matter and an order pursuant to s 7(4) appointing either two psychiatrists or a psychiatrist and a psychologist to examine the defendant and report to the Court on the examinations.
	
	
	On 4 October 2016 Beech-Jones J granted leave to the plaintiff to file an amended summons to reflect changes in the conditions set out in the schedule annexed to the summons. On that day his Honour made orders under s 7(4) and ordered an ISO to commence on 19 October 2016, being the day on which the defendant’s sentence expired: State of New South Wales v Fernando [2016] NSWSC 1427. An. A further amended summons was filed at the commencement of the hearing on 23 November 2016, which reflected further changes in the conditions.
	
	
	The ISO has since been renewed. The renewed ISO is due to expire on 13 December 2016.
	
	
	Mr O’Neil, who appeared on behalf of the defendant, accepted that it was open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if not kept under supervision. However, Mr O’Neil contended that, if an ESO was made, it ought not be for the maximum period of five years. He submitted that an ESO of four years’ duration would be sufficient. Mr O’Neil also took issue with some of the conditions, which will be referred to in more detail below.
	


Evidence


	
	The plaintiff relied on the following evidence:
	



	
	Affidavits of Azam Bulbulia affirmed 7 September 2016 (including Exhibit AYB-1) and 16 September 2016;
	
	
	Affidavits of Paul Nash affirmed 29 September 2016, 3 November 2016 and 23 November 2016 (which annexes a victim statement pursuant to s 21A(4));
	
	
	Affidavit of Dr Richard Parker sworn 3 November 2016;
	
	
	Affidavit of Amanda Carden affirmed on 9 November 2016; and
	
	
	The following reports of the experts appointed by the order under s 7(4) referred to above: a report of Dr Jeremy O’Dea dated 3 November 2016 and a report of Mr Patrick Sheehan dated 29 October 2016.
	



	
	Mr O’Neil did not object to any of the plaintiff’s evidence, much of which comprised material that had been produced pursuant to orders under s 25 of the Act (referred to below) and was therefore admissible under s 25(3). He required Ms Carden and Mr Sheehan to attend for cross-examination. Their evidence will be addressed below.
	
	
	The defendant adduced no evidence. It is not appropriate for me to draw any inference against the defendant by reason of his not giving evidence as the Act does not displace the privilege against exposure to a penalty, save for the obligation upon an offender to be examined by the two independent experts: State of New South Wales v Donovan [2015] NSWCA 280 at [115]-[119] per Beazley P and Macfarlan and Leeming JJA.
	


The applicable law

The Act


	
	Section 3 of the Act provides:
	


“Objects of Act

(1)  The primary object of this Act is to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.

(2)  Another object of this Act is to encourage high-risk sex offenders and high-risk violent offenders to undertake rehabilitation.”


	
	The legislative purpose of the Act is protective, not punitive. The protective purpose is fundamental, as is evident from the wording of s 3(1).
	
	
	Section 4 of the Act relevantly contains the following definitions:
	


serious sex offence—see section 5(1).

sex offender means a person over the age of 18 years who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction of a serious sex offence.


	
	The definition of “serious sex offence” in s 5(1) includes: an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), where the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more: s 5(1)(a)(i). An offence against s 61J of the Crimes Act (which is contained in Division 10 of Part 3) is punishable by imprisonment for 20 years and is, accordingly, a “serious sex offence” within the meaning of s 5(1).
	
	
	Section 5B provides:
	


“High risk sex offender

(1)  An offender can be made the subject of a high risk sex offender extended supervision order or a high risk sex offender continuing detention order as provided for by this Act if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender.

(2)  An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

(3)  The Supreme Court is not required to determine that the risk of a person committing a serious sex offence is more likely than not in order to determine that the person poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence.”


	
	Section 5C confers power on this Court to make an ESO in respect of a high risk sex offender. Implicit in s 5C is that the supervision provided by an ESO is sufficient to counter what would otherwise be an “unacceptable risk”. Supervision can only be regarded as “adequate” if it is effective to reduce the risk such that the offender no longer poses an unacceptable risk.
	
	
	Section 5I(1) provides that an application for a high risk sex offender ESO may be made only in respect of a supervised sex offender. A person who is under supervision while serving a sentence of imprisonment (whether in custody or on release on parole) for a serious sex offence is, relevantly, a supervised sex offender: s 5I(2).
	
	
	Section 7 deals with pre-trial procedures and what is to occur following the preliminary hearing. It relevantly provides:
	


“(4) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must make orders:

(a) appointing:

(i) 2 qualified psychiatrists, or

(ii) 2 registered psychologists, or

(iii) 1 qualified psychiatrist and 1 registered psychologist, or

(iv) 2 qualified psychiatrists and 2 registered psychologists,

to conduct separate psychiatric or psychological examinations (as the case requires) of the offender and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations, and

(b) directing the offender to attend those examinations.

(5) If, following the preliminary hearing, it is not satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must dismiss the application.”


	
	Section 9(3) provides that the following (as well as any other matter I consider to be relevant) are to be taken into account in determining whether to make an ESO:
	


“(a) the safety of the community,

(b) the reports received from the persons appointed under section 7 (4) to conduct examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination,

(c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment,

(d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence,

(d1) any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community,

(e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs,

(f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order,

(g) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004,

(h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history,

(h1) the views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender,

(i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) or serious violence offences (in the case of an application for a high risk violent offender extended supervision order).”


	
	Section 10 provides that an ESO can be made for a total of five years. Section 11 provides for the conditions that may be imposed on an ESO. Section 12 provides that a person who fails to comply with the requirements of an ESO or ISO is guilty of an offence. Section 13 provides that an ESO or ISO may be varied or revoked.
	
	
	These proceedings are civil proceedings and, to the extent to which the Act does not provide otherwise, are to be conducted in accordance with the law (including the rules of evidence) relating to civil proceedings: s 21.
	
	
	Section 21A provides for notice to be given to each registered victim of the offender (defendant). Each such victim may provide a statement, which “may be placed before the Supreme Court for consideration in respect of the application” for an ESO: s 21A(4).
	
	
	Section 25 provides that the Attorney-General, on behalf of the plaintiff, may, by written order, require the production of documents that relate to the behaviour, or physical or mental condition, of any offender. Any document produced in answer to an order is admissible in proceedings under this Act.
	


Background facts


	
	If the threshold test in s 5B is met, the matters to be considered are listed in s 9. Before addressing these matters, I propose to set out a narrative derived from the evidence adduced by the plaintiff.
	


Background

Offences committed as a minor


	
	The defendant was born in 1962. In 1974, when the defendant was twelve, he was convicted in the Children’s Court of the first of several property-related offences. The defendant was subject to supervision on remand in 1976, which was recommended by Anthony Cole, a psychologist, who reported on 16 March 1976 that the defendant was mildly mentally retarded and had difficulties learning, as a result of which the defendant felt victimised by his peers. Mr Cole commented on the lack of parental supervision and the “definite delinquent orientation” of the defendant. On 21 April 1976 a District Officer of the Department of Youth, Ethnic and Community Affairs at Narrabri (H. Fenton) commented that the defendant’s behaviour had improved under supervision.
	
	
	On 11 July 1978 the defendant was assessed by Bruce Bowmaker, a psychologist, who reported as follows:
	


“Kevin is a part-aboriginal lad of below average intelligence. From his reports it seems that he comes from a socially deprived environment where the parents have little idea of supervision and guidance. He is a frank and confident lad but of poor social skills. He expresses little remorse for his anti-social activities and is unconcerned about his committal. He is an immature lad who usually offends with his cousins who are some years younger than himself.

He should not be disruptive in the training school and could benefit from remedial education as he is retarded in this area. He could also benefit from a programme aimed at instituting controls in order to resist peer pressure”


	
	Between 1980 and 1990, the defendant was subject to a number of short sentences, monetary fines and good behaviour bonds for various offences, including: malicious injury (11 April 1980; 4 May 1981); stealing (11 April 1980); receiving (2 December 1980); break enter and steal (5 December 1980; 27 March 1990); break and enter with intent to steal (5 December 1980); goods in custody (4 December 1984); steal from person (22 June 1987); larceny (27 March 1990; 24 September 1990); assault occasioning actual bodily harm (24 September 1990); assault (24 September 1990); steal motor vehicle (27 September 1989); robbery in company x 2 (31 August 1989) and assault with intent to rob (31 August 1989). On 31 August 1989, the defendant was sentenced to three years and ten months in custody for the charges of robbery in company (two counts) and assault with intent to rob. He was released to parole on 28 June 1991 after having served the non-parole component (16 months) of his sentence.
	
	
	The defendant breached his parole in November 1991 through failure to maintain contact with Community Corrections. His parole was revoked and he was returned to custody to serve the remainder of his sentence. He was released in March 1992.
	


Offending conduct

First sexual offence: January 1993


	
	On 17 January 1993 the defendant committed aggravated sexual assault and armed robbery, for which he was later indicted and to which he pleaded guilty. The sentencing judge, O’Reilly DCJ, recorded the circumstances of the offences in the remarks on sentence which are summarised as follows.
	
	
	The victim, a 30-year-old mother of two, was at home on Sunday night when she was threatened by the defendant with a knife, which he shoved into her ribs. The defendant told her of his intention to rob her. She responded that he could take what he wanted but begged that he not hurt her as she had two babies. She was in a state of “abject terror”. He inquired whether she would promise not to report him. She agreed on condition that he not harm her or her children. He reminded her that he knew where she lived and threatened to return and would “do your kids first”. The defendant used the knife to cut the swimsuit which the victim was wearing and remove it from her body. He continued to threaten her with a knife while engaging in oral sex with her. He then had penile intercourse with her. He told her to pray that her children “stay asleep”. He demanded to know where her money was and left with $150 of the victim’s money. As soon as the defendant left, the victim called her mother. Her parents came immediately and found the victim to be very distressed. While they were there the offender rang the victim’s phone number. The phone was answered by the victim’s mother who heard the defendant say: “I am the one who did it to you”. When the victim heard what the defendant had said she became hysterical with fear that she or her children would suffer retribution at his hands.
	


The evidence at the sentence hearing


	
	Before the defendant was sentenced by O’Reilly DCJ (which occurred on 10 June 1994) he was examined by Dr Yvonne Skinner on 24 March 1994 at the Remand Centre, Long Bay Gaol. He gave a history of drug and alcohol abuse from a young age (at least from 12 years of age). Dr Skinner concluded:
	


“He has a major problem of alcohol and drug (benzodiazepine and anti-depressant medication) dependence/abuse. He is suffering from physical signs of alcohol abuse, particularly central nervous system damage. He claims to have suffered “black outs (that is complete amnesia for events which occurred during periods of heavy drinking).

He comes from a background of severe emotional and material deprivation and a model of parent alcoholism and domestic violence, and this has affected his self-perception and also his perceptions as to expected and acceptable behaviour.

…

His control of aggression is directly linked to his alcohol abuse, as he loses control of his aggressive impulses when affected by alcohol. Thus if he could successfully complete a rehabilitation program and abstain from alcohol and drugs, he would be unlikely to re-offend.

His prognosis must be considered guarded in view of the long standing nature of the problem.”

The sentencing remarks


	
	The sentencing judge described the facts as “quite appalling”. His Honour noted that the defendant was in a de facto relationship and referred to a statement from the defendant’s half-brother, to whom he had donated a kidney. The sentencing judge said that, but for the plea of guilty, he would have imposed a sentence of 12-14 years but has discounted that “substantially”. His Honour found special circumstances. The sentence imposed is set out in the following table.
	



	
		
			
			Date of offence
			
			
			Offence
			
			
			Sentence
			
			
			Commencement/ expiry

	As a result of his time on remand and the sentence, the defendant was in custody from 27 January 1993 until 26 January 1999.
	


Release to parole on 26 January 1999


	
	The defendant was released to parole on 26 January 1999. One of the conditions of his parole was that he reside with a teacher, T, working within the correctional system whom he met while in custody and with whom he had an intimate relationship. T had two children, a daughter and a son, who also lived at the residence with the defendant. In May 1999 the defendant moved out of the home but returned to reside there between July and September 1999.
	


Offences committed in October 1999 (which include the index offences)

Offences on 12 October 1999


	
	On 12 October 1999 the defendant returned to T’s home to steal various items for the purpose of pawning them to obtain funds for drugs. No one was home when he stole the property, a CD player and stereo system which belonged to T’s daughter. That afternoon, the defendant came back to T’s house, went into T’s bedroom and stripped to his boxer shorts. When T’s daughter came home from school, she asked the defendant about her stereo, which she noticed was missing. He then dragged her into her mother’s room and began to masturbate his erect penis and told her to sit on the bed. She was terrified. He asked her for her assessment of the size of his penis. She was too frightened to reply. He abused her and pinned her down on the bed. In an attempt to distract the defendant, T’s daughter kept asking him about the stereo. Later he picked up a kitchen knife and threatened to kill himself if she told anyone what had occurred. She asked for the stereo system to be returned, to which he agreed on condition that she would have sex with him. When she refused, he began to yell abuse at her. He grabbed her and pushed her to the floor. He sat on her stomach and held a knife to her throat. A knock was heard at the door. The defendant left the room. When he returned he told T’s daughter that he had to tie her up to make it look as if the house had been robbed. He bound and gagged T’s daughter and exposed his penis to her. He knelt over her and pulled her underpants down, which had the effect of making his penis erect. She continued to struggle, at which point the defendant said, “What have I done?” He cut her loose and apologised for his conduct. He pushed her to the floor and threatened her again with the knife. He told her that if she told anyone what had happened he would kill her family and deny it in court.
	
	
	The defendant allowed her to go to the bathroom and when she returned, he embraced her and told her that he loved her, T and her brother. He apologised again and told her that he did not mean to hurt her. He rubbed cream onto her wrists and then blamed the drugs he was on for his conduct. He again pulled his jeans down and started to masturbate. He instructed T’s daughter to lie on the bed and asked her if she was a virgin and whether his penis would fit into her vagina. At this point, someone knocked on the door. When T’s daughter answered the door, she saw that it was one of her school friends. They both ran away to the friend’s place. T’s daughter was crying and shaking. By the time the police and ambulance arrived, the defendant had located the spare key to T’s car and departed with it. He drove T’s car to a nearby home, ransacked the premises and stole various belongings and money. He abandoned T’s car there. That night, he telephoned T and apologised for what he had done.
	


Offences on 16 and 18 October 1999


	
	On Saturday 16 October 1999 the defendant stole a Holden Commodore. On 17 October 1999 he filled up the Holden Commodore with petrol, for which he did not pay and took various items from the service station store without paying for them. The value of the petrol and various items was $84.40.
	
	
	On Monday 18 October 1999, the defendant was driving the Holden Commodore at 8.45am when he saw V3, who was fifteen years old and wearing a school uniform. He stopped the car and forced her into it. He covered her with a blanket and threatened her with a screwdriver which he forced into her neck. He said, “If you don’t do as I say I’ll kill you.” What then ensued was described by Williams DCJ (the sentencing judge) in the following terms in the remarks on sentence:
	


“The prisoner drove to bushland in the P6 and stopped the car. He told V3 to get up and lent across and reclined the passenger seat. He told her not to scream. He then unbuttoned her school blouse and removed her bra and underpants. Rolled her school skirt up and then pulled down his jeans and underpants exposing his erect penis.

He then got on top of V3, pulled her legs apart and then pushed his penis against V3’s vagina ignoring her pleas for him to stop as it hurt. He said “It’s only halfway up” and then pushed his penis forcefully into the child’s vagina causing considerable pain and bleeding. He had intercourse with V3 for a few minutes, she being too frightened to speak but crying throughout.

After ejaculating the prisoner removed his penis and told her to dress. She saw that she was bleeding and noticed there was blood on the car seat and on her clothes. He drove off with her in the car and as he drove he told V3 not to tell anyone. He said “I should kill you now.” When V3 promised [not, sic] to tell anyone he said “Alright I won’t kill you.” He said he would drop V3 near her home.

The prisoner stopped the car at a location within a short walk of V3’s home. He demanded her money and she gave him the four dollars she had in her school bag. The prisoner then directed V3 to get out of the car and he drove off.

He then drove the vehicle to a park in P7 where he stopped the car and set it alight. It was partially destroyed in the fire.

V3 dishevelled, pale and shaking, went home and showered and changed. Shortly afterwards she approached a neighbour and asked if she could use a telephone as she had just been raped. The neighbour suggested telephoning police, but the victim asked her not to as her assailant said he would kill her. She telephoned her mother and police were subsequently called.”


	
	On 19 October 1999 the defendant’s parole was revoked as his offending conduct constituted a breach of the conditions of his parole.
	


Offences on 20 October 1999


	
	On 20 October 1999 the defendant went to a residence and forced the driver’s side door lock of a Saab motor vehicle owned by V4 and stole a M5 motorway card. He went inside and stole money, a driver’s licence, two keycards and a set of house keys. He left through a sliding door. V5 was in the shower at the time and came out to discover the defendant standing at the side of the house. V5 noticed that two vehicles had been broken into, the Saab and a Suburu. Items had also been taken from that car by the defendant. A Sierra 4-wheel drive was also broken into and various items taken.
	
	
	Police were called. The defendant was located a short time later and arrested and charged.
	


The defendant’s plea of guilty and the sentence imposed


	
	As a result of the events of 12, 16, 18 and 20 October 1999, the defendant was arrested and charged with several offences, to which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced by Williams DCJ on 25 October 2000. The material before the sentencing judge included a victim impact statement made by V3’s mother on behalf of her daughter, which said:
	


“Details of personal harm suffered as a direct result of the offence(s):

I make this statement on behalf of V3 who is my daughter. She is unable to make the statement due to her present emotional and mental state. She cannot speak of the incident at all, let alone make a written statement of the impact on her.

The attack against V3 had had an enormous effect on her in very many different ways. As far as I know she has been unable to speak with anyone at all about the incident since giving her statement to the police. She has refused all counselling and becomes extremely distressed if the subject is brought up. When I have had to tell her about court dates she will listen and then just walk away, she will not talk about it at all.

We had to move house, as V3 did not feel safe. She told me that he might know where she lived and that she had fears that he would come and kill her because she had told police about the attack.

V3 will not leave the house by herself at all. Someone has to take her to school and pick her up. Wherever she goes someone in the family must be with her. The family have willingly done this. Apart from going to school, V3 leaves the house far less than previously. She no longer goes to friend’s houses to visit, and will not go to school functions like dances and other social occasions.

V3 will not leave the house wearing a skirt tor dress as she did previously. She will only wear long trousers when outside of the house. Apart from her father and grandfather, I have noticed that she avoids all conversation and interaction with males. She gets extremely nervous if approached without warning, even inside the house, and jumps nervously at the slightest touch.”


	
	In the remarks on sentence, Williams DCJ said of the danger the defendant poses to the community:
	


“Whilst it is true that to some extent one can mitigate the requirements of general and specific deterrence where a person does not have the appropriate mental capacity to deal with life and the circumstances that give rise to offending, that mitigation in the light of repeat offending must give way to a recognition that ultimately a person is responsible for his own acts, that when someone has so behaved in a certain way in the past and been significantly punished for it and that person re-offends in a similar way at a later point of time, that person’s inability to make appropriate decisions and act appropriately must be considered to be less relevant. My concern in this matter is that there is really nothing substantial before me to suggest that upon release Mr Fernando will not be likely to re-offend. In my view there is a high risk of re-offending.”


	
	His Honour also addressed the gravity of the offences against V3 and the extent to which, if at all, the plea of guilty ought result in a discount in the sentence imposed. His Honour said:
	


“In my view the offences against V3 fall into that category [where the sentence ought not be discounted]. This was an offence that is objectively in the worst category of such offending. The effects on the victim will be permanent and only time will tell how dramatically this event will impinge on her ability to lead a normal life. It is an offence that deserves the greatest community condemnation and for which a sentence should be imposed to reflect the community’s outrage at the offending behaviour and which is likely to protect the community from such behaviour from the prisoner for some considerable period in the future.”

	The effective total sentence was 17 years, commencing on 20 October 1999 and expiring on 19 October 2016. The first day on which the defendant became eligible for release to parole was 19 October 2013, although he was not in fact released to parole until May 2016.
	


Period in custody from 1999 to 2016


	
	During his substantial period in custody, the defendant was, as was later noted by Dr Parker, generally regarded as a “well-behaved prisoner”.
	


Assessment by Helen Haywood in August 2000


	
	In August 2000 the defendant was assessed, on the request of the Parole Board, by Helen Haywood, a registered psychologist at the Junee Correctional Centre where the defendant was imprisoned. At that stage his parole for the 1993 offence had been revoked and he had not yet been sentenced for the 1999 offences (which occurred on 25 October 2000). At the assessment he admitted the sexual offence on 12 October 1999 but denied the one committed on 18 October 1999 (to which he subsequently pleaded guilty). Ms Haywood noted:
	


“The nature of the second offence appears to involve an escalation of his deviant behaviour and contains a high level of sexual deviance and criminality.”


	
	Ms Haywood also noted the following:
	


“He attempted to explain his sexual offending as being “racially based” and as a form of revenge against “white people” since he was sexually assaulted himself when an adolescent.”

CUBIT program and report dated 23 December 2010


	
	Between 25 June and 12 November 2009, the defendant took part in the “PREP” preparatory sex offender program at Long Bay gaol. Between 9 February and 3 December 2010 the defendant participated in the Custody-Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) program. The defendant’s attitude to his sex offending in 1999 was recorded in the report dated 23 December 2010 prepared by Miriam Wyzenbeek, a forensic psychologist, following his completion of the CUBIT program:
	


“29. In the lead up to his sexual offending, Mr Fernando experienced heightened feelings of sexual inadequacy. He blamed the victim’s mother for these inadequacies (e.g., “Is there something wrong with the way I make love? What have I got to do to satisfy this woman?”). He began telling himself that he should pursue sex with someone with nil/limited sexual experience and became fixated on the victim. During this time, he sexualised the behaviours of pubescent girls, particularly those in school uniforms. He would fantasise about the victim during sex with the mother and self-masturbation. In these fantasies, the victim was impressed with Mr Fernando’s penis size and sexually satisfied. Mr Fernando would interpret the victim’s behaviours as evidence that she was interested in experimenting sexually with him. On the day of the primary offence, Mr Fernando cited revenge against the victim’s mother as the trigger for his sexual offending (e.g., “I may as well give her [the mother] something to be really mad at”; I’ll teach the victim’s mother for treating me the way she does”). Mr Fernando stated that his subsequent offending was triggered by his failure to engage in sex during the primary offence.

30. Following failure of the primary offence, Mr Fernando feelings of sexual inadequacy were even more exaggerated. During this time, he coped by increasing his substance use and involvement in crime. He also continued to masturbate to fantasies about sex with the primary victim. In these fantasies however he imagined using force “To show her that I know how to have sex”. He would drive around during times that children were making their way to and from school. During the day, he would park in front of school playing fields and masturbate whilst watching school girls interact or play sport. Based on Mr Fernando’s account, the subsequent offence was opportunistic. He reported imaging the victim of the primary sexual offence during perpetration of this offence. He described being aggressive and threatening towards the victim “More so than I’ve even been, more so than I needed to be” and acknowledged being aroused to the anger. Mr Fernando emphasised the fast escalation of his anger and aggression towards the victim.”


	
	Ms Wyzenbeek recommended that, on release, he participate in a community-based maintenance program; and that he initially reside at a Community Offender Support Program (COSP) Centre. She also recommended the following restrictions:
	


“86. Mr Fernando’s residence should not be with a female child under the age of 16 years, he should not have unsupervised access to female children, and he should not be in positions of authority for children. Should he be in a position where he may be in the presence of a minor, it is recommended that this contact be monitored by a responsible adult who is aware of his potential risk and who is able to provide him with feedback about unhelpful behaviours if necessary.”


	
	Ms Wyzenbeek also recommended that the defendant be assessed for possible treatment with anti-libidinal medication “given his arousal to deviant sexual interests”.
	


Community Treatment Order


	
	In August 2014 the defendant stopped taking his medication for schizophrenia (with which he was diagnosed while in custody) and became psychotic as a result of which he was admitted to the Long Bay Hospital on 22 August 2014 for assessment. He displayed behaviour such as disorganised speech, aggression and was hearing voices.
	
	
	Justice Health applied to the Mental Health Tribunal (the Tribunal) for a Forensic Community Treatment Order (FCTO) to mandate his compliance with treatment and medication. A report of Dr Shweta Sharma, a Registrar in Forensic Psychiatry, dated 10 September 2014 was provided to the Tribunal. Dr Sharma was part of the team responsible for the defendant’s treatment at the Long Bay Hospital. Dr Sharma made the following diagnosis:
	


“DIAGNOSIS

Mr Fernando suffers from Chronic Schizophrenia, which is a mental illness, characterised by thought disorder, persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and bizarre behaviour. Despite first documentation of his psychotic symptoms in 1999, it appears that he has been suffering from psychotic illness long before, which went unnoticed due to his long spells in the custody.”


	
	Dr Sharma’s opinion and recommendations were as follows:
	


“OPINION AND RECOMMENDATION

Mr Fernando suffers from Paranoid Schizophrenia which has responded well to antipsychotic medications. He will need to continue his prescribed medication in the longer term. He will also benefit from ongoing support and Psychoeducation.

However, Mr Fernando has a well-documented history of poor medication compliance and secondary relapse requiring hospitalisation. His partial insight remains of a concern and is likely to affect his medication compliance.

Mr Fernando was referred to MSPC and was accepted for Forensic CTO. He will be under care of Dr Furst. The treating team respectfully recommends that Mr Fernando to be transferred back to Metropolitan Specials Program Centre (MSPC), Long Bay Goal under Forensic community treatment order for ongoing care and treatment”.


	
	On 18 September 2014 the Tribunal granted the FCTO and determined that the defendant was mentally unwell. Since that time further FCTOs were ordered. Upon his release, a CTO was ordered. The current community treatment order (CTO) is due to expire in March 2017. The effect of such orders is that the defendant can be compelled to take medication (including anti-psychotic medication to control the schizophrenia) and receive treatment.
	


Courses in addition to CUBIT completed in prison


	
	The defendant has undertaken several courses in prison. He began the CALM Male Australian Adaptation program on 31 January 2012 and attended 9 out of the 29 sessions. The course was discontinued before he could complete the remaining sessions. He completed Equips Addiction Program in 2015 to assist him with drug, alcohol and gambling addictive behaviour.
	


Pre-release conduct


	
	After the defendant’s hospitalisation in September 2014, there appeared to be a significant change in the defendant’s behaviour. As noted above, he had been eligible for release on parole since 2013 but had been adjudged to be unsuitable having regard to his failure to co-operate. In November 2014 the defendant discussed with officers the reasons for his parole being declined. He put his name down for courses and agreed to take anti-libidinal medication. He told officers that he was settled on his new medication (anti-psychotic) and that he wanted to work towards getting out of gaol. This heralded a marked change in the defendant’s attitude and led to his release to parole on 11 May 2016.
	


Employment in prison


	
	On 19 January 2015 the defendant commenced employment with Corrective Service Industries in Textiles. He transferred to the bakery on 2 February 2015. His supervisor described him as “a good worker who always tries his best when he is here working at the bakery”. It was also noted that the complied with the direction of the team leader and had a good working relationship with the officer and other inmates.
	


Risk assessment report dated 29 January 2016 by Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo


	
	On 29 January 2016 the defendant was interviewed by Dr Parker (a Senior Psychologist with the Serious Offenders Assessment Unit of Corrective Services) and Ms Matsuo (a Forensic Psychologist and State-wide Manager Programs), who conducted a risk assessment for the purposes of the Act (s 9(3)(c)) and who prepared a report dated 3 February 2016. They addressed the connection between the defendant’s general offending and his sex offending as follows:
	


“Summary of Sexual Offending

14. Mr Fernando’s sexual offences have all been committed against post-pubescent females. They all occurred in the context of substance abuse and more general criminality. He did not know two of his three victims before the offences, and probably only decided to sexually assault them shortly before committing the offences. It is possible the offence against his ex-partner’s daughter involved a similar lack of forethought, although he admitted obsessing about her in the period leading up to that offence.

Timeline of non-sexual offences

15. Mr Fernando has an extensive history of general offending, ranging in seriousness from theft to armed robbery. The long-standing nature, and frequency of this offending pattern, suggests that he held a generalised attitude, which gave him permission to take whatever he wanted. It is likely that his sexual offending fits within this same pattern.”


	
	The defendant’s score on the Static-99R (a risk assessment tool based on static factors) was 5 which placed him in the medium-high risk category with respect to other male sexual offenders. He was in the 88th percentile compared to other male sexual offenders. Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo explained that this means that, taking into account that about 7% of sex offenders shared the same score, about 85% of such offenders scored lower than the defendant and 8% scored higher. He scored in the highest risk category by reference to the Violent Risk Appraisal Guide-Revised. He also obtained a high score by reference to the Stable 2007 risk assessment tool (an actuarial took developed to assist clinicians to identify stable dynamic risk factors for sexual reoffending). This placed the defendant in the high risk category relative to other male sexual offenders.
	
	
	Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo assessed the general pattern of the defendant’s sex offending and considered that the sex offending was part of the overall pattern of rule-breaking behaviour and the “extreme end of a pattern of generalised offending”. They identified the following risk factors: drug and alcohol abuse; gambling; tendency to be violent towards women and have a sense of entitlement to their bodies; lack of pro-social influences; and non-compliance with mental health treatment and anti-libidinal medication.
	
	
	Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo considered the reasons for the escalation in the seriousness of the defendant’s offending over time but were unable to come to a concluded view. They postulated the following possibilities:
	



	
	His continuing anti-social behaviour has alienated his usual supports;
	
	
	His time in custody has hardened him and lessened his connection with social norms;
	
	
	His cognitive processes have reduced his capacity for self-reflection (the defendant’s good behaviour in gaol was noted as being inconsistent with (3)); and
	
	
	He has become desensitised to anti-social behaviour and thus he did not regard the index offences as particularly shocking.
	



	
	Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo postulated the following pattern were the defendant to re-offend:
	


“47. Were Mr Fernando to reoffend, this would be almost certainly be proceeded by him abusing alcohol and/or other drugs. At, or around the same time, he would cease taking his medication. If he is allowed to continue on this path, it would likely be followed fairly quickly by property offences, and then violent and/or sexual offences as the substance use escalated.

48. Prior to any of this, Mr Fernando would likely exhibit some psychological warning signs. These would include giving up hope of a good future, and/or hostility towards supervising authorities. This may be evident in the breaking of supervision conditions or simply complaining about the restrictions placed upon him”.

Report of Dr Scott Clark, forensic psychiatrist, dated 19 February 2016


	
	Dr Scott Clark, a forensic psychiatrist, prepared a report dated 19 February 2016 for the State Parole Authority, which was considering whether the defendant ought be released to parole. Dr Scott noted that the defendant had been diagnosed as suffering from: schizophrenia characterised by psychotic symptoms, including paranoia, disorganisation and auditory hallucinations; substance abuse/ dependence; and paedophilia. He also recorded that the defendant was taking Depo-Provera, an anti-libidinal medication.
	
	
	Dr Scott opined that the defendant would require close medical monitoring as well as access to psychological support and counselling. He considered that the defendant ought be required to refrain from illicit drugs and alcohol. Dr Scott also noted (with reference to the period in August 2014-September 2014 when the defendant failed to take anti-psychotic medication):
	


“Medical adherence is important considering his mental condition markedly deteriorated following a period of non-adherence.”

Risk management report of Teresa Sartor dated 1 March 2016


	
	Ms Sartor, a Senior Community Corrections Officer in the ESO Team, interviewed the defendant and had regard to the documentary material, much of which has been referred to above. She noted the following pattern which emerges from a consideration of the defendant’s conduct following release from custody:
	


“With regards to community supervision, CSNSW [Corrective Services NSW] records would indicate that his initial response is usually positive however this soon deteriorates leading to breach action for either disengaging with his parole supervision or committing further offences. His risk factors have been identified as breakdown in relationships, substance abuse and gambling.”


	
	Ms Sartor also performed a calculation of the length of time the defendant had spent in custody and expressed her concerns about his institutionalisation in the following terms:
	


“Mr Fernando was first incarcerated in August 1989 – twenty seven (27) years ago. Since that time he has only been at liberty for a period of approximately two years and 20 days. Due to his having spent a significant period of time in custody there may be issues around institutionalisation and he may experience some difficulties in adapting to normal community life post release.”


	
	Ms Sartor addressed the risks identified by Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo and set out the ways in which she considered each risk could be addressed and managed. Her recommendations are largely reflected in the conditions in the schedule to the further amended summons and include regular meeting, field visits, electronic monitoring, referral to psychological services and alcohol and drug testing. She annexed to her report a document which provides details of the administration of an ESO.
	


Community Management Program at Forensic Psychology Services


	
	On 20 April 2016 the defendant was accepted to start the Community Maintenance Program at Forensic Psychology Services (FPS), which initially required fortnightly attendances at FPS. While he was still in custody, he was accompanied by a custodial officer to the premises for his appointments. According to his “Reintegration Case Plan” dated 15 April 2016:
	


“The primary aim of the Maintenance Program is the successful reintegration of offenders into the community, the initial stages to desistance process.”

Release from custody in May 2016


	
	In May 2016 the defendant was released to parole and taken to the Nunyara COSP where he continues to reside.
	
	
	The defendant is subject to the conditions associated with being a registrable person under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (NSW) (CPOR Act). These conditions include declaration of “carriage services”, which include mobile phones.
	
	
	On 3 June 2016 detectives from Maroubra police station found an undeclared phone in his room at the COSP facility where he is living. It was also discovered that was using a social networking address which had not been registered with police and was therefore in breach of the conditions under the CPOR Act. He was eventually charged under s 17(1) of the CPOR Act. He pleaded guilty. The Magistrate imposed a bond for 12 months under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	Since the defendant’s release, the case management notes have recorded instances of his reporting that he has heard voices. On 29 June 2016 he reported that he heard an evil voice telling him to touch a woman on a bus. His medication was changed and on 5 July 2016 the defendant reported that he was no longer hearing voices.
	


Interim Supervision Orders


	
	As referred to above, on 19 October 2016 the defendant became subject to an ISO which was due to expire on 15 November 2016. The ISO was renewed and is due to expire on 13 December 2016.
	
	
	Since the commencement of the first ISO on 19 October 2016 the defendant’s Departmental Supervising Officer (DSO) has been Ms Carden, who was required for cross-examination. Ms Carden is a Community Corrections Officer within the ESO team and is based in Blacktown. She has been employed as a Community Corrections Officer since May 2014 and began working in the ESO team on 11 October 2016. Her training and qualifications include a Bachelor of Criminology and Criminal Justice with Honours from the University of New South Wales. Before commencing employment as a Community Corrections Officer she completed 12 weeks of training at the Brush Farm Corrective Services Academy. She also completed a Certificate IV in Correctional Practice.
	
	
	Ms Carden gave evidence about her view of particular conditions, which will be referred to below when I address the conditions that are contested by the defendant. She also gave evidence in cross-examination that the defendant had asked her to accompany him to the Salvation Army or the Smith Family to see if they could put together a package deal for him to furnish a flat, which would include a lounge suite, a fridge, a television and so on. Ms Carden indicated her preparedness to help the defendant with this. She also expressed her concern about the defendant’s gambling and said that, although there was a condition prohibiting it and also a condition that he be monitored electronically, it would be relatively easy for the defendant to visit a TAB outlet en route to another approved location.
	


Court-appointed experts


	
	On 4 October 2016 the Court ordered that the defendant be examined by Dr O’Dea and Mr Sheehan for the purposes of each preparing a report pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act.
	


Report of Dr O’Dea


	
	Dr O’Dea interviewed the defendant in his rooms on 17 October 2016 and prepared a report dated 3 November 2016. He considered the defendant to pose a high risk of future sex offending. His view as to the causes of the offending appears from the following extract from his report:
	


“79. Rather, Mr Fernando’s history of offending in general is likely to be best understood in the context of his history of social disadvantage, his history of extensive alcohol and other drug abuse from a young age, and the financial implications of his alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence, and his gambling, in the context of his limited employment history.

80. His history of sex offending in particular is likely to be best understood in the context of combinations of his general offending history, his Paraphilic Disorders, the disinhibiting effects of his alcohol and other drug abuse and dependence, and the impulsive acting on his sexual urges and fantasies, when the opportunity arose.”


	
	He considered there to be a significant risk that the defendant would engage in further sex offending in the community if he were to resume use of alcohol or illicit substances. He opined that the risk was long term and “potentially of at least 5 years’ duration”. He considered that the risk could be managed by an ESO and that the CTO could continue to address the defendant’s requirements for psychiatric treatment.
	


Report of Mr Sheehan


	
	Mr Sheehan is a psychologist with extensive experience in the administration of ESOs. He worked for Corrective Services as part of the ESO team from 2006 until 2014. In his report he assessed the defendant’s risk of sex offending to be high. He suggested an ESO of “four to five years duration would be realistic given the chronic nature of his risk related issues”. This assessment appears in context in the following passage:
	


“Despite his ongoing efforts at rehabilitation, abstinence from substances and treatment compliance, his adjustment remains very tenuous and his risk of reoffending sexually would be considered to be in the high range. The possibility that a sexual re-offence would be a serious sexual offence is realistic given the offence dynamic evident in Mr Fernando’s case. I would suggest that an ESO of four to five years duration would be realistic given the chronic nature of his risk related issues.”


	
	Mr Sheehan gave oral evidence as he was required for cross-examination by Mr O’Neil. Mr Sheehan emphasised the importance of a CTO by which the defendant could be forced to take medication and noted the importance of his taking medication in accordance with the prescription. Mr Sheehan also stressed the distinction between a person such as the defendant being appropriately managed by restrictions and controls such as those contained in a CTO, ISO or ESO and such a person who is living in the community without restrictions or oversight. He said:
	


“It looks like they are doing all right but as soon as the shackles are off things go pear‑shaped very quickly.”


	
	Much of the cross-examination of Mr Sheehan was directed to the length of any ESO and, in particular, whether it should be four years (as contended for by the defendant) or five years (as contended for by the plaintiff). Mr Sheehan opined that one would be in a better position to know how the risk was being managed by any ESO after four years and that giving the defendant a shorter ESO than the maximum might serve to engender trust. However, Mr Sheehan noted that applications for ESOs (particularly further ESOs) tended to be destabilising, although he commented that this defendant appeared to have “taken it in his stride”.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan also explained his view of the conditions which should be specified for an ESO in the following terms:
	


“In my view these schedules are best when they have no fat on them at all, when they are just what is the most important, because if you have things in there that are not directly relevant to risk they might be focused on by a supervising person and at the detriment of other aspects of the order that are directly relevant to offending, to risk of offending.”


	
	Mr Sheehan considered, in effect, that conditions which were not directly relevant to risk would be an affront to the person’s autonomy and that it would be counterproductive to include them as conditions. For this reason, Mr Sheehan generally opposed conditions relating to employment and training.
	
	
	Although Mr Sheehan stressed that gambling was not a principal issue, he described its significance as follows:
	


“It is one of the red flags to suggest that there's disarray, he is starting to have disarray in other aspects of his life and there may be mania.”


	
	Mr Sheehan explained in his oral evidence the relationship between the defendant’s general offending and his sexual offending as follows:
	


“At times when he has committed those offences there was, I think I have referred to it in the body of my report, general disarray in his life and it seems that everything has gone, goes badly for him at those points.

He, he feels bad; he is using drugs he is engaging in other criminality. There's an atmosphere of him feeling hopeless, that there's no future. That he is feeling bad about himself, having unstable mood with his psychotic symptoms being more prominent. Feeling internal distress, wanting to resolve that distress. Relying on sexual fantasy to offset some of that distress. The fantasy then goes towards scenarios where he can feel sexually dominant and oppressive. That facilitates the fantasy and gives him some relief during the fantasy and those feelings of dominance and mastery. And that in turn facilitates the introduction of schoolgirl fantasies because they are a target he can imagine would be more easily impressed and can offset his, what he refers to as penis envy.

And then the fantasy becomes less fulfilling and he, the transition from a really intense repeating fantasy to an actual offence becomes less of a giant step. The gap between the fantasy and the reality become less and less and less. Driving around in his car, stopping outside schools, looking at pornography, fantasising about the schoolgirls. It's getting closer and closer to a point where he would offend.”

The statement of V3


	
	V3’s mother provided a statement dated 15 November 2016 pursuant to s 21A. She said that she and V3 supported the plaintiff’s application for an ESO. She also said:
	


“4. Amanda and I are of the view that the conditions to which the Extended Supervision Order may be subject should include:

a. Mr Fernando is not to go anywhere between Parramatta and the Blue Mountains.

b. Mr Fernando is to be ankle monitored

c. Mr Fernando is not to go near any schools

d. Mr Fernando is not to go anywhere near any children under 16 years of age without supervision.”

Relevant matters


	
	The matters referred to in s 9 are to be taken into account in determining whether to make an ESO. I propose to address each relevant matter in turn, although I will address the safety of the community (s 9(3)(a)) last as this factor largely derives from the others.
	
	
	I am also obliged to consider the victim statement which has been placed before the Court pursuant to s 21A.
	


The reports from experts appointed under s 7(4) of the Act and the level of the defendant’s participation in such examination (s 9(3)(b))


	
	The reports of Dr O’Dea and Mr Sheehan are considered above. They both consider the defendant to pose a high risk of sexual re-offending, which can adequately be controlled by an ESO with appropriate conditions such as those proposed by the plaintiff. Mr O’Dea considered that the maximum term provided by the Act, five years, would be an appropriate duration for an ESO, there being no real prospect of the risk attenuating (other than through the ESO) during that period. He was not cross-examined. Mr Sheehan opined “4-5 years” would be an appropriate length. The basis for his opinion is set out above.
	


The results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further relevant offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment (s 9(3)(c))


	
	The risk assessment report of Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo referred to above assessed the risk posed by the defendant to be high by reference to static and dynamic risk factors.
	


The results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further relevant offence (s 9(3)(d))


	
	The risk assessment report of Dr Parker and Ms Matsuo referred to above included the defendant’s scores by reference to various statistical measures. Each such measure indicated that the defendant poses a high risk of future offending, having regard to static and dynamic factors.
	


Any report prepared by Corrective Services NSW as to the extent to which the offender can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community (s 9(3)(d1))


	
	In the report referred to above, Ms Sartor addressed the ways in which the offender could reasonably and practicably be managed in the community. She set out the mechanisms that could be put in place through conditions imposed on an ISO or ESO which, in her view, could reasonably and practically manage the otherwise unacceptable risk posed by the defendant.
	


Any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs (s 9(3)(e))


	
	The narrative set out above indicates that the defendant has undertaken several programs, including the CUBIT Program which he completed in 2010. By and large the defendant has engaged in such programs and his participation has been regarded as substantial.
	


The level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier ESO (s 9(3)(f))


	
	The defendant was on still on parole for the sentence imposed for the offences committed in 1989 when he offended in January 1993. He was released to parole in January 1999 and offended again in October 1999 when he was still on parole. This history tends to indicate that the offender is incapable of complying with conditions of his parole and that such constraints as have applied to him when on parole have been insufficient to control the risk he poses or to prevent future offending. It is also of concern that there has been an escalation in the degree of sexual violence over this period.
	


The level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 or the Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 (S 9(3)(g))


	
	As referred to above, the defendant was charged with an offence under the CPOR Act relating to his failure to declare a mobile phone and also his use of social media. These offences were committed within two months of his release from custody while he was in the highly regulated environment of the COSP facility. The defendant’s conduct does not engender confidence in his ability to manage his own risk or abide by directions or conditions. It also provides some indication that, although his intelligence is not high, he is capable of acting in a way that cannot readily be detected by his DSO.
	


The offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history (s 9(3)(h))


	
	The defendant has a lengthy criminal history which has been detailed above. The circumstances of his offending conduct are summarised in the narrative. Of the past 27 years the defendant has spent over 24 years in custody. For those relatively short periods when he has been out of custody, he has been under supervision (whether on release to parole or subject to an ISO).
	
	
	The defendant’s offending reveals that when he is disinhibited by alcohol or drugs, he feels entitled to help himself to what he desires, including the bodies of his female victims. He tends to choose young or vulnerable women, apparently on the basis that they are more easily silenced and on the mistaken assumption that they will be impressed by the size of his penis or his sexual prowess. His sexual offending appears to reflect a distorted sense of entitlement and a desire for dominance as much as a sexual desire.
	


The views of the sentencing court at the time the sentence of imprisonment was imposed on the offender (s 9(3)(h1))


	
	The sentencing remarks of O’Reilly DCJ extracted above indicate the extent to which the defendant poses a danger to the community. As referred to above his Honour described the defendant’s prognosis as guarded and the facts as “quite appalling”. His Honour said that the defendant’s conduct called for a heavy sentence.
	
	
	The sentencing remarks of Williams DCJ which are set out above indicate a concern about the danger posed by the defendant to the victim and the extent to which the public needs to be protected from him. I note in particular his Honour’s assessment that the defendant posed a high risk of re-offending.
	


Any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature (in the case of an application for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order) (s 9(3)(i))


	
	The evidence before me has been sufficiently addressed in relation to the other matters to be taken into account under s 9(3).
	


The safety of the community (s 9(3)(a))


	
	The matters referred to above tend to establish that the defendant, if released without supervision, or without adequate conditions as to supervision, would pose an unacceptable risk to the safety of both adult and post-pubescent females. Those girls and women who happen to be in the defendant’s path when he is abusing substances are at particular risk. The defendant’s predilection for young post-pubescent girls (on the grounds that they are likely to be sexually unexperienced and impressed by his prowess) places those in that category at particular risk, although his offending conduct includes violent sexual assaults against adult women as well.
	


The victim statement: s 21A


	
	I have also had regard to the concerns of V3 as expressed in her mother’s statement referred to above. Although I have not included conditions in the identical terms to those proposed by V3’s mother, I am satisfied that the conditions which are imposed will adequately address the victim’s concerns. I do not regard it as either practical or necessary to exclude the defendant from the area between Parramatta and Blacktown. Many of the potential locations for affordable accommodation are in that area, as well as places where it is reasonable to expect the defendant to obtain treatment and assistance from Corrective Services and other authorities. Further it is a substantial geographical area, which includes most of the population of Sydney.
	


Conclusion


	
	The defendant is a sex offender within the meaning of the Act, having been sentenced to imprisonment following his convictions for offences including a serious sex offence, being the offence against s 61J of the Crimes Act against V3, which was committed on 18 October 1999. The summons was filed within six months of the expiry of his sentence for that offence.
	
	
	As referred to above, the defendant suffers from schizophrenia, substance abuse/ dependence and paedophilia. His mental health is unstable, although it can, to some extent, be controlled by medication as long as he is compliant. He has recently experienced symptoms (hearing voices) consistent with uncontrolled schizophrenia, which have a sexual component (the voice told him to touch a woman on the bus). Actuarial and other risk factor tests place him in a high risk category. He has a long history of offending related to poly-substance abuse. He has a complex psychiatric and medication presentation. The seriousness of his offending (both as to violence and sexual content) has increased over time.
	
	
	Having considered the factors in s 9(3) of the Act addressed above, in the context of the narrative of facts, I am satisfied that the defendant, being a sex offender, poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence in the absence of any supervision: State of New South Wales v Donovan at [24] and Lynn v State of New South Wales [2016] NSWCA 57 at [55].
	
	
	Accordingly, I am satisfied that the defendant is a high risk sex offender within the meaning of s 5B of the Act. I note that, although the extent to which the defendant’s liberty is constrained by proposed conditions is a relevant consideration in formulating such conditions, it is irrelevant to the determination of whether the defendant poses an unacceptable risk: Lynn v State of New South Wales at [44], [55]-[58] (per Beazley P), [128] (per Basten JA) and [148] (per Gleeson JA).
	
	
	I am persuaded that it is appropriate, and necessary, to protect the safety of the community, to make an ESO pursuant to ss 5C and 9(1)(a) of the Act on the conditions which have been agreed by the parties (referred to below). I am not satisfied that there are any factors personal to the offender which would militate against the making of the order.
	


The duration of the ESO

The parties’ submissions


	
	It was contended on behalf of the defendant that it was not necessary for an ESO to be made for the maximum period of five years permitted pursuant to s 10(1A). Mr O’Neil submitted that the objects of the Act could be met with a supervision order of four years’ duration. He contended that a period of four years would be sufficient time to determine the course of the defendant’s rehabilitation. He also submitted that an ESO of this length would provide sufficient time from the expiry of the current CTO (assuming it is not extended) to ascertain whether the defendant is capable of administering his medication as prescribed so as to avoid a repetition of what occurred in August 2014.
	
	
	Ms Bennett, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, contended that there was no warrant for supposing that the risk posed by the defendant would be significantly lessened in a period of five years, having regard to the long-standing causes of his offending conduct.
	


Consideration


	
	The long-term risk that the defendant poses to the community is not to be underestimated. The opportunistic impulsivity of his offending behaviour if he is under the influence of substances is an important feature of the defendant’s offending. I regard the prospect that the risk posed by the defendant to the community (and in particular to post-pubescent girls and adult women) could be adequately managed by the defendant himself (by reference to risks and rewards) as remote, if not entirely fanciful.
	
	
	These observations ought not be understood as undermining the important role played by the Departmental Supervising Officer in moderating particular conditions as time goes on to give greater latitude to the defendant if his compliance with the ESO is adjudged to warrant it. I understand this flexibility to be a significant means by which the risk posed by persons such as the defendant is ameliorated and managed by Departmental Supervising Officers.
	
	
	I do not consider the present case to be one where it is appropriate to wait and see what progress, if any, is made over a lesser period, such as four years. The duration of an ESO is to be determined as a matter of judgment, having regard to the wording of the Act. The defendant’s offending conduct is connected with his sexual offending. His criminal history dates back to his childhood. His mental health is compromised and depends on compliance with medication. He has spent almost all of his adult life in custody. These matters do not augur well for a speedy rehabilitation. Mr Sheehan has noted that a risk that can be well-managed under supervision can result in offending conduct when the constraints are removed. There is no reason to suppose that there will be any significant amelioration of what I have found to be the unacceptable risk posed by the defendant in the next five years. It would not, in my view, be appropriate in these circumstances to grant an ESO for a period less than the five-year maximum permitted by the Act.
	


Conditions


	
	As a result of objections raised by Mr O’Neil to conditions proposed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff has amended its summons twice to propose amended conditions. I propose to address the conditions which remain in the annexure to the further amended summons which was filed in Court on 23 November 2016 which are in dispute.
	
	
	Section 11 of the Act provides for conditions to be imposed. In general terms, to be appropriate, conditions must be germane to the risk posed by the defendant or ancillary to the management of the risk posed by the defendant. Conditions which cannot be characterised in this way might be regarded as ultra vires if they are not related to the purpose of s 11 of the Act in the context of the Act as a whole. Therefore it is necessary to consider the connection between the condition and the risk in order to assess whether the condition ought be imposed: see Lynn v State of New South Wales at [141] and Wilde v State of New South Wales [2015] NSWCA 28 at [53]. It is also relevant that breach of a condition renders the defendant liable to criminal sanctions. Accordingly, there is an additional requirement that a condition must be clear such that breach can be judged objectively.
	
	
	I note Mr Sheehan’s general views that the conditions imposed ought be confined to the bare minimum required; that each condition ought be plainly related to the risk imposed by the particular defendant; and that the defendant’s personal autonomy ought be given as much scope as possible. Although I accept, in general terms, that the defendant ought not be unduly restricted, the primary purpose of an ESO is the protection of the public. Conditions which are related to risk management, including in an ancillary way, are also appropriate, depending on the circumstances. I accept the plaintiff’s submissions that it ought be assumed that the power of the DSO to make directions will be exercised lawfully: that is, for a proper purpose and not capriciously.
	


Part D of the conditions: employment, finance and education

Condition 21: direction to engage in employment, education, training or personal development program


	
	Condition 21 as proposed in the schedule to the further amended summons is:
	


“If the defendant is unemployed, the defendant must enter available employment if and as directed by the DSO or make himself available for employment, education, training or participation in a personal development program as directed by the DSO.”


	
	The defendant opposed this condition on two bases. First, Mr O’Neil submitted that it was otiose since it was fanciful to suggest that the defendant, having regard to his hearing impairment, cognitive difficulties and receipt of Disability Support Pension, could ever obtain employment. Further, he submitted that it would be counter-productive for the defendant to be required, upon penalty of criminal conviction for breach, to engage in employment, when such matters were best dealt with as part of “case management” which did not expose the defendant to the penalty of breach.
	
	
	Ms Carden said, of the reason for the condition:
	


“Part of Mr Fernando's reintegration into the community could involve gaining employment, therefore this condition would assist Community Corrections in steering Mr Fernando in that direction if the time was right and it appeared to be necessary or something that he would benefit from.”


	
	In cross-examination, Ms Carden accepted, in effect, that the defendant was unlikely to obtain employment in the open labour market (an assessment which she accepted in re-examination that she had no expertise to make). She also accepted that matters such as employment were best approached through a “case work” method, rather than a direction, non-compliance with which could lead to a breach of the ESO, with criminal consequences.
	
	
	Mr Sheehan agreed that it was unlikely that the defendant would ever work. He did not endorse condition 21 in its present terms. He said:
	


“It seems to be a pathway to breach not really directly related to his offending, particularly in his case where he is on disability and from his presentation it seems unlikely that he will work again, and he will tell you that he doesn't think that he is going to be able to work again”.


	
	I accept the plaintiff’s submissions that the condition ought be imposed. Although I accept that it is unlikely that the defendant will be able to obtain remunerative employment on the open labour market, I would not readily conclude that there is no work, whether of a voluntary nature or otherwise, in which he could engage. That he has been able to work satisfactorily in the prison system as a baker provides some indication that, if some work, whether paid or not, at an appropriate level could be found for him, it would be desirable that he engage in it. Of course, if the defendant were willing to engage in such employment, or indeed in any education or training or personal development program that was thought to be in his interests, there would be no need for his DSO to give him a direction to that effect. However, it is reasonable to envisage that circumstances might arise where a DSO considers that the defendant ought engage in such activities and the defendant is not prepared to do so without a direction. I accept Ms Carden’s view as to the rationale for the condition and consider it to be reasonable. If the defendant can be suitably occupied and challenged, the risks of his lapsing into drug or alcohol abuse are diminished. As this abuse is usually the precursor to his offending behaviour, there is, in my view, a sufficiently close connection between the condition and the risk he poses.
	


Condition 24: prohibition on signing an instrument giving the defendant control over another’s assets without prior approval of DSO


	
	Condition 24 as proposed in the schedule to the further amended summons is:
	


“The defendant must not sign any legal instrument that gives the defendant control of any money or assets of another person or organisation, without prior approval of the DSO.”


	
	The defendant opposed this condition on the grounds that there was no demonstrated need for it and it was purely speculative. Mr O’Neil relied on Ms Carden’s acceptance in cross-examination that she was not aware of anything that would suggest that he would be in such a position. However, she considered that such a condition was reasonable and necessary having regard to the defendant’s propensity to gamble. I am persuaded that condition 24 is reasonable. It is notable that, when the defendant was released from custody in January 1999 he moved in with a woman who worked within the correctional system. They lived together for some months in an intimate relationship. The woman presumably knew of his criminal history (since they had met while he was in gaol). Despite this, she was prepared to live with him and have him reside in the same house as her two children, one of whom was a young girl.
	
	
	These facts illustrate that the defendant has, in the past, demonstrated a significant capacity to engender love and trust. In different circumstances, this capacity might operate to incline someone to entrust the defendant with money. As Ms Carden explained, it would not be in the defendant’s interests to have access to any substantial sum of money, at least at this stage, having regard to his inexperience with managing money.
	


Condition 25: prohibition on signing certain documents without prior approval of DSO


	
	Condition 25 as proposed in the schedule to the further amended summons is:
	


“The defendant must not sign any lease, mortgage, contract for sale for goods or services above the value of $500, hire agreement, power of attorney, deed, or any instrument relating to obtaining any credit, opening of any account held at a bank, credit union, building society or similar institution, without prior approval of the DSO.”

[Emphasis added.]


	
	The defendant opposed the words “mortgage” and “opening of any account held at a bank, credit union, building society or similar institution” as highlighted in italics in the proposed condition set out above. Ms Carden gave evidence of her concerns about the defendant’s capacity for financial management in the following exchange in her cross-examination:
	


“Q. You don't think he could make that determination [whether to enter into a lease] himself?

A. At present I have concerns about his financial management given that recently he was encouraged by his psychologist to listen to music to help him relax on public transport as he experiences anxiety. In discussion with him I suggested perhaps he might like to purchase a CD from a music store the next time he went to the shops. Instead, Mr Fernando informed staff at COS that he had spent approximately $250 on a whole host of CDs that he had seen on TV. Therefore I am concerned that perhaps he might impulsively enter into a lease without thinking about whether or not it would be affordable for him on a Q. Could he not afford the $250 worth of CDs?

A. I'm not sure. He was able to purchase them however I know that at the moment his goal is that he is saving money so that he can move out. He'll need to buy furniture, have money for a bond, things like that. And the CDs would have had an impact on his savings for that”.


	
	The word “mortgage” extends beyond mortgages of real property and extends to chattels and other property. In these circumstances, it is, in my view, reasonably necessary to require that any mortgage be approved by the DSO before it is granted. If the defendant has a bank account of which the DSO is unaware it cannot be monitored. In light of the concerns about the defendant’s capacity to manage money; his propensity to gamble when under stress or when abusing alcohol or substances; and the connection between his offending conduct and disorder in his life, I consider the condition as proposed to be reasonably necessary.
	


Part L of the conditions: personal details and appearance


	
	The defendant opposed each of conditions 53-57 as proposed in the schedule to the further amended summons. These proposed conditions are:
	


“Part L: Personal details and appearance

53. The defendant must not change his name from “Kevin Todd Fernando” or use any other name without the approval of his DSO.

54. The defendant must not use any alias, log-in name, or a name other than “Kevin Todd Fernando” or use any email address other than those known to the DSO under condition 42 above, on any internet site (including social networking sites), any online communication applications or any third party sites or applications that requires the user to have a user identification name or log-in email.

55. The defendant must not change his appearance without the approval of his DSO.

56. The defendant must let CSNSW photograph him.

57. If the defendant changes the details of any current form of identification or obtains further forms of identification, he must provide the DSO with such details.”


	
	Mr O’Neil contended that such conditions may be unnecessary as there is no suggestion that the defendant has ever sought to conceal or change his identity. He submitted that given the close contact between the DSO and the defendant during any ESO any change in appearance would be immediately recognisable by the DSO.
	
	
	I am satisfied that proposed conditions 53-57 ought be made. In 1991 the defendant failed to report in accordance with parole conditions, as a result of which his parole was revoked. He could not be located for a considerable period, during which time he re-offended. It is within reasonable contemplation that, if the defendant were to abuse drugs or alcohol, he might leave his approved address. If he did so during a period when he was subject to electronic monitoring it would be relatively easily to detect his whereabouts and bring him back to the residence. However, if he were not subject to electronic monitoring, it could be difficult to find him.
	
	
	Condition 56 obliges the defendant to permit Corrective Services to photograph him. If there was no photograph of the defendant and he absented himself, it would be difficult to disseminate a reliable image to those who might be able to locate him. These conditions appear to me to be necessary ancillary conditions to the management of the risk posed by the defendant.
	
	
	The identification of the defendant and the location of his whereabouts at any given time are fundamental to risk management. It is particularly important that the defendant can be located quickly since if he does not take prescribed medication and if he abuses alcohol or substances, his life can become “chaotic” (as Mr Sheehan has described it) which tends to lead to offending, including sex offending. The escalation of criminal conduct during a short period was demonstrated in October 1999 when the worst and most violent of his offending, that committed against V3, was committed on 18 October 1999, less than a week after the first episode of his spree (stealing from T and offending against her daughter on 12 October 1999) took place.
	


Orders


	
	For the reasons set out above, I make the following orders:
	



	
	Order pursuant to ss 5C and 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act) that the defendant be subject to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order (“the extended supervision order”) for a period of 5 years from the date of this order.
	
	
	Order pursuant to s 11 of the Act, directing that the defendant, for the period of the extended supervision order, comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule.

3006500,CHK v Children’s Guardian [2016] NSWCATAD 276,"Reasons for decision

Background


	
	CHK (the Applicant), seeks review of the decision of the Respondent (the Children’s Guardian), to refuse his application for a Working with Children Check (WWCC) clearance, under the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012 (“the Act”).
	
	
	The Applicant is a 64 year old man. The Applicant requires a WWCC clearance because he wishes to resume work as a bus driver.
	
	
	On 20 November 2014, the Applicant applied to the Office of the Children’s Guardian (the Respondent) for a WWCC clearance.
	
	
	The Respondent conducted a risk assessment of the Applicant and, on 19 November 2015, determined to refuse the application.
	
	
	On 3 December 2015, the Applicant lodged an application for review of the Respondent’s decision.
	


The Statutory Scheme

The Child Protection (Working with Children) Act


	
	The objects of the Act are as follows:
	


3 Object of Act

The object of this Act is to protect children:

(a) by not permitting certain persons to engage in child-related work, and

(b) by requiring persons engaged in child-related work to have Working with Children Check clearances.


	
	Section 4 of the Act provides that the paramount consideration in the operation of the Act is the “safety, welfare and well-being of children and, in particular, protecting them from child abuse.”
	
	
	The Act prohibits a person from engaging in “child-related work” unless (a) the person holds the relevant WWCC clearance, or (b) there is a current application, by the person, to the Respondent for the relevant WWCC clearance: s 8(1). Contravention of this prohibition is an offence, carrying a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units, or imprisonment for two years, or both.
	
	
	Section 18 sets out how the Respondent is to determine an application for a clearance. Where the person seeking a clearance has a prior conviction (defined to include a finding of guilt without a conviction being entered) for an offence listed in Schedule 2 of the Act, or where that person has been charged with such an offence and the proceedings in regard thereto are pending, subsection 18(1) provides that this person is a “disqualified person” and the Respondent must refuse that person’s application for a clearance. In this case, the Applicant is not a “disqualified person” and the subsection does not apply to him.
	
	
	Subsections 18(2) and (3) apply to all other applications. These subsections provide:
	


18 Determination of applications for clearances

(1) …

(2) The Children’s Guardian must grant a clearance to a person who is subject to a risk assessment under Division 3 unless the Children’s Guardian is satisfied that the person poses a risk to the safety of children.

(3) The Children’s Guardian must grant a clearance to a person if it is satisfied that the person is not a disqualified person and the person is not subject to a risk assessment under Division 3.


	
	A person is subject to an “assessment requirement” if any of the matters specified in Schedule 1 of the Act apply. This includes circumstances where the person has been convicted of, or proceedings have been commenced against a person for, offences involving violence or sexual misconduct sufficient to indicate a pattern of behaviour that warrants investigation as to whether it may cause a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	According to the Respondent’s records, the matter which triggered a risk assessment of the Applicant was CHK’s criminal prosecution in 1992 when he was charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault. CHK was alleged to have sexually assaulted an 11 year old girl on 26 September 1992. The matter proceeded to trial in the District Court in April 1994. A verdict of not guilty was returned on each count.
	
	
	In making an assessment, the Respondent may consider the following factors set out in section 15(4) of the Act:
	



	
	the seriousness of any matters that caused the assessment in relation to the person,
	
	
	the period of time since those matters occurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred,
	
	
	the age of the person at the time the matters occurred,
	
	
	the age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time it occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the victim,
	
	
	the difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person,
	
	
	whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was a child,
	
	
	the person’s present age,
	
	
	the seriousness of the person’s total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the matters occurred,
	
	
	the likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct or of any other matters that caused the assessment and the impact on children of any such repetition,
	
	
	any information given in, or in relation to, the application,
	
	
	any other matters that the Children’s Guardian considers necessary.
	


Role of the Tribunal


	
	Section 27 of the Act makes provision for administrative review by the Tribunal of a number of decisions of the Respondent, including a decision to refuse a WWCC clearance. That section relevantly provides:
	


27 Applications to Civil and Administrative Tribunal for administrative reviews of clearance decisions

(1) A person who has been refused a Working with Children Check clearance by the Children’s Guardian may apply to the Tribunal for an administrative review under the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997 of the decision within 28 days after notice of the decision was given to the person.

(2) …

(3) …

(4) An Applicant must fully disclose to the Tribunal any matters relevant to the application.

(5), (6) (Repealed)

(7) Section 53 of the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997 does not apply to a decision that may be reviewed by the Tribunal under this section.


	
	Having jurisdiction to review the decision of the Respondent, the role of the Tribunal is to decide what the correct and preferable decision is having regard to all of the material before it, including any relevant factual material which may not have been before the Respondent: Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997, s 63.
	
	
	That is, the Tribunal sits in the shoes of the decision maker and decides the matter afresh, as at the date of hearing: YG and GG v Minister for Community Services [2002] NSWCA 247, at [25].
	
	
	The jurisdiction of the Tribunal under section 27 of the Act is protective and not punitive in nature: BJB v Office of the Children’s Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 111 at [110]; AYU v NSW Office of the Children's Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 69, at [34]; Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111, per Young JA at [61]; and R v Commission for Children and Young People [2002] NSWIRComm 101 at [130]
	
	
	The guiding principle to be applied to practice and procedure in the Tribunal “is to facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings” consistent with the objects and principles under the Act: Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013, s 36.
	
	
	The Tribunal may determine its own procedure in relation to any matter for which the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act, or the Civil and Administrative Rules 2014 do not otherwise make provision. The Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence, except in relation to privileged disclosures (Evidence Act 1995, s 128) and is to act with as little formality as the circumstances permit to appropriately determine matters without regard to technicalities or legal form: Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act, s 38 and s 67.
	
	
	Procedural fairness and other aspects of natural justice, of course, apply to these proceedings and the Tribunal has a discretion to act on material which is rationally probative, but must determine in all the circumstances whether it is proper to act on that material and must act fairly towards the parties: Commission for Children and Young People v FZ [2011] NSWCA 111; Roberts v Balencio (1987) 8 NSWLR 436.
	
	
	In BKE v Office of the NSW Children’s Guardian [2015] NSWSC 523 (BKE) at [29], Beech-Jones J noted that while the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence, it should have regard to the principles in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; 60 CLR 336 set out at p 362 per Dixon J , in making a positive finding that an Applicant had sexually abused a child in circumstances where the Applicant had not been convicted of doing so.
	
	
	At [30], His Honour said “significant guidance as to the approach to be adopted” in such cases could be derived from the High Court’s decision in M v M [1988] HCA 68; 166 CLR 69. At [33], His Honour summarised the Tribunal’s fact finding task as follows:
	


“33 … [Thus] in such cases it may be that NCAT can be satisfied that an allegation of sexual abuse against an Applicant is established. Equally, NCAT may be affirmatively satisfied that the relevant incident did not occur, in which case it can be put aside. However, in a context where the welfare of the child is paramount and the question being posed concerns the risk of harm to children, NCAT may not be satisfied that an allegation of abuse has been made out, but nevertheless conclude that the circumstances surrounding a particular incident or course of conduct means that there is a risk to a child or, more correctly, that the existence of a risk has not been disproven.”

Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997


	
	Pursuant to section 63 of the Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997, the Tribunal has power to make the following orders:
	



	
	to affirm the decision of the Respondent, or
	
	
	to vary the decision, or
	
	
	to set aside the decision and make a decision in substitution for the decision it set aside, or
	
	
	to set aside the decision and remit the matter for reconsideration by the Respondent in accordance with any directions or recommendations of the Tribunal.
	



	
	At any stage of proceedings, the Tribunal may remit the decision to the Respondent for reconsideration: Administrative Decisions Review Act 1997, s 65.
	


Child Protection (Working with Children) Act 2012


	
	Subsection 30 (1) of the Act sets out the factors the Tribunal must consider in determining a review application under section 27 of the Act. (These replicate the factors set out in s15(4) to which the Respondent may have regard when conducting its risk assessment) :
	


30 Determination of applications and other matters

(1) The Tribunal must consider the following in determining an application under this Part:

(a) the seriousness of the offences with respect to which the person is a disqualified person or any matters that caused a refusal of a clearance or imposition of an interim bar,

(b) the period of time since those offences or matters occurred and the conduct of the person since they occurred,

(c) the age of the person at the time the offences or matters occurred,

(d) the age of each victim of any relevant offence or conduct at the time they occurred and any matters relating to the vulnerability of the victim,

(e) the difference in age between the victim and the person and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the person,

(f) whether the person knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was a child,

(g) the person’s present age,

(h) the seriousness of the person’s total criminal record and the conduct of the person since the offences occurred,

(i) the likelihood of any repetition by the person of the offences or conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition,

(j) any information given by the Applicant in, or in relation to, the application,

(k) any other matters that the Children’s Guardian considers necessary.


	
	The meaning of the word “risk” was considered by his Honour Young CJ in Eq in Commission for Children and Young People v V [2002] NSWSC 949. At [42], His Honour made the following remarks in regard to the word “risk” as it appeared in the former Child Protection (Prohibited Employment) Act 1998:
	


‘What one is looking for is whether, in all the circumstances, there is a real and appreciable risk in the sense of a risk that is greater than the risk of any adult preying on a child. One, however, must link the word ""risk"" with the words that follow, namely, ""to the safety of children"".’


	
	These remarks have been accepted to equally apply to the word “risk” as it appears in the 2012 Act: AYU v NSW Office of the Children’s Guardian [2014] NSWCATAD 69, at [39] and BKE, at [26].
	
	
	In BKE, at [27], Beech-Jones J noted that the assessment of risk under the Act is not limited to the circumstances for which an Applicant seeks a clearance and whether he/she poses a “risk to the safety of children” in those circumstances. Instead, an Applicant is “subject to the full gamut of assessment which is applicable to persons who seek work in a child-related area.”
	


Burden of proof


	
	The Act is silent as to where the onus lies in relation to an application for administrative review under Part 4 of the Act. It has been held that neither party bears an onus of proof in relation to an application under section 27 of the Act: BJB v The Children’s Guardian (No. 2) [2014] NSWCATAD 164 at [32].
	
	
	Although the Applicant has no legal burden he does have a practical or forensic onus: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v QAAH of 2004 [2006] HCA 53, and the Tribunal has to consider all of the evidence adduced by the parties in light of, and under, the mandated considerations contained in section 30 of the Act. A party who asserts a fact has a responsibility to prove that fact: Re Eckersley and Minister for Capital Territory (1979) 2 ALD 303; Holbrook and Australian Postal Commission (1983) 5 ALN N46.
	
	
	Where a matter requires proof it should be proved to the civil standard, on the balance of probabilities: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Pochi (1980) 4 ALD 139; BJB No. 2 at [32].
	
	
	However, the ultimate issue is not whether a particular allegation has been proved or not proved. This is subservient and ancillary to the ultimate issue: whether in all the circumstances the Applicant poses a real and appreciable risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	An application pursuant to section 27 is a merits review and not a review in which the Applicant must show that the decision maker was wrong: Re Control Investments Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (No. 2) (1981) 3 ALD 88.
	
	
	The Applicant has a duty to disclose all relevant material pursuant to section 27(4) of the Act.
	


Evidence before the Tribunal


	
	The Applicant relied upon the documents he provided to the Respondent (as part of the assessment process) which included the following documents:
	



	
	Statutory Declaration of CHK dated 3 May 2015;
	
	
	Statutory Declaration of CHK dated 16 May 2015;
	
	
	Employer reference dated 7 May 2015;
	
	
	Reference dated 5 December 1987;and
	
	
	Reference dated 24 October 1990
	



	
	In addition the Applicant relied upon a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, Psychiatrist, dated 6 June 2016. He also tendered written submissions prepared by his Solicitor dated 14 April 2016.
	
	
	The Respondent relied upon the following documents:
	



	
	Bundle of documents filed pursuant to section 58 of the Administrative Decisions Review Act on 13 January 2016. (Exhibit R1)
	
	
	Documents produced under Summons by […] on 2 June 2016
	



	
	In addition the Respondent tendered written submissions prepared by Counsel for the Respondent dated 31 March 2016.
	
	
	The evidence is now considered under each of the subheadings of sections 15(4) and 30(1) of the Act.
	


(a) Seriousness of any matters that caused the refusal of the Applicant’s application for a clearance

1992 aggravated sexual assault charges


	
	The principal matters that caused the refusal of the Applicant’s application for a clearance were two charges of aggravated sexual assault on 27 September 1992. It is relevant to note that complete copies of the prosecution brief of evidence and transcripts of the relevant criminal proceedings were not in evidence before the Tribunal. A partial transcript of the committal proceedings in the Local Court on 23 August and 21 October 1993 was in evidence. There was no transcript available from the District Court trial and no evidence which would assist the Tribunal in relation to the circumstances which led to the Applicant’s acquittal on both charges.
	
	
	The Tribunal did have the benefit of some statements to Police including those made by the complainant and Police records of interview with the Applicant conducted shortly after the alleged incident in 1992.
	
	
	There can be no argument that the offences for which the applicant was charged involving aggravated sexual assault of a child are inherently serious. The charges alleged the victim was an 11 year old girl (the complainant). The complainant, according to both her version and the applicant’s version of events, was in the company of two other minors who were all passengers on a bus being driven by the Applicant. The complainant alleged that she and her two companions made a number of trips on the bus driven by the applicant that evening and he let them ride for free. In her statement to Police dated 27 September 1992 the complainant alleges that in the early hours of the morning, after the two boys with whom she had been travelling on the bus alighted, there were no other passengers on the bus. She says the Applicant drove her back to the bus depot. When they arrived at the bus depot he is alleged to have told the complainant to wait in the bus while he took the takings from his bus run to the office. At some point after they returned to the bus depot the complainant alleges that another male got on the stationary bus and she heard the Applicant say to this person “You stupid bastard, you scared the shit out of me.” After the other man left, the complainant says the Applicant gave her $10.00 which she had seen him remove from the bus takings, and told her to go and buy dinner. She further alleges the Applicant then grabbed her and attempted to kiss her, forced her to perform oral sex on him and inserted his finger in her vagina. After this the complainant says the Applicant put her in his vehicle and attempted to leave the bus depot with her. However the complainant says she managed to escape and sought refuge at a nearby house, whose occupants called the Police. 
	
	
	As noted earlier, the circumstances surrounding the acquittal of the Applicant in the District Court criminal trial in 1994 are not known as attempts by the Respondent to obtain copies of the transcript of the trial were unsuccessful.
	
	
	It is conceded by the Respondent that there are aspects of the complainant’s statements that are inconsistent or unclear. One such aspect of the complainant’s evidence was her statement to Police (s.58 documents at p.112) that when the Applicant forced her to perform oral sex on him she had pulled his penis out of her mouth and
	


“there was all this sticky stuff on my hands off his penis when I tried to pull it out my mouth.”


	
	The complainant then says she wiped the “sticky stuff” down the left leg of her jeans. Forensic examination of the jeans worn by the girl on the night of the alleged offence did not detect the presence of semen on the jeans.
	
	
	The complainant is alleged to have told one witness that the Applicant kept her on his bus from about 4.00pm on the afternoon in question (R1 at p.271). This contradicts her statement to Police that she willingly caught a number of buses travelling the same route including the one driven by the Applicant from the afternoon of 26 September 1992 to late that same evening.
	
	
	In his record of interview with Police following the girl’s complaint, the Applicant denies that he took the complainant to the bus depot after completing his last run. He says he dropped her off at a roundabout near the depot. He states she told him that one of the boys she had been travelling with was drunk and that she said
	


I kicked from the, (sic) her mother and father. I say that I got to be home. And she say, I got no money.(R1 at p166)


	
	The Applicant says the complainant asked him for some money as she had none and he gave her $10.00.
	
	
	The Respondent says the fact that the applicant admits that he was aware that the complainant was a young, vulnerable girl and did not act protectively towards her when she was travelling late at night on his bus, raises concerns.
	
	
	The Respondent also says there are a number of matters that support the complainant’s account including that she made an early and detailed complaint to Police. The Respondent says the complainant’s evidence that she was on the bus at the depot when another man came on board and spoke to the Applicant is supported by the account of another employee of the bus company where the applicant worked, who gave evidence at the committal proceedings that he had come on board the Applicant’s bus on the night in question after the Applicant had finished his shift and had startled the Applicant. Further support says the Respondent, is found for the complainant’s version of events that she was taken to the bus depot, from her description of the layout out of the depot which was consistent with the description given by an employee who gave evidence in the criminal proceedings.
	
	
	The allegation of sexual assault is particularly serious. The maximum penalty for the criminal offence of aggravated sexual assault was imprisonment for 20 years. The complainant was 11 years old at the relevant time. There is no witness who observed what happened between the complainant and the applicant that night. The complainant made immediate complaint and report of the offence. There is some support for the account of the complainant that she was on the bus at the depot when another employee boarded the bus.
	
	
	The allegations are such that, if true, the applicant may present a serious risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	As set out earlier in these reasons the Tribunal did not have the benefit of the transcript from the District Court criminal trial at which the Applicant was acquitted. There was also no other evidence before the Tribunal that would assist in determining what led to the Applicant’s acquittal. Based on the available evidence, the Tribunal makes no finding that the events alleged by the complainant to have occurred on 26 September 1992 which formed the basis of the Applicant’s 1992 criminal prosecution did or did not occur. However, as noted in BKE, the circumstances surrounding the allegations are matters the Tribunal is, as was the Respondent, required to take into account in determining whether the applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	


2003 and 2005 domestic violence incidents


	
	The other matters taken into account by the Respondent in refusing the Applicant a WWCC clearance were two alleged incidents of domestic violence in 2003 and 2005. Police records in evidence include COPS entries for these incidents (R1 at p.68) which record that on 1 February 2003 Police were called to the Applicant’s home following an argument between the Applicant and his wife in which the Applicant is alleged to have yelled abuse at his wife and threatened “to break her face.” The Applicant’s wife requested Police to seek an apprehended violence order on her behalf. Although not clear whether the Applicant’s children were in the house at the time of this event it is recorded by Police that the Applicant’s children with his wife were aged 10 and 16 at the time.
	
	
	On 22 January 2005 Police were called to the Applicant’s home following an argument between the applicant and his wife. The Applicant’s wife was referred to the Police domestic violence team and no further action was taken. These incidents in 2003 and 2005 are less serious than the 1992 trigger event. They do not appear to have involved actual physical violence although there was allegedly a threat of violence and the Applicant’s wife described him as possessive and controlling. It is well accepted that children can be both the direct and indirect victims of domestic violence and, in this regard, the Applicant’s alleged conduct is both serious and relevant to the issue of whether the Applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	


(b) The period of time since the matter occurred and the conduct of the Applicant since that time


	
	The trigger offences occurred 24 years ago in September 1992. The most recent domestic incident occurred over 11 years ago in January 2005. Since then the Applicant has had no known criminal offences and there is no evidence before the Tribunal of any conduct which could be considered ‘adverse’ to the Applicant since the matters which led to the refusal of the WWCC clearance.
	
	
	Since then the Applicant has been continuously employed as a bus driver with the same company. He has been suspended from duties as a bus driver pending the outcome of his application to the Tribunal. As part of the risk assessment process, three references were provided to the Respondent by the Applicant. These referees write positively about the Applicant’s character although it is noted that two of these references pre-date the 1992 incident. The references are discussed in more detail below.
	
	
	The Applicant has not provided any evidence of other conduct which might weigh in his favour or otherwise.
	


(c) The age of the Applicant at the time the matters occurred


	
	The Applicant was 39 years old at the time of the alleged sexual assault in 1992. He was 50 and 52 years old at the time of the alleged domestic violence incidents.
	


(d) The age of the victim of the conduct at the time it occurred and any matters relating to vulnerability of the victim


	
	The complainant involved in the 1992 incident was 11 years old. By virtue of her age and the circumstances of the alleged incident she was highly vulnerable. She was travelling over a period of some hours, late at night and into the early hours of the following day unaccompanied by an adult on a bus driven by the Applicant.
	
	
	The Police report of the 2003 domestic violence incident records the ages of the Applicant’s children at the time as 10 and 16. The age gap between the Applicant and his wife is not known. The Applicant’s wife was vulnerable as she was in a domestic relationship with the Applicant which she described to Police as abusive. The Applicant’s children were vulnerable by virtue of the Applicant’s authority as their father and their age.
	


(e) The difference in age between the victim and the Applicant and the relationship (if any) between the victim and the Applicant


	
	There was a difference of 28 years between the age of the Applicant and the complainant in the 1992 incident. She was a passenger on a public bus driven by the Applicant during the course of his employment as a bus driver.
	
	
	The age gap between the Applicant and his wife is not known. The exact age difference between the Applicant and his children is not known although based on the Police COPS entry regarding the 2003 incident, the Applicant’s children were 10 and 16 at the time. There is therefore approximately a 40 and 34 year age gap between them and the Applicant.
	


(f) Whether the Applicant knew, or could reasonably have known, that the victim was a child


	
	The Applicant would have been aware the complainant was a child. He described her to Police after the incident as a small girl.
	
	
	The Applicant would have been aware of the ages of his own children.
	


(g) The Applicant’s present age


	
	The Applicant is now 62 years of age.
	


(h) The seriousness of the Applicant’s total criminal record and the conduct of the Applicant since the matter occurred


	
	The Applicant has no criminal convictions. There is no evidence before the Tribunal of any conduct which could be considered ‘adverse’ to the Applicant since the last of the relevant events occurred in 2005. It is noted by the Tribunal that although there were reports of domestic violence by the Applicant in 2003 and 2005, there was no evidence before the Tribunal that he had ever been subject to an apprehended violence order for the protection of his wife.
	


(i) The likelihood of any repetition by the Applicant of the conduct and the impact on children of any such repetition


	
	The Applicant provided two statutory declarations dated 3 May 2015 and 16 May 2015 to the Respondent as part of the risk assessment process.
	
	
	The Applicant relied on a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, Psychiatrist, dated 6 June 2016. Dr Allnutt was provided with the submissions of the Solicitor for the Applicant and Counsel for the Respondent, the recommendations for refusal and reasons for decision of the Respondent in refusing his WWCC clearance together with Police records. Dr Allnutt interviewed the Applicant on one occasion in May 2016.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt describes the Applicant’s recollection of the events which led to the 1992 charges as poor. He notes that since the events in question there have been no complaints of sexual misconduct against the Applicant. At the time of Dr Allnutt’s interview he said the Applicant was manifesting a number of mild anxiety and depressive symptoms secondary to the chronic stressor of the WWCC procedure. In Dr Allnutt’s view the Applicant has no major psychiatric, anxiety or psychotic disorder and no evidence of cognitive disorder.
	
	
	Dr Allnutt says most risk assessment tools are applied to sex offenders who have been convicted and in a case such as the present there are difficulties in applying this sort of risk assessment tool. Dr Allnutt reports he used the Risk for Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP) in assessing the Applicant together with the Static 99 test but with the qualifier that the reliability and validity of this tool have limited applicability in this case.
	
	
	Factors which Dr Allnutt says are absent in this case which can be associated with increased risk for sexual recidivism include a sexual violence history that is chronic, diverse and escalating, problems with stress or coping, problems with non-intimate relationships, problems with treatment and diagnosis of a major mental illness.
	
	
	Factors associated with increased risk of sexual recidivism that are present in this case are psychological coercion, evidence for sexual deviance and extreme minimisation and denial.
	
	
	Factors which are ambiguous are a history of non-sexual criminality, being the reports of domestic violence, problems with intimate relationships and physical coercion.
	
	
	With regard to the Static 99, had the Applicant been convicted of the sexual offence, Dr Allnutt says he would now fall into a group of sex offenders at low risk of sexual recidivism as compared to other sex offenders who were in the study on which the Static 99 was based.
	
	
	Overall, Dr Allnutt says that if the Applicant committed the alleged sexual offence he would fall into a group of sex offenders at low risk of future sexual offending as compared to other sexual offenders.
	
	
	The Tribunal found Dr Allnutt’s report, which was not contradicted by other expert evidence, compelling and persuasive. The Tribunal accepts the evidence of Dr Allnutt and that the applicant is at low risk of future sexual reoffending as compared to other sexual offenders.
	
	
	Clearly if the Applicant’s alleged conduct was to occur in the future, the impact would be significant on a victim, either a child or adult victim.
	


(j) Any information given by the Applicant in, or in relation to, the application


	
	The Applicant seeks a clearance to enable him to resume work as a bus driver.
	
	
	The Applicant did not give oral evidence at the hearing. He has consistently denied the allegations which formed the basis of the 1992 criminal prosecution, broadly denying the allegations and relying on his acquittal in those proceedings. He provided two statutory declarations to the Respondent as part of the WWCC assessment process. The first dated 3 May 2015 states that he has always acted appropriately and professionally towards passengers and co-workers during the course of his employment.
	
	
	The second statutory declaration dated 16 May 2015 addresses the 2003 and 2005 alleged domestic violence incidents. The Applicant states that he and his wife had a verbal argument on these two occasions over minor issues. He says he has never been physically abusive to his wife or made her feel unsafe. He says in the past he used to speak loudly and say things to his wife out of anger. However he said since 2005 he and his wife now communicate properly and “speak calmly to each other.” He says they now discuss things if there is a problem.
	
	
	The applicant provided written confirmation of his employment for nearly 30 years as a bus driver. He relied upon a positive reference from his current employer at […] who says he has known the Applicant for 17 years and has supervised him in child related employment. This referee states the Applicant has “no problems with either adults or children.” It is not clear on the face of the reference if the referee was aware of the 1992 charges against the Applicant. It is clear that he was aware the reference was being provided as part of a risk assessment process to determine the Applicant’s suitability for child-related employment.
	


(k) Any other matters that the Children’s Guardian considers necessary


	
	The Respondent opposes the application. The Respondent says a relevant consideration is that the trigger offence is alleged to have occurred in the same workplace for which the Applicant now seeks the WWCC clearance.
	
	
	The Respondent says that that the Applicant has not provided any evidence of workplace education or policy that might mitigate the risk posed by the Applicant or employees generally. Instead the Respondent says the Applicant’s submissions through his legal representative focused on his acquittal. The Respondent correctly submits that an acquittal is not sufficient answer to the question of risk. The Respondent says the decision by the Applicant not to give evidence is of concern and must raise issues of his credit.
	
	
	The lack of acknowledgement of any wrongdoing by the Applicant of how he dealt with the complainant, even on the Applicant’s version of events, shows a lack of insight by the Applicant into his own behaviour and is, the Respondent submits, a matter of some concern.
	


Consideration


	
	In this matter, the role of the Tribunal is to review the decision of the Children’s Guardian to refuse the Applicant a WWCC clearance, and to decide what is the correct and preferable decision, having regard to the material before it, including any relevant factual material and any applicable law.
	
	
	There is no presumption in proceedings under section 27 of the Act that the applicant poses a risk to children as there would be if the applicant were a disqualified person seeking an enabling order: cf. section 28(7) of the Act.
	
	
	The applicable law includes the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act, which provides that the safety, welfare and wellbeing of children and, in particular, protecting them from child abuse, is the paramount consideration. Importantly, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is protective and not punitive in nature. In this matter, the Tribunal is tasked with determining whether, on the balance of probabilities, the Applicant poses a risk to the safety of children.
	
	
	Relevantly, a WWCC clearance must be granted to the Applicant unless the Tribunal is satisfied that the Applicant poses a risk to the safety of children. It has previously been held by this Tribunal that no conditions may be placed on the issue of a WWCC clearance.
	
	
	As set out above the Tribunal is unable to make a positive finding that the alleged sexual assault by the applicant in 1992 either occurred or did not occur. It therefore remains open as to whether or not it did. In Office of the Children’s Guardian v CFW [2016] NSWSC 1406, Harrison J found that the Tribunal failed properly to have regard to or to assess those matters that it considered to be “open”. At para 30 his Honour stated
	


There is nothing in the Tribunal’s reasons to indicate that it approached it’s task in the manner identified in these authorities. Its “open conclusion” suggests that there remained at least some degree of suspicion or doubt as to whether the defendant had engaged in criminal or “inappropriate conduct”. That open conclusion necessarily called for a close analysis of those possibilities and the probative value of the doubts or suspicions that seemingly remained, having regard to the fundamental inquiry about whether the defendant posed a risk to the safety of children.


	
	In this matter the Tribunal has given due consideration to the probative value of these doubts and suspicions that remain. The Tribunal finds that on the applicant’s version of the 1992 incident there are concerns raised by his behaviour. His decision to drop an 11 year old girl, who was a passenger on a bus he was driving, very late at night on her own, speaks of a serious lack of judgment and insight on his part.
	
	
	There is some support for the complainant’s version of events as set earlier in these reasons. However, the behaviour is not part of a pattern of ongoing events, is not recent, and the length of time since the alleged events together with the process of being charged and tried has allowed sufficient time for the applicant to reflect upon his behaviour.
	
	
	The behaviour, if repeated, would be more likely than not to do significant harm and the consequences are likely to be serious to children. The paramount principle under the Act includes protection of children from abuse and suffering emotional or psychological harm of such a kind that the emotional or intellectual development of the child or young person is, or is likely to be, significantly damaged.
	
	
	Recurrence of the concerning behaviour has not happened over a significant period. It has been over 24 years since the sexual offence alleged to have been committed by the Applicant occurred. It has been over 10 years since the last alleged event of domestic violence by the Applicant. The Tribunal noted the Applicant's long employment history as a bus driver, described in paragraph 83 above. It noted that there appears to be no other records alleging inappropriate behaviour or alleged sexual assault.
	
	
	Regardless of whether the complainant’s allegations of sexual assault are true or instead the Applicant’s version of events as given to the Police in his record of interview is accepted, it is likely that being charged and tried was a very humiliating experience. If such a personal deterrent were needed, the experience would operate very powerfully as one. When there is no further evidence or intelligence of further involvement in alleged criminal activity on the part of an individual this suggests that either their original claims of innocence were correct or that they have learned from experience and changed their behaviour to a more socially acceptable mode. Either way, it appears to the Tribunal that this factor weighs in the Applicant’s favour.
	
	
	The Tribunal considers that the expert evidence of Dr Allnutt that the Applicant is of low risk to children is not out-weighed by other evidence suggesting the risk is more than low.
	
	
	Having considered all the evidence before it, the Tribunal is not satisfied that there is a likelihood of the applicant engaging in any sexual misconduct or any offending behaviour.
	


Conclusion


	
	The Tribunal has considered all of the matters in s.30 (1) of the Child Protection (Working with Children) Act. The available evidence establishes on the balance of probabilities that there is no real and appreciable risk of harm to children posed by the Applicant. The Tribunal is satisfied the Applicant does not pose a real or appreciable risk to children, and the correct and preferable decision is to grant the Applicant a WWCC clearance.
	


ORDERS


	
	Accordingly, the Orders of the Tribunal are as follows:
	



	
	The decision of the Children’s Guardian dated 23 November 2015 to refuse the Applicant’s Working with Children Check clearance is set aside.
	
	
	In substitution for that decision, the following decision is made: The Applicant is granted a Working with Children Check clearance.

3006501,R v Crumpton [2016] NSWCCA 261,"Judgment


	
	BEAZLEY P:      I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons of Davies J. I agree with his Honour’s reasons and proposed orders.
	
	
	DAVIES J:    The Respondent was charged with manslaughter and in the alternative two counts as follows:
	


Count 2:   Operate aircraft in manner reckless as to endanger life, the maximum penalty for which is 5 years’ imprisonment;

Count 3:   Operate aircraft in manner reckless as to endanger person, the maximum penalty for which is 2 years’ imprisonment.


	
	The Respondent pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was tried before his Honour Judge North SC and a jury. The jury returned a not guilty verdict for manslaughter but guilty on each of the alternative charges.
	
	
	On 28 April 2016 he was sentenced by Judge North as follows:
	


Count 2:   15 months’ imprisonment;

Count 3:   9 months’ imprisonment to be served concurrently with the sentence on count 2.

He was ordered to be released forthwith pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) upon entering a recognizance in the sum of $1000 to be of good behaviour for three years.


	
	The Crown now appeals pursuant to s 5D Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the basis that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Subsequently the Crown filed additional grounds of appeal upon which it relies as follows:
	


Ground 1:   His Honour erred in his approach in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences.

Ground 2:   His Honour erred in his approach to considerations of general deterrence, leading to the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.

Ground 3:   His Honour erred in directing that the sentences be wholly suspended leading, to the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.

Ground 4:   His Honour erred in ordering full concurrency of the sentences leading to the imposition of a sentence that was manifestly inadequate.

Ground 5:   The sentence was manifestly inadequate

Facts


	
	The facts are conveniently summarised in the Crown’s submissions on the appeal.
	
	
	At about 7.20am on Saturday 12 April 2014, the Respondent attended Casino Airport with the intention of flying his plane (a Maule aircraft registered VH-HOG) for the day to see his son at Bonshaw. He first flew to Lismore airport where he refuelled. Prior to leaving Lismore Airport the Respondent arranged for his friend David Whitten and his daughter Kayla Whitten aged 11 years to come along for the flight. The Respondent flew from Lismore to Murwillumbah airport where he picked up David and Kayla Whitten. From Murwillumbah they started to fly towards Bonshaw. However, due to adverse weather conditions, the Respondent decided to land at Tenterfield airport. At Tenterfield airport, the Respondent made a decision not to fly onto Bonshaw but to fly back to Murwillumbah. It was while flying back to Murwillumbah that the Respondent flew along the Clarence River.
	
	
	At about 11am, whilst flying low over the river at about 16 to 25 metres, the plane hit power cables. This resulted in the plane stalling, and crashing into the river upside down.
	
	
	While the plane was upside down in the river the Respondent and Mr Whitten managed to free themselves and then made several attempts to remove Kayla from the plane. Kayla was eventually removed from the plane and they placed her on the upturned fuselage where Mr Whitten commenced CPR before deciding to take her to shore. When they got Kayla to shore, the Respondent went and raised the alarm while Mr Whitten remained with Kayla still performing CPR until the arrival of emergency services.
	
	
	The Respondent made his way to a house on Ewingar Road and spoke with the occupants who assisted in notifying emergency services. They arrived at about 1.30pm. However, nothing could be done to save Kayla. A post mortem examination conducted on 23 May 2014 disclosed that Kayla had died from a cervical spine injury and not drowning.
	
	
	On 15 April 2014, Police recovered aircraft VH-HOG from the Clarence River. The initial inspection of the aircraft revealed marks on the wings indicative of the wings striking the power lines that crossed the Clarence River.
	
	
	Mr Whitten sustained a number of injuries and underwent surgery at Lismore Base Hospital in respect of lacerations to his right forearm and left finger. He had burning from fuel to his torso, legs, back and arms. He had a crush fracture to the vertebrae. After he was discharged, he noticed some pain he had been experiencing in his right shoulder joint and he was later diagnosed with a fracture of his shoulder. Mr Whitten has continued to experience severe back pain as a result of the injury to his spine.
	


Evidence of low-level flying


	
	The evidence at trial as to the manner of flying by the Respondent was given by Mr Whitten and Mrs Meryl Ellaby who resided on a property on Ewingar Road near the location of the crash. The Respondent did not give evidence at trial but the police records of interview conducted with him on the evening of the accident on 12 April 2014 and later on 23 April 2014 were in evidence.
	
	
	Mr Whitten said that as they were flying along the river they were getting lower and he thought the plane got to about tree level. They were flying in a straight part of the river and there were birds on the river flying up. It seemed as if the birds were metres away from the plane as they flew up. (The Respondent’s account in his records of interview was that the birds were undisturbed. The Sentencing Judge could not reach a view about which evidence in that regard should be accepted. However, the matter is of minimal importance for present purposes.)
	
	
	Mr Whitten said that they were flying the course of the river taking lots of tight bends and turning the plane at right angles to go round corners and follow the contour of the river. He said as they were flying along, the lower they were going. He remembered the Respondent taking a sharp left hand turn and the wing tip seemed like it was only metres off the water. Mr Whitten turned to check on Kayla and at the same time the plane seemed to be gaining a bit of height. When it came down again Mr Whitten was still looking at his daughter. He heard a noise and turned around and saw a flash of blue sky and then there was darkness and water hitting him in the face.
	
	
	Mrs Ellaby's evidence was that sometime around 10.48am on 12 April 2014, she was standing on the veranda of her house in Ewingar overlooking the Clarence River. She heard a plane approaching her property from the south and she then saw a plane, flying along the Clarence River at about 20 to 30 feet above the water. She then went back inside and she thought about five to eight minutes later her power went off.
	
	
	In his record of interview of 12 April 2014 the Respondent estimated he was flying between 50 to 100 feet as he flew along the river. He said ""I couldn't have been any lower"". He stated he was aware that the restriction on flying over land and over villages was 1500 feet, and 500 feet over water but he did not know what the restriction was in unpopulated areas.
	
	
	The Respondent said that he suggested that they fly along the Clarence River for a bit and that Mr Whitten was keen because they had talked about it previously. The Respondent had flown in that area before. He said he knew an area that was clear of wire so he flew south along the Clarence double checking for maybe five miles north of Baryulgil. He flew down low on the water and was flying along the river. He came up where the river became too winding and too sharp and just flew over the land and meandered back down. He went around the corner and the wires just jumped out in front of him. He thought the wire caught underneath or the wing or the rudder. He stated the cables sent the plane upwards and into a stall, they spun into the water and they ended up in the water upside down.
	
	
	In the interview with police on 23 April 2014 the Respondent stated that he headed towards the Clarence River flying at between 800 to 1000 feet. He flew the plane down to a part of the river that he had flown before and made a decision to fly along the contours of the river. It was just above the treetop height he guessed on a flat part of the river. He said that he couldn't have been any lower. He remembered seeing birds on the water and they weren't disturbed. They flew north following the contours for another two kilometres and then climbed to a couple of hundred feet.
	
	
	The river made a sharp turn so he left the river and went up and he saw ahead how the river did a slight bend and then pointed straight towards Tabulam. He started to let down again. The trees on the western side were higher than the eastern side and he started to descend and got down to tree height or a bit below tree height on the hill side. As he looked up the river he just started descending slowly and then he caught two lines in the cockpit. The Respondent's instinct was to push forward on the control column and he remembered the aircraft’s nose rising rapidly. The Respondent remembered the motor over-revving and saw the stall light activate on the instrument panel. He pushed forward again on the control column and he remembered the right wing dropping and then he remembered a violent impact.
	
	
	The Respondent was asked how many feet he was flying off the water and he said, ""I couldn't tell you how, exactly how many feet, I was flying off the water. I know it was around treetop height...between fifty and a hundred and fifty feet, just depends how high the trees are.""
	
	
	The Respondent had flown the area before once with his wife and son when they flew down to Grafton and another time on his own and that was when he started looking for wires trying to find an area of water that was safe to get down to treetop level. He had flown that area before when he went looking but he didn't see the wires then. When he flew in down from the south and when he came in from the west on the day of the accident he was checking for orange balls, any indication of wires.
	
	
	The Respondent was asked about visibility and he said it was quite clear for approximately 10 kilometres. When asked if he was aware of the flying heights or regulations applying to rural areas the Respondent replied, ""I've flown over water often and I know its five hundred feet. I've flown over villages and I know its fifteen hundred feet. And I know now that it's five hundred feet over anywhere"". When asked, ""Is that something that you would have learnt on the way to earning your licence and in obtaining your flying licence is that something that you would have been taught or discussed?” The Respondent replied ""Yeah, probably."" He had flown that low before when he was out on his own and that was at treetop height. He said he had flown that height once before but not at that exact spot but a bit further down.
	
	
	When asked for his opinion on how VH-HOG ended up submerged in the Clarence River, the Respondent said, ""Bad judgement (sic)."" When asked, ""What do you mean by bad judgement (sic)?"" the Respondent replied, ""Ah, bad judgement (sic) by me as a pilot."" He said, ""I assume (sic) there were no obstacles because I thought I checked well enough. It was bad judgement (sic) to fly low. Ah, at, at that area or in the area. It was bad decisions. (sic)""
	


Subjective features


	
	The Respondent was aged 53 years at the date of the offences. He did not give evidence at the trial or at the sentence proceedings. At the time of the offences the Respondent had been flying for two years and had about 250 hours flying time in the VH-HOG plane involved in the offences and about 300 hours in gliders and motor gliders.
	
	
	At the trial the defence called a character witness, Lisa Sandstrom who had known the Respondent for 20 years. She had met him through the Respondent’s wife who was one of her closest friends. In his Remarks on Sentence (ROS) the Sentencing Judge described her evidence as genuine and compelling in her description of the Respondent’s good character, and the Sentencing Judge said the Respondent had lived a hardworking and law abiding life. The Sentencing Judge said that it was clear the Respondent had given a great deal to his local community over many years.
	
	
	There were 20 references from people who had known the Respondent and the Sentencing Judge said that those people spoke “glowingly of the character, hard work and social conscience” of the Respondent. The Sentencing Judge noted, however, that the Respondent had a serious driving matter in 2007. That was for an offence for driving a motorcycle recklessly/furiously or in a speed or manner dangerous. He had been clocked on radar at 142-150kph in a 80kph speed zone. In travelling at that speed he admitted to overtaking a number of vehicles on the incorrect side of the road by crossing a double unbroken lane line.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence Report disclosed that the Respondent was a qualified tradesman, was employed as a small engine mechanic in Mullumbimby and had been in that employment for over 12 years. He was also self-employed as a cattle breeder on a casual basis.
	
	
	The Pre-Sentence report noted that the Respondent expressed remorse for the offence and was emotional throughout the interview process. He said that his life would never be the same, nor would it be for the victim's family.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge had a psychological report from Ms Catriona McCornish who had been treating the Respondent since 2 June 2014. He had been referred to Ms McComish by his General Practitioner. She diagnosed him both from her own assessment and from administering two tests as suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. At the time of this report she had seen him for eight sessions with two further sessions to be completed.
	
	
	She reported that he had responded well to the psychotherapy. He had been able to reduce the intrusion of flashbacks, his sleep had improved and much of the time he was able to employ rational thoughts to counter the despair and hopelessness that he felt. He had returned to work, was more comfortable socially and had been able to accept the support of his family and close friends.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge accepted his remorse and contrition which he said was demonstrated immediately by the efforts he made to assist in the recovery of Kayla's body from the plane and then walking some four kilometres or so to find help notwithstanding the injuries he had sustained in the accident. The Sentencing Judge also noted that he had made a payment of some $300,000 to Mr Whitten despite the fact that he was being sued by him for nervous shock.
	


Grounds of appeal

Ground 1: Objective seriousness

Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the Sentencing Judge made no specific finding as to the level of objective seriousness. At one point (ROS at 9.8) his Honour said that he did not accept that the Respondent's conduct was of low moral culpability and at the lower end of objective seriousness. The Crown also drew attention to another passage (ROS at 7.2) where his Honour said in assessing objective seriousness it was necessary to take account of the maximum penalties, and his Honour observed that those were not substantial maximum sentences in the context of the range of penalties available under both Commonwealth and State criminal legislation. The Crown submitted that maximum penalties of these and other offences had no bearing on the objective offending in any particular case. The Crown pointed to a number of matters which indicated the offending was at a very high level of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Respondent submitted that his Honour did not have regard to the maximum penalties when assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. Somewhat inconsistently the Respondent then submitted that the purposes for which his Honour had regard to the maximum penalty were threefold and explicitly noted, that his Honour's approach was consistent with the process of instinctive synthesis, and the maximum penalties were one of many factors that his Honour identified as going to the appropriate sentence in all the circumstances. The Respondent submitted that his Honour had proper regard to the facts consistent with the jury verdict when assessing objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Respondent acknowledged that his Honour did not make a specific finding regarding objective seriousness but said that he rejected the Respondent’s submission that the conduct was of low moral culpability and at the lower end of objective seriousness whilst not finding that the Respondent’s conduct fell at the very high level of objective seriousness.
	
	
	The Respondent submitted that the matter could be clearly distinguished from the worst case scenario as it did not involve an overt act of dangerousness.
	


Consideration


	
	The Sentencing Judge made the following findings relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness:
	


(a)   His Honour found that the Respondent clearly knew that he should not be at a height of between 50 and 100 feet and as a pilot he was not only placing his passengers in danger but himself;

(b)   The evidence established that low flying particularly at the very low level the Respondent was flying was unsafe and that the specific risks involved in low flying were striking power lines that were difficult to see as well as bird strikes;

(c)   The Respondent mistakenly thought that there were either no power lines or, if there were, they would be marked;

(d)   The Respondent was conscious and aware of the risk to life and limb;

(e)   In coming to a decision on the objective seriousness of the offences it was necessary to take into account the maximum sentences. The maximum penalties were not substantial maximum sentences in the context of the range of penalties available under Commonwealth and State criminal legislation;

(f)   His Honour did not accept that the Respondent’s conduct was of low moral culpability and at the lower end of objective seriousness;

(g)   The level of recklessness fell between that proposed by the Crown and that proposed by the Respondent which meant that only a sentence of imprisonment in each case would suffice;

(h)   Finally, his Honour said this when deciding to impose a suspended sentence (ROS 17.2):

In this regard I have come to the conclusion that due to my findings concerning the objective seriousness of the offences, including all the s 16A factors and general deterrence and the very powerful subjective case, that this is such a case [for a suspended sentence].


	
	Nowhere did his Honour express his conclusion as to the objective seriousness of the offending. The only inference that can be drawn, particularly in the light of (f) and (g) above is that his Honour considered it in the mid-range but, in the light of his Honour’s suspending of the sentences, perhaps on the lower side of the mid-range.
	
	
	Both the written and oral submissions of the Crown at the sentence proceedings focused on the degree of recklessness involved in the offence. Of course that was a matter that needed to be considered by the Sentencing Judge because of the elements of the offences charged. To some extent there might be thought to be an elision of the two matters in the ROS but it seems clear enough both from his Honour’s remarks during the sentence proceedings and in the ROS that his Honour understood the need to assess objective seriousness which had to be distinguished from recklessness by reason of the death and injury which in fact occurred and might be regarded as aggravating factors of the offences. The Sentencing Judge was aware of the need to assess objective seriousness regardless of that concentration on recklessness involved in the offending. I do not consider that the approach of the Crown at the sentence proceedings means that error has not been established in relation to this ground.
	
	
	Even if it is accepted that the Sentencing Judge’s ultimate assessment of objective seriousness was in the mid-range that conclusion is infected with error because his Honour took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely, that the maximum penalties for the offences under consideration were not substantial when sentences for all criminal offences were considered. An assessment of objective seriousness concerns the offence charged and the maximum penalty for that offence has no influence on the determination of its objective seriousness. The maximum penalty becomes relevant only when all matters within the instinctive synthesis are considered.
	
	
	In my view, error has been established in relation to this ground.
	


Ground 2:   General deterrence

Submissions


	
	The Crown pointed to a statement by the Sentencing Judge (at ROS 15.5) where his Honour said:
	


Here I have found that general deterrence must be kept in mind but not that it is of particular importance given the overall circumstances of the matter.


	
	The Crown submitted that there was a significant body of evidence before the Sentencing Judge that low flying was a highly dangerous activity and of the high prevalence of wire strike aviation accidents.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that a pilot’s licence like a driver’s licence confers an extremely high level of responsibility on a person, that the privileges it confers must be exercised with the utmost caution, and given the extremely high risk of injury or death inherent in low flying, general deterrence was a matter of very great importance. The Crown submitted that an appropriate analogy was the approach taken by courts to general deterrence in culpable driving cases where it is considered of paramount importance. The Crown submitted that there was nothing about the Respondent’s subjective case that made him a poor vehicle for considerations of general deterrence.
	
	
	The Respondent submitted that general deterrence was not of particular importance in the matter. He submitted that the analogy between aviation and motor vehicle offences was not put before the Sentencing Judge and amounts now to a reformulation of the Crown case. In any event, the Respondent submitted, it is not appropriate to draw such an analogy as aviation matters do not attract the same public policy consideration because:
	


(a)   the risks are incommensurate;

(b)   the rates of fatalities are incommensurate; and

(c)   the maximum penalties are incommensurate.

The Respondent submitted that the Sentencing Judge referred to and considered general deterrence as a relevant principle in sentencing and factored it into his Remarks.


	
	Despite the Respondent’s submission that it was inappropriate to draw an analogy with motor vehicle accidents, the Respondent sought to read an affidavit which annexed data, obtained from the internet, for air deaths, air accidents and motor vehicle deaths for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. The information was sought to be relied upon in relation to the question of general deterrence and in answer to the Crown’s submission about the need to send a message to the wider community.
	


Consideration


	
	After hearing argument on the admissibility of the affidavit during the hearing of the appeal the Court rejected the affidavit with reasons to be provided. What follows are the reasons for rejecting the evidence.
	
	
	The Respondent accepted that the material was available at the time of the sentence hearings. However, the Respondent submitted that it ought to be admitted in the interests of fairness, that it would assist the Court and there was no prejudice to the Crown. The Respondent submitted that the evidence put air accidents and motor vehicle accidents into context.
	
	
	The evidence is plainly not fresh evidence. The general rule in criminal matters relating to the adducing of further evidence is that before the evidence will be received it must be shown that the sentencing of the Applicant, in the absence of that evidence, resulted in a miscarriage of justice with the result that an unjust sentence is permitted to stand: R v McIntee (1985) 38 SASR 432 at 435; Gallagher v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 392 at 395. I discussed the authorities in this area in Colomer v R [2014] NSWCCA 51 at [47] – [50] (Fullerton J agreeing).
	
	
	The High Court has recently reaffirmed the principle in Betts v The Queen [2016] HCA 25; (2016) 90 ALJR 758 where the joint judgment said:
	


[2]   As a general rule, the appellate court's assessment of whether some other sentence is warranted in law is made on the material before the sentencing court and any relevant evidence of the offender's progress towards rehabilitation in the period since the sentence hearing. For the purposes of that assessment, an offender is not permitted to run a new and different case. This general rule does not deny that an appellate court has the flexibility to receive new evidence where it is necessary to do so in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. In this appeal, the general rule applied because the new evidence sought to be adduced by the appellant was inconsistent with the case that he ran in the sentencing court and its rejection in the circumstances did not cause justice to miscarry.

…

[14]   Forensic choices are made in the conduct of the offender's case at the sentence hearing. These include the material that is to be relied upon in mitigation of penalty and whether any of the facts are to be contested. The circumstance that the sentencing judge's discretion is vitiated by House error does not, without more, provide a reason for not holding the offender to these forensic choices. Justice does not miscarry by reason of the refusal to allow an appellant to run a new and different case on the question of re-sentence. Exceptional cases apart, the question of whether some other sentence is warranted in law is answered by consideration of the material that was before the sentencing court and any relevant evidence of post-sentence conduct.


	
	It is not suggested that there was any miscarriage of justice, particularly as the Respondent embraces the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge. There is no doubt that general deterrence was a significant issue at the sentence hearing. The real point of the evidence seemed to be to show how few aircraft accidents (and, seemingly, how few flying offences) there are compared to motor vehicle accidents and offending. Evidence is scarcely necessary in that regard. Most people in the community, including judges, would know that the numbers in each case are not comparable.
	
	
	No basis has been shown for the evidence to be admitted.
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge made the following references to general deterrence. He said (at ROS 9.3):
	


The fact that the risks of endangerment contemplated by the section eventuated is relevant to the assessment of the degree of recklessness involved; it is relevant to general deterrence; and to the fact that the offender was conscious and aware of the risk to life and limb.


	
	His Honour said (at ROS 9.8):
	


However, I do not find, given the fact that I accept that the offender genuinely thought that it was safe and expected to be able to see any wires, if indeed wires existed, that too great an accent on general deterrence is merited in this case. General deterrence remains as the ramifications of this awful day no doubt continue to affect all concerned. It is true that mistakes made whilst flying planes can more often than not result in death or serious injury. Consequently I have kept in mind s 16A(d) and (e) regarding the personal circumstances of any victims of the offences and any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offences.

I also take into account that low flying such as this should be seen to be discouraged by the Courts as death and serious injury can so easily result.


	
	His Honour said (ROS 15.3):
	


Here I have found that general deterrence must be kept in mind but not that it is of particular importance given the overall circumstances of the matter.


	
	Finally, his Honour made reference to a Victorian County Court case of R v Timothy Shamus James (County Court Victoria, Judge Hicks, Unreported, 21 October 2004) and said (ROS 15.8):
	


Indeed on the vexed question in this matter of general deterrence at para 62 it states:

In my view principles of denunciation and general deterrence have their application in this sentencing exercise. Operators of aircraft must be deterred from operating their aircraft in a reckless manner which may endanger the life of another person, or, at the very least, the property of another person.

However, having then quoted some further passages from that case his Honour appears to have considered it only in terms of whether it was a comparable case for sentence purposes.


	
	In my opinion, it is evident from these passages that his Honour appears largely to have confused general deterrence with specific deterrence. The only statement that clearly relates to the matter of general deterrence is his Honour’s statement that low flying should be seen to be discouraged by the Courts.
	
	
	Ordinarily, if it is apparent that the Sentencing Judge has taken a matter such as general deterrence into account, the weight that is given to the matter is one for the Sentencing Judge and this Court would be slow to interfere. The difficulty in the present case is that although his Honour speaks of general deterrence the context of his references to it indicates that he is in fact dealing with specific deterrence. In that way there is doubt about whether general deterrence was truly factored into the instinctive synthesis although his Honour said he had done so, at least when he was suspending the sentence.
	
	
	In my opinion, general deterrence is a significant matter where an offence is committed in relation to the flying of an aircraft. Unlike drivers of motor vehicles who make up most of the adult population, pilots of aircraft are a small group in society. Contrary to the submission of the Respondent when seeking to adduce the further evidence, the smaller rather than the larger group is more likely to be deterred from offending. Aircraft accidents in this country are relatively rare because of the high standard of training and regulation. Fatalities from aircraft accidents are even rarer. It may be accepted, however, that the likelihood of death and serious injury is far greater as a result of reckless flying than from reckless driving. It can reasonably be expected that those who pilot aircraft, particularly non-commercial aircraft, would know of that greater risk. Such persons are also likely to be very aware of accidents involving aircraft and particularly those that have involved fatalities.
	
	
	Punishment of those who commit offences involving flying aircraft is calculated to come to the attention of the relatively small group of persons involved in doing so in the community. Analogy in that regard with the effect of general deterrence on white collar crime is not misplaced for some of the reasons that have been offered in cases such as insider trading and associated market offences: DPP (Cth) v Gregory (2011) 34 VR 1; [2011] VSCA 145 at [53].
	
	
	In my opinion, error has been established.
	


Ground 3:   Suspended sentence

Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that authorities such as R v McKay [2007] NSWSC 275; 2007) 61 ACSR 470 and R v Saleh [2015] NSWCCA 299 show that the imposition of a suspended sentence undermines its general deterrent effect.
	
	
	The Respondent drew attention to what was said in Zaky v R [2015] NSWCCA 161 at [29]-[30] and R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [32] that a suspended sentence remains a gaol sentence and can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent to both the general public and the particular offender.
	
	
	The Respondent submitted that the imposition of a suspended sentence was a sufficient form of deterrence in the light of his Honour’s findings and it allowed for the ongoing rehabilitation of the Respondent.
	


Consideration


	
	It must be acknowledged that there is some tension within the authorities about whether a suspended sentence operates as a deterrence and to what extent. In Zaky Hamill J (with whom Johnson and Davies JJ agreed) made reference at [30] – [36] to some of the cases which suggest that a suspended sentence can be a sufficiently severe form of punishment to act as a deterrent in both senses of the term. On the other hand, in Saleh R S Hulme AJ (with whom Johnson and Beech-Jones JJ agreed) made reference to a number of cases at [40] - [43] which suggest that the real bite of general deterrence only occurs when an actual custodial sentence is imposed.
	
	
	It is not necessary to resolve this conflict when determining the outcome in the present matter. It may be accepted that in certain cases a suspended sentence can amount to real punishment and that it does not in all cases undermine the significance of general deterrence. In the present case the issue of the suspended sentence is only one consideration in the synthesis of whether the sentence is manifestly inadequate. A further aspect of that consideration is whether a suspended sentence sits comfortably with general deterrence given the significance of general deterrence in the present matter.
	
	
	There is no error of principle established by this ground.
	


Ground 4:   Concurrency

Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that the fact that multiple offences arise from one criminal act is not determinative of the question whether sentences should be ordered to be served fully concurrently. The Crown submitted that it is well established in driving cases that where there are multiple victims of one criminal act separate sentences should usually be fixed which are made partly concurrent and partly cumulative with the aggregate of the sentences reflecting the fact that there are multiple victims. Reference was made to Regina v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288; 44 MVR 328; TG v R [2010] NSWCCA 28; 55 MVR 180 and Richards v R [2006] NSWCCA 262; 46 MVR 165.
	
	
	The Respondent drew attention to what was said in Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] and submitted that the Sentencing Judge was entitled to conclude that the sentences should be concurrent because the offences shared the following commonalities:
	


(a)   They were presented on the same indictment;

(b)   They arose as a result of the same incident;

(c)   They arose as a result of a single episode of recklessness or criminality; and

(d)   They contain extremely similar elements.

Consideration


	
	In relation to concurrency his Honour said this (at ROS 16.5):
	


This was one course of flying which resulted in the death of Kayla Whitten and injury to her father. However, taking into account the principles of totality I do find that this being a single episode of criminality with common factors it is more likely the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both and I therefore intend to impose concurrent sentences.


	
	The offences for which the Respondent was convicted do not involve any element of injury or death to any person. The offences are committed when the manner of operating the aircraft is found to be reckless as to endanger a person or to endanger life. Accordingly, if injury or death is occasioned as a result of the offending that injury or death is an aggravating factor. In offences where injury or death is an element of the offence (ordinarily dangerous or culpable driving offences) it has been held that it is an error for sentences to be made entirely concurrent where injury or death has been caused to more than one person: TG at [32] and Richards at [78].
	
	
	This Court has recently affirmed in Silvestri v R [2016] NSWCCA 245 at [50] – [51] the approach taken by Hunt AJA in R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288. That was a case involving two counts of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm arising out of the same accident. Hunt AJA considered cases in which one incident gives rise to different charges with different victims. The second sub-category was where one action by the offender causes a number of people to be injured and where separate charges are laid in respect of each victim. Hunt AJA then said at [23]:
	


In a case falling within the second sub-category, separate sentences should usually be fixed which are made partly concurrent and partly cumulative, each such sentence being appropriate to the existence of only one victim and the aggregate of the sentences reflecting the fact that there are multiple victims resulting from the same action by the offender. The extent to which there should be an overlap in the partial accumulation will depend on what is required to represent the totality of the criminality involved in the one act of the offender.


	
	As noted, the Respondent relied on what was said in Cahyadi. Cahyadi outlined general principles dealing with concurrency and accumulation. What has been said in cases such as TG, Richards and Janceski is a particular application of that principle in situations entirely analogous with the present. The fact that the injury or death which occurred is not an element of the offence but should be regarded as an aggravating factor points more strongly to the need for some accumulation. The obligation on the Sentencing Judge to take into account paragraphs (d), (e) and (ea) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) points in the same direction. 
	
	
	The Sentencing Judge was, therefore, in error in saying that it was more likely that the sentence for one of the offences would reflect the criminality of both.
	


Ground 5:   Sentence manifestly inadequate

Submissions


	
	The Crown submitted that an offender’s subjective circumstances should not be allowed to overshadow the objective seriousness of the offences nor the need for a sentence to reflect general deterrence and denunciation. The Crown submitted that the level of recklessness and moral culpability was extremely high and that the consequences of that recklessness could not be more serious on count 2 and were very serious in relation to count 3. The sentences were plainly unjust and were indicative of error under the final category in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499; [1936] HCA 40 at 506.
	


Consideration


	
	The errors involving the assessment of the level of objective seriousness, the downplaying of general deterrence and the entire concurrency of the sentences demonstrates without more that the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate.
	


Residual discretion


	
	The Crown submitted that both error and manifest inadequacy were established. Whilst the primary purpose of a Crown appeal against sentence, being the expression of principles for the governance and guidance of sentencing courts, the mere statement of those principles in the present case would not satisfy the interests of justice. This was not a case where the Respondent’s subjective case was of such strength as to require such a significant amelioration of the punitive and deterrent elements which are important in sentencing for reckless flying offences. Here, the inadequacy in the sentence risked undermining public confidence in the criminal justice system. Further, the exercise of residual discretion would not give effect to the need for general deterrence.
	
	
	The Respondent submitted that there were a number of reasons why the residual discretion should be exercised in his favour. First, the Respondent submitted that when the Sentencing Judge asked at the end of his Remarks on Sentence if there was anything the Crown wished to comment on, it was open to the Crown to submit that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Secondly, the Respondent pointed to the lodgement of the Crown’s appeal 41 days after the sentence. Thirdly, the Respondent submitted that the fact that a non-custodial sentence had been imposed was a significant factor in the exercise of the residual discretion. Finally, the Respondent pointed to his substantial progress towards rehabilitation.
	


Consideration


	
	In my opinion the residual discretion should not be exercised in favour of the Respondent. A number of errors have been identified and manifest inadequacy has been established. As Harrison J said (Leeming JA and Johnson J agreeing) in R v Mulligan [2016] NSWCCA 47 at [48]:
	


It is difficult to accept that general community standards would sit comfortably with a decision that confirmed the appropriateness of the original sentence.


	
	There is an additional factor present. Perhaps because of the infrequency with which offences of this nature come before the Courts there is virtually no authority to guide a sentencing judge in the fixing of an appropriate sentence for these offences. When that is considered with the significance of the matter of general deterrence it would be inappropriate to exercise the residual discretion in the Respondent’s favour.
	
	
	Any delay (which was minimal) by the Crown in lodging the appeal is not such as to enliven the residual discretion.
	
	
	The suggestion by the Respondent that, once the sentence had been imposed, the Crown ought to have submitted that the sentence was manifestly inadequate should be rejected. Submissions had been made by both parties prior to the sentence being pronounced. The Crown had drawn attention to authorities which said that a suspended sentence was inappropriate where general deterrence is of particular importance, as the Crown had submitted it was. In that way the prosecutor had fulfilled the obligation discussed in CMB v Attorney-General for New South Wales [2015] HCA 9 at [64]. It would have been entirely inappropriate for the prosecutor to suggest after the sentence had been pronounced that the Sentencing Judge should re-visit that sentence because the Crown considered it inadequate. There must be a serious doubt that his Honour had the power at that stage to do other than correct slips in the sentence pronounced.
	
	
	It is not clear what the Respondent’s submission concerning substantial progress towards rehabilitation means. This is not a case of an offender with some form of addiction which led to the offending. What the evidence discloses, although it does not come directly from the Respondent, is that he has been badly psychologically affected by what happened but the treatment he has received is assisting his recovery in that regard, and that, in any event, he is and has from the outset been extremely remorseful for what he did.
	
	
	It may be accepted that the fact that no actual custodial sentence was imposed is a consideration in relation to the residual discretion but it is relevant more particularly to the re-sentence that is to be imposed.
	


Re-sentence


	
	As at the sentence proceedings, there was no evidence from the Respondent put forward at the hearing of the appeal. Instead two affidavits by his solicitor were read each attaching a report, one from Dr Jan Siefken, a psychiatrist and a further report from Catriona McComish, the psychologist.
	
	
	Dr Siefken reports that the Respondent presented as an exhausted, fragmented and broken man. He was plagued by numerous biological and psychological features of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Whilst the Respondent described numerous tragic events during his life, the plane accident remained his current source of great suffering.
	
	
	The psychiatrist noted that he was consuming increasing amounts of alcohol. The psychiatrist noted a strong history of trans-generational trauma with both his father and son being exposed to high levels of war trauma. He had medical co-morbidities of musculo-skeletal injuries together with ongoing headaches and neck pain.
	
	
	The psychiatrist reported that the Respondent was resistant to the use of medication and sought to take more of a psychosocial approach to his PTSD. This included the benefit that he gains from physical exercise at the gym. The psychiatrist, nevertheless, recommended starting him on an SSRI type of anti-depressant.
	
	
	Ms McComish reported that she had been treating the Respondent throughout 2014 and during the first half of 2015. She saw him again in June 2016. Ms McComish said that the Respondent presented in early 2014 with Major Depressive Disorder as well as PTSD. When she saw him in 2016 he told her that after he had been sentenced he had been able to relax his vigilance and consider his future. The lodgement of the Crown appeal had triggered his original fears causing a number of his symptoms to reoccur. Ms McComish recommended Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Desensitisation and Graded Exposure as well as Mindfulness and Relaxation Therapy. The Respondent was to see her on a fortnightly basis to engage in that treatment.
	
	
	It may be accepted from the reports and the large monetary payment made by the Respondent to Mr Whitten that the Respondent is extremely remorseful for his offending and the result of that offending, being the serious injury to his friend Mr Whitten and the death of Mr Whitten’s daughter.
	
	
	Whilst his past offending is not irrelevant to the sentencing exercise, because it involved a similar type of recklessness as the present offending, it may be accepted that it was seven years earlier and there were no other convictions.
	
	
	Each of the present offences was a serious example of the offending with the aggravating factors that death and serious injury occurred as a result of the offending. The Respondent deliberately flew the aircraft at a very low level conscious that there may be powerlines and despite not having flown in that precise location previously.
	
	
	I regard the objective seriousness as above the mid-range. General deterrence is a significant consideration in the matter. Specific deterrence has some part to play but the obvious remorse shown by the Respondent reduces its significance. For that reason and because of his very limited prior offending I consider the Respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation to be very good. I do not believe that he will again offend.
	
	
	A significant consideration on a re-sentence on a Crown appeal is that the Respondent was not originally sentenced to an actual custodial term. Nevertheless, sentences of 15 and nine months respectively do not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offending even having regard to the strong subjective case. Were the Respondent being sentenced at first instance I consider that only a full-time custodial sentence would be adequate and for substantially longer periods.
	
	
	In my opinion, the Respondent should be sentenced to a longer period of imprisonment than imposed by the Sentencing Judge, to be served, if he is found suitable, by way of an Intensive Correction Order.
	
	
	I propose that the Respondent should be sentenced on Count 2 to a period of imprisonment for 21 months, on Count 3 to a period of imprisonment for 12 months to commence 12 months after the sentence for Count 2, and that the sentence should be served by way of an Intensive Correction Order if he is assessed as suitable.
	
	
	The following orders should be made:
	


(1)   Appeal allowed.

(2)   Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 28 April 2016.

(3)   Refer the Respondent for assessment as to his suitability for intensive correction in the community, pursuant to Div 3 of Pt 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

(4)   Adjourn the proceedings for that purpose.


	
	GARLING J:      I agree with Davies J.

		28 November 2016",2016-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
3013484,Safe Work (NSW) v Schaefer Systems International P/L [2016] NSWDC 321,"sentence


	
	Schaefer Systems International Pty Ltd (the offender) has pleaded guilty to an offence that being a person who had a health and safety duty pursuant to section 19(1) Work Health and Safety Act 2011 (the Act), it failed to comply with that duty and thereby exposed Kyell Lewis to a risk of death or serious injury contrary to section 32 of the Act.
	
	
	The maximum penalty for the offence is a fine of $1.5 million.
	


Facts


	
	The parties presented an Agreed Statement of Facts which can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	The offender conducted a business providing industrial storage systems, including providing design, project management and customer support services regarding the implementation of these systems. The offender did not install the storage systems but would engage specialist contractors to undertake this work. The offender would assist installation contractors on technical issues and monitor the progress, quality and safety of installation work.
	
	
	On or about 18 April 2013, Fashion Biz (Aust) Pty Ltd (Fashion Biz) and the offender entered into an agreement to extend the existing industrial storage system that the offender had previously supplied at their industrial warehouse at 48 Bernera Road, Prestons (the premises).
	
	
	The offender engaged Sundance Racking Pty Ltd (Sundance), a company that they had used on many prior occasions, to install an additional 3rd tier level to the existing storage system at the premises.
	
	
	The offender provided Sundance with information about the supplied equipment, installation design and an installation schedule. The offender attended initial scoping meetings and conducted site inspections of the premises with Sundance. Risks and hazards associated with the installation were discussed with Sundance at the site inspections. They were then reduced into a Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS) that was drafted by Sundance.
	
	
	Prior to work commencing at the premises, the offender reviewed the safety policy, safe work procedures and SWMS adopted by Sundance. The offender did not require that any changes be made to these documents. Installation commenced on 14 August 2013.
	
	
	Installation of the storage system was conducted and controlled by Sundance day-to-day, however the offender maintained an overall responsibility for the installation. The offender had two employees at the premises: Richard Fuller, the project manager, and Robert Gaffey, the site supervisor.
	
	
	Mr Fuller’s role as Project Manager involved planning and coordinating project activities to ensure that the project was completed on time. He was also responsible for ensuring that adequate safety procedures were implemented and for identifying and assessing risks in the project. Mr Fuller inspected the premises approximately once per week to check on the progress of the installation and ensure that it was proceeding safely.
	
	
	Mr Gaffey was the on-site point of contact representing the offender and attended the site daily staying for several hours at a time. His role involved monitoring the progress, quality and safety of the installation, and dealing with any technical issues that arose. Mr Gaffey checked that Sundance regularly held tool box meetings and complied with its SWMS.
	
	
	Sundance employed Michael Grace as the site supervisor for the installation work. Sundance also engaged labour hire workers from Xtreme Workforce Pty Ltd (Xtreme). Xtreme would occasionally obtain additional labour hire workers from GK Engineering Services Pty Ltd (GK Engineering). Some of the workers supplied by Xtreme to Sundance were employed by GK Engineering.
	
	
	Kyell Lewis and Joshua Lock were employed by GK Engineering as casual labour hire employees. Mr Lewis commenced this employment at the premises on 26 August 2013. He had no prior experience in installing industrial storage systems.
	
	
	Mr Lock commenced employment with Xtreme in or around April 2011 and had approximately 2 years experience installing industrial storage systems at the date of the incident. Mr Lock commenced work for Sundance at the premises on 14 August 2013.
	
	
	On 9 September 2013, Mr Lock, Mr Lewis and another labour hire worker were undertaking tasks on the second mezzanine level. The work involved laying flooring components into the racking framework on the second mezzanine level while they worked from this level. Mr Lewis was under the supervision of both Mr Lock and Mr Grace.
	
	
	The flooring of the second mezzanine level was approximately 2.4 metres above the flooring of the first mezzanine level and 6 metres above the ground. Racking, shelving and handrails had not been installed on the second mezzanine level and there were unguarded voids. It was planned that permanent handrails would be installed after the floor panels had been laid.
	
	
	At around 10.40am, Mr Lewis and Mr Lock began to move their tools to the middle row of newly laid mezzanine floor to adjust the floor sheeting to eliminate a gap in the floor. They walked towards a conveyor structure that had been installed on that level. The conveyor structure passed through a penetration in the floor to access the level below. Racking had been installed on the left hand side of the conveyor which operated as a physical barrier to the outside edge of the floor. On the right hand side of the conveyor the flooring had two unguarded edges.
	
	
	Mr Lock then walked past the conveyor on the left hand side. Mr Lewis walked on the right hand side of the conveyor and fell off the unguarded edge onto the concrete floor approximately 6 metres below.
	
	
	Mr Lewis was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Liverpool Hospital. He sustained a traumatic brain injury, right renal laceration, right lung contusion/effusion and injury to his back including spinal fractures.
	
	
	There were no employees of the offender on-site at the time of the incident. Mr Gaffey had last attended the site on Friday 6 September 2013. On that occasion he gave a general direction to Mr Grace that handrails needed to be installed on all of the finished areas of the second mezzanine level.
	
	
	The SWMS prepared by Sundance and reviewed by the offender noted a hazard of falling from heights when working at height to lay floors. The control measures specified were to lay temporary sheets to use as a base while laying sections of floor, to ensure that workers do not stand within 1 metre of the edge and for workers to work on their hands and knees if required to work near an unguarded edge.
	
	
	The offender’s systems did not require its site supervisor to check whether control measures had been put in place by Sundance prior to handrails being installed to prevent workers from falling from height.
	
	
	Following the incident, the offender introduced a requirement for all sub-contractors to have a Safety Management Plan as well as a SWMS for the site that addressed the risks of falling from height, including the use of fall protection equipment.
	
	
	The Safety Management Plan also required that supervisors complete a Workplace Inspection Checklist to audit the performance of subcontractors against their Safety Management Plan and SWMS.
	
	
	Sundance implemented a number of measures to improve its safety systems following the incident including revising its SWMS and using temporary handrails.
	


The Offender’s Case on Sentence


	
	The offender relied on an affidavit of Bradley John Welsman, the Executive General Manager of the offender, sworn 8 November 2016. Mr Welsman was present in Court for the sentence hearing but was not required for cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Welsman commenced working for the offender in November 2009 as Executive General Manager, Automation. In January 2012 he commenced as Executive General Manager, the most senior position in Australia. As part of this role, Mr Welsman is responsible for overseeing the offender’s work health and safety systems.
	
	
	The offender was first registered as a company in September 1998. It currently has 70 employees, 50 of which are in New South Wales.
	
	
	Mr Welsman expressed deep remorse personally and on behalf of the directors and senior managers of the offender.
	
	
	Mr Welsman deposed that the offender sought to ensure safety at the premises by engaging Mr Fuller and Mr Gaffey, both of whom had significant relevant experience, to oversee the installation work. Mr Fuller and Mr Gaffey were supervised by the offender’s Engineering Manager, Brett Thirup. Messrs Fuller, Gaffey and Thirrup had regular discussions about the work at the premises including about site safety matters.
	
	
	Sundance had been engaged by the offender for 18 separate projects in the 12 months prior to the incident and no health and safety incidents occurred during any of these projects. Mr Welsman deposed that Sundance had a reputation for having extensive experience in performing installation work and when the offender had worked with them previously, Sundance had taken responsibility for safety concerns during installation. Mr Welsman explained that the offender sought to ensure safety and comply with its work health and safety duties by engaging a specialised expert sub-contractor and it was for that reason that Sundance was engaged.
	
	
	Mr Welsman gave evidence in his affidavit that the offender relied on the expertise of Sundance to ensure that their SWMS and work practices addressed safety risks involved in the installation work. The offender relied on Sundance to engage workers with appropriate experience and/or provide training to ensure that work was carried out safely.
	
	
	Mr Welsman deposed that the offender has had no previous serious accidents or injuries.
	
	
	Prior to the incident the offender had a workplace health and safety management system (WHS System) which it regularly reviewed. The System included:
	



	
	Safety personnel;
	
	
	Hazard identification and management;
	
	
	Safety training;
	
	
	Consultation and communication with workers and stakeholders about work health and safety matters;
	
	
	Written policies and procedures.
	



	
	The offender employed a Work Health and Safety Manager who was responsible for implementing safety management plans that were site specific. New employees were provided with a health and safety induction tailored to their role that was delivered by their manager. The offender encouraged workers to participate in the system and has maintained a Safety Committee since early 2011.
	
	
	Following the incident, the offender created a Project Site Safety Committee to improve safety installation projects. The committee held its first meeting on 12 September 2013. The offender developed a SWMS checklist to be used by project managers and site supervisors. In October 2013 a new Work Health and Safety Management Plan was adopted by the offender. In 2014 the offender organised for a safety audit to be conducted by an independent contractor. The new comprehensive written work health and safety plan was developed as a combination of the efforts of the offender and the independent contractor. On 20 March 2015 the offender was assessed as complying with the Australian Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems Standard AS/NZS 4801:2001. The offender’s management discuss safety at its monthly meetings and follow up on safety issues raised on prior occasions.
	
	
	The system of inducting new and existing staff was reviewed. This resulted in the production of an Occupational Health and Safety Handbook and the delivery of general and site specific inductions by the WHS Manager.
	
	
	Following the incident the offender attempted to make contact with Mr Lewis however he did not wish to be contacted.
	


Consideration


	
	I have had regard to the objects of the Act set out in section 3 and the purposes of sentencing set out in section 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Objective Seriousness


	
	The risk of a worker falling from height during the installation of the storage system was a foreseeable one. There were unprotected edges on the second mezzanine floor and the offender was aware that handrails would not be installed until the flooring had been laid and that the laying of the floor required the workers to work at height.
	
	
	Simple remedial steps were available that could have minimised or eliminated the risk. These included adequately reviewing the work practices and SWMS of Sundance, the use of temporary handrails, and/or the use of fall protection or arrest devices.
	
	
	A mobile scissor lift was present at the premises but was unable to be used in the space where Mr Lewis fell. After the incident a smaller scissor lift was obtained for use in that area.
	
	
	The risk was one of serious injury or death. The second mezzanine floor was 2.4 metres above the first mezzanine floor and 6 m above the concrete ground floor.
	
	
	The injuries sustained by Mr Lewis were very serious. I do not have any information about his recovery because he has not wanted to be involved with the proceedings.
	
	
	The offender’s role in the installation was a supervisory one. The prosecutor accepted that Sundance was more culpable in the circumstances.
	
	
	The objective seriousness of the offences is in the mid-range.
	


Deterrence


	
	The penalty imposed in relation to this offence must provide for general deterrence. Employers must take the obligations imposed by the Act very seriously. The community is entitled to expect that both small and large employers will comply with safety requirements. General deterrence is a significant factor when safety obligations are breached: Bulga Underground Operations Pty Ltd v Nash [2016] NSWCCA 37 at [180].
	
	
	There is also a need for specific deterrence because the offender continues to supply and oversee the installation of industrial storage systems, however in this case it is reduced. The offender took immediate steps to improve its systems. The offender did not have day-to-day control of the installation work but retained an overall responsibility to supervise the work. The offender has accepted responsibility for its breach of duty causing the injury to Mr Lewis.
	


Aggravating factors


	
	There are no relevant aggravating factors.
	


Mitigating factors


	
	The offender does not have any previous convictions: section 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender has been in operation since 1998.
	
	
	The offender is unlikely to reoffend: section 21A(3)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. At the time of the offence the offender had systems in place to train its employees and analyse the SWMSs of its sub-contractors. The offender has identified that these systems were inadequate. The offender has undertaken a very substantial review of its safety systems and I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that it is unlikely to reoffend with those systems in place.
	
	
	The offender has demonstrated remorse: section 21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender expressed remorse through the affidavit Mr Welsman. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has accepted responsibility for its actions and demonstrated genuine remorse and contrition.
	
	
	The offender entered a plea of guilty: section 21A(3)(k) and section 22 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender is entitled to a discount on penalty that reflects the utilitarian value of that plea. The extent of the discount should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25%, but that is only a guide. The primary consideration in determining where in the range a particular case should fall is the timing of the plea, so that the earlier the plea the greater the discount: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and R v Borkowski (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]. The plea also indicates remorse: Borkowski at [32].
	
	
	The original summons was filed on 15 December 2014. An amended summons was filed on 27 September 2016 and the offender pleaded guilty to the offence on that date. The delay was caused in part by Sundance’s negotiations with the prosecutor to enter into an enforceable undertaking. The prosecutor accepted that the offender is entitled to a discount at the upper end of the range. The appropriate discount is 20%.
	
	
	The offender co-operated with the Safe Work investigation: section 21A(3)(m) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	


Penalty


	
	The offender is convicted.
	
	
	The appropriate fine is one of $150,000 that will be discounted by 20% to take into account the plea of guilty.
	
	
	I impose a fine of $120,000.
	
	
	I order that pursuant to section 122(2) Fines Act 1996 that 50% of the fine is to be paid to the prosecutor.
	
	
	I order that the offender pay the prosecutors costs as agreed or assessed.

		28 November 2016",2016-11-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
3013490,Museth v Windsor Country Golf Club Ltd [2016] NSWCA 327,"HEADNOTE

[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

Mr Museth commenced proceedings against Windsor Country Golf Club Ltd (the Club) in the District Court in the tort of nuisance. Mr Museth claimed that water flowed from the Club’s land onto his land and penetrated the sub-surface clay soil which then expanded, causing structural damage to his house.

The primary judge found the nuisance proved. By August 2015 it was common ground that the nuisance had been abated. The primary judge assessed damages at $25,000, ultimately finding that the expert evidence did not support a finding that damages for underpinning or demolition and reconstruction was appropriate. The primary judge concluded that the damage was cosmetic, not structural. Mr Museth had previously settled his claim against another defendant for $30,000. It was accepted that he was required to give credit for that receipt. Accordingly, judgment was entered for the Club with costs.

Mr Museth appealed against findings of fact and conclusions on the expert evidence, and quantification of damages.

Held, dismissing the appeal (per McDougall J, with Gleeson JA and Barrett AJA agreeing at [1] and [2] respectively):

(1)      The primary judge erred in permitting to be given, and relying on, the evidence of Mr Koloff, given over objection in re-examination, as to the apparent extent of exterior cracking and the inferred need, based on those cracks, for underpinning ([111]).

(2)    The primary judge did not err in concluding that the structural integrity of Mr Museth’s property was not compromised ([111]-[112]).

(3)    The nuisance had been abated by August 2015. Coupled with the finding that the proved damage was not structural, damages for demolition and reconstruction were not appropriate. The alleged deficiencies in the primary judge’s reasoning do not go anywhere in light of this finding ([114]).

(4)      The question of damages for demolition and construction does not arise where the damage caused by the nuisance is not structural. Even if this were an appropriate measure of damages, there was no evidence of that cost before the primary judge ([114]-[116]).

(5)    The primary judge’s assessment of damages was appropriate on the evidence that was admissible ([116]-[119]).

Judgment


	
	GLEESON JA:   I agree with McDougall J that the appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given by his Honour. As to the question of whether leave to appeal is required because the matter in issue involves an amount or value of less than $100,000 (Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), s 101(2)(r)), no point was taken by the respondent that the appeal was incompetent: Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) r 51.41, nor was the question of leave addressed by the parties on the appeal. Since no point would be served in putting the parties to further expense in making submissions on the question of leave, I agree with the course proposed by McDougall J that the appeal be determined on the merits.
	
	
	BARRETT AJA:   I agree with McDougall J that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.  Because no party addressed the question whether leave to appeal was required or warranted, I prefer to express no opinion on that matter.  Subject to that, I agree with the reasons of McDougall J.
	
	
	McDOUGALL J:   The appellant (Mr Museth) sued the respondent (the Club) in nuisance. He claimed that water flowed from the Club’s land onto his land and penetrated the sub-surface clay soil. That, Mr Museth claimed, caused damage to the structure to his house.
	
	
	The primary judge found the nuisance proved (although he found that it had been abated in August 2015, when remedial measures taken by the Club stopped the flow of water from its land to Mr Museth’s land). He assessed damages at $25,000. Since the plaintiff had settled his claim against another defendant for $30,000, and since it was common ground that he was required to give credit for that receipt, the primary judge entered judgment for the Club with costs.
	
	
	Mr Museth, purportedly as of right, appeals from that decision. There is a question as to whether he requires leave. I return to that question at [120] and following below.
	


The facts


	
	Mr Museth’s property is located on the corner of McQuade Avenue and Cox Street, South Windsor. If one regards McQuade Avenue as running east-west, and Cox Street as running north-south, Mr Museth’s property is on the south-western corner. His land runs thence to the west. At its western boundary, his land is abutted by land of the Club.
	
	
	When Mr Museth bought his property in November 2011, there was a dirt dish drain on the Club’s land towards its eastern end, running parallel to the boundary with Mr Museth’s property. The Club’s land was grassed at that point (although there was a paved area further to the west, and there were also buildings further to the west).
	
	
	At the point where the two properties abut, the land slopes generally from west to east: the Club’s land is higher than Mr Museth’s land. It may be inferred that the dirt dish drain had been constructed to divert water flowing down the slope of the Club’s land away from Mr Museth’s property (and away from other properties in Cox Street).
	
	
	The primary judge found that both surface water and sub-surface water flowed from the Club’s land onto (and into) Mr Museth’s land. The Club does not challenge that finding. The primary judge found, further, that the effect of those water flows was to charge the sub-surface clay in Mr Museth’s land with water, thus causing it to swell. As is common experience with clay soils, the clay beneath Mr Museth’s house swells when it is charged with water and shrinks when it dries out. That shrink/swell movement disturbed the footings of Mr Museth’s house (which was about 70 years old). That in turn caused cracking in the walls and, the primary judge found, movement in the roof timbers which caused the roof to sag.
	
	
	In August 2015, the Club constructed a retaining wall near the eastern boundary of its property where it abutted Mr Museth’s property (and other properties in Cox Street), and constructed a concrete spoon drain behind that retaining wall. Those measures were effective in stopping the flow of water from the Club’s land to Mr Museth’s land.
	


The primary judge’s reasons


	
	The primary judge gave two separate judgments in this matter. In one, which I will call the reopening judgment, he dealt with (and dismissed) an application by Mr Museth to reopen his case and adduce evidence of the cost of underpinning. In the other, which I will call the principal judgment, the primary judge dealt with the substantive issues. Both judgments need to be considered, because his Honour expressly incorporated into the principal judgment aspects of his reasoning in the reopening judgment.
	
	
	The primary judge commenced the principal judgment by setting out, in a way that is not now contentious, an outline of Mr Museth’s claim, the principles relating to the law of nuisance relevant to the flow of water from one property to another, the facts as to the flow of water from the Club’s land onto Mr Museth’s land, and the facts as to the Club’s works in abatement. As I have indicated, his Honour found that up until August 2015, water had flowed both across and below ground from the Club’s land to Mr Museth’s land, and had caused both exterior and interior cracking to Mr Museth’s house. That finding took his Honour to the question of damages.
	
	
	Each party led expert evidence. To the extent that the expert evidence dealt with water flows, it may be put to one side. The expert evidence as to damages addressed three topics. They were roof sag, the need for underpinning, and whether demolition and reconstruction was the only way of remedying the damage to Mr Museth’s house.
	
	
	As to roof sag, the primary judge concluded that the sagging shown in photographs that were in evidence had been caused by movement in the walls. Movement in the walls had been caused by movement (swell/shrink) in the sub-surface clay material beneath the house.
	
	
	As to underpinning, the primary judge noted that the claim for damages included a claim for the cost of underpinning. There was no evidence of that cost because (as I have indicated already) the primary judge had rejected Mr Museth’s application to reopen and lead evidence of that cost.
	
	
	The primary judge appeared to accept the evidence of Mr Museth’s expert, Mr Koloff, that underpinning could control movement in the foundations of the house. Because there was no evidence of that cost, his Honour was unable to find that underpinning would not be viable in an economic sense.
	
	
	The primary judge found that the structural integrity of the building was not threatened by the cracks that had been observed. Thus, he concluded, underpinning was not required to rectify or prevent structural damage.
	
	
	In short, the primary judge found that the defects could not be remedied by underpinning, and that underpinning was not necessary to secure the structural integrity of the house. His Honour did find that underpinning would prevent further movement and consequent damage, but considered that such damage would not affect the structural integrity of the house.
	
	
	The primary judge noted (at [72]), as to the claim for demolition and rebuilding, that “it was no part of the plaintiff’s submission”. Mr Gross of Queens Counsel, who appeared with Mr Boyd of Counsel for Mr Museth on the hearing of the appeal, attacked that comment. It was incorrect. The submissions put for Mr Museth to the primary judge had included a claim for the cost of demolition and reconstruction. It is fair to say that the submissions were put in a perfunctory way, and were not addressed with any detail whatsoever.
	
	
	The primary judge found that the expert evidence on which Mr Museth relied did not support the claim for demolition and rebuilding. Accordingly, he determined not to allow it.
	
	
	In the reopening judgment, the primary judge had raised (in the context of the cost of underpinning) the question of whether it was reasonable to spend a large amount of money (the amount came from the quotation that Mr Museth wanted to tender if given leave to reopen) on underpinning, having regard to the non-structural nature of the defects. He concluded that it was not. Although his Honour did not expressly refer to that in his principal judgment, it is clear that the same reasoning process would apply.
	
	
	On the basis that the only damage was cosmetic, the primary judge allowed damages in accordance with the estimate provided by one of the Club’s witnesses, and a sum for inconvenience. He rejected a claim for exemplary damages. There is no complaint made as to that. Nor is there any complaint that, on the (contested) basis that the only damage was cosmetic, the sum allowed was inadequate.
	


Outline of issues and approach to decision


	
	Mr Museth advanced eight grounds of appeal.
	
	
	Ground 1 attacks what are said to have been inconsistent findings of fact made by the primary judge when his Honour dealt with the expert evidence, as a result of which, it is said, the primary judge incorrectly concluded that the structural integrity of Mr Museth’s house was not compromised, and the only repairs needed were “cosmetic”.
	
	
	Ground 2 asserts that the primary judge erred in stating that the experts who had commented on wall movement were not asked about, and did not comment on, structural integrity. The ground asserts that Mr Museth’s expert Mr Koloff did do this.
	
	
	Ground 3 asserts that the primary judge erred in his approach to the assessment of damages by using the concept of “betterment”, and thus confining damages to the cost of “cosmetic” repairs (and an allowance for inconvenience). The ground asserts that to the extent that compliance with the current standards of the local council would have resulted in a better building, that was simply a function of reinstatement (by demolition and reconstruction).
	
	
	Ground 4 attacks the primary judge’s asserted reliance “upon the purchase price [paid by Mr Museth in 2011] as a significant factor preventing [Mr Museth] from obtaining any damages for the cost of demolition and rebuilding”.
	
	
	Ground 5 attacks the primary judge’s reasoning (referable to evidence given by Mr Koloff) that Mr Museth did not buy a house for a “1 in 100 years storm” and, thus, his Honour’s rejection of this aspect of Mr Koloff’s evidence.
	
	
	Ground 6 asserts that the primary judge failed to consider the evidence adequately, and to give proper reasons for decision. That ground is, expressly, parasitic on grounds 1 to 5.
	
	
	Ground 7 attacks the primary judge’s refusal to allow by way of damages the cost of demolition and reconstruction, bearing in mind (it is said) that underpinning was not an option, because it was not cost effective, and that there was structural damage to the house.
	
	
	Ground 8 (which is parasitic on all the preceding grounds) asserts that the damages assessed were inadequate.
	
	
	The Club relied on a notice of contention. That notice raised two grounds:
	



	
	on the primary judge’s finding that there was no structural damage, and bearing in mind that the nuisance had been abated, it was not reasonable to reinstate (as Mr Museth said should be done) by demolishing and rebuilding at a cost of $550,000; and
	
	
	passages in the oral evidence of Mr Koloff (strangely, given for the first time in re-examination) were inadmissible and, objection having been taken to them, should have been rejected.
	



	
	It is not really possible to make sense of the grounds of appeal, or the notice of contention, without giving detailed consideration to the expert evidence.
	
	
	Further, and for reasons that will become apparent, it is my view that the admissible and probative expert evidence does not and could not support the conclusions for which Mr Museth now argues. In substance, I think, the second ground stated in the notice of contention is correct. Since that is sufficient to dispose of the appeal (and since an analysis of that question will in any event deal also with the first, second and fifth grounds of appeal), I shall approach the resolution of the issues on appeal by turning to the notice of contention and those grounds after setting out the expert evidence.
	


Principles relevant to expert evidence


	
	Section 76 of the Evidence Act 2005 (NSW) states “the opinion rule”. It reads:
	


76    The opinion rule

(1)    Evidence of an opinion is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact about the existence of which the opinion was expressed.

(2)    Subsection (1) does not apply to evidence of an opinion contained in a certificate or other document given or made under regulations made under an Act other than this Act to the extent to which the regulations provide that the certificate or other document has evidentiary effect.


	
	There are several exceptions to the opinion rule. Section 79 sets out the exception for “opinions based on specialised knowledge”. It reads:
	


79      Exception: opinions based on specialised knowledge

(1)     If a person has specialised knowledge based on the person’s training, study or experience, the opinion rule does not apply to evidence of an opinion of that person that is wholly or substantially based on that knowledge.

(2)     To avoid doubt, and without limiting subsection (1):

(a)    a reference in that subsection to specialised knowledge includes a reference to specialised knowledge of child development and child behaviour (including specialised knowledge of the impact of sexual abuse on children and their development and behaviour during and following the abuse), and

(b)     a reference in that subsection to an opinion of a person includes, if the person has specialised knowledge of the kind referred to in paragraph (a), a reference to an opinion relating to either or both of the following:

(i)     the development and behaviour of children generally,

(ii)    the development and behaviour of children who have been victims of sexual offences, or offences similar to sexual offences.


	
	Rule 31.28 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) sets out procedural requirements to be satisfied before expert opinion evidence can be adduced. The rule serves a number of purposes, one of which is to provide a measure of procedural fairness to a party against whom such evidence is to be adduced. I set out r 31.28:
	


31.28    Disclosure of experts’ reports and hospital reports

(1)    Each party must serve experts’ reports and hospital reports on each other active party:

(a)    in accordance with any order of the court, or

(b)    if no such order is in force, in accordance with any relevant practice note, or

(c)    if no such order or practice note is in force, not later than 28 days before the date of the hearing at which the report is to be used.

(2)    An application to the court for an order under subrule (1) (other than an order solely for abridgment or extension of time) may be made without serving notice of motion.

(3)     Except by leave of the court, or by consent of the parties:

(a)    an expert’s report or hospital report is not admissible unless it has been served in accordance with this rule, and

(b)    without limiting paragraph (a), an expert’s report or hospital report, when tendered under section 63, 64 or 69 of the Evidence Act 1995, is not admissible unless it has been served in accordance with this rule, and

(c)    the oral expert evidence in chief of any expert is not admissible unless an expert’s report or hospital report served in accordance with this rule contains the substance of the matters sought to be adduced in evidence.

(4)    Leave is not to be given as referred to in subrule (3) unless the court is satisfied:

(a)    that there are exceptional circumstances that warrant the granting of leave, or

(b)    that the report concerned merely updates an earlier version of a report that has been served in accordance with subrule (1).


	
	In the present case, expert evidence dealing with water flows, the likely causes of cracking in Mr Museth’s residence, the quality or character of that cracking, methods of repair, and the like would in principle be relevant, and thus could be admissible pursuant to s 56 of the Evidence Act. No one suggested otherwise. However, the issues raised by ground 2 of the notice of contention include whether the evidence in question was shown to fall within s 79(1), and thus to be admissible as an exception to the opinion rule.
	
	
	In Dasreef Pty Ltd v Hawchar (2011) 243 CLR 588; [2011] HCA 21, the majority (French CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) said at [37] that, in the ordinary case, if expert evidence is to be admissible, it must be apparent from the evidence how the opinion expressed follows from the stated (known or assumed) facts by the application of the specialised knowledge of the witness to those facts. In doing so, their Honours referred with approval to what Heydon JA had said in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles (2001) 52 NSWLR 705; [2001] NSWCA 305, at [85]:
	


In short, if evidence tendered as expert opinion evidence is to be admissible, it must be agreed or demonstrated that there is a field of “specialised knowledge”; there must be an identified aspect of that field in which the witness demonstrates that by reason of specified training, study or experience, the witness has become an expert; the opinion proffered must be “wholly or substantially based on the witness’s expert knowledge”; so far as the opinion is based on facts “observed” by the expert, they must be identified and admissibly proved by the expert, and so far as the opinion is based on “assumed” or “accepted” facts, they must be identified and proved in some other way; it must be established that the facts on which the opinion is based form a proper foundation for it; and the opinion of an expert requires demonstration or examination of the scientific or other intellectual basis of the conclusions reached: that is, the expert’s evidence must explain how the field of “specialised knowledge” in which the witness is expert by reason of “training, study or experience”, and on which the opinion is “wholly or substantially based”, applies to the facts assumed or observed so as to produce the opinion propounded. If all these matters are not made explicit, it is not possible to be sure whether the opinion is based wholly or substantially on the expert’s specialised knowledge. If the court cannot be sure of that, the evidence is strictly speaking not admissible, and, so far as it is admissible, of diminished weight. And an attempt to make the basis of the opinion explicit may reveal that it is not based on specialised expert knowledge, but, to use Gleeson CJ’s characterisation of the evidence in HG v R (1999) 197 CLR 414, on “a combination of speculation, inference, personal and second-hand views as to the credibility of the complainant, and a process of reasoning which went well beyond the field of expertise” (at [41]).


	
	It followed, the majority said in Dasreef at [42], that if the evidence does not demonstrate that an opinion expressed by a witness is based on the specialised knowledge of that witness, which in turn is based on training, study or experience, then the evidence is not admissible. That is because, for s 79(1) of the Evidence Act to be engaged, it must be shown or conceded that each of the elements stipulated in that subsection is proved.
	
	
	In the present case, the evidence of Mr Koloff, an expert on whose evidence Mr Museth relied heavily both at trial and on the hearing of the appeal, fell lamentably short of meeting those basic requirements.
	
	
	In my view, purported expert opinion evidence should not be admitted unless the requirements of s 79(1) are proved or conceded. If evidence is admitted without those requirements being proved or conceded, the opposing party is placed in a most invidious situation. Counsel for that party has two choices: to test the evidence, and risk in effect making good its defects; or not to test it, and take the risk that the trial judge might find it persuasive. In my view, it is grossly unfair to put a party in that situation. If parties and their legal advisers cannot ensure that purported expert opinion evidence meets the basic requirements for admissibility, the consequences should fall on them, not on the other party.
	
	
	Further, in my view, it is not consistent with r 31.28 to permit expert evidence to be given, particularly on a vital topic, unless the requirements of the rule have been met (or the opposing party consents).
	


The expert evidence

Evidence called for Mr Museth 


	
	Mr Museth called evidence from a geotechnical engineer, Mr Jworchan; from a civil and structural engineer, Mr Koloff; and from a builder, Mr Parcell. Messrs Koloff and Jworchan gave oral evidence. Mr Parcell did not; he was seriously ill, and his statement of evidence was tendered, but was not tested in cross-examination.
	


Mr Jworchan


	
	Mr Jworchan’s evidence dealt, as one would expect, with the geotechnical characteristics of Mr Museth’s land. He said that “bedrock shale is unlikely to be encountered up to depth of about 2.0m”. Thus, he said, if underpinning works had to be based on shale, “existing residence may not be economically underpinned”. Mr Jworchan concluded that the soil had a very low bearing capacity down to about a metre in depth, and a higher but variable bearing capacity at a depth of about one to two metres. He concluded that it “may be feasible” to underpin the house “at depths of 1.0m to 2.0m”.
	
	
	In his oral evidence, Mr Jworchan confirmed that he had no comment on whether underpinning might or might not be appropriate. He said that this was a question for “whoever was designing that, yes”.
	


Mr Koloff


	
	Mr Koloff’s written evidence was extraordinarily unsatisfactory. In his first report, dated 29 March 2015, he referred to a site inspection that he had conducted two days earlier in the company of Mr Parcell and said, without any further ado:
	


Underpinning of the house required as per [the attached quotation of] Crackerjack Construction for $187,000 and rectify all damaged parts of the house will cost in excess of $400,000.


	
	It appears that objection was taken to that statement. Understandably, Counsel then appearing for Mr Museth did not press it.
	
	
	Next, Mr Koloff set out his “conclusion”:
	


The most cost effective solution is to demolish the house and construct similar new dwellings on levels higher than 1 in 100 years storm as provided by Winsor [sic] Council.


	
	It does not appear that objection was taken to that sentence. Nonetheless, it can have no probative weight, because the report simply does not indicate what is the problem to which demolition and reconstruction is “the most cost effective solution”. It does not provide any factual basis for the assertion. Nor (of necessity given the absence of factual reference) does it provide any process of reasoning.
	
	
	There is another problem with the “conclusion”. It is apparent that Mr Koloff thought that a new house should be erected above the 1 in 100 year storm level. The evidence is silent as to whether Mr Museth’s land fell above or below that level. If it were below that level then, one might infer, reconstruction would not be effective.
	
	
	The report then set out Mr Koloff’s qualifications.
	
	
	There was annexed to the report a quotation from Crackerjack Construction. The tender of that quotation was not pressed.
	
	
	That is all there was to Mr Koloff’s first report.
	
	
	In a second report dated 3 July 2015, Mr Koloff referred to his first inspection and to a subsequent inspection on 7 May 2015. He said:
	


As a result of newly erected extension of the carpark belonging to Windsor Country Gold [sic] Club (building works complete in 2011) all the surface water is discharged to the rear of the properties along Cox Street and in particular the No.37 Cox Street which is at the lowest point of previously constructed spoon drain and pit and subsequently collapsed due to excess water flow and inadequate construction.

Over the past 4 years the rear yard of the above property has been heavily saturated and movements of the foundations created external and internal cracks, some sections of the roof have collapsed.

The concerned owner of the above property Mr. Mick Musech [sic] has obtained a geotechnical report from Geotechique Pty Ltd stating that the soil end bearing capacity is less or equal to 100 KPa and the substrata of the surrounding area is heavily saturated where the moisture content exceeds 100%.

Recommendation:

In view of the above I recommend that the building should be demolished and similar dwelling to be erected on foundation such as screw piling suitable for this type of soil condition and in lieu new stormwater drainage system to be erected by the Windsor Country Golf Club thus diverting the water flow to the Council’s stormwater drainage system.

Underpinning is not an option as per my previous report dated 29.03.2015.


	
	Because the sentence in the previous report, dealing with underpinning, had not been tendered, the last sentence of the “Recommendation” had no point of reference and no probative weight.
	
	
	In essence (so it seems to me), the absence of any demonstrated reasoning process in Mr Koloff’s reports means that they were inadmissible, because they could not be seen to come within s 79(1) of the Evidence Act. Even if the reports were admissible, there were problems.
	
	
	First, the recommendation for demolition and reconstruction simply does not follow, in any way explained in the second report, from the assumed facts set out in the two preceding paragraphs. It may well follow from observations made by Mr Koloff during one or other of his site inspections, but if it does, the report does not show how. Thus, in my view, the recommendation has no probative weight. It is impossible for anyone reading the report to understand the factual basis leading to the conclusion that demolition and reconstruction is appropriate, or the reasoning deployed in support of that conclusion.
	
	
	Another problem concerns that part of the recommendation that commences with the words “and in lieu”. Do those words mean that the “new stormwater drainage system” is to be erected in lieu of what was then in place on the Club’s land (i.e., the dirt dish drain)? Or do they indicate, as was submitted for the Club on appeal, that constructing an effective stormwater drainage system on its land is an alternative to demolition and reconstruction of Mr Museth’s house.
	
	
	Neither of Mr Koloff’s reports, to the extent that they were admitted into evidence, said anything about the need for or cost of underpinning. Further, in my view, neither of them said anything of any probative force, to the effect that the only practicable method of reinstatement available to Mr Museth was demolition and reconstruction.
	
	
	Mr Koloff gave oral evidence, including some substantive evidence in chief. Since there was no objection to his giving further oral evidence in chief (as opposed to specific objections to specific questions), this may be taken to have happened with the Club’s consent, for the purposes of UCPR r 31.28(3).
	
	
	No part of Mr Koloff’s oral evidence in chief (nor, for that matter, in his cross-examination) provided any support for the proposition that nothing short of demolition and reconstruction (or, perhaps, as an intermediate measure, underpinning) could provide an appropriate method of rectification for the damage caused by the nuisance to Mr Museth’s house.
	
	
	In the course of cross-examination, Mr Koloff agreed with the following points:
	



	
	when assessing damage due to foundation movements, the relevant Australian Standard, AS 2870, provided the “starting position”;
	
	
	in assessing rectification of cracks in a house built of brick (as was Mr Museth’s property), the extent and direction of cracking were important, but the width was “not necessarily” important;
	
	
	in assessing the appropriate rectification for a 70 year old brick house built on clay, it would be very important to measure the width of cracks, their direction and their location;
	
	
	he had not measured the width of the cracks;
	
	
	Mr MacLeod, an expert who had provided a report for the Club, had measured the cracks; Mr Koloff agreed that the report “was very comprehensive”, and he “would agree with the contents of” that “very comprehensive… report”; and
	
	
	when shown a copy of the report in question, it was Mr MacLeod’s report, he found it to be comprehensive, and that he agreed with the opinions in it.
	



	
	The primary judge commented, correctly, that it was difficult to understand Mr Koloff’s apparent acceptance of the comprehensive nature of, and opinions expressed in, Mr MacLeod’s report, given that the opinions expressed by Mr MacLeod differed in some respects from those expressed by Mr Koloff. The primary judge concluded at [67] that Mr Koloff had not meant to say what he said, because Mr MacLeod’s report “is completely contradictory to his own report”. The primary judge did not venture a view as to what it was that Mr Koloff had intended to say.
	
	
	It is apparent that English was not Mr Koloff’s first language, and this may explain the apparent inconsistency. (It may also explain why Mr Koloff’s second report contains the puzzling passage commencing with the words “and in lieu” – see at [55], [59] above.) Whilst the difficulty that a witness has with the English language may give rise to an inference that the witness did not intend to convey the meaning that some of his answers (or other evidence) on their face appear to convey, it does not provide any basis for inferring what it was that the witness had intended to convey.
	
	
	Leaving those problems aside, the point reached at the conclusion of Mr Koloff’s evidence in chief, including his reports, and evidence in cross-examination was that he had given no evidence of the need for underpinning, and no evidence (of any probative force) as to why it was necessary to demolish and rebuild, rather than repair. Quite extraordinarily, those topics were broached in re-examination.
	
	
	In the course of re-examination, Mr Koloff was shown a number of photographs, said to have been taken on 2 June 2015. He was asked to describe what they showed to him. He said that some of them at least showed a “typical difference of settlement, a vertical crack” that indicated “movements to the foundation and, and that typical vertical crack”. He said that vertical cracks were the ones that caused major problems; horizontal cracks, it appears, were nothing to worry about.
	
	
	Mr Koloff was then asked to assume that the width of some of the cracks was 10mm, or 10 to 15mm. Rather than assume that fact, he appeared to estimate, by looking at the photographs, that this indeed was their width. Neither the assumption nor his visual estimate were consistent with the measurements made by Mr MacLeod. As events happened, Mr MacLeod’s measurements were not challenged in cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Koloff was then asked to indicate the significance of the cracking depicted in the photographs. There was an objection. The primary judge allowed the question. Mr Koloff said that it showed “the movements in the foundations and the thing is moving and settling”. In terms of significance, he said (again over objection) that “it’s underpinning” which was “a very complex process” that had to be “done in stage”.
	
	
	Then, and I think it is reasonably clear, still over objection (Counsel then appearing for the Club seems to have taken the appropriate course that his objection applied to the whole line of questioning; Mr Gross did not suggest otherwise), Mr Koloff said that the only way to rectify the damage was “if you demolished and rebuilt again” or, somewhat cryptically, “underpinning”.
	
	
	Mr Koloff was then asked further questions, again over objection, as to the assumed width of cracks shown in photographs (again, the fact that the assumption was inconsistent with Mr MacLeod’s statement of evidence does not appear to have troubled anyone) and asked to indicate what those cracks showed. He said “the only way you can rectify once whatever is to underpin and to go to firm stratum, underpin it”.
	
	
	There was more of the same.
	
	
	Next, Mr Koloff was asked to look at a photograph of the house which showed “the sagging of the roof”. This had not been mentioned in either of his reports, nor in any of his oral evidence to date. Mr Koloff said that the sagging in the roof was due to movement in the load-bearing walls. When asked how to repair the damage, he said he did not know, perhaps the trusses could be replaced, “but unless you fix up the, unless you fix up the load bearing walls you’re wasting your time because this will happen again”.
	
	
	Again, it appeared to be common ground on the hearing of the appeal that this evidence was given (or should be taken to have been given) over the repeated objections of Counsel for the Club.
	
	
	The evidence in re-examination to which I have referred is the subject of the second ground in the notice of contention. Although I shall return to this, I should indicate at this point that in my opinion, that material should not have been admitted, for at least four, related, reasons.
	
	
	First, it had not been flagged in any way in the reports and thus, absent consent (which clearly was not forthcoming) should not have been given: UCPR r 31.28(3). Second, by no stretch of the imagination could the evidence be regarded as having arisen out of the carefully structured cross-examination. Third, the conclusory and unreasoned manner in which the evidence was given, coupled with its divergence (as to the width of the cracks) from other evidence that was expected to be given, made it unreliable. And fourth, arising out of the preceding matters, the evidence was unfairly prejudicial to the Club, thus engaging s 135 of the Evidence Act.
	


Mr Parcell 


	
	The third expert on whose evidence Mr Museth sought to rely was Mr Parcell. Mr Parcell prepared two reports, the later of which was dated 27 July 2015. In that report, he referred to inspections he had made in January, March, May and July 2015, and reported on his observations. He said that in his view, movement in the footings, movement and cracking in the brickwork, movement and cracking in the interior walls and the sagging of the roof were caused by water penetration. He then purported to give the following opinions:
	



	
	the foundations required underpinning;
	
	
	the underpinning of the foundations could not be done with the dwelling in situ, and therefore the dwelling should be demolished and removed; and
	
	
	once the underpinning work had been performed, the dwelling could be rebuilt at a cost “in the order of $550,000” which “would include the cost of pile driving to depths of the new footings to the engineers [sic] satisfaction”.
	



	
	Those opinions were attacked, on the basis that they were conclusory and showed no reasoning. That must be so, as to the first. The report gives no reasoning to support the proposition (which I note appears to be one that Mr Koloff did not agree with, if one passage in his re-examination is to be accepted).
	
	
	As to the second opinion, it was on its face inconsistent with the opinion of Mr Jworchan. However, that is not of itself a reason for regarding it as inadmissible. Nor do I think that the second opinion is so baldly expressed as to be inadmissible. When it is read in the context of the whole report, I think that the reason why Mr Parcell expressed that opinion is clear enough.
	
	
	The real problem, however, lies with the third opinion. That assumes that underpinning will take place. Yet the underpinning that is in question relates to the footings of the existing dwelling. That would not be necessary if the existing dwelling were demolished. Once the existing building had been demolished, a new building could be constructed on footings to be designed by an engineer. Mr Koloff had indicated that screw pile footings would be appropriate. However one regards the process, there would be no need for underpinning the existing footings.
	
	
	As I have said, Mr Parcell was ill and could not attend court. Thus, his evidence was not tested in cross-examination.
	
	
	The primary judge said at [73] that an earlier report by Mr Parcell (dated 19 January 2015) “is of no assistance”, and that the later report “is of little further help”. His Honour gave reasons, including the apparent inconsistency with Mr Jworchan’s opinion.
	
	
	The primary judge, at [73], rejected Mr Parcell’s opinion. The grounds of appeal do not challenge his Honour’s rejection. In my view, the reason that his Honour gave was sufficient to justify rejection of the opinion. I add that the other matter I have referred to above – the apparent duplication of underpinning the footings of the existing dwelling which was to be demolished, and the construction of pile driven footings for the new dwelling (both of which appear to have been included in the estimated cost of $550,000) – provide an additional reason for rejecting the opinion.
	
	
	Once that opinion had been rejected, there was no evidence of the cost of rebuilding. It follows that even if the primary judge had concluded that rebuilding was the only appropriate way to deal with the defects caused to Mr Museth’s house by the movement of the underling clay soils, there was no evidence that would have enabled his Honour to fix the cost.
	
	
	Mr Gross in his submissions in this Court relied on Mr Parcell’s evidence. He did not explain how that evidence could assist Mr Museth, having regard to the primary judge’s unchallenged rejection of it.
	


Evidence called for the Club 


	
	The Club called three expert witnesses. They were Dr Cordery (a hydrologist), Mr MacLeod and Mr Mitrevski (each of whom described himself as a civil and structural engineer).
	


Dr Cordery


	
	Dr Cordery’s evidence dealt with water flows from the Club’s land to Mr Museth’s land, and with ways in which those flows could be prevented. Nothing turns on it for present purposes.
	


Mr MacLeod 


	
	Mr MacLeod inspected Mr Museth’s property and the adjoining land of the Club. He prepared two reports. In one (apart from commenting on other experts’ reports), Mr MacLeod set out his detailed observations of the cracking that he had observed during his inspection. In the second report, Mr MacLeod set out his views on the Club’s proposed abatement works.
	
	
	Mr MacLeod observed cracking in the exterior walls at locations that he identified. He measured the width of the cracks “using a hand held crack gauge with an accuracy of ± 0.1mm”. He illustrated his observations by reference to photographs. None of the exterior cracks observed and measured by Mr MacLeod was wider than 4mm, and most of them were considerably narrower.
	
	
	Mr MacLeod also observed (and identified by reference to photographs) internal cracking. To some extent, his observations of the width of those cracks were estimates, presumably because he could not reach them to measure them. Nonetheless, the widest estimated internal crack was about 2mm, and again most of them were narrower.
	
	
	Mr MacLeod expressed the opinion that “the cracking that exists is cosmetic, of no structural significance and those over 1.0mm in width can be repaired”.
	
	
	Mr MacLeod gave oral evidence in chief, as to a gap between the damp-proof course and the mortar perpend at one point. He had thought it was a construction joint, or construction issue, but said that if it were a crack caused by movement, it could be repaired. He added that the width of the suggested crack “is not representative of all the cracks that I saw on the perimeter of the building”, and summarised what he had seen.
	
	
	Mr MacLeod was cross-examined at some length. Much of the cross-examination dealt with water flows from the Club’s land to Mr Museth’s land, and the consequences. However, it is important to note that there was no challenge to Mr MacLeod’s evidence of his observations of the existence, location and width of the cracking that he observed on his visit. Nor was there any direct challenge to his evidence that the cracking that he observed “is cosmetic, of no structural significance and … can be repaired”.
	


Mr Mitrevski 


	
	Mr Mitrevski provided a report in which, among other things, he gave evidence of the external and internal cracking that he observed. He supported that evidence by reference to photographs. He said that he observed a number of exterior cracks of 2 to 3mm (or in some cases 1 to 2mm) width, and a number of internal cracks of similar widths. His conclusions included that:
	


The observed cracking, at the time of inspection, varies from “very slight” to slight (< 5mm wide) and are [sic] considered to have little to no influence on the overall structural integrity of the dwelling. The distress observed is generally considered only an “aesthetic” problem.


	
	Mr Mitrevski said that the cracking that he had observed “is not uncommon and generally expected to occur during the design life of a building”. It could be repaired. He said that “the apparent reactive nature of the clay foundation material” was likely to lead to “further cracking defects … in the future as a result of general foundation movement from seasonal changes in the foundation moisture condition”.
	
	
	Mr Mitrevski gave oral evidence, and was cross-examined. There was no challenge to his evidence of the width of the cracks that he had observed. Nor was there any challenge to his opinion that the cracking had “little to no influence on the overall structural integrity of the dwelling”.
	


Consideration


	
	The primary judge reviewed the expert evidence by reference to the three topics I have identified: roof sag; underpinning; and demolition and rebuilding.
	
	
	As to roof sag, the primary judge noted, correctly, that there was photographic evidence that the roof had sagged. He noted, again correctly, that no expert had gone into the roof space “to inspect what the problem was”, although that was something “available to be done by experts retained by both parties” (at [44]).
	
	
	The primary judge then dealt with the competing expert views as to the cause of the roof sag. On balance, he concluded that the roof sag was caused by movement in the walls (which supported the roof trusses) and that the walls moved because of swelling and shrinking in the sub-surface clay.
	
	
	As to underpinning, the primary judge considered that there were two issues. One was whether underpinning was practically or economically viable. The other was whether it was necessary.
	
	
	As to the first issue, the primary judge noted Mr Jworchan’s evidence that underpinning might be possible, but could be difficult. He then noted Mr Koloff’s opinion that underpinning was not an option. Unfortunately, in doing so, the primary judge took into account the sentence to that effect in Mr Koloff’s report which was objected to and not pressed. This opinion had been repeated in the second report, by reference back to the first report. It does not appear to have been dealt with specifically in the objections to and rulings on the second report.
	
	
	If it were open to the primary judge to take that opinion into account (because it had been repeated, apparently without objection, in the second report), there is another problem.
	
	
	Mr Koloff’s view, according to his second report, was that “underpinning is not an option”. However, the primary judge (at [68]) accepted the oral evidence of Mr Koloff, to the effect that underpinning was required. In short, the primary judge had before him two conflicting views from Mr Koloff, as to underpinning, and accepted one of those, in preference to the other and the evidence of the other experts. Nothing in Mr Koloff’s evidence in re-examination explains this dramatic shift in his opinion. The primary judge does not appear to have considered that inconsistency.
	
	
	Having concluded that underpinning was required (apparently to prevent further movement in the walls), the primary judge moved to consider whether it was necessary to ensure the structural integrity of the building. He referred to Mr Mitrevski’s opinion that the building’s structural integrity had not been compromised. It is apparent from the reopening judgment that the primary judge accepted Mr Mitrevski’s opinion. In my view, it was open to his Honour to do so. First, that opinion was not challenged in cross-examination. Second, it was supported by Mr MacLeod’s opinion. Third, Mr MacLeod’s opinion to the same effect on the issue of structural integrity was not challenged in cross-examination.
	
	
	Mr Gross submitted (and this is in essence the subject of the first ground of appeal) that the primary judge could not, consistently, prefer Mr Koloff’s evidence as to the need for underpinning and, at the same time, accept Mr Mitrevski’s evidence that the structural integrity of the house was not threatened or impaired. I do not think that there is any such contradiction. The only contradiction that I perceive in this part of the evidence is found in Mr Koloff’s conflicting opinions on underpinning.
	
	
	Accepting, for the moment, that it was open to the trial judge to accept Mr Koloff’s oral evidence on the need for underpinning (as opposed to his written evidence and as opposed to the evidence of Messrs MacLeod and Mitrevski), all that follows is that underpinning was necessary to control movement in the walls due to swell/shrink in the underlying clays. The evidence of Messrs MacLeod and Mitrevski confirmed what is (for many people in the Sydney Metropolitan Region) common knowledge: namely, that older houses built on clay soils will experience movement in the walls due to the swelling and shrinkage of the clay. It does not follow, simply because the walls move and crack, that the structural integrity of the building is compromised.
	
	
	Mr Koloff did not say in terms that the structural integrity of Mr Museth’s dwelling was compromised. His evidence (to the extent that it can be understood) was, rather, that the walls would continue to move, as the sub-surface clay expanded and contracted, and would continue to crack as a result. The suggested inconsistency in the findings of the primary judge depends on the assumption that such movement and cracking represents a threat to structural integrity. But as I have indicated, that assumption was not supported by any of the expert testimony, and is inconsistent with the testimony of Messrs MacLeod and Mitrevski.
	
	
	Thus, even if it were open to the primary judge to rely on the oral evidence of Mr Koloff, given over objection in re-examination, as to the necessity for underpinning, it does not follow that the primary judge erred in accepting the evidence of Mr Mitrevski (supported, I repeat, Mr MacLeod) that the cracking he observed had no structural significance. There was no evidence that any further cracking that might have occurred after each of those gentlemen made his inspection was so radically different to what each had observed as to require some different conclusion. It was not suggested to either Mr MacLeod or Mr Mitrevski that the cracking had worsened, to the extent that his opinion as to structural integrity was no longer valid.
	
	
	Further, to the extent that Mr Koloff’s opinion on the necessity for underpinning depends on his estimates (in the witness box, based on photographs) of the width of the cracks, there is a real area of doubt about the validity of his opinion. His estimate of the width of the cracks was very much at variance with the observations (in one case, supported by precise measurements) made by Messrs MacLeod and Mitrevski. It does not appear from Mr Koloff’s reports that he made any measurements, or even estimates, of the width of the cracks that he observed on his site visits.
	
	
	In the absence of any challenge to the evidence of Messrs MacLeod and Mitrevski as to the width of the cracks, and in the absence of any reliable contradictory evidence from Mr Koloff, the weight that could be given to his opinions expressed in re-examination is in my view minimal. That is because the opinion that he reached, based on the descriptions of the cracks as they appeared (in his view) from the photographs, appears to have little correlation with the unchallenged evidence on that topic.
	


Conclusions


	
	From that review of the expert evidence, the following conclusions may be stated as to ground 2 of the notice of contention and grounds 1 and 2 of the amended notice of appeal:
	



	
	the primary judge erred in permitting to be given, and (to the extent that he did) relying on, the evidence of Mr Koloff, given over objection in re-examination, as to the apparent extent of exterior cracking and the inferred need, based on those cracks, for underpinning.
	
	
	Even if it were open to the primary judge to receive and rely upon that evidence, it was not, properly understood, inconsistent with the evidence of Mr Mitrevski (and, I add yet again, Mr MacLeod) that the observed cracking posed no risk to the structural integrity of the plaintiff’s residence.
	
	
	Properly understood, Mr Koloff did not address, directly or by implication, the question of structural integrity.
	



	
	Once it is accepted that it was open to the primary judge to conclude, on the whole of the evidence, that the structural integrity of Mr Museth’s residence was not compromised, the remaining grounds of appeal (and ground 1 of the notice of contention) can be disposed of quickly.
	
	
	One way or another, grounds 3, 4, 7 and 8 of the amended notice of appeal raise the question of whether, in all the circumstances, the appropriate measure of damages for the nuisance is the cost of demolition and reconstruction of Mr Museth’s residence. That measure of damages could only be appropriate if:
	



	
	the cracking caused by the Club’s nuisance had caused the building to become structurally unsound; and
	
	
	the building could not be effectively or economically repaired; so that
	
	
	in consequence, the only way to make good the (hypothetical) damage was to demolish the building and reconstruct it.
	



	
	However, if the building is not structurally defective, then the issue of repair versus demolition and reconstruction does not arise. Since I have concluded that the primary judge was correct to find that the structural integrity of the building was not compromised, these grounds go nowhere. Even if the reasoning of the primary judge were inadequate or deficient in the ways alleged (and I am not to be taken as saying that I accept any of the criticisms made of his Honour’s reasons), there could be no different outcome.
	
	
	The same may be said as to ground 1 of the notice of contention, which says in effect that the decision of the primary judge should be upheld because, on his Honour’s findings and taking into account the abatement of the nuisance, demolition and reconstruction is not an appropriate measure of such loss as Mr Museth has sustained.
	
	
	I add that, on his Honour’s findings (which in essence I think are correct), the obvious measure of damages was, as his Honour pointed out, diminution in value. For whatever reason, no evidence of diminution of value was led. And even if, contrary to my view, damages should have been assessed by reference to the cost of demolition and reconstruction, there was no evidence of that cost before the primary judge.
	
	
	Mr Gross did not submit that if the primary judge had been correct in his conclusion that the structural integrity of Mr Museth’s residence was not compromised, nonetheless, his Honour had erred in assessing damages.
	
	
	Ground 5 of the amended notice of appeal goes nowhere. Even if the primary judge reasoned as the ground asserts, and erred in doing so, his Honour’s ultimate conclusion remains the correct one.
	
	
	Ground 6 of the amended notice of appeal complains of inadequacy of reasoning in some respects, and ground 8 complains that the damages awarded were inadequate. Ground 6 stands or falls with the matters that I have canvassed at length – specifically, the suggested inconsistency in the findings of the primary judge, and his Honour’s conclusion that the cost of demolition and construction did not provide the appropriate measure of damages. It falls with the earlier grounds on which it is based. Likewise, ground 8, which complains of the inadequacy of the damages notionally assessed, falls with those earlier grounds.
	


The question of leave


	
	Neither party addressed the question, whether leave to appeal was required. On one view, it may be. The primary judge assessed damages at $25,000. There was no evidence before his Honour of any alternative basis of assessment, because:
	



	
	his Honour rejected Mr Museth’s application for leave to reopen and tender evidence of the cost of underpinning; and
	
	
	in the principal judgment, his Honour rejected the evidence of Mr Parcell as to the cost of demolition and reconstruction.
	



	
	The amended notice of appeal does not challenge either of those decisions; nor has leave been sought (if it be necessary) to appeal from the first.
	
	
	There was no affidavit before this Court giving evidence as to what the cost of demolition or reconstruction might be. It is therefore at least open to question whether there is any “foundation for the allegation” that Mr Museth’s claim does exceed $100,000 in value (the quotation comes from Cole v The Commonwealth of Australia (1961) 106 CLR 653; [1961] HCA 87, at CLR 656).
	
	
	In my view, rather than put the parties to the trouble and expense of making submissions on the question of leave, the better course is to do as I have done, and deal with the merits of the appeal on the assumption that leave is not necessary.
	
	
	I should say that if the question of leave had been argued, and I had been persuaded that leave was required, I would not have been prepared to grant it. As the notice of appeal discloses, Mr Museth seeks a new trial limited to damages. However, if that new trial were limited to the evidence tendered before and found acceptable by the primary judge, the outcome must be the same. Thus, there would be no miscarriage of justice.
	
	
	Bearing in mind the matters set out at [120], [121] above, the only purpose to be served by ordering a new trial could be to permit Mr Museth to adduce admissible evidence of (for example) the cost of underpinning or the cost of demolition and reconstruction. I do not think that the interests of justice would be served by permitting this. The right to be heard does not, in the ordinary way, include the right to be heard twice; a trial and an appeal are not to be treated as preludes to a fresh trial where admissible and probative evidence is adduced with the benefit of the reasons given in the first trial and on appeal.
	


Proposed order


	
	I propose that the appeal be dismissed with costs.

		28 November 2016",2016-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
3013614,R v Zrinski [2015] NSWDC 417,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Jessica Jade Zrinski is a person who appeared before me at least six times over the past 12 months. When the matter was first before me I granted her an adjournment under s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. From that date Ms Zrinski has lamentably failed to indicate that she has a realistic attitude towards rehabilitation, at least in so far as it concerns her own drug use. Despite repeated promises that she will give up drugs and has given up drugs, every objective circumstance shows that she has not done so.
	
	
	On the last occasion she was here I gave her one last chance. I required that she be closely supervised by the probation and parole service and that weekly urinalysis was done. I told Ms Zrinski that if for some reason probation and parole did not do weekly urinalysis she should arrange her own. The matter has come back before me with not a single urinalysis test to be put before me and the most recent pre-sentence report tendered today indicates that she told probation and parole service that she had used drugs.
	
	
	Ms Zrinski’s attitude towards these proceedings has also been appalling, she was regularly late to court, on one occasion explaining that she wanted to get her nails done for court.
	
	
	Ultimately however as Mr Fraser reminds me I am not to sentence Ms Zrinski for failing to demonstrate rehabilitation I am to sentence her for her original offence, taking into account of course the poor prospects of rehabilitation that the past 12 months have demonstrated, and so I will turn now to what occurred on 21 October 2012 when Ms Zrinski was first arrested. Police saw her and her then boyfriend Chris Misefski and another man in a car. Because of their behaviour police asked them all to get out of the vehicle and began searching it. They found a number of drugs, including 20 brown pills which proved to be MDMA with a total weight of 6.156 grams. The offender pleaded guilty to supplying those drugs in the sense that she had them in her possession for the purposes of supply, that being something she did to assist her then boyfriend by, as she said to police, selling them at parties. Also found within the car was a small quantity of cocaine and $100 in the form of two $50 notes, the offender could provide no reasonable explanation as to how she came to be in possession of that money and so she asks me to take into account when I sentence her for the supply prohibited drug matter, two charges, one possessing the cocaine and the second, goods in custody relating to the money.
	
	
	There is another matter which I am to deal with, an offence on a s 166 certificate of hindering police. She told police that some other drugs which were found were hers when they were in fact those of her boyfriend. Police charged her with hindering police in those circumstances, saying that there was a delay in police investigations in relation to the true ownership of the drugs.
	
	
	Ms Zrinski pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. She also assisted the authorities, I will be very circumspect in what I say about this matter, in fact I will say little more than that because I have formed the opinion, consistent with what Mr Fraser asked me to do, that for her early plea of guilty and assistance to the authorities I have decided to impose a sentence upon her which is 40% less than would otherwise have been, and the assistance has also been one of a number of factors which have led to me to decide to impose a different form of sentence from that which would otherwise have been the case.
	
	
	The starting point for the actual type of sentence which should be imposed is of course the repeated authorities from the Court of Criminal Appeal which say that those who traffic to a substantial degree should receive sentences of fulltime custody unless there are exceptional circumstances. Here I am not satisfied that Ms Zrinski was trafficking to a substantial degree. She does have prior matters on her criminal history but nothing for drug supply and there is no evidence that the 20 tablets she was in possession of for the purposes of supplying on this occasion were part of an ongoing operation. Twenty tablets in themselves, whilst a significant quantity are not such that I would be satisfied that she was trafficking those in the sense that they involved drug trafficking to a substantial degree. So she does not need to demonstrate exceptional circumstances before I impose a sentence of other than fulltime custody. That does not mean that a sentence of fulltime custody should otherwise be imposed but such a sentence is very much a sentence of last resort.
	
	
	I do take into account that apart from the admitted criminal activity of buying drugs, or at least obtaining drugs and using them over the past year Ms Zrinski has apparently committed no further offence in the past two and a half years since her initial arrest. That is a matter in her favour.
	
	
	It is troubling that Ms Zrinski has repeatedly failed to appreciate the position that she is in. I have commented on her attitude towards these proceedings, it is demonstrative of a person who apparently believes that she can get through life telling lies, acting as she wishes to act, with no consequences befalling her.
	
	
	Mr Fraser asks that I impose a suspended sentence of imprisonment. I accept that there is at least a good possibility that Ms Zrinski will be unable to comply with the basic conditions of such a suspended sentence, namely that she is of good behaviour for the period of the bond. But I also accept that there is no principle of law that says a suspended sentence of imprisonment is inappropriate in the case of someone who is likely to fail. True it is that one might be more careful about imposing a suspended sentence on someone who was likely to commit further offences where those offences were, for example, involved significant violence. That is not of course to underestimate the harm that drug supply causes. That is to say that whilst the prospects of Ms Zrinski, being of good behaviour over that period of the bond are poor, the prospects that she will, in that period supply other drugs is also, on the material before me, somewhat unlikely. The risk I am taking I guess is that Ms Zrinski will not be of good behaviour by continuing to use drugs. If she does she will come back before me and it will then be probably the time that I will do what the Crown asks me to do today, send her into fulltime custody.
	
	
	I impose upon Ms Zrinski sentence as follows.
	
	
	For the s 166 matter I sentence her under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that is there is a conviction with no further penalty.
	
	
	For the supply prohibited drug matter, taking into account the two matters on the Form 1, I sentence Ms Zrinski to imprisonment for 18 months that term of imprisonment is suspended on condition that she enter into a bond to be of good behaviour for the period of the bond under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Conditions of the bond are as follows:
	
	
	She is to be of good behaviour. She is to accept the supervision of the probation and parole service including psychiatric and psychological counselling and treatment which the probation and parole service recommend or require for her. She is to take all medication prescribed for her. She is to participate in any drug and alcohol counselling as directed or recommended by the probation and parole service. She is to live with her father which means that she must stay at his place every night, unless permission to stay overnight elsewhere is granted in advance by the probation and parole service.

		29 November 2016",2015-05-14 00:00:00,NSW District Court
3021578,Julius Yates V Regina [2016] NSWDC 326,"Judgment


	
	Julius Yates (the appellant) appeals against a conviction entered by her Honour Magistrate McIntyre at Downing Centre Local Court on 11 May 2016. On that day the appellant was convicted of an offence of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to section 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.
	
	
	On 27 August 2015 the appellant was working as a bar attendant at the Lobo Plantation, licensed premises situated at 209 Clarence Street, Sydney (the premises). At about 6pm 2 undercover police officers codenamed “Natasha” and “Layla” entered the premises intending to purchase prohibited drugs pursuant to a Controlled Operation Authority.
	
	
	At about 7pm Layla went to the entrance to the premises and spoke to a security guard named Jay (the security guard). At that time Natasha had a conversation with the appellant that was recorded in Natasha’s statement as follows:
	


Appellant:   Do you want another drink?

Natasha:   Nah, my friend’s upstairs trying to get us some stuff.

Appellant:   Some special stuff?

Natasha:   Yeah, are you into the special stuff?

Appellant:   Yeah.

Natasha:   Do you know anyone that can help us out ‘cause I think my friend is having trouble.

Appellant:   I know someone that can probably help you out, he didn’t come through last week, but he can probably sort you out.


	
	Layla returned and showed the screen of her mobile phone to Natasha and the appellant. Layla had been given a mobile telephone number by the security guard at the entrance to the premises, stored under the contact “A1 Taxis” and recording the number 0451 102 171 (the mobile number). The appellant looked at it.
	
	
	Layla then had a conversation with the appellant in the presence of Natasha that was recorded in both of their statements as follows:
	


Layla:      Is this your guy?

Appellant:   Oh yeah that’s him. I’m in a bit of trouble with him at the moment.

Layla:      Oh I just got his number off Jay upstairs. I spoke with him, he said he was coming by and could help us out, he said to ask Joe behind the bar for prices. Is that you?

Appellant:   Yeah, that’s me.

Layla:      How much are we looking at for a gram?

Appellant:   It’s $300 for 1

Layla:      OK, cool. That’s fine.


	
	About an hour later, Layla was approached by the security guard and they went out to the street. Layla then received a text message from the mobile number that said “Outside”, to which she replied by text message “I’m with Jay”. Layla then approached a man of between 25-30 years of middle eastern appearance wearing a black t-shirt and jeans. The man supplied her with approximately 1g of cocaine for $300 in cash.
	
	
	Layla came back inside the premises. Natasha then went outside and was met by a man of middle eastern appearance aged about 25 years, with facial hair and wearing a black t-shirt and blue jeans. The man supplied her with approximately 1g of cocaine for $300 in cash. Natasha then returned to the bar.
	
	
	When Layla returned to the bar area she had a conversation with the appellant in the presence of Natasha that was recorded in their statements as follows:
	


Appellant:   How did you go?

Layla:      Yeah, all good. I think we are going off to the casino, we might see you guys tomorrow night though.

Appellant:   No worries, good luck ladies.


	
	The matter proceeded in the Local Court by the prosecution tendering the police statements. The prosecution witnesses were not required for cross-examination. The appellant did not lead any evidence.
	


The Relevant Law


	
	Section 18(1) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 provides that the appeal is a rehearing on the certified transcripts of evidence, obviously as supplemented by reference to the exhibits tendered in the Local Court and is not an appeal de novo: Gianoutsas v Glykis [2006] NSWCCA 137 at [24]-[31].
	
	
	The principles governing appeals from judges sitting without a jury apply in that the appellate judge is to form his or her own judgement of the facts while recognising the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called and observing the natural limitations stemming from proceeding wholly or substantially on the transcript record: Charara v R [2006] NSWCCA 244 at [17]-[22].
	
	
	The Court is obliged to give the judgement which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance: Fox v Percy (2003) 214 CLR 118 at [23].
	
	
	“Supply” as defined in section 3 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 includes sell and distribute, agreeing to supply, or offering for supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.
	
	
	Section 6 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 provides that a person takes part in the supply of a prohibited drug if the person takes or participates in any step, or causes any step to be taken in the process of that supply.
	
	
	Section 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 provides that a person who knowingly takes part in the supply of a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.
	
	
	A person can be guilty of taking part in a supply notwithstanding that no actual supply takes place, so long as a supply was in contemplation: Director of Public Prosecutions (SA) Reference No 2 of 1995 (1995) 65 SASR 508.
	
	
	Knowingly take part in supply has a degree of remoteness in point of time or place from the actual transaction amounting to supply. It is intended to cover the case in which the accused has not or cannot be shown to be guilty of the offence of supply, and it applies even though the contemplated supply does not take place: Deng v R (1996) 91 A Crim R 80.
	
	
	The word “supply” in section 6 has the extended meaning given to it by section 3 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985: R v Zaiter [2005] NSWCCA 61.
	
	
	In Zaiter the appellant was recorded as saying that he could arrange for the supply of a kilogram of cocaine to a third party, although no substantive details had been agreed for the actual supply of the drugs. The appellant gave evidence on an application to withdraw his plea that he did not have access to that quantity of the drug. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the trial judge’s ruling, refusing to allow the withdrawal of the guilty plea, on the basis that he had knowingly participated in a supply of drugs by offering to supply the cocaine, notwithstanding that there was no actual supply arranged and it was only in contemplation.
	


The appellant’s submissions


	
	The appellant submitted that he did no more in the conversations with the officers than say that he might know someone who could sell them drugs and to pass on information to them about that process from his own experience. It was contended that there was no evidentiary link between him and the ultimate supply.
	
	
	It was further contended that the appellant did not take part in a supply because he assisted the proposed buyers of the drugs.
	


Consideration


	
	In this matter there were no witnesses called and the magistrate was not required to make any credit findings to which I must have regard.
	
	
	The appellant did not challenge the prosecution evidence as to the officers’ conversations with him and I am satisfied that the conversations occurred in the terms set out.
	
	
	Having conducted an independent review of the evidence I am in agreement with the magistrate’s conclusion for the reasons that follow.
	
	
	The evidence makes it clear that the appellant knew that the officers were speaking to him about the purchase of prohibited drugs. The appellant then proceeded to take the following steps:
	



	
	He told the officers that he knew someone who may be able to supply them;
	
	
	He confirmed that the information they had been given as to the identity of the supplier was correct;
	
	
	He volunteered that he was the person “Joe” referred to by the supplier as the person who could give information about the price of cocaine; and
	
	
	He then told them that the price was $300 for a gram.
	



	
	These were all steps taken in the process of the supplier offering the cocaine for supply or agreeing to supply the cocaine for the price of $300 for a gram.
	
	
	It was not necessary for the appellant to be a third party to the supply to the officers, or in fact that any supply actually take place. In other words, the prosecution was not required to prove that the appellant was part of the joint criminal enterprise of the supply that occurred.
	
	
	Nevertheless, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was involved in the particular supply because he made an admission to the officers that he was the person referred to by the supplier who could tell them the price of the cocaine and did so. The officers were both then supplied the cocaine for that price.
	
	
	I do not accept it as a reasonable possibility that the appellant knew the price or would have been referred to by the supplier by reason of the appellant’s past purchases from the supplier. That is not to say that the appellant profited from the drug supply that took place. There is no evidence on this point and I cannot draw that inference from the other evidence.
	
	
	I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew that cocaine was being supplied by others at the premises and that he was a knowing participant in the supply to the officers, by taking the steps I have referred to.
	
	
	The appellant’s second submission is misconceived for 2 reasons. First, as a matter of fact the appellant assisted the supplier by referring the officers to him and by quoting a price. Second, in the ordinary course the purchaser of a prohibited drug is guilty of the offence of knowingly taking part in the supply because they cause the sale or distribution of the drug to occur by requesting the sale, accepting the offer to supply that is made and/or providing payment.
	
	
	The orders I make are:
	



	
	Appeal against conviction is dismissed.

		29 November 2016",2016-11-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
3021580,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 47) [2016] NSWSC 1007,"Judgment


	
	On the sixty ninth day of the trial, senior counsel appearing for Farhad Qaumi raised an objection to two portions of a sequence of telephone intercept material that the parties otherwise agree is admissible. I ruled that the particular portions were not admissible and that the recordings and associated transcripts should be edited before the material is presented to the jury. These are my brief reasons for that decision.
	
	
	The whole sequence of recordings was not tendered on the voir dire but the parties explained the context in which the two particular telephone calls (in which the impugned portions are found) were made. That context concerns a bag containing drugs and two firearms that, on the prosecution case, was left for safe-keeping with a person known as Witness A. As I understand it, it is the Crown case that the owners of the items in the bag were Farhad, Mumtaz and Jamil Qaumi. Each is charged with offences (counts 20, 21 and 22) arising from their alleged possession of the drugs and two guns. Witness A gave evidence that he received the bag from Jamil Qaumi and was given directions as to what to do with it. During the course of his evidence a number of telephone intercepts were tendered. These involved conversations with a person called Masieh Amiri who was a member of the Blacktown Brothers for Life. Witness A told Mr Amiri that the bag was with a third party who was refusing to return the bag unless he received money. This was a ruse because, by that time, the bag was in the possession of the police. The aim appeared to be to entrap Mr Amiri and to obtain evidence of the Qaumi brothers ownership or association with the bag and the items contained therein.
	
	
	The sequence of calls that are now to be played are calls between other people, including Mr Amiri, in relation to the same subject matter. A number of the calls do not involve any of the accused men. Some do. Mr Amiri will not be called to give evidence. For the most part, the parties are in agreement as to which calls should be played. As I understand, the joint position of the parties, is that the evidence is relevant to establish a connection between the three accused and the bag. In particular, the evidence constitutes an exception to the hearsay rule because (on the prosecution case), the representations contained within the calls were made in furtherance of a common purpose that the person had with the accused or one or more person including the accused: see ss 81 and 87 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The evidence may also be admissible on other bases but, one way or another, the parties are in agreement that the evidence is admissible.
	
	
	The first call subject of the objection is a call between Masieh Amiri and Mumtaz Qaumi at around 1pm on 8 January 2014. [1]  Objection was taken to the italicised parts of the following passage:
	


“MQ: Naa. Oy listen, try to get hold of this fucking little dog, [call his work, if he is there we will go to his work now].

MA: [the work is not telling me, remember last time I called F and told him. When F told me to call for the second time and give them his number so that they can call him. I called the office again and a lady answered and said why do you need him for], he went home, two second ago, she goes, he is just over here, I will call him. They put me on hold, she comes she goes, oh don’t call this number again cause he has left home and don’t call this number again. If you want to call his mobile number.”


	
	While that passage may be admissible against Mumtaz Qaumi, it contains inadmissible hearsay against Farhad Qaumi. The italicised passage is not a representation in furtherance of the common purpose. Rather, it is a “narrative statement of account of some past event”: see Landini v New South Wales [2007] NSWSC 259 (Hall J) at [25]. It may be that other parts of the passage are similarly objectionable but, in the course of argument, the objection was refined to the italicised portion. I ruled that it was not admissible.
	
	
	The second call was between Mr Amiri and another member of the Blacktown Brothers for Life, Harris Sadat. It occurred on 8 January 2014. Objection was taken to the following passage:
	


“HS: What about, how does the guy know it’s F’s stuff now.

MA: What do you mean.

HS: How is he going to know its F’s stuff?

MA: [Witness A]’s told him.

HS: [Witness A]’s told him?” [2] 


	
	Neither participant in the call is to give evidence. Again, this is a narrative of past events rather than an act done in furtherance of a common purpose.
	
	
	In both instances, the evidence had the capacity to establish controversial propositions of fact against Farhad Qaumi through hearsay evidence that is not properly the subject of any recognised or statutory exception to the hearsay evidence. Accordingly, the evidence was excluded.

		30 November 2016",2016-07-18 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
3021581,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 46) [2016] NSWSC 938,"Judgment


	
	On the sixty ninth day of the trial, counsel for the accused, Mohammed Kalal objected to part of the evidence to be led from two doctors (Dr Collins and Dr Gunja) concerning the injuries and disabilities sustained by the victim (H) [1]  of a shooting incident that gives rise to count 9 on the indictment. I ruled that the evidence of Dr Collins was not admissible but that the evidence of Dr Gunja was admissible. These are my reasons for those rulings.
	
	
	There is no dispute that on 4 November 2013 H received wounds from at least one gunshot and that, as a result, a large number of shotgun pellets were lodged in her body. While some of the pellets were removed surgically many remained (and remain) in her body. The evidence to which objection was taken concerned opinions given by the doctors that the pellets contained lead and evidence by Dr Gunja as to the medical consequences of that fact.
	
	
	In the case of Dr Collins, the issue was straightforward. His certificate merely stated that H “was known to have lead pellets behind L5”. There was no evidence as to the basis of his opinion that the pellets were lead and no evidence that he had expertise sufficient for him to proffer that opinion. Accordingly, I ruled that the reference to “lead” should be removed. There was no further objection to his certificate and the certificate was admitted in its edited form.
	
	
	The evidence of Dr Gunja was more complex. He had expertise in forensic toxicology and his evidence was based on that expertise. There was objection to two parts of his statement. The first concerned his opinion that H had elevated lead levels caused by the shotgun pellets that remained in her body. The relevant part of his certificate was as follows:
	


“6. H was referred to me for review as the many embedded pellets from the incident contained lead and were slowly leaching out lead particulars. Although many of the pellets had been removed during surgery, there still appeared a few hundred pellets on imaging studies. H also stated that small metallic pieces exfoliate from her skin on regular basis.

7. H has an elevated blood lead level (BLL) from the residential pellets. This has caused a chronic low-level lead toxicity, which is likely to continue for many years, if not for the rest of her life. The lead in her blood redistributes and deposits in other tissues such as bone and joints. Though H does not have any overt signs of severe lead toxicity, the lead deposition is likely to have an increasing contribution to her chronic pain in bones and joints.

8. H’s lead and haemoglobin (Hb) levels over time are shown in the table below:


	
		
			
			Date
			
			
			Nov 2013
			
			
			Jan 2014

9. Though these lead levels have fluctuated between 15-30 ug/dl, they are below the threshold for active treatment with chelation. As H has ongoing lead exposure, chelation is likely to only lower BBL transiently and unlikely to have any measurable benefit on her long-term prognosis. H’s toxicological treatment involves vitamin and iron supplementation and monitoring of her BLL and haemoglobin.”


	
	Initially I was inclined to accept the submission that the evidence asserting that the pellets were lead involved circular reasoning. That is, the doctor made an assumption (or had been told) that the pellets were lead and had therefore concluded that the elevated lead levels were the result of the pellets. That finding, in turn, led to a conclusion that the pellets were made of lead in spite of the fact that the evidence of that fact was not clear. The pellets had not been tested and a police officer with some relevant expertise had conceded that not all shotgun pellets were made of lead and that manufacturers were trying to phase out the use of lead in the construction of shotgun pellets. [2]  At that stage there was no evidence of the significance of the elevated lead levels, no evidence of other possible explanations for those levels and no evidence that other causes or explanations had been, or could be, excluded.
	
	
	Having heard my preliminary view, the Crown sought to examine Dr Gunja on the voir dire. He was also cross-examined. Having heard his evidence on the voir dire I was satisfied that the evidence was admissible.
	
	
	Dr Gunja gave evidence that a “normal” lead level in the body is zero although people sometimes have readings of up to 5 (micrograms per decilitre) without causing concern. H’s readings since the shooting were 19.5, 27.1, 16, 24, 17.6 and 137. Levels between 10 and 40 are considered to be elevated to a moderate degree. Levels above 40 are considered high and above 100 are considered to be very high and create risk of serious toxicity and death. Other explanations for elevated lead levels included eating food cooked in very old saucepans made of lead, breathing lead in the atmosphere (eg from leaded petrol or nearby mines), certain alternative medicines and swallowing a foreign object made of lead (eg a fishing sinker). Apart from the pellets embedded in H’s body, there was no other explanation for the elevated lead levels in this particular patient.
	
	
	He denied the proposition that that he had made an assumption that the elevated lead levels were caused by the pellets. He said that when he sees a patient with lead toxicity he makes “a thorough assessment about potential sources of lead” and did so in H’s case. He questioned her and her family and was unable to find any other sources of lead. He accepted that he had not tested the pellets himself. He had studies scans and x-rays and identified no other sources such as a lead foreign body in her stomach.
	
	
	He said “in the absence of other sources and a gunshot pattern that is very similar to other cases of lead toxicity from these type of injuries, it would be the most obvious source of the lead”.
	
	
	I was satisfied that the witness was qualified to provide the opinion that the elevated lead levels were connected with the pellets remaining in H’s body and that his opinion was based on his experience and qualifications and not on an assumption as to the source of the lead or the constituents of the pellets. I was satisfied that the reasoning was not circular or self-fulfilling.
	
	
	In reaching that conclusion I took into account the police officer’s evidence, referred to in passing above at [5] included the following:
	


“Q. Okay. And again just using your expertise and knowledge if you wouldn't mind, for many years now the shot inside a shotgun cartridge, for environmental reasons if no other, is often no longer lead, is that right?

A. The majority is still lead but they have other alternatives such as steel.

Q. Tungsten?

A. Tungsten, other

Q. Bismuth, is it called that, a naturally occurring metal, b i s m u t h?

A. I am not familiar with that one.

Q. But certainly lead is on the way out?

A. They are trying to move away from lead projectiles”.


	
	I accept that this evidence is imprecise and that it is not clear what “the majority still is” really means. I accept that the best method of determining whether the pellets were made of lead would have been to have some of them tested. However, these facts do not diminish the cogency of Dr Gunja’s evidence or undermine his expertise and capacity to offer the opinions contained in paragraphs 6-9 of his certificate.
	
	
	Accordingly, I ruled that paragraphs 6-9 of the report were admissible.
	
	
	A further and different objection was taken to paragraph 10 of the certificate which was in the following terms:
	


“10. There is no current evidence of renal, cardiac or liver toxicity from her persistently elevated lead levels. In future, her chronic lead toxicity may lead to hypertension, iron deficiency anaemia, neurocognitive impairment, renal disease and infertility. There is significant concern for the ability of H to bear children and the risk of neuroplumbism in any potential offspring. If she were to fall pregnant, there is an increased risk of impaired neurodevelopment to the growing foetus, particularly when material BLL is above 5 µg/dL. This could lead to cognitive or other neurological impairment after birth.”


	
	It was submitted that this evidence was emotive and highly prejudicial. In view of the fact that none of the accused dispute that the injuries suffered by H constitute grievous bodily harm, the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice: s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). It was further submitted that the concerns and risks expressed in paragraph 10 were speculative and may never manifest themselves. Accordingly, the evidence may be misleading: s 135 of the Evidence Act.
	
	
	Dr Gunja accepted that it was possible that H might fall pregnant and that she may give birth to a normal healthy child. However, he said that if she became pregnant, it was “almost certain” that the foetus would be exposed to lead. When it was put to him that “this may happen or it may not happen, we simply do not know” he replied:
	


“No. What I mean by that paragraph is that there is an increased risk if her lead levels stay above 5, which they are likely to for the rest of her life. There is an increased risk. It is not that there isn’t an increased risk or there is one. There definitely is an increased risk. Whether something happens or not is another question. Here I am talking about risk.”


	
	He accepted it was possible that H could fall pregnant and have a healthy baby but said “I don’t know if it’s a reasonable scenario”.
	
	
	I formed the view that the risk of infertility and complications for the issue of any pregnancy was a matter that was highly probative of the question whether the injuries sustained by H constituted grievous bodily harm. While I accept that defence counsel do not intend to dispute this element of count 9, the Crown is entitled to establish that element of the offence. I did not accept that the evidence was misleading or likely to be misused in any way.
	
	
	Reliance was placed on the gender balance of the jury which includes a number of young women. Around half of the members of the jury (currently of 14) are women. I did not accept that the nature of risk around fertility and childbirth would create a risk of unfair prejudice or that the make-up of the jury increased the risk of unfair prejudice.
	
	
	For those reasons, I also allowed the Crown to lead the evidence in paragraph 10 of the doctor’s certificate.

3021741,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 21) [2016] NSWSC 402,"Judgment


	
	On Thursday 7 April 2016, a number of the accused made application under s 53B of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) that an individual juror be discharged. After a series of inquiries, each of the accused withdrew that application. I decided that the juror should remain on the jury and the trial continued. These are my reasons for that decision.
	
	
	On Monday 4 April 2016, following a pre-trial hearing that commenced in November 2015, a jury of 15 was empanelled to commence the trial of 5 men on a total of 24 counts. The estimated length of the trial is 4-6 months. The allegations include 5 separate shooting incidents – including one charge of murder – allegedly perpetrated by members of a group that the prosecution says is a criminal gang called the Brothers for Life, Blacktown Chapter. The process of empanelment was complicated by legitimate concerns raised by the accused as to the amount of publicity that the case has attracted and concerns that a lay jury may have difficulty bringing impartial consideration to the issues that arise in the trial.
	
	
	The jury panel was provided with a witness list and other documents to ensure that they knew nothing about the case or the witnesses that might prevent them from bringing an impartial mind to bear on the issues. The jury was provided with more information than is customary to comply with s 38(7) of the Jury Act and the Prosecutor’s remarks to the panel under that section was more extensive than is usually the case.
	
	
	On three or four separate occasions I called on members of the panel to ask to be excused under s 38 either for personal reasons or because they felt that they may not be able to bring an impartial mind to bear on the issues. A number of members of the panel made such applications and were excused with no inquiry beyond a brief statement (either in writing or verbally to me) of their reason for seeking to be excused.
	
	
	On Thursday 8 April 2016 at the short adjournment I received a note from the jury. The note (MFI 10) was in the following terms:
	


“One of the jurors has become aware that one of the prison officers is someone they know. They have not spoken in over 2 years so they are not close acquaintances. Thank you.”


	
	In some cases, such a note – by itself – would create a problem because it establishes that the juror might readily, and correctly, conclude that the accused is in custody. In some cases, the parties are careful to ensure that the jury is not aware that the accused is in custody. That fact is an irrelevancy and has some capacity to cause prejudice. This is not an issue in the present case for two reasons. First, the nature of the charges is such that it would come as no surprise to the jury that the accused have not been granted bail. Secondly, there will be evidence in the case that necessarily shows that the accused are (or were since being charged) in custody. This includes evidence of recordings (captured by surveillance device and telephone intercept) made when the accused were in custody. In fact, on the third day of the trial (the first day of evidence) Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi put to a police officer that she was mistaken in saying that she spoke to Farhad Qaumi on a particular date because the accused was in custody at that time [1] .
	
	
	Initially, counsel for each accused indicated that no problem arose from the disclosure that the juror had some acquaintance with one of the Corrective Services Officers. However, shortly thereafter, counsel for Mr Zarshoy indicated that there may be an issue due to the nature of some of the officers in charge of transporting and guarding the accused in court. Counsel were allowed a period to contemplate their position and a short time later each of the accused indicated either that the juror should be discharged or that further inquiries should be made as to the extent of the acquaintance and whether the juror knew anything about the nature of the officer’s job within the Department of Corrective Services.
	
	
	The concerns of counsel were, potentially, well founded. The concern arose from the fact that a number of the officers are from a particular unit known (I think) as the Extreme High Security Transport Unit (“EHSTU”). These officers are specially trained and are engaged in cases where a determination has been made that a particular inmate represents a significant security risk. If the officer in question was from that unit, and the juror knew that, the juror might conclude that the accused were considered by authorities to be particularly dangerous prisoners. This had a potential to impact on the juror’s capacity to judge the case impartially.
	
	
	When issues such as this arise in a jury trial, the matter must be approached with significant caution and circumspection. For one thing, any inquiry that might intrude on the sanctity of discussions in the jury room must be avoided. For another, there is a risk that interrogating the juror may alert the juror to the kind of concern that is being expressed by counsel. In the present case, counsel was unable to agree on precisely what questions (if any) should be asked if the juror was to be examined.
	
	
	The jury was released for an extended lunch hour while further discussions took place in its absence. The jury was directed not to discuss the matter that was subject of their note. [2] 
	
	
	The Crown Prosecutor suggested a possible first step that would enable us to know whether the officer in question was, in fact, a member of the particular unit. That was to ask the juror, through the Court officer to write down the name of the Corrective Services Officer on a note that would be confidential and only read by me. It was then proposed that I direct an inquiry to the senior officer in court as to whether that officer was in fact a member of the unit. I adopted this approach.
	
	
	As it turned out, the officer was not from the EHSTU but the senior officer indicated (through the court officer in whispers) that it was “more complicated than that.” In saying this, the officer showed significant astuteness and good judgment. All parties agreed that it was appropriate for me to consult with the senior officer in chambers and in confidence. It emerged, and was disclosed to the parties, that while the officer was not a member of the EHSTU, she was from a similarly qualified unit based in Goulburn known as the Security Operations Group. Some of the accused have been held at the gaol commonly known as the Goulburn Super Max prison. [3] 
	
	
	This information caused each of the accused to apply for a discharge of the juror. Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi expressed the concern that he was instructed that the particular officer had searched his client’s cell. The learned Crown Prosecutor opposed the discharge of the juror on the basis that the statutory criteria allowing for discharge of an individual juror had not been established. Section 53B of the Jury Act is in the following terms:
	


“s 53B Discretionary discharge of individual juror

The court or coroner may, in the course of any trial or coronial inquest, discharge a juror if:

(a) the juror (though able to discharge the duties of a juror) has, in the judge’s or coroner’s opinion, become so ill, infirm or incapacitated as to be likely to become unable to serve as a juror before the jury delivers their verdict or has become so ill as to be a health risk to other jurors or persons present at the trial or coronial inquest, or

(b) it appears to the court or coroner (from the juror’s own statements or from evidence before the court or coroner) that the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of the juror’s familiarity with the witnesses, parties or legal representatives in the trial or coronial inquest, any reasonable apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason, or

(c) a juror refuses to take part in the jury’s deliberations, or

(d) it appears to the court or coroner that, for any other reason affecting the juror’s ability to perform the functions of a juror, the juror should not continue to act as a juror.”


	
	While sub-paragraph (d) is in very wide terms and goes beyond the matters covered by sub-paragraph (b), on the information then available it was not clear that the juror’s ability to perform the functions of the jury was compromised. At that stage I determined to separate the juror from the balance of the jury and to examine her on oath or affirmation in the presence of the parties.
	
	
	The juror gave the following evidence in answer to questions from the Bench:
	


“Q. I just have two questions one is whether or not you have any knowledge of the officer's job or position in the department?

A. No, I mean I understood that she was in the department but I've never spoken to her, I don't know to what level she is.

Q. Thank you. When you say you have never spoken to her?

A. In regards to the job.

Q. You just knew she was an employee of the Department?

A. Yes.

Q. Apart from telling your fellow jurors the fact of your knowledge and what was disclosed, have you had any further conversations with them about your relationship, if you like, or how you know this officer?

A. No, no, when we spoke originally about it I just said I knew her through my brother and that's all it's been.” [4] 


	
	Senior Counsel for Farhad Qaumi immediately withdrew the application for the discharge of the jury. The remaining accused were given a short time to receive advice and provide instructions. The juror remained separated from the remaining 14 members of the jury for that short period.
	
	
	Counsel for each of the remaining accused then withdrew the various applications for the individual juror to be discharged. Those applications were accordingly, and for the reasons I have briefly set out above, dismissed.
	
	
	The juror returned to the jury room, the jury returned to the court and the trial proceeded. [5] 
	
	
	The incident demonstrated that the jury had paid very close attention to the procedure followed during the empanelment process and were fastidious in obeying directions that they disclose any knowledge of the witnesses or the events that might give rise to an appearance of partiality.
	
	
	As I indicated after the incident was resolved, I was grateful to counsel for the flexibility and thoughtfulness of their submissions as the matter developed and for their assistance in determining the proper steps to ensure the integrity of the trial process.

		30 November 2016",2016-04-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
3021742,R v Qaumi & Ors (No 22) [2016] NSWSC 403,"EX tempore Judgment


	
	On 7 April 2016, Jamil Qaumi raised an objection to the Crown's proposed tender of one photograph, which is numbered 17 of 258, and a DVD that contains something known as an ISRAPS presentation. The ISRAPS is created by taking a series of photographs of and near a crime scene and then, by use of a particular software program, creating a presentation through or by which the user or viewer is able to move between various camera locations, to pan around 360 degrees from each point of view, and to zoom in and out while viewing the individual photographs.
	
	
	In this instance, the photographs from which the ISRAPS was derived were taken from a number of locations on Bardo Circuit, Revesby Heights and within the garage of the residence at 28 Bardo Circuit, Revesby Circuits. That is the address where the shooting of Mahmoud Hamzy and Omar Ajaj took place.
	
	
	In both cases, the objection is that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. It is an objection grounded in s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).
	
	
	The potential prejudice arises from the fact that the scene depicts the bloody aftermath of the shooting. The parties had reached agreement as to the exclusion of a number of the photographs. In particular a photograph numbered 18 of 258 was excluded by agreement and this was tendered on the voir dire as defence exhibit VD 24. The concern raised by counsel was that the jury could see the same image if it used the ISRAPS, focused on the relevant area and zoomed in.
	
	
	The parties arranged for this to be rehearsed in the absence of the jury. I was provided with a brief overview of the use that the Crown intended to make of the ISRAPS while tendering the bundle of photographs and sketch plans taken by Senior Constable Lee, a crime scene officer who had attended 28 Bardo Circuit. I viewed what counsel for Jamil Qaumi contended was the most troubling image able to be obtained from the ISRAPS.
	
	
	In order to allow the jury to return and for the trial to continue, I made two rulings. The first was that photograph 17 was to be excluded. The second was to allow the Crown to use the ISRAPS for the purpose of presenting the crime scene evidence but to have the DVD marked for identification and to defer the issue of whether the DVD could be tendered and, if so, whether it would be allowed to be taken to the jury room during the trial or during deliberations.
	
	
	Counsel did not take objection to the ISRAPS being used while being presented by the Crown Prosecutor in the presence of the parties, Rather, the concern was (and remains) allowing the jury to use the DVD in the privacy of the jury room when it would be able to focus on particular parts of the images and zoom in on parts, including the area depicted in exhibit VD 24.
	
	
	This morning, at my request, the ISRAPS was again set up so that I am able to see, as I speak, the particular still image at what I understand to be maximum zoom and this is the image that is said to raise the same issues that led the Crown to agree to exclude the photograph number 18 which is exhibit VD 24. A “screen shot” of this image was tendered on the voir dire. [1] 
	


Photograph 17


	
	My reason for excluding photograph 17 was that the same image but taken from a greater distance or using a lesser zoom is contained in photograph 15 of 258. The only added element in photograph 17 is that there is a right angled ruler providing the viewer with a better idea of scale. I determined that if scale was significant, oral evidence could be given to provide that information. Photograph 17 had no probative value beyond that of photograph 15. Further, the close-up view shows an area of blood stain that could potentially arouse an emotional response. In the end, it was the lack of probative value, rather than the potential for prejudice, that caused me to exclude photograph 17.
	
	
	I accept that the image is somewhat disturbing and that it may, as counsel submitted, be interpreted as showing brain matter in addition to blood. There is no evidence that it is brain matter and it is really a matter of speculation. In any event, photographs such as these are commonly tendered in murder trials and they are not the kind that would arouse the kind of emotional response that will cause the jury to lose its objectivity.
	


The ISRAPS presentation


	
	The ISRAPS presentation is a valuable evidentiary tool that allows the tribunal of fact ""virtually"" to move around the crime scene and get a much better perspective and understanding of the surroundings. Of course, it is not perfect but it gives a better understanding of what is depicted in the photographs, the angles from which the photographs were taken and the physical dimensions and qualities of the crime scene.
	
	
	The image that was shown in the course of the voir dire, [2]  depicts the same area of the room as that shown in exhibit VD 24 (photograph 18) that the prosecution agreed to take out of the bundle of photographs. However, the fact that the Crown, in deference to concerns raised by defence counsel, agreed to the removal of the photographs ought not to be seen as a concession of inadmissibility. It may be that it is simply a demonstration of the restrained approach taken by the Crown and its sensitivity to matters that troubled counsel for the accused.
	
	
	Photograph 18 shows a ""copper coloured impact damaged bullet"", near a police marker G. It appears to be an area of pooling of blood. Immediately underneath an inverted G on the marker is an item which is I think self-evidently (although there was some doubt raised in argument) [3]  a tooth. I take it that this is the item, perhaps along with what counsel says may be fluid from the brain, referred to in argument as ""possible body parts"". [4] 
	
	
	Counsel submitted that the image derived from the ISRAPS is ""even worse"" than the image in exhibit VD 24. I am unable to agree. Even at the highest zoom allowed by the ISRAPS the tooth is unable clearly to be made out. The most that can be said is that it may be a tooth.
	
	
	The zoom on photograph 18 creates a closer image, although counsel is correct when she submits that the image derived on the TV screen from the ISRAPS has better clarity. Even allowing for the possibility or fact that the image derived from the ISRAPS depicts a tooth, and that a jury might interpret part of the blood stain as being fluid from the brain, I am not satisfied that the probative value of the ISRAPS is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused.
	
	
	As the Crown Prosecutor submitted, this is a murder trial. The allegation is that the deceased was shot in the head at close range. The images with which we are dealing with far removed from the kind of gruesome images that are often the subject of objections such as these.
	
	
	I accept that as lawyers practising in this field of endeavour, we become somewhat immune to the emotional reactions that may be provoked in a lay observer. However, even allowing for the sensitivities of some members of the jury, I am of the view that there is no great capacity for the ISRAPS to be misused or to create a danger of unfair prejudice. At the same time it has a high degree of probative value and is a useful tool for a jury in understanding the scene where the alleged murder occurred.
	
	
	I propose, therefore, to allow the Crown to tender the ISRAPS presentation and, when the time comes, to allow the jury to have access to it and the capacity to play it in the jury room.
	
	
	In that last regard, I note that s 55A of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW) specifically provides that a judge may refuse to allow an exhibit to go into the jury room if the safety of the jury would be put at risk. That is not the situation here and it could be argued that the absence of a specific provision would raise a doubt over the proposal (which came from me) that the exhibit not be allowed into the jury room. However, I have little doubt that the Court would have the power to control the use of an exhibit if it has some potential for prejudice.
	
	
	If in the course of the trial counsel is able to draw my attention to some other feature of the ISRAPS presentation that creates a danger of unfair prejudice, I am happy to revisit this issue before the jury retires to deliberate. In the meantime, in the absence of a specific request from the jury, I do not propose to allow the jury to have access to this exhibit in the jury room before it retires to consider its verdicts.
