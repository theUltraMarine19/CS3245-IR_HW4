ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Theft—Travel agency received
funds for airline tickets—Airline not paid and customers without ticket or
refund—Whether or not theft of monies paid under direction.

Courts—Supreme Court of
Canada—Jurisdiction—Jurisdiction restricted to questions of law—Appeal as of
right from court of appeal judgment with dissent—Whether or not dissenting
opinion based on question of law or of fact—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, ss. 283, 290, 292, 294, 618.

Appellant appeals as of right from a judgment
of the Alberta Court of Appeal upholding convictions of theft, Moir J.A.
dissenting. Clients of a travel agency—appellant was its president and
principal shareholder—booked tours through and made payment to the agency. The
clients did not receive their tickets. Only a portion of the amount paid the
agency had in turn been paid to the tour operator. The trial judge predicated
the finding of theft under s. 283 of the Code and the majority of
the Court of Appeal under ss. 283, 290 and 292; the dissenting judge was of the
opinion that the convictions could not be supported by these sections.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

As the appellant came to the Court as of right
under s. 618(1)(a) and since a finding of theft under any one of
ss. 283, 290 and 292 is sufficient for a conviction, the appeal must be
dismissed in the absence of a dissent on a question of law with respect to any
one of those sections. The dissent with the Court of Appeal’s finding of theft
under s. 292 was not a disagreement on a question of law but on one of
fact. The difference of opinions was as to whether there was evidence that the
funds were advanced “with the express instruction to acquire on behalf of [the]
customer[s] a specified com-

[Page 61]

modity or service” and whether there was
evidence that appellant knew that he was applying money for purposes contrary
to his clients’ directions. There was evidence on which a finding of direction
could be reasonably made.

The convictions under s. 292 were not
the result of an error of law. While expectations standing alone do not amount
to a direction, expectations known to the recipient of money as a result of
“express instructions” are directions.

15 C.C.C. (2d) 1, 15 Alta. L.R. (2d) 250, 27 A.R. 91, upholding convictions for
theft pronounced by Feehan P.C.J. Appeal dismissed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Appellant was convicted of eight counts
of theft by a District Court Judge in Calgary. His convictions were upheld by the Alberta Court of Appeal, Moir
J.A. dissenting.

THE FACTS

The eight convictions of the appellant, a travel
agent, for theft, were each in respect of money valued at more than $200, the
property of eight named persons who were all clients of a travel agency.

The appellant was the principal shareholder and
president of that travel agency, R.B. & C. Agencies Limited. The following
statement of the relevant facts by McGillivray C.J.A. is not in dispute.

The company was incorporated in May of 1970
and functioned as a travel agency until about the middle of June, 1978. The
other shareholders were the Appellant’s wife and his daughter. The business was
operated from rented premises by an office manager, a bookkeeper and
Mrs. Lowden, who was an assistant to the bookkeeper. The Appellant did the
banking on behalf of the company

[Page 62]

and had signing authority to issue cheques
on the company’s accounts.

The company operated three bank accounts—a
trust account, a general account and a U.S. account. The so-called trust account was reserved for the purpose
of receiving and paying out money for airline tickets. The so-called general
account was used for the purpose of paying out moneys for tours, rent-a-car
arrangements and hotel reservations, and the U.S. account was reserved for the purpose of receiving and paying out
moneys in U.S. funds.

It is clear that the accounts, and in
particular the trust account, were not designed for the specific purpose of
separating moneys belonging to the company from moneys belonging to customers.
As was mentioned, the company operated for a period of approximately eight
years. It is to the accused’s credit that while considerable volumes of
business were done, increasing each year, at no time before June of 1978 did
any of the agency’s customers fail to get tickets or reservations which they
had paid for. In 1975, sales amounted to nearly $300,000.00; this increased the
next year to $597,000.00 and in 1977 to $841,000.00. The company books were at
all times currently kept up and were meticulously accurate.

Evidence relating to financial reports
showed that in 1975 the company lost close to $12,000.00; in 1976 close to
$22,000.00; and in 1977, something over $23,000.00. In 1976 the Appellant had
an outstanding shareholder’s loan to the company of $47,000.00 odd. By 1978,
that. loan had increased to $77,000.00. Part of that shareholder’s loan was
secured by a second mortgage against the Appellant’s house.

…

In 1978 the Appellant arranged for
overdraft privileges at his bank of up to $10,000.00, but these privileges were
cancelled when the company began being overdrawn and not having the money the
next day to cover the overdrafts.

A bank account reconciliation by the
company’s bookkeeper showed that as of January 20, 1978, cheques written
on the general account exceeded deposits by $11,669.50. The trust account was
similarly overdrawn by $2,233.26, and the U.S. account by $1,037.85. A later reconciliation indicated that as of February 22, 1978, the general account was
overdrawn by $11,796.28, and the U.S. account by $1,405.88, while in the trust account there remained a
positive balance of $2,432.83.

After the February reconciliation the
appellant directed that these monthly reports cease; he was more

[Page 63]

interested in the amount of funds on
deposit from day to day at the bank than in the total overdraft picture.

…

From May until approximately the middle of
June, the company was in a very difficult financial position, with a great deal
of pressure for payment from every side.

It further appears that from February 1978
on, by which time the accounts were generally in an overdraft position, (that
is, there were more cheques outstanding than there was money in the accounts),
that the Appellant determined which cheques of those outstanding, the bank
should honour. Loretta Ann McMillan, an employee of the Bank of Nova Scotia
gave this evidence:

Q. All right, and were there other cheques
in the group that went in with the $2,000 cheque?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. What happened to those other cheques?

A. The $404 which made up the other cheques
in the group were returned.

Q. For what reason?

A. Non-sufficient funds.

Q. Can you tell me why the $2,000 would go
through and the other cheques totalling $404 would not go through?

A. Well, when R.B. & C. Travel Agencies
account was overdrawn, the next morning when Mr. Lowden came in he would
put in enough money to cover certain cheques and they were the ones that got
paid and the rest were returned.

Q. Who would decide which cheques would be
paid and which ones would be returned? A. Mr. Lowden did.

Q. Can you tell us when N.S.F. cheques were
started in 1978 with respect to the statements of account?

A. In February.

Q. And did they continue from that time on?

A. Yes, they did.

The cheque, exhibit 38, referred to in
McMillan’s evidence, was dated June 13, 1978. It was for $2,000.00 and the
payee was the Appellant. It was cashed by the bank rather than other cheques,
on the direction of the Appellant. The proceeds were handed to the Appellant in
cash.

The eight counts before the Court arise out
of similar circumstances: It will be sufficient for illustration pur-

[Page 64]

poses to review the facts which gave rise
to Counts #1,2 and 3. These counts relate to the Perrys’.

On January 27th, 1978, Noreen Perry attended
at the offices of R.B. & C. Agencies Limited and booked a European tour for
herself and her husband, with a departure date of July 29th, 1978. She
deposited $100.00. On February 2nd she returned and booked two tours for her
son and daughter, paying a $200.00 deposit. Those deposits were duly paid by
R.B. & C. Agencies Limited to hold the reservations. Later, the daughter
sent to Mrs. Perry a cheque dated May 15, 1978 in the sum of $1,044.00.
Mrs. Perry turned that over to the agency on May 24th, 1978. The cheque,
payable to Mrs. Perry although, apparently not endorsed, was deposited to
the company’s bank account on May 25th, 1978. Mrs. Perry’s son sent her a bank draft which was turned over
to the company on May 25th, 1978. It appears that the proceeds of this draft
also went into the company’s bank account. Finally, Mrs. Perry turned over
to the company her own cheque for $266.00 and her husband’s cheque in the
amount of $260.00. Her cheque was dated June 9th and her husband’s cheque was
dated June 7th. They were both deposited to the company’s account on June 12th, 1978.

It appears that cheques were drawn on
behalf of the company to cover the payments entitled to be made on behalf of
the Perrys’, but the cheques were never signed.

At the end of June, 1978, Mrs. Perry
returned to the offices of R.B. & C. Agencies Limited to pick up the
tickets, only to find the premises closed. She and her husband never took their
tour. The $100.00 deposit was transferred to the credit of the son’s and
daughter’s tour. The balance owing on the latter tours—the sum of $1,980.00 was
paid by the Perrys’ directly to the tour operator. The operator’s
representative testified at trial that only the $300.00 in deposits was ever
received from the appellant’s agency.

As I have mentioned above, the
circumstances leading up to the other five counts were similar, each involving
a payment to the company in May or June of 1978 for travel arrangements, be
they transportation or accommodation or both, and a deposit by the Appellant to
the company’s bank account. In all cases the arrangements were not made by R.B.
& C., and the complainant either had to pay the operator directly, or to
forego his travel plans. All complainants were reimbursed by the Appellant
after the preliminary inquiry in this matter.

[Page 65]

Appellant comes to this Court as of right under
s. 618(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

618. (1) A
person who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose conviction is
affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada;

(a) on any question of law on which
a judge of the court of appeal dissents, or

…

Theft is an indictable offence by virtue of
s. 294  of the Criminal Code .

294. Except
where otherwise provided by law, every one who commits theft

(a) is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years, where the property stolen
is a testamentary instrument or where the value of what is stolen exceeds two
hundred dollars; or

(b) is guilty

(i) of an indictable offence and is liable
to imprisonment for two years, or

(ii) of an offence punishable on summary
conviction,

where the value of what is stolen does not
exceed two hundred dollars.

There are various ways of committing theft,
three of which are found at ss. 283, 290 and 292 of the Code.

The indictment referred only to the unlawful
stealing of money under s. 294 (a) and did not specify upon which
substantive definitional section or sections the Crown predicated its
allegation of “unlawful stealing”.

The trial judge predicated his finding of theft
under s. 283 of the Code.

McGillivray C.J.A. and Brennan J. (ad hoc)
of the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, but found theft by the
appellant also under ss. 290 and 292 of the Code. Moir J.A., dissenting,
was of the view that the convictions could not stand on any of these three
sections, and one can reasonably assume, as implicit in his conclusion that an
acquittal should be entered, that he was of the view that the requirements of
no other theft section of the Code had been satisfied.

[Page 66]

Two observations must then be made before
considering the facts giving rise to the prosecution and the judgments below.

First, in determining whether the accused was
properly convicted, this Court can only consider and determine, for the purpose
of giving corrective effect if error is found, questions of law on which Moir
J.A. dissented. In the absence of any such dissent, the appeal will be quashed
as the Court would be without jurisdiction, there being no question of law upon
which to rest the right of appeal.

Secondly, as it is sufficient for a conviction
to be entered that theft be found under any one of the definitional theft
sections in the Code, the appeal will be dismissed if, as
regards the application of any one of those sections, this Court finds no
dissent on a question of law.

Though I find dissent on a question of law by
Moir J.A. as regards ss. 283 and 290, I would nevertheless dismiss this appeal,
as I am of the view that Moir J.A.’s disagreement with the Court of Appeal’s
finding of theft under s. 292 of the Code was not a disagreement on
a question of law, but one on a question of fact.

We, therefore, need not consider this appeal as
regards ss. 283 and 290, and I shall limit reference to the pronouncements
below and the findings of facts to those related to the alleged error of law
the object of Moir J.A.’s alleged dissent as regards s. 292, which
appellant reformulated at the hearing before this Court as follows:

With respect to s. 292  of the
Criminal Code —Did the Court of Appeal of Alberta
err in law in holding that there need not be any “specific direction”,
either orally or in writing, by the person paying the money (i.e. customer) to
the person receiving it (i.e. Appellant) as to the purpose for which the money
is to be used?

Section 292  reads:

292. (1)
Every one commits theft who, having received, either solely or jointly with
another person, money or valuable security or a power of attorney for

[Page 67]

the sale of real or personal property, with
a direction that the money or a part of it, or the proceeds of a part of the
proceeds of the security or the property shall be applied to a purpose or paid
to a person specified in the direction, fraudulently and contrary to the
direction applies to any other purpose or pays to any other person the money or
proceeds or any part of it.

(2) This section does not apply where
a person who receives anything mentioned in subsection (1) and the person
from whom he receives it deal with each other on such terms that all money paid
to the former would, in the absence of any such direction, be properly treated
as an item in a debtor and creditor account between them, unless the direction
is in writing.

We need not consider subs. 2 as it is common
ground that Moir J.A. did not dissent in law but that he found that it had no
application to the present case.

A reading of Moir J.A.’s opinion might, at first
sight, suggest that he disagrees with the majority on a question of law.
However, with respect, the disagreement in law that appellant alleges would, in
any event be the result of a wrongful assessment by Moir J.A. of what the
majority found as a matter of fact. Moir J.A. very clearly and accurately sets
out the law under s. 292  as follows:

I think I should explain how I see
s. 292  operating. If, in the circumstances of the case, there is a
debtor-creditor relationship between the parties to a transaction, before there
can be a conviction the direction must be in writing. If there is no
debtor-creditor relationship, it is incumbent upon the Crown to prove a direction.
That direction must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

In this case it is said that as between the
travel agency and the customer there is not a debtor-creditor relationship.
That does not do away with the need of a direction, it only does away with the
direction being in writing. Section 292  requires a direction as the words state
“a direction that the money or a part of it… be applied to a purpose or paid to
a person specified in the direction”.

The conclusion that I have reached is fully
supported by the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in R. v. Brown
(1956) 116 C.C.C. 112 and by numerous other Canadian cases.

[Page 68]

In my respectful opinion to rely upon
s. 292  of the Criminal Code  it must be shown in the evidence that there
was a direction to the agency to keep the money and to pay it only for the
purpose set out in the direction. There is no such evidence and the Crown’s
case fails for lack of proof of the required direction.

Speaking of the customers of the agency, he had
previously mentioned that:

In this case it is said that the customers
of the travel agency expected that the money would be used to buy tickets and
for no other purpose. There is nothing in the evidence to support any such
agreement or direction between the appellant and the customers. It is a
conclusion said to be implicit in the relationship.

…

It is apparent that it is necessary to find
… a direction under s. 292  for the section to apply. The expectations
of the customers are irrelevant. The money must have been paid on a direction
and accepted on that direction for the accused to be criminally responsible. It
is a question of contract or direction and not of expectation.

With Moir J.A.’s reading of the law, I agree.

With respect, I cannot, however, agree that
there is no evidence upon which a finding of the existence of a direction could
have been made, nor can I agree that the expectations of the customers are
irrelevant, though I should add that expectations, standing alone, do not
amount to a direction.

Moir J.A. was of the view that the majority had
found that the customers’ expectations, when considering what was implicit in
their relations with the agency, were sufficient to involve the existence of a
“direction” such as that contemplated under s. 292 . Had that been the
Court’s finding I should agree with Moir J.A. that mere “expectations” on the
part of persons, in the absence of proof of knowledge as to those expectations
by the recipient of the things and of the recipient’s knowledge of the
understanding that the remittance of the things was solely for the fulfilment
of those expectations cannot, as a matter of law, constitute “a direction”;
such a finding by the Court of Appeal would have been an error in law upon
which he

[Page 69]

had dissented. But, as I said, such is not the
case. McGillivray C.J.A. and Brennan J. (ad hoc) concurring had said:

To my mind, the paying of money to a travel
agency for a particular trip on a particular date with a carrier flying
regularly, or the payment of money for a particular reservation with a
particular hotel for a particular period, creates more than a simple debtor and
creditor relationship. To my mind, it is implicit that the agent is
either expected to get the ticket or to return the money. In my view it is not
a case that if an airline flight was cancelled, the agent would be liable in
damages. It seems clear to me that the public would understand that the agent
was going to use the money to make the booking. If the flight was cancelled, it
would not be the responsibility of the agent. It would have done its full duty
to the client, and it would be expected that the money would be returned by the
airline. [My underlining]

The Chief Justice, when referring to what was
“implicit”, was dealing with the fact that there was more than just a
debtor-creditor relationship. He was in no way suggesting that what the client
expected as implicit in the relationship constituted “a direction”. In support
of his finding the existence of a direction one must not overlook, in addition
to the finding of those expectations, findings that, as a matter of fact,
appellant had been given and had “accepted” the money for the clear purpose of
satisfying those expectations, his having full knowledge of those expectations,
they having been conveyed to him “express[ly]”, and that through his conduct he
dealt with the money in such a manner as to defeat the purpose.

Witness the following passages of the Chief
Justice’s opinion. Commenting on the facts in R. v. Hall, [1972] 2
All E.R. 1009, he said:

This is not, in my view, the same as accepting
money for the purpose of obtaining a ticket on a scheduled airline flight on a
particular day and at a particular time, which is what occurred in the case at
bar. [My underlining]

And comparing the facts in R. v. Geddes (1979),
52 C.C.C. (2d) 231, to those of the case at bar, he said:

… they are both cases of a customer
advancing funds to a businessman with the express instruction to acquire,

[Page 70]

on behalf of that customer, a specified
commodity or service. [My underlining]

It is upon those findings of fact, coupled to
that of the “expectations” that McGillivray C.J.A. then concluded that:

With regard to Section 292 , it is clear to
me that when the customer paid his money for tickets, this was tantamount to
a direction that the money be applied to a purpose or paid to a person
specified in the direction. Again the appellant did not carry out that mandate.
Subsection (2) of Section 292 , a saving section, has in my opinion, no
application. [My underlining]

And finally,

On this evidence, it is clear that the
Appellant knew he was applying money for purposes contrary to his
clients’ directions. [My underlining]

In my respectful view the differences of opinion
between Moir J.A. and the majority were as to whether there was evidence that
the funds were advanced “with the express instruction to acquire on behalf of
[the] customer[s] a specified commodity or service” and whether there was
evidence whether “appellant knew he was applying money for purposes contrary to
his clients’ directions”; those are not, though they may appear to be so,
disagreements on a question of law, except to the extent one could say that
Moir J.A. was of the view that, as a matter of law, there was no evidence
whatsoever upon which to predicate such a finding. I do not think that that was
his position but, if such were the case, I could not agree. A reading of the
record satisfies me that there was some evidence upon which the finding of the
existence of a direction could reasonably be made.

As I would not, however, want it to be thought
that the convictions under s. 292  were the result of an error of law and
are left undisturbed in this Court solely because the absence of a dissent on
that question of law (the prerequisite appellant chose to meet when coming to
this Court through s. 618(1) (a)) left the matter beyond our reach,
I should like to add the following: had leave been asked and granted, even at
large, I would have been of the view that the majority of the Court of

[Page 71]

Appeal committed no error of law as regards what
is a direction under s. 292 .

Expectations, standing alone, are not
directions, but when known by the recipient of the money (or thing), they may,
given the proper setting, be “tantamount to a direction”. Expectations known to
the recipient of the money as a result of “express instructions”, as was found
in the Court of Appeal, are directions. It is not, in my view, necessary that
the recipient be further told expressly what not to do with the money for the
direction to exist, or again what to do with the money if the expectations
cannot be met; this may, as found by the Court of Appeal, be implicit as a
result of the nature of the relationship.

The appeal should be dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Murder—Charge to
jury—Self-defence—Excessive force—Whether there was sufficient evidence to put
the defence of self-defence to the jury—Whether use of excessive force in
self-defence reducing murder to manslaughter—Section 613(1)(b)(iii)
applicable—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 7, 34, 212, 215,
613(1)(b)(iii).

Appellant was convicted of first degree
murder and his appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed with a dissent. The
dissenting judge found that, although the trial judge had properly put the
defence of self-defence to the jury, he erred when he did not instruct them
that if the appellant used excessive force in self-defence, murder could be
reduced to manslaughter. The appeal was based on this dissenting judgment.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Estey and McIntyre JJ.: A trial judge must put to the jury all defences which
arise from the evidence. There must, however, be some evidence sufficient to
give an air of reality to a defence before the obligation to put a defence can
arise. Here, there was no evidence sufficient to require the trial judge to put
the issue of self-defence to the jury, and the accused therefore suffered no
injustice as a result of any deficiency in the charge. This was a case where
s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code should apply to dismiss the
appeal.

Queen; Huculak v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 266; Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965]
S.C.R. 739, referred to.

[Page 228]

Per Laskin and
Ritchie JJ.: There was no evidence to leave the issue of self-defence to the
jury, let alone any issue of excessive self-defence as a basis for a verdict of
manslaughter. This was a proper case to apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code .

R. v. Challice (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546, referred to.

Per Dickson,
Beetz, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: It seems highly questionable whether there was
evidence to warrant placing the defence of self-defence before the jury. In any
event, unless related to intent under s. 212 of the Code or to
provocation, the notion that excessive force in self-defence could reduce what
would otherwise be murder to manslaughter should be rejected. On a reasonable
statutory interpretation of s. 34 of the Code it is apparent that a
qualified defence of excessive force does not exist.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of
Appeal, [1980] C.A. 457,
affirming a conviction

[Page 229]

of murder in the first degree. Appeal dismissed.

Michel F. Denis, for the appellant.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie were
delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—This is an appeal from a
judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal, Bélanger J.A. dissenting, affirming a
conviction of murder in the first degree entered on the verdict of a jury. The
dissenting judge disagreed with the majority that, there having been
misdirection on an important point by the trial judge, s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  could be properly invoked for dismissal of the
appeal. Having taken an appeal to this Court as of right based on Bélanger
J.A.’s dissent, the appellant applied for and was given leave by this Court to
raise four other grounds of appeal, all being questions of law.

In my view, only the ground on which Bélanger
J.A. dissented raised any arguable issue in this case. Some of the other
grounds may, in other circumstances, raise issues that should engage the
concern of a final appellate court, but I do not find them cogent enough in
this case to justify interference with the conviction. It is nonetheless
desirable that I should speak to them in these reasons.

Perspective on all issues canvassed in this
Court requires a brief reference to the facts, which are unusual and somewhat
bizarre. The accused was charged with murder in the first degree for the
unlawfull killing of a person whose burned body, defying identification, was
found in the accused’s car which had been set on fire with gasoline. The
medical or scientific cause of death could not be determined but there was
evidence that the deceased did not die in the fire or, more precisely, from
carbon monoxide asphyxiation. There was, however, a very high level of alcohol
in his blood, high enough according to expert evidence, to be a possible cause
of death. The body was discovered in the car on March 28, 1977.

[Page 230]

The accused had a grocery business in Montreal,
Quebec, and was having financial difficulties as of the beginning of 1977.
Early in March he obtained two birth certificates and later on a passport and
an international vaccination certificate. On Saturday, March 26, 1977, he
failed to take his store’s receipts (which were put into a bag containing
cheques, accounts and cash) to his bank’s depository. Next day he left his
young daughter with his brother-in-law and was seen leaving his store carrying
two bags. He registered at a hotel in Montreal under a false name. On Monday,
March 28, 1977, the day of the discovery of the burned body in his car, the
accused flew to Toronto and then to Vancouver where he stayed for three days.
Then an air ticket was issued in his name for a flight to Los Angeles and then
to Tahiti.

On April 1, 1977, his Longueuil bank received
the deposit minus the cash. Included was a letter to the manager, stating that
the accused had been kidnapped, that money had been demanded and announcing his
death because he could identify his abductors. Prints found on the letter were
later identified as those of the accused. On May 7, 1977 he travelled by air
from Los Angeles to Montreal where he registered in a rooming house. A niece
recognized him at an intersection two days later and on May 15, 1977 a
former work-mate of the accused recognized him and followed him to the rooming
house. He notified the family who had thought the accused was dead. A brother
sought out the police who went with him to the rooming house where they found
the accused with some money, with Montreal newspapers dating from preceding
March 28th and with his passport showing his itinerary to Tahiti. From the time
of his return to Montreal until he was discovered, the accused did not contact
any of his family or his friends.

He did not testify at his trial but gave
evidence at a voir dire respecting the admissibility of three statements
he made to the police. All three were admitted in evidence. The first two
statements, which it is unnecessary to canvass in any detail, referred to a
contrived account of his kidnapping

[Page 231]

and of his treatment by his kidnappers after he
was allegedly seized at his car near his place of business and when he was on
his way to make a night deposit at his bank. According to the first statement,
it was they who took him to a Montreal hotel, then to Toronto, Vancouver and
Los Angeles. The second statement was substantially the same with some update
in saying that he was flown to Tahiti, and touching on other facts then known
to the police. There was no explanation by the accused as to why he did not try
to get in touch with the authorities in the various places where he was
allegedly left by his kidnappers or try to reach his family. The obvious
falsity of the statements as to the kidnapping could not but be damaging.

The third statement was of a completely
different character. He said in it that his business was in a precarious state
and that in desperation he decided to walk away from everything. He obtained a
passport and on March 27, 1977 he took the bank deposit from his store, put
certain effects in some bags, placed a case of beer in the back seat of his car
and went to rent a room in a Montreal hotel. Still undecided about leaving, he
went for a walk and met a tramp (un clochard) with whom he had dinner.
They came back by taxi to the hotel and the tramp was put in the accused’s car
and given a 40 oz. bottle of rye. They drove around for two and one-half to
three hours, the tramp drinking constantly. A dispute broke out and the tramp
hit the accused across the forehead with the half-full bottle of rye. The
accused stopped the car and tried to calm his passenger but could not do so. He
pushed him to the corner, stretched his arm over the back seat, took a bottle
of beer from the case that was there and hit the tramp on the head with the
bottle to calm him but the bottle broke and the person lay inert, crumbled on
the front seat with his head at the door. The accused drove around for some
time with the inert body which was bleeding from the ears. He then took two
gasoline cans which he had in his trunk and filled them at a station and later
set the interior of the car on fire. The statement also contained an admission
by the accused that he sent the “kidnap” letter to the bank and also described
his travels to the west

[Page 232]

coast and to the Pacific.

Of the five grounds of appeal in this case, the
one that can be dismissed out of hand is that there was no proper hearing
before the Court of Appeal when the three judges of the Court, each giving
reasons, did not pass on all the issues raised before them. They gave
dispositive reasons, and the fact that one or more of them found it unnecessary
to dwell on all the points raised in argument does not amount to reversible
errors, however desirable it may be, especially for an appellant looking to a
further appeal, that each point raised be separately considered. Again, I am
unable to agree that there was reversible error here in the instruction given
by the trial judge on character evidence, especially when the accused did not
testify. The trial judge in saying that evidence of good character has no
effect when there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the commission of the
crime charged is saying in effect that good character is not itself a defence.
Of course, evidence of good character may have a bearing on intent but in the
circumstances here this is not such a case.

A third point taken on behalf of the accused was
that the trial judge improperly told the jury that the same rules applied to
the assessment of testimony, whether offered by the Crown or by the defence. If
the trial judge’s instructions in this connection could be taken as diminishing
or qualifying the burden of proof resting on the Crown, there would be merit in
the contention. In the context in which the challenged instruction was given, I
do not think the objection to it can stand. This is not a case where the jury
may have been misled by being directed to determine guilt or innocence on the
basis of the credibility of the witnesses on each side: see, for example, R.
v. Challice (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546.

[Page 233]

The fourth ground taken by the accused was that
there was fatal misdirection by the trial judge in telling the jury that they
did not have to determine the cause of death in order to find the accused
guilty and also in telling them that if they concluded that alcohol was the
cause of death, they should acquit. What was apparently objected to on the
latter point was the trial judge’s use of the word “conclusion” in telling the
jury that if they came to the conclusion that alcohol was the cause of death
they should acquit. The objection was that this watered down the burden of
proof on the Crown. Having regard to the trial judge’s charge on this issue,
the objection is trifling and without merit.

So too, in this case, there is no merit in the
contention that the trial judge erred in telling the jury that they did not
have to determine the cause of death to find the accused guilty. The mere fact
that in some cases the cause of death cannot be determined is no more a
disabling hurdle for the Crown than the fact that in some cases there is no corpus
delicti. If there is evidence upon which a jury can determine beyond a
reasonable doubt that the death of a person was brought about by an unlawful
act of the accused accompanied by the required intent to constitute the offence
of murder, a finding of the exact cause of death, in a medical or scientific sense,
is not a necessary condition of conviction. Causation, where there is a jury,
is essentially a jury question on a proper instruction by the trial judge as to
the law. In this case, proper instruction was given. The trial judge made it
clear that in order to convict of murder the jury had to find that an unlawful
act of the accused caused the death of the victim and he also instructed them
on the required intent. Again, he said, quite properly, that if the jury
determined that death resulted from alcohol, they should acquit.

[Page 234]

This brings me to the point of law on which
Bélanger J.A. dissented. Bélanger J.A. took the clear point that there was a
fatal failure by the trial judge, having dealt with self-defence, to instruct
on manslaughter if in acting in self-defence the accused used excessive force
in the circumstances. Although the trial judge had instructed the jury on
provocation and its effect on the murder charge, he did not relate manslaughter
to any specific defence when, at the end of his address to the jury, he told
them of the four verdicts that were open to them, namely, murder in the first
degree, murder in the second degree, manslaughter and acquittal. According to
Bélanger J.A., the jury was placed in the position of finding the accused
guilty of murder if they found he had used excessive force in acting in
self-defence rather than finding him guilty of manslaughter. The learned
dissenting judge made no mention of s. 613(1) (b)(iii), being
obviously of the opinion that where there is a serious non-direction amounting
to a misdirection there is no room for the application of the curative
provision. I agree with him completely in a case where the accused is deprived
of his legal right to have the jury pass on a qualified defence that would, if
accepted, result in a verdict of manslaughter.

I had originally formed the view that there was
a basis in the evidence not only to support an instruction on self-defence
alone (which the trial judge gave) but also evidence of possible excessive
force requiring, according to Bélanger J.A., an instruction on manslaughter.
(If this was a correct view of the issues, it would obviously be wrong to apply
the curative provisions of Criminal Code , s. 613(1) (b)(iii)).

Having read the reasons of Dickson J. and those
prepared by my brother McIntyre, I have reviewed again the record of the facts
which I have set out

[Page 235]

in my reasons herein and am now persuaded that
the trial judge overreached in leaving even self-defence to the jury. I
therefore agree with my brother McIntyre that there was no evidence to leave
that issue to the jury, let alone any issue of excessive self-defence as a
basis for a verdict of manslaughter. I also now agree with him, following the
majority judgments of the Quebec Court of Appeal, that this is in any event a
proper case to apply the proviso in Criminal Code , s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

I would accordingly, and following McIntyre J.,
dismiss the appeal.

The reasons of Martland, Estey and McIntyre JJ.
were delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—I have read the reasons for judgment
of my brothers, the Chief Justice and Dickson J. I agree with the Chief Justice
in his rejection of all grounds of appeal. Though I agree in the result reached
by Dickson J., in that I would dismiss the appeal, I would confine my reasons
for so doing to the proposition that there was no evidence before the trial
judge sufficient to require him to put the issue of self-defence to the jury,
and the accused therefore suffered no injustice as a result of any deficiency
in the charge. It is also, in my view, a case where the provisions of
s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  would apply to
dismiss the appeal in any event.

A trial judge must put to the jury all defences
which arise from the evidence. There must, however, be some evidence sufficient
to give an air of reality to a defence before the obligation to put a defence
can arise. In Pappajohn v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 120, at pp. 126
and 127, I dealt with this question—with the approval of the majority of the
Court—and I would refer again to the words of Fauteux J. in Kelsey v. The
Queen, [1953] 1 S.C.R. 220, where he said, at p. 226:

The allotment of any substance to an
argument or of any value to a grievance resting on the omission of the

[Page 236]

trial Judge from mentioning such argument
must be conditioned on the existence in the record of some evidence or matter
apt to convey a sense of reality in the argument and in the grievance.

See, as well, the other cases referred to in Pappajohn
on this point: Wu v. The King, [1934] S.C.R. 609 and Workman v.
The Queen; Huculak v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 266.

Can it be said in the case at bar that there was
before the court at trial any such evidence which would convey a sense of
reality in the suggestion that the accused killed in self‑defence? In my
view, the answer must be: no.

The appellant did not give evidence at trial.
The suggested basis for the defence of self‑defence is to be found in a
statement he made to the police which is reproduced, in part, in the reasons of
Dickson J. in these terms:

[TRANSLATION] At that point I stopped the
car suddenly. I asked him to calm down, which he had no intention of doing. I
pushed him back to his side, reached over to the back seat, took a bottle of
beer from a case of twelve and hit him on the head with it to calm him down.
The bottle shattered and he stopped moving. He was slumped over and motionless
on the front seat with his head leaning against the door on the trim next to
the window.

This statement was put before the jury with the
other evidence which revealed the planning and deliberation, and the elaborate
scheme referred to in the recital of facts given by the Chief Justice. In my
view, it affords no basis for a suggestion of self-defence but, assuming it is
true, it speaks rather of the reaction of an angry man who, with one hand, was
capable of holding his opponent down while he, sitting in the driver’s seat of
a car, reached with the other arm into the back seat of the car, opened the
case of beer, took out a bottle and delivered a blow to the head of his
opponent. This does not afford evidence of repelling force by force in the
words of s. 34(1)  of the Criminal Code . Rather it provides evidence
of a calculated retaliation, well after any need for self-defence existed. In
my view, no air of reality attaches to the assertion that the appellant acted
in self-defence, particularly when this statement—the sole basis of the
defence—is considered against the

[Page 237]

background of the evidence adduced by the Crown.
The trial judge, therefore, was not required to charge on this issue.

In the Court of Appeal, Crête C.J.Q. and Monet
J.A. were of the opinion that any deficiencies in the charge on the issue of
self-defence were such that the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the
Code should be applied to dismiss the appeal. I am in agreement with
them. Applying the test in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739, and
even assuming some deficiency in the charge given in this case, I am of the
view that on the whole of the evidence, much of which was uncontested, there is
no possibility that a jury, properly instructed, would have any reasonable
doubt on the question of the appellant’s guilt.

I refrain from any comment on the question dealt
with by Dickson J. regarding the availability of a verdict of manslaughter
where an accused acting in self-defence, as described in s. 34 of the Code,
causes a death by the use of an excess of force.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The reasons of Dickson, Beetz, Chouinard and
Lamer JJ.

DICKSON J.—This is an appeal from the Court of
Appeal of Quebec following conviction of the appellant Brisson, by a jury at
Montreal, on a charge of first degree murder. The question of substance is
whether the trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that if they found
that the accused had used excessive force in defending himself from his victim,
they should find him guilty only of manslaughter, and not murder.

After study of the transcript and the
authorities the views which I hold with respect to the self‑defence issue
are as follows. In the first place I question whether there was any evidentiary
base for the defence. Secondly, in my view, the verdict is murder and not
manslaughter if the Crown establishes the requisite deadly intent (means to

[Page 238]

cause death or means to cause bodily harm that
he knows is likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not,
s. 212  of the Criminal Code ) and the defence of self‑defence
fails.

I

On the evidentiary point, the evidence gleaned
from a statement of the accused to the police, was to the following effect.
Brisson had met un clochard (a rubby-dub) with whom he had had supper.
He took the clochard by taxi to the parking lot of the Hotel Loews and
put him in his car. He gave the clochard a 40-ounce bottle of rye that was
already in the trunk of the car. They drove about in the car for
two-and-one-half hours, the clochard drinking throughout this time. At
one point a dispute broke out and the clochard hit Brisson on the
forehead with the half-empty bottle of rye. The statement by Brisson continues:

[TRANSLATION] At that point I stopped the
car suddenly. I asked him to calm down, which he had no intention of doing. I
pushed him back to his side, reached over to the back seat, took a bottle of
beer from a case of twelve and hit him on the head with it to calm him down.
The bottle shattered and he stopped moving. He was slumped over and motionless
on the front seat with his head leaning against the door on the trim next to
the window.

On these facts it seems to me highly questionable
whether there was evidence to warrant placing the defence of self-defence
before the jury. Assuming, however, arguendo that the trial judge was
correct in charging the jury on self-defence I pass to the substantial legal
point which arises.

II

Canadian Authorities

The defence of self-defence is codified in our Criminal
Code . The Code preserves the common law with slight variation.
Although it is to the Code and not the cases that we should primarily
direct attention, the Canadian authorities which

[Page 239]

have considered the issue of excessive force in
self-defence have paid scant heed to the Code. They have concentrated,
in the main, on the jurisprudence as it has developed in Australia, in England
and in Canada. For that reason I will turn to the cases before addressing
s. 34  of the Criminal Code .

A number of Canadian cases have suggested that
it is open to a jury to bring in a verdict of manslaughter if they find that
the force used by an accused in self-defence is excessive. The first of these
is R. v. Barilla (1944), 82 C.C.C. 228 (B.C.C.A.). O’Halloran J.A. found
error on the part of the trial judge in failing to instruct the jury that if
they found that firing the revolver as Barilla did was an unnecessarily violent
act of self-defence in the circumstances of the attack then launched, that it
was open to them to find a verdict of manslaughter. There was no discussion in Barilla
of the principles involved and no mention of the Criminal Code . O’Halloran
J.A. relied on three very early English cases: Mead’s and Belt’s Case (1823),
1 Lewin 184, 168 E.R. 1006; R. v. Smith (1837), 8 Car & P. 160, 173
E.R. 441; R. v. Odgers (1843), 2 M. & Rob. 479, 174 E.R. 355 and
upon the later case of R. v. Hussey (1924), 89 J.P. 28.

A close reading of the cases relied upon in Barilla
provides scant support for the legal proposition for which those cases are
said to stand. As will be seen, the Privy Council and the English Court of
Appeal in later cases did not draw from these and other early English
authorities the conclusion that excessive force in self-defence results in a
manslaughter verdict.

Many of the Canadian cases simply follow Barilla.
See for example, R. v. Ouellette, [1950] 2 W.W.R. 875 (B.C.C.A.) and
R. v. Basarabas and Spek (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (B.C.C.A.). In R.
v. Stanley (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 216 (B.C.C.A.), Branca J.A. stated the
law in the following terms (at p. 232):

If the force used was not excessive and/or
if the death was caused with the justification offered in s. 34(2)(a)

[Page 240]

and (b) then he, Stanley, was
justified in killing Blosky and was not criminally responsible.

On the other hand, if the force used was
excessive or if the death was caused in circumstances not coming within the
justification provided in s. 34(2)(a) and (b) and if there
was not an intent within s. 212 , then the death was caused by an unlawful
act but not in circumstances amounting to murder.

The critical words are those found in the second
paragraph “and if there was not an intent within s. 212 ”. In R. v. Crothers
(1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 27 the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal purported to
adopt the principles stated by Branca J.A. in the headnote in Stanley’s case.
But the headnote is in error. The words to which I have above directed
attention are repeated in the headnote “and if there was not intent within
s. 42  of the Criminal Code ”. Section 42  is concerned with assertion
of a right to a house or real property. No mention is made of s. 212 of
the Code dealing with intent in murder.

Alberta has been the province in which the
doctrine has been most favourably received but the Alberta Court of Appeal has
been divided in its opinion as to the legal underpinning of the doctrine. In R.
v. Deegan, [1979] 6 W.W.R. 97 (Alta. C.A.) Prowse J.A. said (at
p. 104):

If the accused’s mind was consumed with an
apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm, his acts thereafter “being the
purely physical products of” such passion, can it be said that he formulated
the requisite specific intent for murder? In my view, in such circumstances, he
cannot be said to have formed a genuine intent of the nature required to
support such a conviction.

If the accused does not have the intent
requisite for murder under s. 212 of the Code or if there is
reasonable doubt on the point, then of course the verdict should be
manslaughter and not murder. If that is what is meant by the above passage then
it would seem to me to be in accordance with principle. If, however,
Mr. Justice Prowse is speaking of an intent other than that contemplated
in s. 212 of the Code then I confess to some difficulty, and it is

[Page 241]

compounded by the following passage from his
reasons (at p. 105):

In cases where the learned trial judge
finds that there is evidence that warrants placing the defence of self-defence
before the jury, I am of the view that it is sufficient, in placing this issue
of manslaughter based on such evidence, to do so by putting the following
question to it: “If you find that the accused’s actions were dictated by a fear
of death of grievous bodily harm, or if you are left with a reasonable doubt on
that point, then you should bring in a verdict of manslaughter although you
found he used excessive force.”

This issue only arises after the jury has
rejected the defence of self-defence, and is considering whether the accused
had the intent required to support a conviction for murder. For this reason
care should be taken to make clear to the jury that it must only consider this
issue if it rejects that defence.

In R. v. Fraser (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d)
503 Mr. Justice Moir of the Alberta Court of Appeal reviewed in some
detail the Australian cases of R. v. McKay, [1957] V.R. 560, R. v.
Howe (1958), 100 C.L.R. 448 (H.C. of Austr.) and Viro v. The Queen, (1978),
18 A.L.R. 257 (H.C. of Austr.) and concluded (at p. 522):

The Australian High Court has therefore
held that the qualified defence of excessive force operates as does the defence
of provocation. The effect of the defence is not to negative the intention to
kill or to cause injury but to hold that an intent to kill or injure, when
force is permissible, is less morally culpable than the intent to kill or
injure recklessly under other circumstances.

He referred to the fact that this conclusion was
rejected by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Palmer v. The
Queen, [1971] 1 All E.R. 1077 followed by the English Court of Appeal in R.
v. Mclnnes, [1971] 3 All E.R. 295 and left open by the House of Lords in Reference
under s. 48 A of the Criminal Appeal (Northern Ireland) Act 1968 (No. 1 of
1975), [1976] 2 All E.R. 937.

Moir J.A. (with whom Lieberman J.A. concurred)
observed, correctly in my opinion, that the law of Canada is in a very
unsatisfactory state. “Decisions of various Courts of appeal go in both

[Page 242]

directions and, indeed, may be inconsistent
within the same Court.” He continued at p. 523:

In the rather uncertain state of the law
and for the reasons given by the High Court of Australia in Viro I hold
that the qualified defence of excessive force is available to the respondent.
However, for it to exist the following elements must be found by the trier of
fact:

1. Certain serious circumstances must exist
which led the accused to reasonably believe a situation involving danger
existed.

2. The accused used unreasonable or
excessive force.

3. The accused was acting honestly when he
used excessive force in that he mistakenly believed that the degree of force he
was using was reasonable.

If all of these elements are found, and
even if the trier of the fact concludes the accused intentionally killed the
victim, the qualified defence may be successfully invoked and the accused may
be found guilty of manslaughter only.

Mr. Justice Moir founded himself upon a
reduced moral culpability of the accused, as in provocation, to make the crime
manslaughter and not murder. One of the difficulties of this approach, as it
seems to me, lies in the fact that Parliament has recognized the possibility of
a lesser moral culpability in a situation of provocation and has made due
provision for it, in express and precise terms, in s. 215 of the Code. Culpable
homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the
person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden
provocation (s. 215(1)). The conditions which must be met are set out in detail
in the Code:

(2) A wrongful act or insult that is of
such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of
self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the
accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion
to cool.

(3) For the purposes of this
section the questions

(a) whether a particular
wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

(b) whether the accused was
deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he
received,

[Page 243]

are questions of fact, but no one shall be
deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a
legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in
order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to
any human being.

(4) Culpable homicide that otherwise would
be murder is not necessarily manslaughter by reason only that it was committed
by a person who was being arrested illegally, but the fact that the illegality
of the arrest was known to the accused may be evidence of provocation for the
purpose of this section.

Mr. Justice Moir and Mr. Justice
Lieberman in R. v. Fraser, supra, adopted the very detailed charge as
set out by Mason J. in Viro v. The Queen:

(1)(a) It is for the jury first to consider
whether when the accused killed the deceased the accused reasonably believed
that an unlawful attack which threatened him with death or serious bodily harm
was being or was about to be made upon him.

(b) By the expression ‘reasonably believed’
is meant, not what a reasonable man would have believed, but what the accused
himself might reasonably believe in all the circumstances in which he found
himself.

(2) If the jury is satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt that there was no reasonable belief by the accused of such an attack no
question of self-defence arises.

(3) If the jury is not satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that there was no such reasonable belief by the accused, it
must then consider whether the force in fact used by the accused was reasonably
proportionate to the danger which he believed he faced.

(4) If the jury is not satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that more force was used than was reasonably proportionate it
should acquit.

(5) If the jury is satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that more force was used, then its verdict should be either
manslaughter or murder, that depending upon the answer to the final question
for the jury—did the accused believe that the force which he used was reasonably
proportionate to the danger which he believed he faced.

(6) If the jury is satisfied beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused did not have such a belief the verdict will
be murder. If it is not satisfied beyond reasonable

[Page 244]

doubt that the accused did not have that
belief the verdict will be manslaughter [at p. 303].

If the law of Canada is as above and judges must
henceforth give juries instructions on the issue of manslaughter arising from
excessive use of force in self-defence along the lines of those set forth by
Mason J. in Viro v. The Queen, I cannot but think that the task of the
jury, presently difficult enough in a murder case, will be vastly more so.

In Manitoba a unanimous Court of Appeal in R.
v. Appleby, [1979] 1 W.W.R. 664 rejected the idea that if excessive force
is used, then the verdict must be manslaughter and not murder, O’Sullivan J.A.
being of the opinion that the present law in England and in Canada is as summed
up in Arch-bold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, 39th ed.,
1976, p. 1035, paragraph 2470:

Where a person who is attacked uses a
greater degree of force than was necessary in the circumstances and thereby
kills the aggressor, and the jury accordingly reject a defence of self-defence,
a verdict of manslaughter may in some cases still be open to them. There is no
rule that, on a charge of homicide where a defence of self-defence has been
raised but has failed because the force used went beyond what was reasonable in
the circumstances, the judge should direct the jury that the verdict should be
guilty of manslaughter only… There are cases of this kind where a direction to
that effect would be wholly inappropriate and where the proper verdict would be
guilty of murder …However, the facts on which the defence of self-defence was
unsuccessfully sought to be based may in some cases go to show that the
defendant acted under provocation or that, although acting unlawfully, he
lacked the intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm; and in such cases a
verdict of manslaughter would be proper.

Archbold, of course, is summarizing the position
in England subsequent to the Privy Council decision in Palmer v. The Queen,
supra.

The Ontario Court of Appeal has dealt with the
matter now under discussion in a number of cases over the last few years. In R.
v. Hay (1973), 22

[Page 245]

C.R.N.S. 191 the Court concluded that no jury
properly instructed could have come to the conclusion that the force
represented by the firing of the shot was not excessive; accordingly, on the
evidence, the defence of self-defence was not available to the accused. In R.
v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6, the charge was one of attempted
murder and it was urged that the trial judge had erred in failing to direct the
jury that excessive force in self-defence leads to a verdict of attempted
manslaughter. The court held it unnecessary to decide the question whether
there is a separate rule that excessive force used in self-defence reduces
murder to manslaughter and the limits of that doctrine, since, where it is
recognized, it is applicable only where the charge is murder. Mr. Justice
Martin, speaking for the court, noted that the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council in Palmer v. The Queen, supra, held that there is no separate
rule of law that excessive force in self-defence leads to a verdict of
manslaughter, although an issue might, none the less, arise whether there was
provocation where self-defence is relied on, or whether the requisite intent
for murder had been proved. He added “[e]ven in Australia where excessive force
in self-defence is recognized as a “qualified” defence to murder, the precise
limits of the doctrine have not been finally settled: see Australian
Criminal Law, 2nd ed., pp. 96-98, by Colin Howard” (at p. 17).

The Ontario Court of Appeal returned to the
question of excessive self-defence in R. v. Trecroce (1980), 55 C.C.C.
(2d) 202, the judgment of the court being again delivered by Mr. Justice
Martin. The discussion on this point was obiter (at p. 211):

In the present case, assuming without
deciding, that the qualified defence of excessive self-defence exists as a
substantive doctrine, the circumstances were not such as to require its
submission to the jury.

[Page 246]

and:

Whatever the true view may be, which we do
not find necessary to decide, the doctrine of excessive force in self-defence
has no application to the facts of this case. Where excessive force in
self-defence has been recognized as a substantive doctrine, it would appear
that the following conditions, at least, are necessary to give rise to that
qualified defence:

(a) The accused must have been justified in
using some force to defend himself against an attack, real or reasonably
apprehended.

(b) The accused must have honestly believed
that he was justified in using the force that he did.

(c) The force used was excessive only
because it exceeded what the accused could reasonably have considered
necessary.

Prior to the foregoing passage Mr. Justice
Martin reviewed most of the cases to which I have adverted and then referred to
the writings of Professor Colin Howard, who has written extensively on the
subject (at pp. 210-11):

Professor Colin Howard who, on balance,
supports the view that excessive self-defence is a qualified defence to murder
discusses in an informative article some of the difficulties inherent in the
doctrine: “Two Problems in Excessive Defence”, 84 L.Q.R. 343 (1968). The rationale
of the doctrine has, perhaps, not been finally settled. Professor Howard
suggests that the basis of excessive self-defence might be assimilated with
provocation, extenuating even an intentional killing. He, however, appears to
favour the view that a killing by the use of excessive force in self-defence is
properly classified as a form of involuntary manslaughter arising from criminal
negligence. The doctrine is not necessarily more generous to the accused than
the traditional view as expounded by Lord Morris in Palmer v. The Queen,
supra: see Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law, 4th ed. (1978), pp. 330-1.

Recently, in an as yet unreported decision[1], R. v. Reilly (Howland C.J.O., Arnup
and Weatherston JJ.A., judgment delivered March 9, 1982) the Ontario Court of
Appeal, speaking through Arnup

[Page 247]

J.A. again reviewed the cases and concluded:

In the light of the decisions of the Courts
of Appeal of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, and upon consideration
of the careful review of the subject by Martin J.A. in Campbell and Trecroce,
supra, I have reached the conclusion that the doctrine of excessive force
in self-defence rendering the accused guilty only of manslaughter instead of
murder should be recognized in Ontario. Without deciding that there are no
other requisites for its application in particular cases, I conclude also that
the conditions stated by Martin J.A. in Trecroce as to the minimum
prerequisites should be applied.

The judgment does not say why the use of
excessive force in self-defence should reduce murder to manslaughter, nor is
there reference to the Criminal Code .

The review of judgments of provincial appellate
courts will be complete with reference to Pilon v. The Queen, [1966] 2
C.C.C. 53 in which Owen J.A. was of the opinion, at p. 59 of the report,
that the instructions given to the jury were not satisfactory, in particular
because “the presiding Judge omitted to instruct the jury that excessive force
used in self-defence could result in a verdict of manslaughter”. That is all
that was said on the point.

In Linney v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
646, Mr. Justice de Grandpré and I, in our respective judgments, made
reference to the trial judge’s charge in which, inter alia, he directed
the jury that excessive use of force in self-defence would lead to a verdict of
manslaughter. That part of the charge passed without comment in this Court for
the reason that that issue was not before us. The only question in Linney’s case
was whether the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that if they
were in doubt as to whether the act of killing was provoked it was their duty
to reduce the offence from murder to manslaughter.

[Page 248]

A review of the Canadian authorities shows a
singular lack of uniformity in result and in reasoning. It is difficult to say
that the cases follow any pattern, or the law of any country, or that, to date,
any clear statement of principle has emerged.

III

Australia

The defence of the excessive use of force in
self-defence is often referred to as an Australian doctrine and its origin
traced to a series of Australian cases. Some common law states in Australia
have held that an accused, who used more force than reasonably necessary to
defend himself and caused the death of his assailant, would be guilty of
manslaughter and not murder, provided he believed that the degree of force he
was using was warranted by the situation. The general statement of the
Australian law was made by Dixon C.J. in Howe, supra, at pp. 460-61:

The assumption made for the purpose of
[deciding whether excessive defence is manslaughter] is that a man actually
defending himself from the real or apprehended violence of the deceased has
used more force than was justified by the occasion and that death has ensued
from this use of excessive force. In all other respects, so it is assumed, the
elements of a plea of self-defence existed. That is to say it is assumed that
an attack of a violent and felonious nature, or at least of an unlawful nature,
was made or threatened so that the person under attack or threat of attack
reasonably feared for his life or the safety of his person from injury,
violation or indecent or insulting usage. This would mean that an occasion has
arisen entitling the person charged with murder to resort to force to repel
force or apprehended force. Had he used no more force than was proportionate to
the danger in which he stood, or reasonably supposed he stood, although he
thereby caused the death of his assailant he would not have been guilty either
of murder or manslaughter. But assuming that he was not entitled to a complete
defence to a charge of murder, for the reason only that the force or violence which
he used against his assailant or apprehended assailant went beyond what was
needed for his protection or what the circumstances could cause him reason-

[Page 249]

ably to believe to be necessary for his
protection, of what crime does he stand guilty? Is the consequence of the
failure of his plea of self-defence on that ground that he is guilty of murder
or does it operate to reduce the homicide to manslaughter?

Dixon C.J. gave this answer to the question he
posed himself:

There is no clear and definite judicial
decision providing an answer to this question but it seems reasonable in
principle to regard such a homicide as reduced to manslaughter…

See in elaboration of this R. v. Howe, supra,
Viro v. The Queen, supra, R. v. Bufalo, [1958] V.R. 363, R. v. Haley (1959),
76 W.N. (N.S.W.) 550, R. v. Tikos (No.1), [1963] V.R. 285, R. v.
Tikos (No. 2), [1963] V.R. 306. There is also extensive scholarly writing
available including Morris, “The Slain Chicken Thief”, (1958) 2 Sydney L. Rev.
414; Morris, “Development in the Law of Homicide”, [1960] Crim. L.R. 468;
Morris, “A New Qualified Defence to Murder”, (1960) Adelaide L. Rev. 23:

This explicit formulation by the Australian
courts of a previously unrecognised qualified defence to a charge of murder is
a major development in the law of homicide. It recognises a middleground
between a conviction of murder and an acquittal… [at p. 23].

Some authors have expressed doubt as to the
utility of this development, given the familiar rules relating to involuntary
manslaughter. Thus, Professor Howard has written:

The second difficulty in the present law
arises from the form it has taken of being a new category of voluntary
manslaughter. To regard excessive defence in its present form as voluntary
manslaughter is unsatisfactory because there is no present analogy between
excessive defence and provocation. It follows that the law would be clearer and
more satisfactory if an excessive defence case were regarded as an instance of
involuntary manslaughter rather than voluntary manslaughter.

[Page 250]

Alternatively, if they thought it were open
to them, the courts might convert excessive defence into a true voluntary
manslaughter by changing its basis to assimilate it with provocation [Howard,
“Two Problems in Excessive Defence”, (1968) 84 L.Q.R. 343 at pp. 360-61].

Other useful scholarly writings are Howard,
“Excessive Defence”, [1964] Crim. L.R. 448, Morris and Howard, “A New
Manslaughter” in Studies in Criminal Law (1964); Smith, “Excessive
Defence—A Rejection of Australian Initiative”, [1972] Crim. L.R. 524;
Sornarajah, “Excessive Self-Defence in Commonwealth Law”, (1972) 21 Int. and
Comp. L.Q. 758; James, “The Queens-bury Rules of Self Defence”, (1972) 21 Int.
and Comp. L.Q. 357.

Professor Elliot (“Excessive Self-Defence in
Commonwealth Law” (1973) 22 Int. and Comp. L.Q. 727) is critical of the
doctrine. He introduces his article with the trenchant paragraph:

The task of defining the proper scope of
excessive self-defence is a difficult one. It will be argued that the
Australian cases, despite their considerable heuristic value, have not resolved
the difficulty. It should be added that, so far as Australian law is concerned,
it may well be time for an obituary. The plea of excessive self-defence has no
basis in statute or code in Australia. It was fashioned from common law
material and it is not unlikely that the doctrine received its quietus with the
Privy Council decision in Palmer.

Discussing the limits of self-defence in the
Australian cases, he concludes that (at p. 736):

The common law doctrine of excessive
self-defence, as it has developed in Australia, is seriously defective. In
cases where it does apply it will often add little more than unnecessary
complication to the issues of self-defence and provocation. And it appears to
be inapplicable in a class of cases where there is genuine need for a qualified
defence.

[Page 251]

It must not be forgotten that in Australia, as
in the United States, criminal law is a matter of state competence and thus may
vary from state to state. Added to this is the fact that some of the Australian
states have adopted criminal codes whereas others have not, preferring to
remain common law criminal jurisdictions. The so-called “qualified defence” of
excessive force is a product of the common law states. Of the three states
possessing criminal codes, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia all have
rejected the concept. “It has been held in both Queensland and Tasmania that
the doctrine is peculiar to the common law and therefore has no application
under the codes of those states” (Howard, Criminal Law (1977), at
p. 90). Subsequent to this statement by Professor Howard it was held in
Western Australia that under the Criminal Code  of that state if a
defence under s. 248 or 249 of the Code would fail because the
degree of force used in self-defence was excessive, the crime is not reduced
from murder to manslaughter: Aleksovski v. The Queen, [1979] W.A.R. 1.

The rejection of the “qualified” defence of
excessive self-defence by all those Australian states which have a criminal
code is of interest to us in Canada, as are the reasons for the rejection. The
obstacle to reading the principle into the Tasmanian Code was found in the
detailed provisions which the Code made in relation to the same subject matter:
Masnec v. The Queen, [1962] Tas. S.R. 254, at p. 262. “Sections 46
and 47 as to the use of force in self‑defence are but two of a group of
no less than twenty sections covering comprehensively the occasions on
which the use of force is legally justified”. Sections 25 to 45 of the Canadian
Criminal Code equally cover comprehensively and authoritatively the
occasions on which the use of force is legally justified. There would seem to
be little room for competing or supplementary common law doctrine.

[Page 252]

It has been said by one or more of the authors
that the presence in our Code of s. 7(3) affords a means of
supplementing our Code with a common law defence not open to the
Australian states because the criminal codes of those states lacked the equivalent
of s. 7(3). That is not correct. Section 7(3) of our Code reads:

(3) Every rule and principle of the common
law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a
defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings
for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada,
except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or
any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

Section 8 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code Act is
a comparable section and the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal responded
to argument based thereon as follows (at p. 265):

As to the same s. 8 of the Act, which
formed the basis of the second argument, it is true that in terms it operates
to save “all rules and principles of the Common law which render any
circumstances a justification or excuse for any act or omission”, but it only
does so except insofar as they are altered by or are inconsistent with the
Code. In view of the compelling words of s. 157(1)(c) in particular
we are unable to give this general provision the effect contended for, in any
case there is good reason historically for viewing it as having been inserted ex
abundante cautela (see per Crisp J. in Reg. v. Vallance, [1960]
Tas. S.R. 51, at p. 86) and not as intended to modify one of the most
significantly comprehensive parts of the whole Code.

Section 157(1)(c) is the counterpart of
s. 212(a) of our Code. In R. v. Johnson, [1964] Qd.
R. 1 the Court of Criminal Appeal of Queensland refused to follow R. v.
Howe for the reason given in the headnote:

The common law doctrine expressed in R.
v. Howe ([1958] 100 C.L.R. 448), that where a plea of self defence to
murder fails only because the death was occasioned by the use of excessive
force a verdict of manslaughter should be returned, is based on the common law
concept that malice aforethought is an

[Page 253]

essential ingredient of murder. That
concept is no part of the law of Queensland and the doctrine referred to is not
expressly or impliedly incorporated into the Code.

The Supreme Court of Western Australia—Court of
Criminal Appeal—in Aleksovski v. The Queen, supra, rejected R. v.
Howe and Viro v. The Queen. A passage from the judgment of Burt C.J.
will suffice to explain why.

In my opinion and for the reasons given by
the Court of Criminal Appeal in R. v. Johnson [1964] Qd. R. 1, those
cases have no application to the Criminal Code . In my opinion, under the Code,
and expressing myself now without regard to the onus of proof, if the act
causing death was done with intent to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm,
but in self defence within the meaning of the second part of s 248, the verdict
is not guilty; if that defence fails and if nothing more appears, the verdict
is wilful murder or murder as the case might be. There is no half-way house [at
p. 5].

IV

England

When one comes to consider the interplay of the
so-called qualified defence of excessive force and criminal codes one finds
that the issue is by no means a new one. The authors (Lord Blackburn, Barry,
Lush and Stephen JJ.) of the 1879 Report of the Criminal Code Bill
Commission whose Draft Code formed the basis of the Canadian Criminal
Code of 1892 considered the doctrine of excessive self-defence and rejected
it out of hand (C. 2345 English Parliamentary Papers (1879) Vol. 36,
p. 157). The earlier Report of the Commissioners who framed the Indian
Penal Code had argued for the same half-way house which later found favour
in some of the Australian courts. The Report of the Indian Code states (Criminal
Code Bill Commission—Report, at p. 45):

For the law itself has encouraged the
slayer to inflict on the assailant any harm short of death which may be
necessary for the purpose of repelling the outrage,—to give the assailant a cut
with a knife across the fingers, which may render his right hand useless to him
for life,

[Page 254]

or to hurl him downstairs with such force
as to break his leg. And it seems difficult to conceive that circumstances
which would be a full justification of any violence short of homicide, should
not be a mitigation of the guilt of homicide. That a man should be merely
exercising a right by fracturing the skull and knocking out the eye of an
assailant, and should be guilty of the highest crime in the code if he kills
the same assailant,—that there should be only a single step between perfect
impunity and liability to capital punishment seems unreasonable. In a case in
which the law itself empowers an individual to inflict any harm short of death,
it ought hardly, we think, to visit him with the highest punishment if he
inflicts death.

The authors of the 1879 Report flatly rejected
this argument: “If we thought that the common law was such as is here supposed,
we should without hesitation suggest that it should be altered. But we think
that such is not and never was the law of England. The law discourages persons
from taking the law into their own hands. Still the law does permit men to
defend themselves …And when violence is used for the purpose of repelling a
wrong, the degree of violence must not be disproportioned to the wrong to be
prevented, or it is not justified” (at p. 45). In the view of the
Commissioners provocation and full self-defence, if I may use that term,
exhausted the possibilities. The Report of the Commissioners was in accordance
with the traditional English view of the defence of self-defence to a charge of
murder. Either the defence succeeds, in which case the accused is acquitted or
it fails, in which case he is convicted of murder. In R. v. Hassin, [1963]
Crim. L.R. 852 the Court of Criminal Appeal described as a “novelty in present
times” a submission that if an accused exceeded the bounds of self-defence, the
proper verdict was manslaughter.

In 1971, in Palmer v. The Queen, [1971] 1
All E.R. 1077 the Privy Council gave careful consideration to the leading
Australian authority, the decision of the High Court in Howe, but did
not find it persuasive. Their Lordships held (at p. 1088):

[Page 255]

If there has been attack so that defence is
reasonably necessary it will be recognised that a person defending himself
cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his necessary defensive action.
If a jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had
only done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary that would
be most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken.

Their Lordships went on to say:

A jury will be told that the defence of
self-defence, where the evidence makes its raising possible, will only fail if
the prosecution show beyond doubt that what the accused did was not by way of
self-defence. But their Lordships consider in agreement with the approach in De
freitas v. R. (1960), 2 W.I.R. 523 that if the prosecution have shown that
what was done was not done in self-defence then that issue is eliminated from
the case. If the jury consider that an accused acted in self-defence or if the
jury are in doubt as to this then they will acquit. The defence of self-defence
either succeeds so as to result in an acquittal or it is disproved in which
case as a defence it is rejected. In a homicide case the circumstances may be
such that it will become an issue whether there was provocation so that the
verdict might be one of manslaughter. Any other possible issues will remain. If
in any case the view is possible that the intent necessary to constitute the
crime of murder was lacking then that matter would be left to the jury.

This was followed in R. v. Mclnnes, [1971]
3 All E.R. 295. The Court of Appeal, Criminal Division held that where
self-defence fails on the ground that the force used went clearly beyond that
which was reasonable in the light of the circumstances as they reasonably
appeared to the accused, it is not the law that the inevitable result must be that
he can be convicted of manslaughter only, and not of murder. The Court held
that if self-defence failed for the reason stated, it affords the accused no
protection at all. The Court continued (at p. 301):

But it is important to stress that the
facts on which the plea of self-defence is unsuccessfully sought to be based
may nevertheless serve the accused in good stead. They may, for example, go to
show that he may have acted under provocation or that, although acting
unlawfully,

[Page 256]

he may have lacked the intent to kill or
cause serious bodily harm, and in that way render the proper verdict one of
manslaughter.

In Reference under s. 48A of the
Criminal Appeal (Northern Ireland) Act 1968 (No. 1 of 1975), supra, the
House of Lords was invited to apply the Australian doctrine of excessive use of
force in self-defence, to the “defence of use of reasonable force in the
prevention of crime”. Lord Diplock declined the invitation, stating that the
issue of self-defence was “quite different” from that of reasonable force in
the prevention of crime. The latter defence, he noted, is based on statute and
not on the common law. The Criminal Law (Northern Ireland) Act 1968 (No. 1
of 1975) specifically provided for the use of force in the prevention of
crime or in effecting the lawful arrest of suspected offenders (s. 3). It also
provided that s. 3 replaces the common rules dealing with the same
matters. Viscount Dilhorne in the course of his judgment said (at p. 956):

…I can find no escape from the conclusion
that if a crime was committed, it was murder if the shot was fired with intent
to kill or seriously wound. To hold that it could be manslaughter would be to
make entirely new law. If a plea of self-defence is put forward in answer to a
charge of murder and fails because excessive force was used though some force
was justifiable, as the law now stands the accused cannot be convicted of
manslaughter. It may be that a strong case can be made for an alteration of the
law to enable a verdict of manslaughter to be returned where the use of some
force was justifiable but that is a matter for legislation and not for judicial
decision.

With respect, I agree.

There is no special rule to the effect that
death caused by the use of excessive force in self‑defence can only be
manslaughter. However, as stated in Archbold, Criminal Pleading, Evidence
and Practice (39th ed.) at p. 1035, the facts on which the

[Page 257]

defence of self-defence was unsuccessfully
sought to be based may in some cases go to show that the defendant acted under
provocation or that, although acting unlawfully, he lacked the intent to kill
or to cause grievous bodily harm; and in such cases a verdict of manslaughter
would be proper. That I take to be the position at common law and, in broad
terms, the position, as I understand it, under our Criminal Code .

As Barwick C.J. pointed out in dissent in Viro
v. The Queen, supra, the justices in R. v. Howe ignored the
fundamental considerations applicable to murder and manslaughter in developing
their “new rule”; the distinction between murder and manslaughter is based upon
intent. The presence or absence of intent must be determined by the jury and
that finding of fact is determinative of all that follows.

V

The Criminal Code 

A consideration of the elements of murder,
self-defence, and the consequences of that “defence” must begin with
s. 212 (a) and s. 34  of the Criminal Code . Culpable
homicide is murder when the person who causes the death means to cause the
death or means to cause bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause death and
is reckless whether death ensues or not. An accused who is charged with murder
or manslaughter may invoke the defence or self‑defence and s. 34 of
the Code which reads:

34. (1)
Every one who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is
justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to
cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable
him to defend himself.

(2) Every one who is unlawfully assaulted
and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is
justified if

a) he causes
it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the
violence with

[Page 258]

which the assault was originally made or
with which the assailant pursues his purposes, and

(b) he believes, on reasonable and
probable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or
grievous bodily harm.

Section 34(1)  may only be invoked if there is no
intention to cause death or grievous harm and no more force than is necessary
is used. Section 34(2) is invoked where death or grievous harm has resulted but
(i) the accused reasonably apprehended his own death or grievous harm and (ii)
he believed on reasonable grounds that he had no other means of avoiding his
own death or grievous harm. Section 34(1)  affords justification in
circumstances where the force used was not intended to cause death or grievous
harm and is not excessive. Section 34(2) affords justification where there was
an intention to cause death but under circumstances where objectively it was
reasonable that the person accused believed he was going to be killed and
subjectively he did so believe. Section 34(2) obviously provides for acquittal,
despite the fact that the accused means to cause death or bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause death.

On the construction of s. 34  it is
difficult to see how the amount of force used will determine that a murder
should be reduced to manslaughter. In such a case one must of necessity be
dealing with s. 34(2), i.e. there exists an intention to cause
death. Otherwise we fall under s. 34(1)  where there is no intention to
cause death and thus no question of reducing murder to manslaughter. In
s. 34(2) we are concerned primarily with the person who has caused death
and intended to cause death. All of these elements of murder are present.

On a reasonable statutory interpretation of
s. 34  it is apparent that a qualified defence of excessive force does not
exist.

To summarize, I would reject the notion that excessive
force in self-defence, unless related to

[Page 259]

intent under s. 212 of the Code or
to provocation, reduces what would otherwise be murder to manslaughter.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM
THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law — Defences — Entrapment —
Trafficking conviction — Conviction resulting from incidents instigated by
undercover officer — Whether or not defence of entrapment existed and
applicable — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 7(3).

This appeal was from appellant's conviction
of trafficking in cocaine. An undercover policeman and an informer had
repeatedly and persistently requested drugs from appellant, at home and at
work, over the course of two months despite his lack of interest and despite
the absence of no reasonable cause to believe him to be involved in the illicit
drug trade. A certain friendship developed during that time, and eventually,
appellant reluctantly put the two men in contact with a supplier. The charges
laid related to one occasion where cocaine passed from the supplier, through
appellant to the undercover officer and to a second occasion where the drugs
passed directly from the supplier to the officer following an implied threat of
violence made to appellant. Arguments as to whether the ""defence of
entrapment"" existed, and if so, as to whether it applied here, were
considered at trial and on appeal.

Held (Laskin C.J. and Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ. dissenting): The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland, Dickson, Beetz and Chouinard JJ.: The defence of
entrapment, assuming it to be available under Canadian law, did not arise on
the facts of this case that was the unanimous conclusion of the four British
Columbia judges who had already considered the matter. This Court should not
retry the case and arrive at different findings.

[page 419]

Per Ritchie
J.: The question of entrapment can only enter into the determination of an
accused's guilt or innocence where police tactics are such as to leave no room
for the formation of independent criminal intent by the accused. The mere fact
that the crime was committed at the ""solicitation"" of an agent
provocateur does not, standing alone, support a defence of entrapment. The
defence of entrapment might have been supported here if the accused had been
coerced to cooperate with the police plan under the threat of violence.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ., dissenting: The doctrine of entrapment
is rooted in the common law's recognition of the need for some element of
judicial control and should be recognized and applied here. Section 7(3)  of the
Criminal Code  allows the criminal courts to adopt common law defences;
those defences did not crystallize when the statute was enacted. Indeed, as
entrapment may not technically be a defence in that it results in a stay of
prosecution rather than an acquittal, reliance on s. 7(3)  might be unnecessary.
The doctrine's principal characteristics are: 1) that the police instigate an
offence and through their conduct ensnare the accused into committing it; 2)
that the scheme be to gain evidence for the prosecution of the accused for the
instigated crime; and 3) that the crime be induced through deceit, fraud,
trickery, reward or other means. The scheme must be in all circumstances so
shocking and outrageous as to bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. The doctrine is not applicable where the true purpose of the police
initiative is to put the enforcement officers in a position to obtain evidence
of an offence when committed, absent the other circumstances noted. Here, this
shocking and outrageous enterprise was earmarked with all the trappings of
entrapment.

APPEAL from a judgment of the British

dismissing an appeal from a conviction of trafficking in cocaine. Appeal dismissed,

[page 420]

Laskin C.J.. and Estey, McIntyre and Lamer JJ.
dissenting.

Sidney B. Simons, for the appellant.

John Scollin, Q.C., and Cory Stolte,
for the respondent.

The reasons of Laskin C.J. and Estey, McIntyre
and Lamer JJ. were delivered by

ESTEY J. (dissenting)—The appellant was charged with
two counts of trafficking in cocaine on or about October 3 and October 13,
1977. At his trial before McGivern P.C.J. the sale of the cocaine to an
R.C.M.P. undercover agent was admitted. The defence raised was entrapment.

In June of 1977 the accused was employed as a
hairdresser in North Vancouver. He was approached by the manager of the shop,
one André, who said that he had a friend who was Iooking for a gram of cocaine.
Amato responded that he did not think he knew of anyone from whom it could be
obtained. Amato's evidence, which I shall now summarize, is that he had never
used cocaine nor trafficked in it. Two days later, André's friend, who
identified himself as Don, called Amato at work. Amato told Don that he didn't
really know where he could obtain cocaine but as Don was a friend of André he
would keep his ears open. Shortly thereafter Amato switched places of
employment to another hairdressing salon. Don called him there repeating his
earlier request and saying that he had obtained his number from André.

Don was in fact Don Langvin, a paid police
informer whose job was to introduce traffickers to the police. He is himself
known as a trafficker who was granted immunity from prosecution in relation to
an incident where he was found in possession of three ounces of heroin. He was
also paid $200 a week and received a lump sum of $9,500 to assist in relocating
at the end of the operation. Over the period during which he was involved with
Amato, Langvin did not carry a recording device or make any written notes or
reports. He reported verbally

[page 421]

to his
""handler"" who for most of the time was Constable Godwin of the
R.C.M.P. Godwin has no notes nor any recollection of reports made to him by
Langvin of his dealings with Amato prior to October 3 some four months after
Langvin's first contact with Amato. Godwin and Langvin were meeting three or
four times per week over this period. In response to the trial judge's repeated
inquiries, the Crown stated that Langvin could not be located to testify. Here
I have summarized and inserted in the course of Amato's evidence some testimony
given by Godwin.

When Langvin called
Amato at his new place of work back in June he was told by Amato that André was
mistaken if he thought he could be counted on to obtain cocaine. Langvin
responded that he did not know many people in North Vancouver, that he had to
go through André, that he was very desperate to ""score"" a gram and
that he had been looking for some time without success. Langvin continued to
call Amato through the summer. Between the third week in June and early
September he called at least fifteen to twenty times, mostly at work. In August
he came to Amato's work place and asked him to join him for a coffee and to
look at his car. Langvin owned an antique Rover which interested Amato because
he thought Langvin had connections and Amato claims he hoped to own one some
day. Amato describes the relationship between him and Langvin at that time in
his examination-in-chief at trial:

Q. And did you have any intention of
obtaining cocaine for him or selling it to him?

A. Not at all. I was just trying to be a
friend with him because he—he seemed like a
very clean-cut kid and he-he just seemed like a person that I could probably benefit from because he had deals
on cars and things like that, but he seemed
like an all 'round nice guy. To me it didn't—didn't dawn on me.

In the first part
of September Langvin visited twice at Amato's apartment to discuss a party
which was being held at the end of the month. Langvin had some friends coming
from California

[page 422]

and said they wanted some cocaine for the party.
Amato said he would ask amongst his friends to see if he could ""turn him
on to someone"". He asked some hairdresser friends but they could not come
up with anything.

In mid-August Amato called June Lee to ask if
she could help to obtain some cocaine. She is an ex-girlfriend with whom Amato
had lived for three years but they had broken off their relationship two and a
half years previous to this time. Amato says he turned to June Lee because her
brother was involved with heroin. Amato wanted her to contact her brother's
girlfriend as he believed her to have some contact in the drug business. June
Lee wasn't interested but Amato called her back three or four times over the
next month. She did not want to ""stick her neck out"". By
mid-September June Lee changed her mind and arrangements were made to sell one
gram of cocaine to Langvin for $100. Amato met Langvin in a parking lot, took
the $100, went to June Lee's place and returned with the cocaine for Langvin.
Amato received no money or cocaine from the transaction. This first transaction
was in September.

When Amato delivered the first gram to Langvin
the latter raised the possibility of getting a half ounce for his friends who
were coming from California for the party. Amato refused but Langvin called him
the next day at work. Amato said he had done it only as a favour and told
Langvin he was scared by the whole thing. Langvin continued to call Amato daily
at the shop. Amato refused repeatedly. On October 3 Langvin came to Amato's
shop where they went out behind it and after talking about cars Langvin told
Amato that the friends from California had arrived. Amato was asked if he could
do everything in his power to get some more cocaine. He called June Lee who
refused and hung up. He called her back and pressed her to do ""a last
little favour"". After a few calls she agreed to provide a half ounce of
cocaine for $1,100. Langvin and Amato were to meet in a parking lot but when
Langvin showed up he had his friend Gary (who was in fact Godwin) with him.
Amato refused to go through with the deal at first but he was reassured that
Godwin was ""cool""

[page 423]

and that he was
Langvin's best friend. Godwin and Langvin gave Amato $1,100 and he went off to
meet June Lee who went somewhere else to get the cocaine. Amato returned with
it and Godwin began discussing quality and quantity and Amato says he was ""coming
on very strong, like a dealer"". Amato says he told Godwin and Langvin:

... 'Look I am not a dealer.' ... 'As far as
I'm concerned l'm not doing
this voluntarily. I'm into this predicament because I've been pushed this far
and it's not—it's not—it's not going to happen. You know, as soon as this is over I just don't want to see any of the
both of yous again.'

As Amato left the
car he said to Godwin and Langvin, ""Forget it. This won't happen
again"". Langvin wasn't heard from again. Godwin called two days later and
congratulated Amato on how smoothly it had gone. Godwin called a few more times
at the shop saying that he wanted to obtain three ounces of cocaine, offering a
price of $6,000. Amato told him to forget it and Godwin replied, ""You just
tell your people that"". Godwin continued to call at work but Amato refused
the calls saying he was too busy. On October 12 Godwin called seven or eight
times and at the end of the day Amato called him back. Amato told him that he
was washing his hands of him and hung up. Godwin called right back telling
Amato that he had friends in town who were expecting three ounces. Godwin said
he just wanted to have a chat with him for ten minutes and Amato agreed to meet
him. Godwin mentioned that he was in a jam. Godwin told Amato that he didn't
have to be frightened because he always dealt with guns and that he didn't
""screw around"". He told Amato, again according to Amato's evidence at
trial:

'I'm just in a jam, I need to—to answer to
these people, if not these people will be
coming down to see you in the morning.'

Amato was asked if
he would put Godwin in direct contact with June Lee or with her source
repeating that these people would be coming down to see him (Amato that is) the
next day. Amato called

[page 424]

June Lee who said that maybe something could be
arranged for the following day, October 13. Godwin was still very anxious and
asked Amato to try one more time. Amato called June Lee back and arrangements
were made for a deal in the early morning of October 13. Godwin met Amato at 11
p.m. (October 12) in a parking lot. Godwin insisted he must personally pass the
money to June Lee. Together they went to June Lee's place where they met in a
basement apartment and Godwin purchased two and a half ounces of cocaine. Amato
received no money and no cocaine for his part in the deal. Fie and Godwin left
the apartment separately.

Godwin called twice two days later and again the
following day looking for Lee's phone number. After that time there was no
further contact between Amato and Godwin. Two subsequent deals were made with
Lee by Godwin and she pleaded guilty to the three counts. Amato was arrested
five months after the third transaction and was charged with trafficking in
respect of the two dates in October.

In summary, there were three transactions:

1. one gram delivered by Amato to Langvin
some time in September in respect of which no charge was laid;

2. a half ounce delivered by Amato to Godwin
on October 3;

3. two and a half ounces delivered by Lee to
Godwin on October 13.

Charges were laid with respect to numbers 2 and
3 only.

This account, with the exception of the
reference to Godwin's evidence, is taken from the testimony of Amato given at
his trial. André was not called to testify. Langvin could not be located
despite the efforts of defence counsel to determine his whereabouts. The only
evidence other than that of Amato which relates to the pressure being put upon
him by Langvin and Godwin is the evidence of Godwin which commenced with the
meeting in the parking lot on October 3. There are some conflicts between these
two accounts of the period from October 3 to October 13. Godwin denies

[page 425]

having
threatened Amato or having said anything about guns. Godwin says there were
five phone calls during that period, three of which were initiated by Amato.
Godwin also says that Amato discussed receiving an ""end"", some
cocaine off the top for himself,
although he doesn't
say that he actually received it. The learned trial judge made the following
observations on credibility:

In present case, the Crown was unable to
produce the witness who originally arranged for the undercover officer to meet
the accused, Amato. His evidence would have been extremely useful to assist me
in making my determinations of fact. He could have corroborated the evidence of the Crown or he could have corroborated
the evidence of the Defence. I believe he should have been called by the
Crown. His absence has restricted the Defence from making a full answer in
defence to the charge.

I am satisfied that in fairness to the
accused I must presume that he would have given evidence consistent with that
given by the Defence. For that reason, I am prepared for the sake of these
reasons for judgment, to assume that the findings of fact ought to be made on
the basis of the evidence tendered by the Defence.

There
is some difficulty in determining whether the above passage refers to Amato's
version of the events only up to October 3 or if it extends to include the
period ending October 13. In subsequently reviewing the evidence of that period
the learned trial judge says:

The third transaction testified to by the
accused Amato concerned some two and a half ounces of cocaine. On this
occasion, the undercover Policeman dealt directly with Amato to arrange the
deal and then concluded it with the accused Lee. In this transaction, Amato
alleged for the first time, according to my recollection of the evidence, that
he was threatened by the undercover Policeman and the threat was one to the
effect that if the deal could not be made, then certain people would visit
Amato at his place of employment. This information presumably was passed on to
the accused Lee. Amato testified that on the basis of the threat and
persistence of the undercover Officer, he was forced to arrange the transaction
which eventually took place.

I am satisfied that the evidence in this case falls far short of the evidence
required at law to establish the defence of entrapment. The evidence amounts no
more than to persistent solicitation by the informer and the

[page 426]

undercover
Officer to persuade the accused Amato to engage in
trafficking of cocaine. Amato's dealings with
Ms. Lee do not permit her to be successful in relying on the defence of entrapment because she
merely agreed to go along with her friend.

This subsequent
reference to the evidence of Amato concerning the events between October 3 and
13 indicates that the trial judge proceeded on the basis that Amato's story was
credible through-out, or at least was to be so taken for the reasons he gave,
and that the defence of entrapment was rejected with reference to Amato's
version of the events which had taken place.

The Court of Appeal
also proceeded on the basis that Amato's story was to be believed in its
entirety. Taggart J.A. reviewed the third transaction which occurred on October
13 as follows:

In addition, on the third occasion when
cocaine passed between the persons in the house and Lee and the undercover police officer, the Appellant was
induced to go to his source of supply not only by importuning on the
part of the undercover police officer but as well by reason of threats of the use of force by persons for whom the
undercover police officer said he was obtaining the cocaine.

In the light of
these comments I come to the conclusion that the account of the appellant was
accepted as credible and that the issue of the application of entrapment should
be disposed of on that basis.

Returning to the
facts it should be noted that prior to October 3, 1977, Amato was neither known
to nor suspected by the police as a drug trafficker. Neither is there evidence that
a police operation was being directed through him against Lee or any other
police suspect. The evidence in short reveals a random contact with Amato by
Langvin, a police agent, through an innocent intermediary (Amato's boss) who
plays no further part in the story.

The trial judge
apparently accepted that the defence of entrapment was open as a matter of law
in Canada and he referred to the judgment of

[page 427]

Laskin
C.J. in Kirzner v. The
Queen, [1978]
2 S.C.R. 487, and
summarized his view of the test therein described as follows:

In order to determine the sufficiency of
evidence to raise a defence of entrapment
there must be evidence to show that the Police had instigated the crime
and that had they not done so, the accused would not have been involved in the
transaction. The instigation must of course go beyond mere solicitation or
decoy work.

As
seen from the above the trial judge was of the view that the evidence fell
""far short of the evidence required at law to establish the defence of
entrapment"". Notwithstanding that conclusion the learned trial judge made
this observation in imposing his sentence, a fine of $3,000:

I am satisfied that I do not have to
incarcerate you. I'm satisfied, however, that I must impose some monetary
punishment. Notwithstanding that you were persuaded by some continuing
persistence to get involved in the trafficking of cocaine, I was not and I am
still not satisfied that the persistence used upon you legally justified your actions. I am, however, satisfied
that that persistence is something that I must take into consideration
in imposing sentence upon you.

The
Court of Appeal agreed with the conclusion of the trial judge in a passing
reference to the merits of the defence of entrapment. In any event the Court
concluded that the defence of entrapment was not available. Taggart J.A., after
referring to decisions of the British Columbia and Ontario Courts of Appeal in
which the view was expressed that there was no defence of entrapment, as well
as to the views of the Chief Justice in Kirzner v. The Queen, supra, put it this way:

I think we ought to follow the expressed
views of this Court until such time as the
matter is definitively settled by the
Supreme Court of Canada or by a division of this Court composed of five
members who can deal definitively with the problem.

Seaton
J.A. was of the view not only that the defence of entrapment does not exist but
that it should not exist. He expressed a decided preference for what he called
the English approach which he explained as being the conviction of the accused
for the completed offence but mitigating

[page 428]

the sentence where his
involvement is due to the motivating influence of others whether those others
be police agents or not. Carrothers J.A. agreed with both Taggart and Seaton B.A.

The issue of the
availability of the defence of entrapment was expressly left open by Chief
Justice Laskin in Kirzner, supra. The Ontario Court of Appeal in that
case ((1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 665) had taken the view that the defence was not
open to the accused. The Chief Justice concurred with the Court of Appeal in
the result but not the reasoning at p. 496:

In
these circumstances, I would not, however, endorse the view of the
Ontario Court of Appeal in the present case or of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal in Chernecki [(1971), 16 C.R.N.S. 182] rejecting entrapment as a
defence. There are good reasons for leaving the question open. Indeed, if that position is based on a static
view of s. 7(3)  of the Criminal Code  I find it unacceptable. I do not think that s. 7(3)  should
be regarded as having frozen the power of the Courts to enlarge the content of
the common law by way of recognizing new defences, as they may think proper according to circumstances that they consider may
call for further control of prosecutorial behaviour or of judicial
proceedings.

The majority of this
Court speaking through Pigeon J. expressly refrained from expressing any view
on the availability of the defence of entrapment in Canadian law.

The scope of a defence
in the nature of that generally called entrapment and the problems raised by
such a defence are discussed at length by the Chief Justice in Kirzner,
supra, and will not be repeated here. If there be such a defence for an
accused in the criminal law, several matters must be determined:

(a) the source of authority in the courts to
give recognition to the defence;

(b) the nature and range of offences in
respect of which this defence may be available;

(c) the constituent elements which must be
present;

[page 429]

(d) the remedy or result of its successful
application.

The
proponents of this defence generally seek to advance it as something necessary
to bring fairness or fundamental justice into the criminal law when the state
agencies of enforcement resort to methods of law enforcement which threaten the
integrity of the criminal justice system or bring shame to the state. Put
another way, the defence is seen as an offset to or a control mechanism for
over-zealous crime detection and prosecution where inducement or incitement
leads the otherwise innocent to the commission of an offence. There are shades
and variants of these elements which make the defence difficult of definition
and the doctrine delicate to apply.

As
the Chief Justice said in Kirzner at p. 492:

There is, of course, a balance to be struck
between giving reasonable latitude to the police in the employment of
stratagems to control the spread of crime, especially in the case of the
illegal drug traffic, and controlling behaviour that goes beyond any reasonable
latitude. American jurisdictions have, on a constitutional basis, sought to
control the introduction of illegally obtained evidence; in England, the Courts
have continued to exercise a discretionary power to control the admissibility
of evidence that would operate unfairly against an accused. Control techniques
may thus relate to the recognition of substantive defences or to rules against
the admission of evidence or to a discretion as to its reception. Abuse of
process or stay of proceedings have also been put forward as techniques of
control.

and
at p. 494:

The problem which has caused judicial concern
is the one which arises from the
police-instigated crime, where the police have gone beyond mere
solicitation or mere decoy work and have actively organized a scheme of
ensnarement, of entrapment, in order to prosecute the person so caught. In my
opinion, it is only in this situation that it is proper to speak of entrapment
and to consider what effect this should have
on the prosecution of a person who has thus been drawn into the
commission of an offence.

[page 430]

There is no doubt that it may be difficult in
particular cases to draw the line between mere use of spies, decoys or
informers and the use of agents provocateurs who go beyond mere solicitation or encouragement and
initiate a criminal design for the purpose of entrapping a
person in order to prosecute him.

In
an earlier case the defence was characterized by the Chief Justice in a
judgment when on the Ontario Court of Appeal, as arising in the presence of
""calculated inveigling and persistent importuning"" by the enforcement
agency: R. v. Ormerod, [1969] 2 O.R. 230, at p. 238.

This
defence has been applied and been the subject of an on-going debate for over
half a century in the courts of the United States. In Sorrells v. United States (1932), 287 U.S. 435, a case in which the
facts, substituting alcohol for drugs, are remarkably similar to the present
circumstances, Chief Justice Hughes recognized the defence:

It is clear that
the evidence was sufficient to warrant a finding that
the act for which defendant was prosecuted
was instigated by the prohibition agent, that it was the creature of his
purpose . . . [p. 441]

and
continued on p. 442:

A different
question is presented when the crimnal design originates
with the officials of the Government, and
they implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.

The
Court adopted an earlier Circuit Court view:

When the criminal
design originates, not with the accused, but is
conceived in the mind of the government
officers, and the accused is by persuasion, deceitful representation, or
inducement lured into the commission of a criminal act, the government is estopped by
sound public policy from prosecution
therefor. [Woods J. in Newman v.
United States (1924), 299 F. 128,
at p. 131].

The
majority of the Court found authority for applying the defence of entrapment in
a rule of statutory construction to be applied to the offence-creating statute,
at p. 448:

[page 431]

We think that
this established principle of construction is
applicable here. We are unable to conclude that it was the intention of the Congress in enacting this statute that its processes of detection and enforcement
should be abused by the instigation by government officials of an act on the part of persons otherwise
innocent in order to lure them to its
commission and to punish them.

By this theory the
Court avoided claiming for itself a power to forbid the prosecution of a person
whose conduct appears to come squarely within the statute. The issue was seen
by the Court as whether the defendant is a person otherwise innocent whom the
government is seeking to punish for an alleged offence which is ""the product
of the creative industry of its own efforts"". Chief Justice Hughes
concluded at p. 451:

If that is the fact, common justice requires
that the accused be permitted to prove it.

The question then
arose, of course, as to what the proper disposition should be on a successful
application of the defence. Should it preclude prosecution, should it be a
finding of not guilty, or simply a stay of prosecution at whatever the stage
the defence is established? In Sorrells the
Court remanded the case for further proceedings at trial in which it would be
left to the jury to assess the conduct of the police investigation and the
conduct of the accused with emphasis upon his predisposition and criminal
design with reference to the offence. Chief Justice Hughes concluded at p. 452:

We are of the opinion that upon the evidence
produced in the instant case the defense of
entrapment was available and that the
trial court was in error in holding that as a matter of law there was no
entrapment and in refusing to submit the issue to the jury.

A minority opinion
by Mr. Justice Roberts, concurred in by Justices Brandeis and Stone, took the
view, at p. 454, that entrapment should be defined as:

... the conception and planning of an offense
by an officer, and his procurement of its commission by one who would not have
perpetrated it except for the trickery, persuasion, or fraud of the officer.

[page 432]

In the minority view the doctrine of entrapment
rests on a fundamental rule of public policy, at pp. 457 and 459, namely:

The protection of its own functions and the
preservation of the purity of its own temple belongs only to the court. It is
the province of the court and of the court alone to protect itself and the
government from such prostitution of the criminal law. The violation of the
principles of justice by the entrapment of the unwary into crime should be
dealt with by the court no matter by whom or at what stage of the proceedings
the facts are brought to its attention. Quite properly it may discharge the
prisoner upon a writ of habeas corpus. Equally well may it quash the indictment or entertain and try a plea
in bar. But its powers do not end there. Proof of entrapment, at any stage of
the case, requires the court to stop the prosecution, direct that the
indictment be quashed, and the defendant set at liberty.

[…]

The applicable principle is that courts must
be closed to the trial of a crime instigated by the government's own agents. No other issue, no comparison of
equities as between the guilty official and the guilty defendant, has
any place in the enforcement of this overruling principle of public policy.

The U.S. Supreme Court considered this defence
again in Sherman v. United States (1958), 356 U.S. 369. The accused had
been repeatedly importuned by an informer who, like the accused, was attending
a clinic for treatment for narcotic addiction. The informer claimed that he was
not responding to treatment and the repeated requests for assistance in
obtaining narcotics were premised upon the informer's feigned suffering. The
majority applied Sorrells and continued to define entrapment as a
defence ""where the criminal conduct was the product of creative activity
of law enforcement officials"". The government reply relied on the
defendant's criminal record to establish ""a ready complaisance"" to
commit the offence. In Sorrells the case was remanded with the
entrapment issue being left to the jury. In Sherman, however, the Court
directed a dismissal no doubt on the grounds of overwhelming evidence. The
majority of the Court declined to reconsider the doctrinal basis for the
defence adopted by the majority in Sorrells as the issue had not been

[page 433]

raised
by the parties or in the lower courts. Frankfurter J., for himself and Justices
Douglas, Harlan and Brennan, concurred in the result but would have elevated
the minority view of Sorrells
to a
governing principle. The view of Frankfurter J., at p. 380, was that:

Insofar as they are used as instrumentalities
in the administration of criminal justice, the federal courts have an obligation
to set their face against enforcement of the law by lawless means or means that
violate rationally vindicated standards of justice, and to refuse to sustain
such methods by effectuating them .... Public confidence in the fair and
honorable administration of justice, upon which ultimately depends the rule of
law, is the transcending value at stake.

Following
this line of thought the crucial question becomes whether the police conduct in
a particular case falls below ""standards, to which common feelings
respond, for the proper use of governmental power"". The position of the
majority in Sorrells
is commented upon at p. 382:

The intention referred to, therefore, must be
a general intention or predisposition to
commit, whenever the opportunity should arise, crimes of the kind solicited, and
in proof of such a predisposition evidence has often been admitted to show the defendant's reputation, criminal
activities, and prior disposition. The danger of prejudice in such a situation, particularly if the issue of entrapment must be
submitted to the jury and disposed of by a general verdict of guilty or
innocent, is evident. The defendant must
either forego the claim of entrapment or run the substantial risk that, in
spite of instructions, the jury will allow a criminal record or bad reputation
to weigh in its determination of guilt of the specific offense of which he
stands charged. Furthermore, a test that looks to the character and
predisposition of the defendant rather than the conduct of the police loses sight
of the underlying reason for the defense of entrapment.

[page 434]

It follows therefore that a court enunciating
this view must conclude, irrespective of the defendant's past record, that
certain police conduct to ensnare him into further crime cannot be tolerated
and hence the defence of entrapment applies. The position of the accused is not
the criterion of the test but rather the conduct of the public authority (at p.
383):

Permissible
police activity does not vary according to the
particular defendant concerned; surely if two suspects have been solicited at
the same time in the same manner, one should
not go to jail simply because he has been convicted before and is said
to have a criminal disposition.

While recognizing that the police may act so as to
detect those engaged in criminal conduct and those who are ready and willing to
commit further crimes, the test as to entrapment must be that (at p. 384):

... in holding out inducements they should
act in such a manner as is likely to induce
to the commission of crime only these persons and not others who would
normally avoid crime and through self-struggle resist ordinary temptations.
This test shifts attention from the record and predisposition of the particular
defendant to the conduct of the police and the likelihood, objectively
considered, that it would entrap only those ready and willing to commit crime.
It is as objective a test as the subject matter permits, .. .

The minority acknowledges that the scale of
police conduct to be condemned by the doctrine must be such as is likely to
induce those not otherwise ready and willing to commit crime to do so, and this
type of conduct must ""be picked out from case to case as new situations
arise involving different crimes and new methods of detection"" (p. 384).
Like Justice Roberts in Sorrells,
the minority in Sherman concluded at p.
385 that the test was one for the court and not for the jury:

Only the court,
through the gradual evolution of explicit standards in
accumulated precedents, can do this with the degree of certainty that the wise
administration of criminal justice demands.

[page 435]

Frankfurter J. does
not stipulate as to whether the proper disposition is a quashing of the charge
as proposed by Roberts J. in Sorrells or a
stay of proceedings as was frequently the case in the federal courts when that
option was open to them. He concurred with the result of the majority which was
to remand the matter to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the
indictment.

Again in 1973 the
U.S. Supreme Court returned to entrapment in the United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423. The police investigator
had supplied an essential and, although legally obtainable, difficult to obtain
ingredient in the manufacture of 'speed' in return for one-half of the drug to
be produced. The conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit because of ""the intolerable degree of government
participation in the criminal enterprise"" ((1972), 459 F. 2d 671). The
trial judge had stated the law to be:

Where a person already has the willingness
and the readiness to break the law, the mere fact that the government agent
provides what appears to be a favorable opportunity is not entrapment.

By a five-to-four
majority the Supreme Court restored the conviction. Rehnquist J., for the
majority, followed the majority judgments in Sorrells and Sherman, taking
the epitome of the latter judgment to be the observation by Chief Justice
Warren:

[t]o determine whether entrapment has been
established, a line must be drawn between the trap for the unwary innocent and
the trap for the unwary criminal. [356 U.S. 369, at 372].

Rehnquist J.
concluded in favour of the ""subjective"" approach at p. 434:

Nor does it seem particularly desirable for
the law to grant complete immunity from prosecution
to one who himself planned to commit a crime, and then committed it, simply because government undercover agents
subjected him to inducements which might have seduced a hypothetical individual who was not so
predisposed.

[page 436]

It is clear that in the view of the majority in Russell
the defence of entrapment is not to be used as a flexible yardstick in
assessing the conduct of the prosecution. Rehnquist J. continued, at p. 435:

But the defense of entrapment enunciated in
those opinions was not intended to give the federal judiciary a
""chancellor's foot"" veto over law enforcement practices of which it
did not approve. The execution of the federal laws under our Constitution is
confided primarily to the Executive Branch of the Government, subject to
applicable constitutional and statutory limitations and to judicially fashioned
rules to enforce those limitations.

Four members of the Court dissented in two
judgments. Douglas J. with Brennan J. concurring followed the dissents in Sorrells and Sherman and concluded that the federal prosecutor here played
""a debased role"" when he became the ""instigator"" of the
crime by supplying an ingredient needed to manufacture the illegal drug.
Stewart J. dissented (Brennan and Marshall JJ. concurring) and likewise adopted
the dissenting viewpoint in the two prior cases. The Sorrells and Sherman majorities
in this view stand for the limitation of the entrapment doctrine ""to those
who would be otherwise innocent"", that is those who would not have
committed the crime but for the government's inducement (p. 440). Stewart J.
would apply the principle of the minority view in both cases and thereby place
the focus upon ""whether the police conduct falls below standards for the
proper use of governmental power"", or as Stewart J. put it at p. 441:

Phrased another way, the question is whether—regardless
of the predisposition to crime of the particular defendant involved—the
governmental agents have acted in such a way as is likely to instigate or
create a criminal offense. Under this approach, the determination of the lawfulness of the Government's conduct
must be made—as it is on all questions involving the legality of law
enforcement methods—by the trial judge, not the jury.

[page 437]

The minority prefers an application whereby the
""predisposed"" or ""otherwise innocent"" condition of the
defendant is irrelevant because ""this subjective test means that the
Government is permitted to entrap a person with a criminal record or bad
reputation, and then to prosecute him for the manufactured crime ... ""
[pp. 443-44].

From a review of the earlier decisions the
appropriate rule in the minority view is expressed to be (per Stewart J. at p. 445):

But when the
agents' involvement in criminal activities goes beyond
the mere offering of such an opportunity, and when their conduct is of a kind
that could induce or instigate the
commission of a crime by one not ready and willing to commit it, then—regardless
of the character or propensities of the particular person induced—I think
entrapment has occurred.

On principle the supply by a government agent to
the defendant of an essential ingredient not otherwise obtainable was precisely
the type of governmental conduct that amounts to entrapment in the view of the
minority. Therefore, regardless of the defendant's ""predisposition""
or ""innocence"", he was entrapped. Neither dissenting judgment deals
with the proper disposition of such a case. The reversal of the conviction at
trial by the Court of Appeals may have entailed a quashing of the indictment or
a dismissal of the charge but the Report [(1972), 459 F. 2d 671] is ambiguous. Vide also Hampton v. United States (1976), 425 U.S. 484, where
entrapment emerged in some of the judgments of the Court but as the discussion
centered on constitutional aspects, the case is not here helpful.

In the course of this developing case law in the
American courts the American Law Institute published a proposed Model Penal Code, 1962. With reference
to entrapment the following was proposed:

Section 2.13. Entrapment.

(1) A public law enforcement official or a
person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates

[page 438]

an entrapment if for the purpose of obtaining
evidence of the commission of an offense, he induces or encourages another
person to engage in conduct constituting such offense by either:

(a) making knowingly false representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct is
not prohibited; or

(b)employing methods of persuasion or
inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be
committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.

(2) Except as provided in Subsection (3) of
this Section, a person prosecuted for an offense shall be acquitted if he
proves by a preponderance of evidence that his conduct occurred in response to
an entrapment. The issue of entrapment shall be tried by the Court in the
absence of the jury.

(3)The defense afforded by this Section is
unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an element of the
offense charged and the prosecution is based
on conduct causing or threatening such injury to a person other than the
person perpetrating the entrapment.

See also the Brown Commission proposal for a new
federal Criminal Code  to the same effect (1971), sec. 702(2) . The American
entrapment jurisprudence has been the source of much academic comment in the
United States as well as in Canada and the United Kingdom. Vide: Park, The Entrapment Controversy (1976), 60 Minn. L.R. 163;
Friedland, Controlling Entrapment (1982),
32 U. of T. L.J. 1; Barlow, Entrapment and
the Common Law (1978), 41 Mod. L.R. 266.

The earliest reference in the Canadian cases to
the defence now commonly referred to as entrapment is found in Amsden v. Rogers (1916), 26 C.C.C. 389.
Like several of the cases which follow, other grounds were found for the
dismissal of charges, here the lack of precision in the evidence establishing
the locus of the offence to be within the province of charge. In the course of
disposing of the appeal on this basis Lamont J., then in the Supreme Court of
Saskatchewan, stated:

I do not say that in their efforts to secure evidence in cases where
crimes have been committed the officers of

[page 439]

the law are not sometimes entitled to resort
to pretense and even false statements. There may be cases where that is
necessary in the interests of justice to enable them to secure the evidence, and the fact that an officer has
resorted to subterfuge may not cast discredit upon the evidence which he discovers by means thereof. But, in my
opinion, it is a different matter where the false statements are made, not for
the detection of crime committed but for the purpose of inducing its
commission, and inducing its commission in order that the person making these statements may be able to
prefer a charge for the offence committed at his solicitation.

This Court in Lemieux v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 492, found it unnecessary to accept or reject the defence because on the
facts before the Court the defendant has not committed the alleged breaking and
entering because by police arrangement the owner of the premises has consented
to the entry. The facts were well within the requirement of Sorrells, et al. but for the foregoing reason it was unnecessary to
settle the issue of entrapment on that appeal. Judson J., however, in giving
judgment for the Court asserted, albeit in obiter (at p. 496):

Had Lemieux in fact committed the offence
with which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act
at the solicitation of an agent provocateur
would have been irrelevant to the
question of his guilt or innocence.

In the following
year, in Patterson v.
The Queen, [1968]
S.C.R. 157, the Court allowed an appeal from conviction on the basis that the
offence of keeping a common bawdy house was not disclosed on the record. The
policeman who instigated the alleged transaction by an unsolicited telephone
call to the accused was described in the Court of Appeal as an agent provocateur but nothing indicates that the defence
of entrapment was advanced before this Court. As in Lemieux the appeal turned on the failure of the record to
disclose the commission of the alleged offence and hence the issue of
entrapment did not arise.

In the year
following, the Ontario Court of Appeal in Ormerod, supra, examined the defence

[page 440]

and in the view of
Laskin J.A., as he then was, if there be a general defence an element must be
the presence of "". .. such calculated inveigling and persistent
importuning of the accused ... as to go beyond ordinary solicitation of a
suspected drug seller"" (at p. 238). The exploratory views there expressed
seem to be that if the defence had its place in the common law it would be in
the Court's inherent power to prevent abuse of its processes.

R. v. Shipley, [1970] 2 O.R. 411, records the first judicial application
of the defence in this country. The undercover policeman acknowledged that
there was no reason to suspect the accused of trafficking in drugs and that the
policeman was desirous not ""of developing evidence against the accused or
to catch him in trafficking"". His primary interest in the transactions
which followed was to find out the identity of the accused's suppliers. McAndrew
Co. Ct. J. found that without the inducement held out by the officer the
accused would not have offended the Narcotic Control Act. The Court applied the dictum of Sorrells, supra, to the effect that the officer had done
more than supply the opportunity to commit the offence; he had in fact
instigated the offence by putting the idea into the mind of the accused; and stayed
the prosecution on the authority of the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Osborn, [1969] 1 O.R. 152, (subsequently reversed in this Court, [1971] S.C.R.
184). See also R. v.
MacDonald (1971), 15 C.R.N.S. 122 (B.C. Prov. Ct.)

The British Columbia
Court of Appeal rejected the defence of entrapment on the facts in R. v. Chernecki, supra, but in doing so applied the words of
Judson J. in Lemieux,
supra, observing that
no such defence was then known to the law in this country (per Bull J.A., pp. 232-33). Notwithstanding the Chernecki decision, Cronin Prov. Ct. J. (B.C.) applied the
defence of entrapment in R. v. Haukness, [1976]
5 W.W.R. 420, and found the accused not guilty. In R. v. Sirois, [1972] 2 W.W.R. 149, Greschuk J. of the Supreme Court of
Alberta applied the test in Sorrells and
rejected the defence on the facts. Similarly, the Nova

[page 441]

Scotia Court of
Appeal in R. v. Bonnar (1975), 34 C.R.N.S. 182, after a
comprehensive review of the law of entrapment in the United States and the tentative
discussions of the doctrine in the courts of this country, found on the facts
no basis for the defence because the undercover agent (not a policeman)
""afforded the accused the opportunity to commit the offence [but] he did
not induce him to commit it"" (p. 194). In obiter Macdonald
J.A., speaking for the Court, expressed the view at p. 192:

... that proceedings should be stayed or the
accused discharged if it is clear that the accused did not have a prior
intention or predisposition to commit the offence with which he is charged but committed it only because the
conduct of the agent provocateur was (as Laskin J.A. said in Regina v. Ormerod ...) such calculating, inveigling and persistent importuning as went
beyond ordinary solicitation. In such a situation there is an abuse of the process of the Court and something
that is contrary to public policy. Indeed such conduct by an agent
provocateur strikes at the very foundation of the system and administration of
criminal justice in a free and democratic society
and just cannot be permitted or condoned.

As in Sorrells, supra the foregoing indicates the need for
the presence of two elements:

(a) the absence of prior intention or
predisposition in the accused to commit the offence; and

(b) the commission of the offence because of
the conduct of the police agent when it amounts to calculating, inveigling and
persistent importuning.

There is a brief
reference to entrapment in the Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections
(the Ouimet Report, 1969) where at pp. 75-76 it is stated:

... the function of law enforcement officers
is to detect crime, not to create
or encourage crime .... the use of persuasion or unfair means to induce the
commission of an offence by a person
who had no pre-existing intention to commit it, and who would not have
committed the

[page 442]

offence but for the instigation of law
enforcement officers or an agent provocateur employed by them, is in the
opinion of the Committee wholly indefensible.

With
respect to the defence of entrapment the Committee recommended legislation at
pp. 79-80, which would provide:

1. That a person is not guilty of an offence
if his conduct is instigated by a law enforcement officer or agent of a law
enforcement officer, for the purpose of obtaining evidence for the prosecution
of such person, if such person did not have a pre-existing intention to commit
the offence.

2. Conduct amounting to an offence shall be
deemed not to have been instigated where the defendant had a pre-existing
intention to commit the offence when the opportunity arose and the conduct
which is alleged to have induced the defendant to commit the offence did not go
beyond affording him an opportunity to commit it.

3. The defence that the offence has been
instigated by a law enforcement officer or his agent should not apply to the
commission of those offences which involve the infliction of bodily harm or
which endanger life.

The
Report of the Commission of Inquiry Concerning Certain Activities of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (The McDonald Commission, 1981) made a somewhat similar
recommendation with reference to the defence of entrapment. See Second Report,
vol. II, at p. 1053.

If
there be a defence of entrapment available to the accused in the circumstances
of this appeal it cannot be of statutory origin for it is not to be found in
the Criminal Code . If a defence arises in
the common law it can only find its way into the courts through s. 7(3) of the Code:

7. ...

(3) Every rule and principle of the common
law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a
defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings
for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada,
except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or
any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

[page 443]

This provision in
turn only supports the application of such a defence if subs. (3) has a
continuing prospective character when properly construed. The Chief Justice
assumes this to be the case in Kirzner, supra, at p. 496:

I do not think that s. 7(3)  should be
regarded as having frozen the power
of the Courts to enlarge the content of the common law by way of recognizing new defences,
as they may think proper
according to circumstances that they
consider may call for further control of prosecutorial behaviour or of judicial proceedings.

Bull J.A. in Chernecki, supra, on the other hand, appears to take the
opposite view of s. 7(3) . The conventional view has been that the common law is
always speaking. Some theories hold that it is a process of discovery, others
of evolution. Whatever it might be properly classified to be in jurisprudence
it would take the clearest and most precise language in a statute which
purports to incorporate the principles of common law to so construe it as to
crystallize the common law at the date of enactment of the statute. If so, the
importation of common law principles would be limited to those which had
crystallized and developed prior to the effective date of the statute. Section
7(3)  does not employ such words. It is at most ambiguous, susceptible either to
the static view or to the view that it makes reference to the common law as an
evolving, developing system of rules and principles. Where a statute might be
read as displacing the common law the appropriate canon of interpretation is a
preference for that construction which preserves the rule of common law where
it can be done consistently with the statute. By analogy the common law would
be allowed to develop defences not inconsistent with the provisions of the Code if the construction adopted was
prospective. For this conclusion I find support in the Report of the Imperial
Commissioners of the draft Code of 1879, s. 19 of which is the forerunner of
our present s. 7(3) . The Commissioners explained the inclusion of s. 19 (now s.
7(3) ) as follows, at Volume I, p. 10 of their Report:

But whilst we exclude from the category of
indictable offences any culpable act or
omission not provided for by this or some other Act of Parliament, there
is another

[page 444]

branch of the unwritten law which introduces
different considerations; namely, the principles which declare what
circumstances amount to a justification or excuse for doing that which would be
otherwise a crime, or at least would alter the quality of the crime. In the
cases of ordinary occurrence, the decisions of the Courts and the opinions of
great lawyers enable us to say how the principles of the law are to be applied.
And so far the unwritten law may be digested without extreme difficulty and
with practical advantage, and so far also it may be settled and rendered
certain.

In our opinion the principles of the common
law on such subjects, when rightly understood, are founded on sense and
justice. There are a few points on which we venture to suggest alterations,
which we shall afterwards state in detail. At present we desire to state that
in our opinion it is, if not absolutely impossible, at least not practicable,
to foresee all the various combinations of circumstances which may happen, but
which are of so unfrequent occurrence that they have not hitherto been the
subject of judicial consideration, although they might constitute a
justification or excuse, and to use language at once so precise and clear and comprehensive
as to include all cases that ought to be included, and not to include any case
that ought to be excluded.

We have already expressed our opinion that it
is on the whole expedient that no crimes not specified in the Draft Code should
be punished, though in consequence some guilty persons may thus escape
punishment. But we do not think it desirable that, if a particular combination
of circumstances arises of so unusual a character that the law has never been
decided with reference to it, there should be any risk of a Code being so
framed as to deprive an accused person of a defence to which the common law
entitles him, and that it might become the duty of the judge to direct the jury
that they must find him guilty, although the facts proved did show that he had
a defence on the merits, and would have an undoubted claim to be pardoned by
the Crown. While, therefore, digesting and declaring the law as applicable to
the ordinary cases, we think that the common law so far as it affords a defence
should be preserved in all cases not expressly provided for. This we have
endeavoured to do by Section 19 of the Draft Code.

It
might also be noted that in recent years this Court has adverted to common law
defences of duress (Paquette v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R.
189), necessity
(Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616), and due diligence (R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299), without exclusive

[page 445]

concern for the
state of the law prior to the 1892 introduction of the Criminal Code .

Applying the
ordinary rule of construction where statutes and common law meet I conclude
that s. 7(3)  is the authority for the courts of criminal jurisdiction to adopt,
if appropriate in the view of the court, defences including the defence of
entrapment. The components of such a defence and the criteria for its
application raise other issues.

Having found the way
open for the development of defences not contrary to the provisions of the Code or other statutes of Canada, consideration must be
given to the juristic nature of the doctrine of entrapment. While it is
frequently referred to in legal writings and sometimes in the courts as the
'defence of entrapment' it is not a defence in the traditional sense of that
term. A successful defence leads to an acquittal on the charge, a determination
that the offence has not been committed by the accused. Here, axiomatically,
the crime from a physical point of view at least has been committed. Indeed it
may be that the necessary intent and act have combined to form a complete
crime. The successful application of the doctrine of entrapment, if it be a
defence in the ordinary sense, would support an acquittal. The Criminal Code  authorizes acquittals in somewhat
similar circumstances as in the case of the defence of duress. However, as will
be seen later, the successful application of the concept of entrapment leads to
a stay of prosecution, the court withholding its processes from the prosecution
on the basis that such would bring the administration of justice into
disrepute. This is an exercise of the inherent powers of the courts. Entrapment
is not in a traditional sense a defence. For convenience and ease of reference
as well as to conform to the present vocabulary of the law, I sometimes refer
to the doctrine as the 'defence of entrapment' although in strict law it is not
a defence. Therefore, for this technical reason, it may not be necessary to
invoke s. 7(3)  other than to illustrate by analogy the continuing flexibility
of the criminal law within and without the Criminal Code .

[page 446]

The availability of
this defence in law and the proper constituent elements of the offence are
closely entwined. Assuming the defence to be known to the common law and
available in Canadian criminal law, in a proper case what are the component
elements, the criteria to be met for its invocation? It is, of course,
impossible to cast in futuro
a set of guides,
principles, rules or yard-sticks with satisfactory precision and detail. This
defence perhaps more than any other will succeed only in an unusual and
delicately balanced set of circumstances. Case law will have to paint in the
variants. The principal elements or characteristics of the defence are that an
offence must be instigated, originated or brought about by the police and the
accused must be ensnared into the commission of that offence by the police
conduct; the purpose of the scheme must be to gain evidence for the prosecution
of the accused for the very crime which has been so instigated; and the
inducement may be but is not limited to deceit, fraud, trickery or reward, and
ordinarily but not necessarily will consist of calculated inveigling and
persistent importuning. The character of the initiative taken by the police is
unaffected by the fact that the law enforcement agency is represented by a
member of a police force or an undercover or other agent, paid or unpaid, but
operating under the control of the police. In the result, the scheme so
perpetrated must in all the circumstances be so shocking and outrageous as
to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.

At least one
relevant circumstance in examining the character in law of the police conduct
(such as persistent importuning) is whether the law enforcement agency had a
reasonable suspicion that the accused would commit the offence without
inducement. By itself and without more the predisposition in fact of the
accused is not relevant to the availability of the defence. On the other hand,
where the true purpose of the police initiative is to put the enforcement
officers in a position to obtain evidence of an offence when committed, absent
other circumstances already noted, the concept of entrapment does not arise.

[page 447]

Each case will turn
within the influence of these factors according to its own circumstances. The root
of the defence must, in my view, be the same as, for example, the exclusion of
involuntary confessions. The integrity of the criminal justice system demands
the rule. The exclusionary rule in any defence based upon the same ultimate
considerations will be difficult of administration; but that is not a fatal
consideration. Even if entrapment were found to be based upon a rule of
statutory interpretation, as Chief Justice Hughes has said, its application, as
for example in Russell, supra, is difficult. Fine lines are drawn in the
determination of guilt and innocence throughout the criminal law. The
overriding need in the field which we have been examining on this appeal is for
a device in the criminal justice system which will not expose the community to the
spectacle of a person being convicted of a crime, the commission of which in
substance was the work of the state itself.

As we have seen the
United States Supreme Court is ambivalent on the consequences of implementation
of the defence of entrapment. The majority view in Sorrells and Russell has
considered it to be a matter for the jury on the proper instructions of the
trial judge in the ordinary way. In this process the defence leads the evidence
of entrapment and the prosecution has the right of reply. The difficulties with
this procedure are described above in excerpts from the minority view from the Sorrells case forward. The minority position is that abuse
of process is the fundamental safeguard available to the community through the
court for the preservation of the integrity of the administration of justice.
It is for the courts and no one else to maintain that integrity and to keep the
courts free and immune from improper employment by other branches of
government. Thus the minority view decries the employment of a rule of
statutory construction to find that the accused, although he has committed the
crime, has not offended the statute and thereby is entitled to a defence. The
minority view meets the problem head-on by acknowledging the commission of the
offence but, in the circumstances raised by the defence of entrapment, treating
the case as one the

[page 448]

hearing of which in
court would be an abuse of the judicial system by the prosecutorial arm of
government. The remedy in such a case therefore is a stay of prosecution, a
denial of the courts to their improper use by the law enforcement agencies of
the community. Sometimes the United States courts quashed the indictment and
sometimes simply entered a stay. There seems to be no distinction in the law of
that country, at least in this sector of the law, between the remedy of a
dismissal, quashing of indictment or indefinite stay of prosecution. The
essential difference between the minority and majority is that the latter leave
the issue to the jury in the ordinary way as though this were a substantive
defence, whereas the minority take the view that the protection of the process
of the Court and the institution of the Court in order to preserve it for the
discharge of its proper role in the community is a function for the Court and
the Court alone. This raises philosophical difficulties when one considers the
defence of duress where of course the physical act in question has been
committed. The defence is available through the ordinary processes of trial
and, if a jury is involved, will include the assessment of all the evidence and
circumstances by the jury to determine the success of the defence.

In the case of
entrapment, the minority in the United States Supreme Court has concluded that
on balance the public interest requires that the administration of justice be
safeguarded against the challenge coming from the executive branch of
government through the abuse of the judicial process, by the presiding judge
himself without the intervention of a jury. This school of thought has in its
support the need for continuity of administration of the principle. The
realization of an abuse of the judicial branch is a question essentially of law
or law and political science and one not by its nature ordinarily assigned to
the jury component of the trial courtroom. It would seem, on a pure application
of criminal procedure, that a stay is the proper judicial step. I find comfort
in this

[page 449]

conclusion in Bonnar,
supra, per Macdonald J.A. at p. 192.

What basis,
therefore, do we have in our criminal judicial system for a court staying a
prosecution brought in the ordinary way by the executive branch of the
government charged with the enforcement of the criminal law? This Court
considered its role where abuse of process was advanced as a defence in R.
v. Osborn which carne to this Court from the Ontario Court of Appeal where
Jessup J.A., speaking for the Court in [1969] 1 O.R. 152, at p. 155, concluded:

... the courts of this Province have from the
earliest times invoked an inherent jurisdiction to prevent the abuse of their
process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings.

This brings us then
to the basic question as to whether or not after the judgments of this Court in
Osborn and in Rourke, infra, there is any jurisdiction in a
Canadian criminal court to stay a prosecution on the grounds of abuse of
process whether or not that abuse takes the form of the defence of entrapment.
The Court of Appeal in Osborn was, in the result, reversed in this Court
on the grounds that there is no basis in our criminal law for a finding of
oppression by reason only of the fact that a multiplicity of charges are
successively laid in relation to the same facts. In that case the respondent
was acquitted on a charge of having in possession seven cheques intended to be
used to commit a forgery. A year later the accused was indicted on a charge of
conspiring to commit the indictable offence of uttering the same seven forged
cheques. This was found in this Court not to be either oppressive or subject to
any remedy such as abuse of process. In the view of Pigeon J. (Martland and
Judson JJ. concurring), the issue was very narrow and dealt entirely with the
right in the prosecution to come back with the second charge as it did. In his
judgment Pigeon J. stated in part at pp. 188-89:

In the instant case, it does not appear to me
that I need consider whether the trial judge
had jurisdiction to make the order
that the Court of Appeal held he should have made.

[…]

[page 450]

In this country, Parliament's conception of
fairness has always been ... that when a conviction is quashed (Cr. Code, sec.
592(2)) a new trial can be ordered instead of an acquittal and such is always
the order made except in special circumstances.

In reaching his conclusion Pigeon J. cited from
the British decision of Connelly v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1964] A.C. 1254, and particularly from the judgments of Lord Morris
at p. 1301 and Lord Hodson at p. 1336 wherein repeated reference was made to an
inherent power of a court to control its own processes, but that such power
should not be used simply on the basis that a court would have preferred that
the charge in question not have been brought. The minority in Osborn simply found that the facts did
not give rise to oppression and consequently it was unnecessary to determine
the extent to which the doctrine of the abuse of process might be employed in
our criminal courts. The Chief Justice simply agreed that the appeal should be
allowed and gave no reason.

Before proceeding to an examination of the
decision of this Court in Rourke, supra, one
should examine briefly the judgments in Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra. Lord Reid, at p. 1296,
after disposing of the narrow question then before the Court, stated:

But I think there must always be a residual
discretion to prevent anything which savours of abuse of process.

Lord Morris, at p. 1304, narrowed the discretion
somewhat by stating:

It would, in my
judgment, be an unfortunate innovation if it were held
that the power of a court to prevent any abuse
of its process or to ensure compliance with correct procedure enabled a
judge to suppress a prosecution merely because he regretted that it was taking
place.

Lord Devlin, on the other hand, at p. 1347, took
a much broader view of the authority of the Court to protect its own processes:

Under the first head I must observe that
nearly the whole of the English criminal law of procedure and evidence has been
made by exercise of the judges of

[page 451]

their power to see that what was fair and
just was done between prosecutors and accused. The doctrine of autrefois was
itself doubtless evolved in that way.

Lord Pearce adopted
the broad view of Lord Devlin when he stated at p. 1365:

The court has, I think, a power to apply, in
the exercise of its judicial discretion, the broader principles to cases that
do not fit the actual pleas [pleas of autrefois convict and autrefois
acquit] and a duty to stop a prosecution which on the facts offends against
those principles and creates abuse and injustice.

Viewed in the light
of the Connelly case, reference to which was repeatedly made in Osborn,
it is difficult to see Osborn as establishing anything more than
that the doctrine of abuse of prosecution will not avail an accused in a case
of multiple charges brought on the same set of facts if nothing more is
involved. The House of Lords continued the examination of the breadth of
application, not the existence, of the doctrine of the abuse of process in Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Humphrys, [1976] 2 Ml E.R. 497. Lord Hailsham, at
p. 517, acknowledged the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to protect its own
processes against abuse. Lord Salmon also found a general discretion in the
Court to stay proceedings which were vexatious or oppressive (p. 528); and Lord
Edmund-Davies took the same general position (pp. 533-35):

Notwithstanding certain of my observations in
delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Connelly, I am
now satisfied that, in the words of Lord Parker CJ in Mills v Cooper [[19671]
2 All ER at 104, [1967] 2 QB at 467], 'every court has undoubtedly a right in
its discretion to decline to hear proceedings on the ground that they are
oppressive and an abuse of the process of the court' ... .

While judges should pause long before staying
proceedings which on their face are prefectly regular, it would indeed be bad
for justice if in such fortunately rare
cases as R v Riebold, [1967] 1 All ER 653,
[1967] 1 WLR 674] their hands were tied and they were
obliged to allow the further trial to proceed. In my judgment, Connelly established that they are vested with

[page 452]

the power to do what the justice of the case
clearly demands.

Again in Humphrys
as in Connelly the
object of the Law Lords was not to establish a recognition of the doctrine of
abuse of process but to define the reach and application of that doctrine.

I turn now to the decision of this Court in Rourke v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 1021. The Court was there
faced with a proceeding which at trial had been stayed by reason of the delay
in the Crown said to be harmful to the defence of the accused in bringing a
charge of kidnapping and robbery, some twenty months in all. Pigeon J., writing
for the majority in a five-to-four division, stated at p. 1043:

I cannot find any rule in our criminal law
that prosecutions must be instituted promptly and ought not to be permitted to
be proceeded with if a delay in instituting them may have caused prejudice to
the accused. In fact, no authority was cited to establish the existence of such
a principle which is at variance with the rule that criminal offences generally
are not subject to prescription except in
the case of specific offences for which a prescription time has been
established by statute. I have to disagree with the view expressed by McIntyre
J.A. that there could be factual situations giving
to a trial judge discretion to stay proceedings for delay.

His Lordship goes on to say at p. 1043:

For the reasons
I gave in The
Queen v. Osborn, I cannot
admit of any general discretionary power in courts of criminal jurisdiction to
stay proceedings regularly instituted because the prosecution is considered
oppressive.

As we have seen, the decision in Osborn was narrowed down to the facts
then before the Court, namely the bringing of successive charges arising out of
the same set of facts and the contrast between the criminal law procedure of
Canada and the United Kingdom. Again in Rourke
the issue is narrowly confined to the effects of a delay in bringing
on to trial a person arrested twenty months previously at which time many if
not all of the facts alleged by the prosecution were known. I cannot depart
from an examination of Rourke without
noting that the majority made reference to

[page 453]

s. 7(3)  of the Criminal Code  as being a provision for the retention
of common law defences but not necessarily with reference to discretionary stay
of proceedings which may or may not be rooted in the common law. Pigeon J.
commented at p. 1045:

In my view, the absence of any provision in
the Criminal Code  contemplating the staying of an indictment by a trial judge or an appeal from such decision, is a strong indication against the existence of any
power to grant such stay.

Chief Justice
Laskin wrote for the minority in Rourke concurring
in the conclusion of Pigeon J. that there was no basis for the exercise of the
discretion to stay proceedings where the sole basis for the alleged abuse was a
delay in prosecution. He did however take the view, at p. 1034, that the jurisdiction
to stay proceedings for abuse is a useful one:

I have paraded this long list of cases to
show how varied are the fact situations in
which judges of different levels and of different Provinces have used
abuse of process as a way of controlling prosecution behaviour which operates
prejudicially to accused persons. I pass no judgment on the correctness of any
of the decisions, but they do indicate by their very diversity the utility of a
general principle of abuse of process which judges should be able to invoke in appropriate circumstances to mark
their control of the process of their Courts and to require fair behaviour of
the Crown towards accused persons. It will not escape notice that the decisions
I have cited are almost all quite recent, and a perusal of them would reveal how much they have been
influenced by Connelly
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, supra, and
particularly by the reasons of Lord Devlin in that case.

I come therefore to
the conclusion that the decisions of Osborn and Rourke must be
taken as standing on their own facts and limited precisely to the ratio of the
judgments disposing of the issues arising on those facts. It follows therefore
that the observations of Jessup J.A. in Osborn with reference to the origins and breadth of the
trial court discretion to protect the processes of the courts from abuse remain
substantially unimpaired by succeeding decisions in this Court. Viewed from

[page 454]

another perspective
the majority in Rourke affirms an exceptional jurisdiction to
stay proceedings whereas Laskin C.J.C. for the minority takes the view of Lord
Devlin in Connelly and finds the doctrine of abuse of
process a wide-ranging technique for the control by the criminal court of
criminal procedure in the protection of the processes of that court; a
technique illustrated but not limited by the special pleas of autrefois acquit and convict, res judicata and issue estoppel (p. 287). In my respectful view,
much of what was said by both divisions of this Court in Rourke is obiter dicta, bearing in mind the precise issue of
abuse of process in the form of delay by the prosecution which was then the
only issue before the Court. There is a distinction to be drawn where the
initiating process is valid and the only issue is delay prejudicial to the
accused as in Rourke; and the case where the executive action
leading to the charge and its prosecution is offensive to the principles on
which the administration of justice is conducted by the courts. It is for this
further reason that the judgment in Rourke in my view is not here applicable.

From the earliest
times courts have withheld from the law enforcement arm of the community
recourse to the authority of the criminal court where the conduct of the
prosecution has offended the sense of justice of the court. As long ago as R. v. Robins (1844), 1 Cox C.C. 114, upon the prosecutor's
inability to ""explain satisfactorily the cause of the delay"" (nearly
two years), Baron Alderson said:

I ought not to allow this case to go further.
It is monstrous to put a man on his trial
after such a lapse of time. How can
he account for his conduct so far back? ... No man's life would be safe
if such a prosecution were permitted. It would be very unjust to put
him on his trial.

The Report
concludes: ""His Lordship then directed the jury to acquit the
prisoner."" See as well Lord Mansfield C.J. in R. v. Robinson (1765), I

[page 455]

Black. W. 541, 96 E.R. 313; and R. v. Marshall and Grantham (1811), 13
East 322, 104 E.R. 394.

It is of interest and of some relevance to observe
that since the decisions of this Court in Osborn
and Rourke courts in
this country have tended to take a narrow view of the impact of these decisions
on the doctrine of abuse of process; vide Munroe
J. in R. v. K (1971), 5 C.C.C.
(2d) 46, at p. 48; Vanek P.C.J. in R. v.
Weightman and Cunningham (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 303; and Lewis
P.C.J. in R. v. Billen (1980),
54 C.C.C. (2d) 425; and to restrict effectively the impact of Rourke, for example, to the
circumstances of prosecutorial delay only. See also Re Abitibi Paper Company Limited and The Queen (1979), 24 O.R.
(2d) 742 (Ont. C.A.); Re Orysiuk and The
Queen (1977), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 445 (Alta.); Re Asselin and The Queen (1979), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 332 (Quebec
C.A.); and Re Young et al. and The Queen (1981),
60 C.C.C. (2d) 252 (Sask. Q.B.); John A. Olah, The Doctrine of Abuse of Process: Alive and Well in Canada (1978),
1 C.R. (3d) 341. There are, however, some instances of a broader interpretation
of the majority view in Rourke as
will be found in R. v. Lebrun (1978),
7 C.R. (3d) 93 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Catagas (1977),
38 C.C.C. (2d) 296 (Man. C.A.); and R. v.
Maxner (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 446 (N.S.C.A.).

There may be said to be a tacit acknowledgment
of the restricted ratio of Rourke in
the unanimous judgment of this Court in R.
v. Krannenburg, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1053, per Dickson J. at p. 1061:

The question of
whether a new information may be laid after
jurisdiction has been lost is not before us, and I refrain from any extended discussion on the point, in the absence
of argument and on the narrow facts of this case.
It is manifest, however, that there will be occasions on which the laying of a new
information will not be available. Time
limitations may preclude it. Indeed, the laying of another information
may amount to nothing less than an abuse of process.

[page 456]

and in the
observation of Laskin C.J. in Kirzner, supra, at
p. 501.

Lord Scarman, in R. v. Sang, [1979] 2 All E.R. 1222, (about which more will be
said later), adverted to the abuse of process doctrine at p. 1245 when he said:

Save in the
very rare situation, which is not this case, of an abuse of the process of the court (against
which every court is in duty bound to protect itself), the judge is
concerned only with the conduct of the trial.

The House of Lords,
it should be noted however, in Sang did not
bring the defence of entrapment within the principles of abuse of process. In
the Court of Appeal judgment in Sang, however, ([1979] 2 All E.R. 46) in the opinion of the Court written by
Roskill L.J., the question was left open at p. 50:

It has not been argued before us in the
present appeals that if the present
prosecution were allowed to proceed, it
would amount to an abuse of the process of the court.

In an earlier
decision of the House of Lords, Selvey v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1968] 2 All E.R. 497, Lord Guest, in referring
to the overriding duty of the judge to ensure that a trial is fair, stated at
p. 520 that such discretion

... springs from the inherent power of the
judge to control the trial before him and to see that justice is done in fairness to the accused.

As we have already
seen, the United States Supreme Court minority view in Sorrells, supra, invokes this same inherent power in the
court for the recognition of the defence of entrapment.

There are of course
but three available dispositions on a successful application of the defence of
entrapment:

(a) a dismissal of the accused on the charge;

(b) an order quashing the charge;

(c) a stay of prosecution.

Alternative (a) is
inappropriate in that both essential elements of the charge, the wrongful act
and the criminal intent, are present in the proof before the court. As to (b)
there is no authority in the Criminal Code  for
a court in this circumstance

[page 457]

to quash a charge that is complete in form and
properly issued under the Code. The last alternative (c)
has a technical infirmity in that the charge remains extant and in the records
of the court. The case before the Court in this appeal was founded on an
information about which there is no suggestion of irregularity. However, the
defect in course (c) is wholly technical. While the charge may be said to hang
over the head of the accused, this is a wholly theoretical observation because
there is no forum for its further processing. The courts in both the United
States and the United Kingdom have in such circumstances, as shown in the
authorities already reviewed, followed all three routes without apparent
concern for technical considerations. I would prefer alternative (c) and would
apply a stay of prosecution where the defence of entrapment is operative.

There are offences which by their very nature
would appear (as indicated earlier in these reasons) to render this defence
inapplicable, as for example crimes of violence. One of the questions to be
answered here therefore must be, what are the offences to which this defence
will relate? Generally speaking, it is the consensual offence where the issue
most naturally arises. When the offence relates to physical acts the crime leaves
its own marks. Methods of detection reflect this fact. The victims complain.
The external evidence is there for the police to follow. In other areas of
crime such as drug offences, commercial or municipal fraud, prostitution and
gambling, these conditions do not prevail. The 'victims' rarely seek the aid of
the authorities, and indeed generally there are no direct 'victims'. There are
no external signs of the offence. Policing must react differently to this kind
of crime. Hence the use of agents provocateurs, spies,
informers, undercover agents in or retained by the police force, decoys and
other such police initiatives. The move from passive to active policing brings
the courts into the process. When policing in this field verges into
police-instigated crimes or into police stimulation of crime for the sake of
obtaining convictions, what is the position of the courts? Up to this
development in criminal justice the positions of the court and the executive
were clear. The latter investigate apparent offences, gather evidence, make
arrests,

[page 458]

lay charges,
introduce evidence in court and present the law enforcement agency's views on
the applicable law. The courts on the other hand receive the charge, take
custody of the accused in a figurative and sometimes actual sense, hear the
evidence, interpret and apply the law, determine guilt or innocence, award the
appropriate punishment and return the accused to executive custody; or
discharge the accused. In the process the court must concern itself with the conduct
of the case by the prosecution and the accused and must vigorously apply the
fundamental doctrine of the presumption of innocence. Courts have for centuries
been evolving doctrines appropriate to this process, with and without
legislative aid, in the form of rules relating to the admissibility of evidence
and such substantive rules as the doctrine of res judicata. The consensual crimes, their detection and
demonstration in court, raise new issues or aggravate the problems surrounding
older issues. The appointed spy may, pursuant to arrangements, infiltrate and
report upon participants in a crime to which the agent may be a party or which
the agent has provided to others the opportunity to commit. In some
circumstances, indeed, the offence would in all likelihood not have otherwise
been committed. The law enforcement agency in these circumstances moves from
the position of merely affording an opportunity for the commission of crime to
persons who may be so disposed to a position where the agency itself encourages
the commission of the crime. Expressed another way, the police may have by any
such measures instigated the offence, or at least its planning, and did so
simply to catch the otherwise innocent members of the public in order to
prosecute them. The ensnared or entrapped must in such a situation have a
defence in law for the police and the state have gone beyond mere crime
detection by decoy work or solicitation of evidence. In fact the crime has been
designed and committed by the state itself.

[page 459]

Whatever may be the range of such a defence, it
must be clear that the defence arising in this circumstance does not operate in
the case of all offences. In the Model
Penal Code of 1962, supra, the
defence is ""unavailable when causing or threatening bodily injury is an
element of the offence charged ... "" (s. 2.13(3)), presumably on the basis
that the social interest in controlling the accused's behaviour outweighs that
of controlling police behaviour. There may be other categories of offences to
which the defence will not run but this again will develop as the judicial
system of criminal justice may require.

This is not a process unknown to the common law.
The defence of 'duress' arose in the common law long before the Report of the
Imperial Commissioners on the Draft Code 1879, s. 12 stated: ""We have
framed s. 23 of our Draft Code, to express what we think is the existing law
...."" The Commissioners are there referring to the defence of duress, a
defence originating in the common law long before the studies for the
codification of criminal law commenced in England and were completed in Canada.
The parallel is particularly apt as the defence of duress relates to the
completed commission of an offence in the same way as entrapment. The common
law rules and principles of duress as a defence, at least as regards a
principal offender, have now been ""codified and exhaustively defined in s.
17 ... "" of the Code (R. v. Carker, [1967]
S.C.R. 114, per Ritchie J. at
p. 117). The Report by the Commissioners, supra,
had this to say on the scope of that defence in common law:

There can be no doubt that a man is entitled
to preserve his own life and limb; and on
this ground he may justify much which
otherwise would be punishable. The cases of a person setting up as a defence that he was compelled to commit a
crime is of every day occurrence. There
is no doubt on the authorities that compulsion is a defence where the crime is not of a heinous
character.

[page 460]

Section 17 of the Canadian Criminal Code continued this general limitation by
providing that the defence "". . . does not apply where the offence that is
committed is high treason or treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder,
assisting in rape, forcible abduction, robbery, causing bodily harm or arson"".

The evolution of
defences at common law, both evidentiary and substantive, have seen expansion
and adjustment as required to meet altering conditions in the community, and
entrapment as a defence has experienced this same history where it has been
recognized. See for example the discussion in N.L.A. Barlow, Entrapment and the Common Law. Is there
a Place for the American Doctrine of Entrapment, supra.

In the Court of
Appeal Seaton J.A. (with whom Carrothers J.A. concurred) expressed a preference
for the ""English approach"" which he described as making allowance at
the sentencing stage by giving ""attention to what motivated him and to any
influence that others had upon him; others would include the police"". It
is certainly true that the courts of England have rejected the defence of
entrapment (vide Sang,
supra, at p. 1224)
where not only was the defence of entrapment rejected but also the indirect
power in a court to exclude evidence of the commission of the offence as a
means of controlling the activities of the prosecution. In the course of giving
judgment Lord Diplock (at p. 1227) and Lord Salmon (at p. 1236) both adverted
to the possibility of imposing a milder sentence in the event the accused was
found on the evidence to have been entrapped. However, it should be noted that
both Law Lords also suggested prosecution of the police as a means of control
of such improper activities. The House of Lords started with the simple
assertion that entrapment is not a defence in English law and then approached
the question on the basis that a power in a court to exclude the evidence
relating to the commission of the offence on whatever basis would simply be a
recognition of entrapment indirectly when the same was impermissible directly.

[page 461]

The fundamental
cleavage in principle between the House and the approach of the United States
Supreme Court is seen in Lord Diplock's observation at p. 1230:

It is no part of
a judge's function to exercise disciplinary powers over the police or prosecution as respects
the way in which evidence to be used at the trial is obtained by them.

In my respectful
view the issue is not the discipline of the prosecution but the avoidance of
the improper invocation by the state of the judicial process and its powers in
circumstances where the accused has been ensnared by the police force in order
to bring about an offence for which he will be prosecuted. The view of Lord
Diplock is expressed somewhat differently but with the same result by Lord
Salmon at pp. 1235-36:

A man who intends to commit a crime and
actually commits it is guilty of the offence
whether or not he has been persuaded or induced to commit it, no matter
by whom. This being the law, it is inconceivable that, in such circumstances, the judge could have a
discretion to prevent the Crown from adducing evidence of the accused's
guilt, for this would amount to giving the judge the power of changing or
disregarding the law.

These conclusions
necessarily result from the rejection of the defence of entrapment which as a
necessary consequence has the effect of fatally reducing the Court's discretion
under existing law which Lord Scarman described at p. 1243 as follows:

it is now the law that 'a judge has a
discretion to exclude legally admissible
evidence if justice so requires' (per Lord Reid in Myers v Director of Public Prosecutions, [[1964] 2 All E.R. 881 at 887, [1965] A.C. 1001 at 1024.]

Viscount Dilhorne
was discussing the same principle in Selvey, supra, at p. 510 when he said:

It [the exclusion of evidence by restriction
of the right to cross-examine] must depend
on the circumstances of each case and the overriding duty of the judge
to ensure that a trial is fair.

The result of this
approach is that if the proceeding is fundamentally unfair and results in a
conviction and punishment, the judicial branch is powerless, but if the result
is only unfair in an

[page 462]

evidentiary sense in
the course of the trial, but not necessarily resulting in an unfair outcome,
the court, in its duty to ensure a fair trial, may exclude the objectionable evidence.
This is the result not entirely of the adoption of the view that mitigation of
sentence is the appropriate remedy alone but that legislation is necessary to
recognize entrapment, that guilt is guilt however it may be proven or even
brought about, that prosecution of the informer or of the police themselves is
an adequate control mechanism. Some or all of these in combination may underlie
the House of Lords' decision but it would appear to amount to an.
oversimplification of the ""English approach"" to ascribe the result,
at least in Sang, supra,
as the adoption of
singular recourse to mitigation of sentence.

The judgments in Sang may be said to be less than usually persuasive
because they suffer, in my respectful view, from being a discussion of an assumed
demonstration by the accused that but for police intervention he ""would
not have committed the offence"" without any more factual base than that as
to the presence or absence of inveigling and persistent importuning, and from a
precluded view on entrapment as a defence known to the law.

There is in our
country a serious limitation to reliance upon mitigation of sentence as a
judicial response to the problem of entrapment. The Criminal Code  and the Narcotics Control Act, and perhaps
other statutes, sometimes impose serious minimum sentences. The latter statute
in s. 5(2)  for example, being the offence of importation of narcotics,
stipulates a minimum sentence of seven years. It can hardly be thought that
Parliament, in establishing such a minimum imprisonment, had in mind an accused
who could demonstrate that the crime was instigated by the state itself.

As I have already
intimated, the repugnance which must be experienced by a court on being
implicated in a process so outrageous and shameful on the part of the state
cannot be dissipated by

[page 463]

the registration of
a conviction and the imposition thereafter of even a minimum sentence. To
participate in such injustice up to and including a finding of guilt and then
to attempt to undo the harm by the imposition of a lighter sentence, so far
from restoring confidence in the fair administration of justice, would
contribute to the opposite result. For the courts to acknowledge at the
sentencing stage of the trial a sense of outrage at the position in which the
accused and the court have been placed at the instigation of the police, is a
wholly unsatisfactory response to the realization that a flagrant abuse of the
process of the court has occurred. The harm to both the accused and to the
administration of justice is complete with the substantive determination of
guilt.

The stay of
proceedings in the presence of entrapment finds its way into the law or fails
to do so as a matter of judicial view of the proper policy of the law in these
circumstances. Which policy will produce a principle of law which will better
serve the community in this area of the criminal law has been the subject of
thought and debate for a lengthy period. The considerations at play are well
known and have been thoroughly analysed and debated in the courts and by
judicial writers.

In the foregoing
pages I have reviewed and discussed the experience of the courts of this
country, of England and of the United States in their approach to the question
of entrapment. I have, as well, endeavoured to isolate and state the principles
which have emerged in the cases regarding the formulation of the defence and
the application of it. It is clear that the need for some element of judicial
control has been recognized in the common law and that the roots of the
doctrine of entrapment are to be found in the common law. I am of the view that
it is open to this Court and consistent with authority to recognize a defence
of entrapment and to give effect to it in proper cases.

The conduct of the
investigatory authority here in my view clearly gives rise to entrapment. In a
period of two and one-half months the accused received fifteen to twenty
telephone calls, together with visits to the accused by the police or their
agent at work or at home. These importunings

[page 464]

were accompanied by
successful efforts by the agent to gain the confidence and friendship of the
accused. All this occurred after he had told the police informer that the
accused could not be counted upon to provide the cocaine. In the second period
of contact requests for drugs were made on a daily basis and accompanied by
frequent visits by the undercover policeman at the accused's place of
employment. In this second period there were also numerous urgent telephone
calls requesting drugs, sometimes accompanied by implied threats of physical
violence. That there was persistent inveigling and importuning is clear. It is
also clear that the purpose of the program initiated by the police was to
obtain evidence for the prosecution of the accused. It is the plain fact that
the drug trafficking which occurred was promoted by the police at a time when
the police had no reason to suspect, let alone believe, that the accused was in
any way related to such activity. The cumulative effect of such a deliberately
launched enterprise by the police would in my view 'in all the circumstances'
be viewed in the community as shocking and outrageous, and such conduct is
clearly contrary to the proper principles upon which justice must be done by
the courts.

For all the reasons
advanced and discussed above, I would recognize the defence of entrapment and
would apply that defence to the facts and circumstances of this case; and
therefore would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and direct a stay of
prosecution.

The judgment of
Martland, Dickson, Beetz and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON
J.—I am of the opinion that on the facts of
this case the defence of entrapment, assuming it to be available under Canadian
law, does not arise.

The trial judge
stated:

In order to determine the sufficiency of
evidence to raise a defence of entrapment there must be evidence to show that the Police had instigated the
crime and that had they not done so,
the accused would not have been

[page 465]

involved in the transaction. The instigation
must of course go beyond mere solicitation or decoy work.

He continued:

In present case, the Crown was unable to
produce the witness who originally arranged
for the undercover officer to meet the accused, Amato. His evidence
would have been extremely useful to assist me in making my determinations of
fact. He could have corroborated the evidence
of the Crown or he could have corroborated the evidence of the Defence. I
believe he should have been called by the Crown. His absence has restricted the
Defence from making a full answer in defence to the charge.

The trial judge
concluded that in fairness to the accused he must presume that the witness in
question would have given evidence consistent with that given by the defence
and for that reason the findings of fact ought to be made on the basis of the
evidence tendered by the defence. It seems to me a doubtful proposition that
the defence evidence must be accepted as true because the Crown failed to call
a witness whom the trial judge considered should have been called.
Notwithstanding the adoption of such an unusual course, the trial judge
concluded:

I am satisfied that the evidence in this case
falls far short of the evidence required at law to establish the defence of
entrapment. The evidence amounts no more than to persistent solicitation by the
informer and the undercover Officer to persuade the accused Amato to engage in
trafficking in cocaine.

When the matter
reached the Court of Appeal, Taggart J.A. referred to the passage from the
judgment at trial which I have just quoted and said:

I am not persuaded that the evidence to which
we have been referred by counsel for the Appellant does other than support the
conclusion reached by the trial judge.

Seaton J.A., in the
course of his judgment said:

In the case at bar the police are not blamed,
it is the informer who it is said importuned the Appellant. The police,
according to counsel for the Appellant, did not have any reason to go after the
Appellant and were not after him. It seems to me to follow that they did not
entrap him. What the Appellant is saying is ""I did

[page 466]

commit the offence, I was importuned by
another, and fortunately for me that other had some relationship with the
police and as a result I should be found not guilty."" I do not accept
that. I think that entrapment as such is not a general defect.

Carrothers, J.A. agreed with each Mr. Justice
Taggart and Mr. Justice Seaton.

The four British Columbia judges before whom the
matter has come have been unanimous in concluding that, on the facts, the
defence of entrapment does not arise. It does not seem to me to fall to this
Court to retry the case and arrive at different findings.

I would therefore dismiss this appeal.

The following are the reasons delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an
appeal brought with leave of this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of British Columbia affirming the conviction of the appellant at his trial
before Judge McGivern on two charges of trafficking in cocaine. The first
charge was laid against Amato alone, but the second charge for the same offence
which was allegedly committed ten days later was also laid against one June
Lee.

The transactions which are the subject of these
two counts formed a part of a sequence of events which was put in motion by one
Don Langvin, a police informer, who had a drug related criminal record and who
was employed by the police in this instance in furtherance of a scheme to
locate sources from which drug traffickers were able to obtain their supply.
The device adopted to this end was to instruct Langvin, who was then acting
under an R.C.M.P. undercover officer named Godwin, to ferret out the required
information. Langvin proceeded to obtain an introduction to the appellant
through one Andre who employed Amato as a hairdresser. Langvin thereafter posed
as one in need of drugs and requested the appellant to obtain some for him.
Amato at first refused to have anything to do with the proposition saying in
effect that he was just a simple hairdresser and

[page 467]

knew nothing about drugs in any way; however,
after a series of telephone calls and visits to his place of work, Amato was
persuaded by Langvin to obtain a gram of cocaine which he did by contacting his
former mistress, June Lee, who appears to have had the necessary contact with
drug sources and who was thus able to produce the small amount of cocaine. This
first transaction forms no part of the charges against Amato but it turned out
to be only the beginning of repeated pestering by Langvin seeking further drugs
from Amato. Thenceforth Amato was constantly bothered by telephone calls at his
home and visits at his place of business by Langvin all of which were directed
to soliciting further drugs from Amato. Amato finally succumbed to the pressure
being exerted on him and arranged for another delivery. It was at this point
that the undercover policeman, Godwin, entered the picture; he was introduced
to Amato and after more pressure had been exerted over the appellant, a meeting
was arranged for delivery of a further supply of cocaine. This transaction was
the subject of the first charge against the appellant but the undercover
policeman there-after played a more prominent part and, posing as one who had
friends coming to town the next day who were important in the drug trade in the
U.S.A. and were in need of an immediate delivery of drugs which they were
prepared to obtain by violence, that he finally induced the appellant to obtain
a further supply of cocaine and in this case the transaction was completed by
payment by Godwin to Amato and thence to Miss Lee.

It should be stressed that the record does not
disclose any wrongdoing by the appellant either through dealings in drugs or
otherwise until he was approached by Langvin and that his association with this
character was purely as a friend of his employer (Andre). All the drug dealings
involving the appellant were prompted and solicited by Langvin and later by
Godwin and, as I have indicated, it is plain to me from the record that the
course of events was instigated and carried forward at the direction of the
police for the purpose of locating drug sources and that the involvement of the
appellant was simply an incidental factor necessarily employed by the police in
order to

[page 468]

achieve
their objective. At the trial before McGivern J., Langvin was not called as a
witness by either the Crown or the defence and as to this circumstance the
learned trial judge observed:

In the present case, the Crown was unable to
produce the witness who originally arranged for the undercover officer to meet
the accused, Amato. His evidence would have been extremely useful to assist me
in making my determinations of fact. He could have corroborated the evidence of
the Crown or he could have corroborated the evidence of the Defence. I believe
he should have been called by the Crown. His absence has restricted the Defence
from making a full answer in defence to the charge.

I am satisfied that in fairness to the
accused I must presume that he would have given evidence consistent with that
given by the Defence. For that reason, I am prepared for the sake of these
reasons for judgment, to assume that the findings of fact ought to be made on
the basis of the evidence tendered by the Defence. The accused, Amato,
testified that he was induced and persuaded by his former boss and the Police
informer to obtain some cocaine. After several months of requests, and in an
attempt to befriend the Police informer, Amato arranged for some cocaine
through the accused, Lee. He also said that he had to persuade her to go along
with the deal. The second transaction took place involving a half ounce of
cocaine. At this time the accused, Amato,
believed he was assisting his friend who was a Police informer. He only
wanted to help a friend, the deal was arranged. The undercover Policeman
arrived on the scene and after some time Amato was persuaded to go along with
the sale to the undercover Policeman rather than to his friend, the informer.

Against
the above background I am prepared to adopt the analysis of the facts contained in the judgment of Mr. Justice
Taggart in the Court of Appeal:

Very briefly, the facts are that the
Appellant was asked by his then employer if
he could find some cocaine for a friend of his, that is to say of the
employer's. The Appellant then and throughout the time that he had to do with
the undercover police officer and the informer expressed no interest in
accommodating them and it was only by virtue of the persuasion of his employer
in the first instance and of the informer and the undercover police officer
thereafter that the Appellant eventually agreed to provide a source of cocaine.

There were three transactions, the first of
which did not result in a charge being preferred against the Appellant.

[page 469]

That first offence was of a relatively small
amount of cocaine which after a great deal of solicitation on the part of the
informer the Appellant agreed to procure. He procured it through the medium of
June Lee who herself obtained it from other persons. The first transaction was
accomplished by the Appellant going to the house of Lee and there obtaining and
paying for the cocaine with money which had been provided to him by the
informer. He then took the cocaine to the informer and delivered it over to him. The informer in turn turned it over
to his contact in the police force.

On the second occasion which gave rise to the
first of the two charges against the Appellant, a substantially larger amount
of cocaine was involved and the undercover police officer appeared on the scene
with the informer. Substantially the same procedure was adopted on this
occasion as the first occasion.

The third transaction did not involve the
informer at all, but only the undercover police officer. On this occasion a yet
more substantial amount of cocaine was involved and on this occasion the
undercover police officer accompanied the Appellant to the house of Lee where
the money was handed over and the cocaine provided directly to the undercover
police officer. On each of these occasions
there was a considerable amount of importuning on the part of either the
informer or the undercover police officer or both.

It
was submitted on behalf of the appellant, both at trial and on appeal, that the
above circumstances were such as to justify him in invoking the defence of
entrapment if indeed such a defence is recognized in Canadian law. Both courts
below, however, held that the circumstances which I have outlined did not
constitute entrapment and that in any event entrapment does not constitute a
defence to a criminal charge in Canada. It is these two findings which form the
basis of the grounds of appeal to this Court which are described as follows in
the factum filed on behalf of the appellant:

(i) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in
ruling that the conduct used by the police in this case directed at instigating
and procuring the commission of a criminal offence by the accused did not in
law constitute an entrapment or an abuse of process?

(ii) Whether the Court of Appeal erred in
ruling that entrapment does not constitute a defence to a criminal charge?

[page 470]

(iii) Whether the failure of the Crown to
call the undercover police agent, Donald
Langvin, or procure his attendance at the trial restricted the accused
from making a full answer and defence to the charges and thereby constituted an
abuse of process for which the proceedings ought to have been stayed?

As will hereafter appear the defence of
entrapment has been recognized in a number of cases in the Supreme Court of the
United States, but it is categorically denied by the courts in the United
Kingdom as going to the guilt or innocence of the accused, although some
consideration may be given to it in regard to sentence. This is made plain in
the following passage from a judgment of Lord Chief Justice Widgery in R. v. Mealey and Sheridan (1974), 60 Crim. App. R. 59, at
p. 62, where he says that it is

... quite clearly established that the
so-called defence of entrapment, which finds some place in the law of the
United States of America, finds no place in our law here. It is abundantly
clear on the authorities, which are uncontradicted on this point, that if a
crime is brought about by the activities of someone who can be described as an
agent provocateur, although that may be an important matter in regard to sentence,
it does not affect the question of guilty or not guilty.

In the same case Lord Widgery observed that a
policeman

... must endeavour to tread the somewhat
difficult line between showing the necessary enthusiasm to keep his cover and
actually becoming an agent provocateur, meaning thereby someone who actually
causes offences to be committed which otherwise would not be committed at all.

The approach in the United States stems from a
judgment of the Supreme Court in Sorrells
v. United States (1932), 287 U.S. 435, where an undercover police
agent posing as a tourist induced a local resident to obtain liquor for him,
and Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for the majority, after discussing
entrapment as a defence, went on to say at p. 442:

A different question is presented when the
criminal design originates with the officials of the Government, and they
implant in the mind of an innocent person the disposition to commit the alleged
offense and induce its commission in order that they may prosecute.

[page 471]

These observations were expressly affirmed in
the Supreme Court in Sherman v. United
States (1958), 356 U.S. 369 and in United States v. Russell (1973), 411 U.S. 423, in the latter
of which cases Mr. Justice Rehnquist expanded on the reasoning for recognizing
the limitations of the defence of entrapment when he said, at p. 434:

Nor does it seem particularly desirable for
the law to grant complete immunity from prosecution to one who himself planned to commit a crime, and then
committed it, simply because government undercover agents subjected him
to inducements which might have seduced a hypothetical individual who was not
so predisposed.

The latter quotation indicates the different
approaches adopted in the United States to the validity of the defence of entrapment
where opportunity to commit a crime has been presented to an accused by the
police.

If it be shown that an accused's character or
record was such that he might have been predisposed to committing such a crime
as is alleged and that he merely took advantage of the opportunity created by
the undercover organization of the police to commit the crime, he is obviously
under these circumstances not entitled to rely on the defence of entrapment in
the same way as one whose record and character are free of blemish and who can
show that his involvement with the crime was devised through the ""creative
activity"" of an agent provocateur.

Although there is no authoritative judgment in
Canada wherein it has been found that the facts support a defence of entrapment,
there are nonetheless a number of cases in which the elements of such a defence
are discussed. These cases are extensively reviewed by Laskin, C.J. in Kirzner v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 487, where it will
be seen that the weight of authority is to the effect that in a case where the
evidence discloses that the crime in question would not have been committed
save for the ""calculated inveigling or persistent importuning"" of the
police it may then be apparent that it was the creative activity of the police
rather than the intention of the accused which gave rise

[page 472]

to the crime being
committed. In such event the essential element of mens rea would be absent and the accused's defence would be
established.

The Canadian
approach to the defence is best illustrated in the case of Kirzner, supra, where the Chief Justice made the
following statement at p. 494:

The problem which has caused judicial concern
is the one which arises from the police-instigated crime, where the police have gone beyond mere solicitation
or mere decoy work and have actively
organized a scheme of ensnarement, of
entrapment, in order to prosecute the person
so caught. In my opinion, it is only in this situation that it is proper to speak of entrapment and to consider
what effect this should have on the prosecution of a person who has thus been drawn into the commission of an offence.

It was contended in
the present case that Amato was subjected to a threat of violence against himself
if he failed to cooperate with the police plan for procuring the drug. If this
had in fact been the case I am satisfied that it might well have supported a
defence of entrapment, but a careful study of the evidence fails to disclose to
me that there was any such threat although the police officer who was allegedly
seeking drugs for some ""strong arm"" operators from the United States
did make mention of the fact that they carried firearms and this apparently
made Amato nervous.

Whether the
activities of the police can be said to have amounted to the ""calculated
inveigling or persistent importuning"" by the police mentioned by Mr.
Justice Laskin (as he then was) in R. v. Ormerod, [1969] 2 O.R. 230, at p. 238, must depend on the
facts of each case and in the present case, although drug transactions were
suggested to Amato by an agent
provocateur, this is
not of itself enough to invoke the defence of entrapment or to affect the fact
that Amato must have known that what he was doing was wrong.

In the case of Lemieux v. The Queen, [1967] S.C.R. 492, Lemieux was charged with
breaking and entering a dwelling house where the police had secured the consent
of the owner and had lured the accused into participating in the break-in. Here

[page 473]

there was mens rea but
the accused was ultimately acquitted in this Court on the ground that the owner
having consented there was no actus reus. In the course of his reasons for
judgment which were delivered on behalf of this Court, Mr. Justice Judson said,
at p. 496:

Had Lemieux in fact committed the offence
with which he was charged, the circumstance that he had done the forbidden act
at the solicitation of an agent provocateur
would have been irrelevant
to the question of
his guilt or innocence. The reason that his conviction cannot stand is that the
jury were not properly instructed on a question vital to the issue whether any
offence had been committed.

These remarks have
been widely characterized as obiter dicta but while it is true that they were not
necessary to the determination of that case, I prefer to regard them as support
for the proposition that the mere fact that the crime was committed at the
""solicitation"" of an agent provocateur does not, standing alone, support a
defence of entrapment.

In my view it is
only where police tactics are such as to leave no room for the formation of
independent criminal intent by the accused that the question of entrapment can
enter into the determination of his guilt or innocence.

It was further
contended in the present case that the failure of the Crown to call the agent provocateur, Langvin, as a witness resulted in the accused being unable to
cross-examine him and to thus being denied the right of making full answer and
defence to the charges. The appellant characterized this method of conducting
the case as being an abuse of process which should have resulted in the
proceedings being stayed. In my opinion, the failure to call Langvin, who was
apparently unavailable to both parties, did not amount to an abuse of process;
not only does the evidence not disclose any such abuse, but no such question
arises in the present case because of the finding made at trial that any
disadvantage to which the defence might have been subjected by the absence of
Langvin did not affect the trial judge's being ""prepared for the sake of
these reasons for judgment, to assume that the findings of fact ought to

[page 474]

be made on the basis of the evidence tendered by
the Defence"". This finding in my view mitigates against any conclusion
that Langvin's absence from the stand can be characterized as having resulted
in any disadvantage to the accused which could justify a finding of ""abuse
of process"" with an accompanying stay of proceedings.

For all these reasons I would dismiss this
appeal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
SASKATCHEWAN

Criminal law—Autrefois acquit—Identical
informations—First informations dismissed by provincial court judge—Whether or
not trial judge trying the indictment on the second informations erred in
dismissing the plea of autrefois acquit—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, ss. 2, 234(1), 235(2), 440.1, 535(4), 720, 721(2), 734, 735(1),
736(3), 738(1),(3),(4), 739—The Provincial Court Act, R.S.S. 1978 (Supp.), c.
P-30.1, ss. 3, 4.

A provincial court judge dismissed two
informations under Part XXIV of the Code on an erroneous finding that he
had lost jurisdiction. The Crown without appealing the dismissal commenced
proceedings by indictment in the identical terms of the informations. A plea of
autrefois acquit was refused.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The provincial court judge, in deciding that
he lacked jurisdiction, simply made an error in law in the disposition of the
case which was properly before him and within his jurisdiction. The appellant
was put in jeopardy, and the summary conviction court dismissed the
informations thus giving the appellant a determination of the issue that could
be raised in bar of any later proceedings on the same charge. The judge’s
order, even if made in error, must stand until rescinded, quashed or reversed
on appeal. It was in force and effect when the plea of autrefois acquit was
raised and should have received effect. The Crown could have appealed or have
sought relief by prerogative proceedings, but it could not simply conclude that
the summary conviction court’s order was ex facie a nullity and ignore
it by commencing new proceedings.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
(1980), 4 Sask. R. 357, allowing the Crown’s appeal from a judgment of MacLean
D.C.J. acquitting the accused. Appeal allowed.

David C. Woods and Henry S. Brown, for
the appellant.

Kenneth MacKay, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal raises questions
relating to the plea of autrefois acquit where the Crown has commenced
proceedings by indictment after the dismissal of informations in identical
terms by a provincial court judge under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code .

The appellant was charged with impaired driving,
under s. 234(1)  of the Criminal Code , and with a refusal to comply
with a demand made by a police officer to furnish a sample of his breath, under
s. 235(2) of the Code. The offences were alleged to have occurred
on July 4, 1978 and were the subject of two separate informations sworn on July 31, 1978. The Crown elected to proceed by
way of summary conviction on August 3, 1978 and the proceedings were adjourned
until September 7, 1978. On
that date the appellant appeared and entered pleas of not guilty to each charge
and the proceedings were adjourned until October 27, 1978. On October 26, 1978 an adjournment was made setting
the trial date at December 15, 1978 and a further adjournment was later made to
January 11, 1979. On all of
these occasions the accused was represented by counsel and the adjournments
were made at his request.

[Page 495]

While it is difficult to decipher the
endorsements on the reverse side of the informations, it appears that the
adjournment of October 26, 1978 was made by consent, and that the information
alleging impaired driving was adjourned by consent on December 15, 1978. On January 11, 1979, the
provincial court judge dismissed both informations without hearing evidence on
the basis that he lacked jurisdiction, it not having been shown that the
appellant had consented to the various adjournments which had exceeded eight
days. He was, presumably, considering s. 738(1)  of the Criminal Code , which
provides:

738. (1) The
summary conviction court may, in its discretion, before or during the trial,
adjourn the trial to a time and place to be appointed and stated in the
presence of the parties or their counsels or agents, but no such adjournment
shall be for more than eight clear days unless both parties or their counsel or
agents consent to the proposed adjournment whether or not the defendant is in
custody.

The judge issued certificates of dismissal
covering each information, certifying that the informations had been dismissed
for want of jurisdiction. It is not entirely clear when the certificates were
issued. They are certified as true copies and are dated the 2nd and 3rd of
March, 1981, long after the plea of autrefois acquit was raised. I have
mentioned these certificates to complete the record, but little emphasis was
given to them in argument and they form no significant part of the appellant’s
case. 1 will not deal with them further, other than to say that they form part
of the record and confirm, if confirmation is needed, that the reason given for
the dismissals was a want of jurisdiction.

On January 15, 1979, some four days after the
dismissals, two new informations were sworn in identical terms, relying on the
same circumstances as the earlier ones. The Crown elected to proceed on the new
informations by indictment because the limitation period of six months,
provided for in s. 721(2)  of the Criminal Code , had elapsed.
Separate preliminary hearings were held in respect of each information, but on
committal for trial following the preliminary hearings the two charges were
included in one indictment. On November 15, 1979, prior to trial, the appellant
appeared

[Page 496]

before MacLean D.C.J. and made a plea of autrefois
acquit to each charge in the indictment. The judge rejected the plea and on
December 13, 1979 directed the appellant to enter pleas to the charges in
accordance with the provisions of s. 535(4)  of the Criminal Code . The
indictment was tried before MacLean D.C.J. and judgment given on March 24,
1980. The appellant was acquitted on the refusal count, under s. 235(2) of
the Code, and the Crown entered a stay on the impaired driving count.

The Crown’s appeal against the acquittal on the
refusal to supply a breath sample charge was allowed, a conviction entered, and
the matter referred back to the trial judge for sentence. Beyond saying that
“the learned trial judge found all of the essential facts necessary to found a
conviction”, Culliton C.J.S., who wrote the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court
of Appeal, made no mention of the disposal of the plea of autrefois acquit and
it is not clear whether the matter was canvassed in that Court. The appeal in
this Court turned largely on that argument and the result is that this appeal
has become, in effect, an appeal against the pre-trial decision refusing the
plea of autrefois acquit.

The appellant advanced four grounds of appeal in
this Court. In my view, only the first ground requires any consideration. It
asserts that the trial judge erred in failing to give effect to the plea of autrefois
acquit and, presumably, that the Court of Appeal was in error in not
correcting him. Counsel for the appellant argued that the provincial court
judge who dismissed the two original informations was in error when he held
that he was without jurisdiction. He had jurisdiction to proceed to trial and
his decision to the contrary amounted to an error in law. It led, nonetheless,
to a disposition of the case, a dismissal of each information, and while that
decision might have

[Page 497]

been reviewable on appeal, or subject to attack
by prerogative writ, it constituted a trial on the merits and it would stand
until lawfully set aside.

The Crown argued that the provincial court
judge, acting under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code , had jurisdiction to
dismiss an information only under ss. 734 , 735(1) , 736(3) , 738(3)  and (4) , and
s. 739 . Only under those sections, none of which was invoked here, could
the court grant an order of dismissal under s. 743(1) , that is, one which
would be effective to bar subsequent proceedings. His action then was
ineffective to dismiss the informations and permit the issue of certificates of
dismissal, or to support a plea of autrefois acquit.

MacLean D.C.J. seems to have refused the plea of
autrefois acquit on the basis that the judgment of the provincial court
judge, dismissing the informations, was not an adjudication or judgment
resulting in an acquittal. He seems to have accepted the provincial court
judge’s finding of an absence of jurisdiction when he said:

To paraphrase Latchford, C.J. was the
dismissal by Judge King an adjudication or judgment resulting in an acquittal?
I think not. In my view, Judge King in dismissing the information decided that
he was without jurisdiction to hear the informations due to a procedural error
in granting an adjournment of over eight days without the accused’s consent
appearing on the record. In my opinion, a judge who is without jurisdiction
cannot make an adjudication upon a case. If a judge cannot make an
adjudication, the accused was not in jeopardy and if he was not in jeopardy, he
cannot successfully plead autrefois acquit.

In my view, MacLean D.C.J. failed to address the
real issue. He accepted the provincial court judge’s finding of an absence of
jurisdiction and then seems to have concluded that any order he made was a
nullity. Instead, he should have asked himself whether the provincial court
judge had jurisdiction and, if he had, irrespective of the correctness of any
finding made on that subject by the provincial court judge, whether the order
of

[Page 498]

that court was effective to dismiss the
informations.

The whole question in issue in this appeal was
recently canvassed in this Court in R. v. Riddle, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 380.
Dickson J., speaking for the Court, examined the authorities and concluded that
the provisions of s. 743  of the Criminal Code , providing for the
issue by the summary conviction court of a certificate of dismissal to a person
acquitted of a summary conviction offence, do not deprive that person of the
benefit of the special plea of autrefois acquit. It was open then to the
appellant to raise this plea before the commencement of his trial on the
indictment and it follows that had that plea been successful, the proceedings
on the indictment would have been brought to an end.

While, in Riddle, the accused pleaded the
fact of his acquittal on summary proceedings as a bar to subsequent proceedings
of the same nature, the result would not have differed if the later proceedings
had been, as in the case at bar, by way of indictment. Conviction or acquittal
of an offence on summary proceedings will bar further proceedings on the same
charge by indictment: see Spencer Bower on Res Judicata (1924), at pp.
35-36, where it was said:

49. In
foregoing portions of this Chapter, incidental illustrations have been given of
the conclusiveness of decisions of a court of summary jurisdiction in the
exercise of auxiliary civil or quasi-civil authority conferred by statute or
otherwise, and also of decisions as to wrongful acts of both a civil and a
criminal complexion, such as assault, trespass, and defamation of certain
kinds.

50. It is no
less true that purely criminal decisions have the same effect, and cannot be
called in question in any subsequent proceeding, whether criminal or civil, to
which the King is a party, in respect of the same offence. Thus, the decision
of a criminal court having jurisdiction to deal with indictable offences is
conclusive in any court of the like jurisdiction, and, a fortiori, in
any court of summary jurisdiction; whilst the decision of

[Page 499]

a court of summary jurisdiction is
conclusive, not only in any similar court, but also in any court of superior
criminal jurisdiction, that is, in any court having authority to deal with
indictable offences.

In support of this proposition the author cited R.
v. Elrington (1861), 1 B. & S. 688, 121 E.R. 870, where an
acquittal before Justices of the Peace on a charge of assault was held to bar
subsequent proceedings by indictment for an assault with aggravating
circumstances, but concerning the same event. Other cases which have adopted
this view include R. v. Miles (1890), 24 Q.B. 423, where a conviction
for assault by a court of summary jurisdiction barred an indictment for the
same assault. At page 433, Hawkins J. said:

After a summary conviction or dismissal of
a charge upon which they have lawfully adjudicated, evidence may be discovered
which would probably have induced them to come to an opposite conclusion. Yet,
as in the case of an acquittal or conviction upon an indictment, their
acquittal or conviction upon complaint within their jurisdiction is equally final,
and their decisions upon matters within their jurisdiction cannot, as I have
already shewn, be altered by presenting the same charge in the shape of an
indictment before a jury in an aggravated form.

And see, as well, R. v. Hilton (1895), 59
J.P. 778.

Dickson J. dealt, as well, in Riddle with
the nature of the plea of autrefois acquit and with the term “trial on
the merits” as it applies to the plea and to the application of the bis
vexari principle. I need not repeat in detail what he said, but I can
summarize the effect of his words and the authorities on which they are based
by saying that a plea of autrefois acquit is available and should
succeed where an accused shows that he was placed in jeopardy on the same
matter on an earlier occasion before a court of competent jurisdiction, and
that

[Page 500]

there was a disposition in his favour resulting
in an acquittal or dismissal of the charges. The question for decision in this
case then is whether the proceedings before the provincial court had that
effect. Was the court a court of competent jurisdiction? Was the appellant
placed in jeopardy before that court, and did his trial commence and proceed to
a final disposition of the charges by dismissal or acquittal?

The record does not make apparent how the judge
reached the decision that he had no jurisdiction. He had assumed jurisdiction;
heard the informations read; taken pleas of not guilty; ordered several
adjournments; and fixed a date for trial before he reached his conclusion. It
has not been suggested at any time that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the
matters raised in the informations when they were presented. The provisions of
ss. 720  and 2  of the Criminal Code , together with ss. 3 and 4 of The
Provincial Court Act, R.S.S. 1978 (Supp.), c. P-30.1, clearly cover the
point. Furthermore, any loss of jurisdiction which could have occurred prior to
the enactment of s. 440.1  of the Criminal Code  would now be
prevented. The section is reproduced hereunder:

440.1 (1)
The validity of any proceeding before a court, judge, magistrate or justice is
not affected by any failure to comply with the provisions of this Act relating
to adjournments or remands, and where such failure has occurred and an accused
or a defendant does not appear at any such proceeding or upon any adjournment
thereof, the court, judge, magistrate or justice may issue a summons or, if it
or he considers it necessary in the public interest, a warrant for the arrest
of the accused or defendant.

(2) Where, in the opinion of the court,
judge, magistrate or justice, an accused or a defendant who appears at a
proceeding has been misled or prejudiced by reason of any matter referred to in
subsection (1), the court, judge, magistrate or justice may adjourn the
proceeding and may make such order as it or he considers proper.

(3) The provisions of Part XIV apply mutatis
mutandis where a summons or warrant is issued under subsection (1).

The effect of this section was noted by
Laskin C.J.C. in Batchelor v. The Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 988, at
p. 991. I would add that I am in agreement with Tallis J. (as he then was)
in Re Thompson

[Page 501]

and The Queen (1978),
38 C.C.C. (2d) 498, where he held that s. 440.1 of the Code applied
both to summary proceedings and proceedings by indictment.

I am therefore of the opinion that the
provincial court judge was seized with jurisdiction to hear the informations
from the outset and he never lost it and was, therefore, a court of competent
jurisdiction. It should be noted here, however, that the Crown did not appeal his
order of dismissal, nor did it seek to attack it by means of a prerogative
proceeding.

I am also of the opinion that the appellant was
placed in jeopardy and that his trial commenced upon the informations. He had
pleaded not guilty and he stood prepared to meet the Crown’s case. In Riddle,
the Crown’s case was dismissed because the Crown, despite the refusal of an
adjournment and the Court’s direction that the trial proceed, declined to call
evidence. There was accordingly no case for the accused to meet and the
acquittal resulted. In that case Dickson J. said, at p. 398:

In my view, a criminal trial commences and
an accused is normally in jeopardy from the moment issue is joined before a
judge having jurisdiction and the prosecution is called upon to present its
case in court. The person accused continues in jeopardy until final
determination of the matter by rendering of the verdict.

I do not consider that Dickson J. imposed by
those words a requirement that some direct invitation must be issued to the Crown
to call evidence before it could be said that the issue had been joined and the
accused placed in jeopardy. The authorities he relied upon in his reasons
support the proposition that once a plea is entered before a court of competent
jurisdiction the accused is in jeopardy. Where that court proceeds to a
determination, in the nature of an acquittal or dismissal, proceedings on new
informations raising the same allegations will be barred: Haynes v. Davis, [1915]
1 K.B. 332; R. v. Hatherley (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 242; R. v. Blair
and Karashowsky (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 47; R. v. Day (1980), 37
N.S.R. (2d) 193; and other authorities referred to in Riddle, supra.

[Page 502]

I am in agreement with Dickson J. when,
referring to the question of “trial on the merits”, he said, at p. 399, in
the Riddle case:

The term “on the merits” does nothing to
further the test for the application of the bis vexari maxim. There is
no basis, in the Code or in the common law, for any super-added
requirement that there must be a trial “on the merits”. That phrase merely
serves to emphasize the general requirement that the previous dismissal must
have been made by a court of competent jurisdiction, whose proceedings were
free from jurisdictional error and which rendered judgment on the charge.

In my view, when he concluded his comment, above
quoted, with the words “whose proceedings were free from jurisdictional error”,
he was not referring to such an error as was present here where the provincial
court judge decided, in error, that he had no jurisdiction. The jurisdictional
error contemplated in Dickson J.’s expression is one which leads the court to
exceed its jurisdiction by exercising, or purporting to exercise, a
jurisdiction it does not possess. The provincial court judge in the case at
bar, in deciding he lacked jurisdiction, simply made an error in law in the
disposition of the case which was properly before him and within his
jurisdiction.

In the facts of this case I am of the view that
the appellant was put in jeopardy, and the summary conviction court dismissed
the informations thus giving the appellant such a determination of the issue
that it could be raised in bar of any later proceedings on the same charge. The
fact that the provincial court judge may have made an error in law in
dismissing the informations does not alter the situation. He made an order.
Assuming, as I do, that his order was wrong, it nonetheless disposed of the
informations. Such an order, though voidable, must stand, however, until it is
rescinded, quashed, or reversed on appeal. It was therefore in force and effect
when the plea of autrefois acquit was raised and it should have received
effect. This is not to say the Crown was left without remedy in the face of
judicial error. The Crown could have appealed; it might have had the right to
relief by prerogative proceedings, but it could not simply conclude that the
summary conviction court’s order was ex facie a nullity and ignore it by

[Page 503]

commencing new proceedings. By this approach,
the Crown has foregone its remedy and a plea of autrefois acquit should
have succeeded. I would allow the appeal.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Drunk driving charge—Viva voce
evidence—Whether statutory rebuttable presumption applicable—Whether proof of
suitability of substance necessary—Criminal Code , ss. 237(1) (c), 237(1) (f).

The appellant was acquitted of a drunk
driving charge under s. 236  of the Criminal Code . The Crown, electing to
proceed under summary conviction procedure, had sought to prove the charge by viva
voce evidence, relying on the presumption created by s. 237(1) (c),
and the appellant had called no evidence in defence.

Two questions of law arising out of a stated
case were put to the courts: whether the trial judge erred 1) in concluding
that the statutory rebuttable presumption could only be applied to a case where
the Crown had proceeded by way of certificate evidence and 2) in concluding
that there had to be proof of the suitability of the substance used in the
breathalyzer machine at the time of the analyses of the samples of the
accused’s breath. These questions were answered in the affirmative by the
courts below and the acquittal was set aside.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

With respect to the first question: it is
manifest from a plain reading of s. 237 that assuming the requirements of the
various subsections are satisfied, the Crown may rely on the presumption
of subs. (1)(c) whether it proceeds to prove the offence by means of the
viva voce evidence of a qualified technician or by the production of a
certificate under subs. (1)(f).

With respect to the second question:
admittedly, no such element of proof by the Crown is expressed in s. 237(1) (c)
and the Court should avoid reading into the section technical requirements
which do not flow from the language used by Parliament.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario affirming the order
on a stated case. Appeal dismissed.

Gerald R. Kluwak and Barry Prentice, for
the appellant.

A.G. Campbell, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The appellant is here by leave
on two questions of law arising out of a stated case which followed his
acquittal of a drunk driving charge under Criminal Code , s. 236 .
The Crown, electing to proceed under summary conviction procedure, sought to
prove the charge by viva voce evidence, relying on the presumption
created by s. 237(1) (c). The accused called no evidence in defence.

The case stated at the request of the Crown and
pursuant to Criminal Code , s. 762  contained four questions as follows:

(i) Did I err in law in concluding that the
statutory rebuttable presumption contained in Section 237(1) (c) of
the Criminal Code  could only be applied to a case where the Crown had
proceeded by way of certificate evidence?

(ii) Did I err in law in concluding that there
had to be proof of the suitability of the substance or solution used in the
breathalyzer machine at the time of the analyses of the samples of the
accused’s breath, and proof of how the chemical analyses were conducted where
no certificate evidence was relied upon and the Crown proceeded by way of viva
voce evidence?

(iii) Did I err in law in concluding that
the demand made pursuant to Section 235(1) was not made forthwith or as
soon as practicable by reason of the delay in taking the roadside sample?

(iv) Did I err in concluding that the
samples taken as provided for in Section 237(1) (c)(ii) were not
taken as soon as practicable by reason of the delay in taking the roadside
sample?

[Page 568]

Robins J. before whom the issues came answered
all questions in the stated case in the affirmative. In consequence, he allowed
the Crown’s appeal, set aside the acquittal and remitted the matter to the
trial judge. On further appeal to the Court of Appeal, that Court affirmed the
order of Robins J. for the reasons given by him. As indicated above, the case
is here by leave on two only, the first two, of the questions set out in the
stated case.

I need not dwell at any length on the first of
the questions that is before this Court. The reasons of Robins J. are sufficient
support for the conclusion that the rebuttable statutory presumption may be
raised by the Crown by viva voce evidence and that it is not restricted,
in its resort to s. 237(1) (c) to certificate evidence.
Section 237(1) (c) is in these terms:

237. (1) In
any proceedings under section 234  or 236 ,

(c) where samples of the
breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1), if

(i) [not yet proclaimed]

(ii) each sample was taken as soon as
practicable after the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed
and in any event not later than two hours after that time, with an interval of
at least fifteen minutes between the times when the samples were taken,

(iii) each sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by a qualified technician, and

(iv) a chemical analysis of each sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician.

evidence of the results of the chemical
analyses so made is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that
the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the
offence was alleged to have been committed was, where the results of the
analyses are the same, the proportion determined by such analyses and, where
the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the proportions
determined by such analyses;

Robins J. addressed the first question as
follows:

[Page 569]

Whether the Crown seeks to establish the offence
through the certificate of a qualified technician admissible under
section 237(1) (f) or through the oral testimony of the technician,
it is entitled to receive the evidentiary advantage afforded it by
section 237(1) (c). The evidence of the results of the chemical
analysis must in each case by virtue of section 237(1) (c), be taken
to constitute proof of the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at
the material time “in the absence of any evidence to the contrary”.

There is no merit in my view to the
submission made on behalf of the respondent that section 237 is designed
solely for the purpose of permitting certificate evidence; the
section presents no difficulty of interpretation on this point. I think it
manifest from a plain reading of it that assuming the requirements of the
various subsections are satisfied, the Crown may rely on the presumption
of subsection (1)(c) whether it proceeds to prove the offence by
means of the viva voce evidence of a qualified technician or by the
production of a certificate under subsection (1)(f). The Court of
Appeal indicated in the case of Regina v. Ware (1975), 30 C.R.N.S. 308
that both methods of proof are available to the Crown.

On the second question, counsel for the
appellant restricted himself to the first part thereof, that concerning proof
of the suitability of the substance or solution used in the breathalyzer
machine at the time of the analyses of the samples of the accused’s breath. It
was his contention that even if he was wrong as to the requirement of
certificate evidence only to bring the Crown within s. 237(1) (c), it was
nonetheless necessary, where the Crown proceeded by viva voce evidence, as it
did here, to make proof of the suitability of the substance or solution used in
the breathalyzer machine. Admittedly, no such element of proof by the Crown is
expressed in s. 237(1) (c) and the principle expressed by Pigeon J. for
this Court in R. v. Crosthwait[1] would
appear to exclude its importation into that provision. The Crosthwait case
concerned a drunk driving charge, similar to that in this case, but there the
Crown sought to raise the statutory presumption under s. 237(1) (c) by
producing a certificate of analyses of two breath tests through the officer who
took the tests. A question was raised in that case as to the extent to which
reliance could be placed upon a certificate made pursuant to s. 237(1) (f).
Pigeon J. said

[Page 570]

this in the course of his reasons (at pp.
1099-1100):

In the instant case, the certificate filed
at the trial fully complies with the conditions stated in para. (f). It
was, therefore, by itself, evidence of the results of the analyses. With
respect, I cannot agree that there is another implicit condition namely, that
the instrument used must be shown to have been functioning properly, and the
technician had followed the manufacturer’s instructions in testing its
accuracy. It is clear from the wording of the Code that the rebuttable
presumption arises from the mere statements in the certificate itself. The
presumption may no doubt be rebutted by evidence that the instrument used was
not functioning properly but the certificate cannot be rejected on that
account. It may very well be that a scientist would not sign a certificate of
analysis on the basis of the tests as performed by the technician, but this is
irrelevant. Parliament has prescribed the conditions under which a certificate
is evidence of the results of breath analyses and did not see fit to require
evidence that the approved instrument was operating properly. Parliament did
not see fit to require a check test be made with a standard alcohol solution
and made reference only to the solution used for the actual test. Technicians
are instructed to make a check test but the making of this test or its results
have not been made conditions of the validity of the certificate and it has not
been provided that the certificate would not be valid if it was not shown that
the instrument had been maintained and operated in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instruction.

…

This does not mean that the accused is at
the mercy of the technician: while the certificate is evidence by itself, the
facts of which it is evidence are “deemed to be established only in the absence
of any evidence to the contrary”. Thus, any evidence tending to invalidate the
result of the tests may be adduced on behalf of the accused in order to dispute
the charge against him. As was pointed out in R. v. Proudlock, [[1979] 1
S.C.R. 525], it is not necessary in such cases that the rebutting evidence
should do more than raise a reasonable doubt and, of course, this evidence may
be sought in the depositions given by witnesses of the Crown as well as in
depositions of defence witnesses. Therefore, in my view, the situation here is
that the certificate was evidence of the results of the analyses by virtue of
the express provisions of the Criminal Code , however, the further
question remained: Was there evidence to the contrary sufficient at least to
raise a reasonable doubt?

[Page 571]

Counsel for the appellant submitted, however,
that he was not seeking to have the Court introduce an element of proof into a
provision which did not express it but rather was seeking to have the Court
give a proper interpretation to s. 237(1) (c) in the light of the various
provisions of s. 237(1) , including s. 237(1) (e) and (f).
Subsections (1)(e) and (1)(f) are “certificate” clauses
reading respectively as follows:

237. (1)…

(e) a certificate of an analyst
stating that he has made an analysis of a sample of any substance or solution intended
for use in an approved instrument and identified in the certificate and that
the sample analyzed by him was found to be suitable for use in an approved
instrument, is evidence that the substance or solution so identified is
suitable for use in an approved instrument, without proof of the signature or
the official character of the person appearing to have signed the certificate;
and

(f) where samples of the breath of
the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under
subsection 235(1), a certificate of a qualified technician stating

(i) that each chemical analysis of the
samples has been made by means of an approved instrument operated by him in
which a substance or solution suitable for use in that approved instrument and
identified in the certificate was used,

(ii) the results of the chemical analyses
so made,

and

(iii) if the samples were taken by him,

(A) [not yet proclaimed]

(B) the time when and place where each
sample and any specimen described in clause (A) was taken, and

(C) that each sample was received from the
accused directly into an approved container or into an approved instrument
operated by the technician,

is evidence of the statements contained in
the certificate without proof of the signature or the official character of the
person appearing to have signed the certificate.

Emphasis was laid by counsel for the appellant
on the word “identified” in para. (f)(i). What

[Page 572]

counsel asserted was that this word did no more
than require that the certificate name the substance or solution but left its
suitability to be proved otherwise by the Crown. He invoked as well the
judgment of Johnson J.A. in R. v. Gorgichuk[2] decided by the Alberta Appellate Division
and the judgment of Taggart J.A. in R. v. Rogers[3] a decision of the British Columbia
Court of Appeal. Counsel’s point was that where the Crown proceeded by
certificate evidence under s. 237(1) (f) to seek the advantage of the
presumption under s. 237(1) (c), it was still necessary to prove the
suitability of the substance or solution in the breathalyzer instrument, either
by resort to a certificate under (e) or by the evidence of a
qualified witness, namely, the analyst. A fortiori, in his submission,
was this necessary if the Crown proceeded by viva voce evidence alone to
raise the presumption.

Reliance was placed on the following passage
from the reasons of Johnson J.A. in the Gorgichuk case, at p. 496:

This other question also concerns the
technician’s certificate. It is whether the production of this certificate
alone, without at the same time producing an analyst’s certificate that he has
analyzed the “substance or solution” and found it “suitable for use in an
approved instrument” is sufficient to prove the proportion of alcohol in the
blood of the appellant.

Subsection (1)(c) provides:

(c) where a sample of the breath of
the accused has been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection (1)
of Section 223, if

(iv) a chemical analysis of the sample was
made by means of an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician,

evidence of the result of the chemical
analysis so made is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof of
the proportion of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the
offence was alleged to have been committed;

[Page 573]

This on its face would appear to be all
that is required to establish proof of the alcohol content of the blood.
However, the following clauses of the subsection make it clear that the
approved instrument can only be operated if it is supplied by a “substance or
solution” analyzed by an analyst and found to be suitable for use in an
approved instrument (s-s. (1)(f)(i)).

Subsection (6) defines an approved
instrument and the Approved Breathalyzer Order, SOR/69-583, approved a
“Borkenstein Breathalyzer as suitable for the purposes of section 224A  of
the Criminal Code ”. There is no provision made for the approval of the
“substance or solution” intended to be used in the approved instrument other
than by an analyst who has analyzed a sample of the same and his finding of
suitability may be proved by his certificate under s-s. (1)(e). It is
clear such a certificate, or failing that, viva voce evidence by the
analyst, is a part of the Crown’s case when it proceeds under these sections.

The Rogers case, unlike Gorgichuk, was one
where the Crown sought to prove a drunk driving charge against an accused by viva
voce evidence, that of a police officer, a qualified technician, who took
breath samples with an approved breathalyzer instrument. As in Gorgichuk, so
in Rogers, the Court held that it was necessary for the Crown to introduce
evidence to show that the approved instrument contained a substance or solution
suitable for use in the breathalyzer instrument, as well as evidence that a
chemical analysis was conducted. “Without such evidence” said Taggart J.A. for
the Court, “there is no proper basis for an opinion as to the quantity of
alcohol in the bloodstream of the person who is the subject of the analysis”
(at p. 500).

The judgment in Rogers was somewhat
diluted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in its recent judgment in R.
v. York, September 16, 1980, not yet reported. It was an appeal from
affirmation of a summary conviction on a drunk driving charge and the argument
made on behalf of the appellant was that there was no evidence as

[Page 574]

to the suitability of the solution used in the
breathalyzer instrument, there was no evidence as to the identity of the
solution and there was no evidence as to the making of a chemical analysis. As
in the Rogers case, the Crown sought to prove the charge by the viva voce evidence
of a qualified technician who took the breath samples with an approved
breathalyzer instrument.

Taggart J.A., who delivered the judgment in Rogers, delivered
the principal judgment in the York case. The conviction was affirmed and
the distinction drawn in respect of the Rogers case was that there the appeal was by
way of stated case and not by way of a straight appeal alleging a want of
evidence. Taggart J.A. added that he was not at all satisfied that the nature
of the evidence adduced before the trial judge in the Rogers case was in
any way similar to the nature of the evidence adduced in the York case.
On the merits, he was of the view that the testimony of the qualified
technician as to his use of an approved breathalyzer instrument and with which
he took the required breath samples followed by a check of the instrument, was
sufficient to enable the County Court Judge to draw the inference that the
solution used was suitable and that it was properly identified.
Section 237(1) (c) was satisfied without more, even as to the
chemical analysis.

I find considerable difficulty in reconciling
the two cases of Rogers and York but, in any event, I think that
Robins J., who purported to follow the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal
in R. v. Ware[4] was
correct in doing so even if he were not bound to it by stare decisis. Lacourcière
J.A. who spoke for the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Ware case said
this (at p. 315) on the point in issue here:

…in my view, the learned trial Judge was in
error in holding that the suitability of the substance or solution for use in
an approved instrument had to be proved as part of the Crown’s case before the
accused could be found guilty of the offence charged. In my view subs. (1)(e)
is merely an evidentiary subsection providing the Crown with the means by
which to rebut any evidence that the substance or solution was unsuitable. I am
of

[Page 575]

opinion that it is sufficient for the
Crown, in order to prove the commission of the offence, merely to bring the
accused within subs. (1)(a) and to file the certificate under
subs. (1)(f) or prove the three enacted requirements of subs. (1)(c)
by viva voce evidence.

Parliament created a new offence, the actus
reus of which includes the
prohibited blood‑alcohol concentration; it set out a workable procedure
to prove it. With great respect, it is not for the courts to defeat the
laudable social purpose of the legislation, i.e., keeping off the roads people
whose blood-alcohol proportion may exceed the prescribed limit, by adding, as
part of the required [sic] proof of an offence, the necessity of an
analysis of the solution in every case. I am required to “approach the matter
by considering what is the mischief aimed at by this Act” […] and to avoid
reading into the section technical requirements which do not flow from the
language used by Parliament.

In short, the Crown may obtain the advantage of
the statutory presumption under s. 237(1) (c) by offering proof,
by certificate or by oral evidence, of the three elements specified therein.
Nothing more is required, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. In my
opinion, both Gorgichuk and Rogers were wróngly decided.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed with costs.

The judgment of the Court was delivered orally
by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We do not need to hear you,
Mr. Herschorn and Mr. Giovannetti. The only issue in this case,
involving a charge of indecent assault, was consent, and on this issue, there
was the uncontradicted evidence of the complainant that there was no consent.
In the circumstances, we find no reversible error in the charge of the trial
judge who pointed to the danger of convicting on the complainant’s evidence
alone, although he did not give the so‑called Binet warning when
there were the prior inconsistent sworn and unsworn statements of the
complainant. As

[Page 565]

was noted by Davey J.A. in R. v. Rustad[2], the obligation of a trial judge to give
the Binet warning depends on the circumstances and on the issues. Those
in this case did not require the trial judge to go farther than he did.

The appeal is, accordingly, dismissed.

Judgment accordingly.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
MANITOBA

Criminal law—Defence—Compulsion—Charge of
rape—“Assisting in rape” precluded from the defence but not rape—Appellant
claiming duress—Whether or not rape excluded from defence of compulsion—If
available, whether or not sufficient evidence to put defence to the
jury—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, s. 17.

This appeal concerned the application of the
defence of compulsion or duress, provided in s. 17  of the Criminal
Code , to rape. Appellant, who admitted the acts of intercourse against the
complainant’s will and without her consent, gave no evidence at trial but found
an evidentiary base for his defence in the evidence of other witnesses and a
long statement that he made to the police. Complainant had been first raped by
one Durack, while appellant waited near the car, and then by appellant.
Although appellant had initially refused to have intercourse with the
complainant when ordered to do so by Durack, he complied because he said he
feared for his life. Durack was a violent man and armed with a knife.
Complainant testified that she was forced to perform further sexual acts with
both men. Despite the relative proximity of a farm-house which could have
provided both appellant and complainant with assistance, appellant did not take
advantage of his opportunities to escape—at least two and perhaps three rapes
occurred.

The case raised two clear issues. Did the
defence of compulsion described in s. 17  of the Criminal Code  apply
to rape or did the section’s wording exclude it, and assuming the defence did
apply, was there sufficient evidence in this case to warrant the putting of the
defence to the jury?

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

[Page 540]

The defence of compulsion applied to all
criminal offences, except those excluded, and only became effective to protect
an accused where it could be shown that the accused had in fact actually
committed the offence.

“Assisting in rape” was among the excepted
offences; rape was not specifically mentioned. The expression “assisting in
rape” was descriptive of participation in rape and could exclude, and in its
use in the Criminal Code  was intended to exclude, the crime of rape
whether committed by one acting as ravisher or by one who participated by
assisting. As rape was a crime where certain persons could only be convicted as
aiders, the words “assisting in rape” broadened, rather than restricted, the
exclusion and brought into the exclusion from the defence those whose liability
depended upon assisting in the commission of rape, as well as the rapers in
fact. The phrase was never intended to include persons assisting to the
exclusion of persons actually committing the crime of rape.

The meaning of the words “assisting in rape”
was not strained by this interpretation because they were used in the sense
that they “import[ed] either active participation or cooperation, or intended
encouragement”.

[Page 541]

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal from a decision of the
Court of Appeal for Manitoba (Monnin and Matas JJ.A., Huband J.A. dissenting)
raises questions concerning the application of the defence of compulsion or
duress, provided for in s. 17  of the Criminal Code .

The facts of the case are not seriously
disputed. The complainant, a young woman then aged twenty-five, went alone to a
beer parlour in a Winnipeg hotel. She wished to hear a band which performed
there. She arrived about 8:30 or 9:00 p.m. and shortly thereafter was asked to join a group at another table.
The group, including the complainant, remained in the beer parlour until it
closed about 1:30 a.m. They then left for a party at a private apartment in Winnipeg. The appellant and a man named
Durack were also at the party which lasted until about 4:30 a.m. During this affair, as in the beer
parlour earlier, there was a good deal of drinking. Shortly before departure
from the party, there was some discussion between Bergstrom and the complainant
about driving the complainant home. Bergstrom agreed to take the complainant to
her home in his car but, because he did not have a driver’s licence, Durack was
to drive as far as his (Durack’s) home where he would get out and leave
Bergstrom to take the complainant the remainder of the way. The journey
commenced but, instead of driving to his home, Durack drove the car out of the
city to a point some twenty miles north of Winnipeg. The complainant passed out during the course of the journey,
presumably because of the amount of liquor she had consumed. Bergstrom, in a
statement to the police, said that he had protested to Durack when he realized
that he was not driving to his home as planned, and that when questioned on the
subject a second time Durack produced a knife and ordered him to be quiet.

Durack drove off the road passing nearby a
farm-house and stopped in a field. He ordered the complainant, now reawakened,
to get into the back seat of the car and over her protests and after
threatening her with violence he terrorized her into submitting to intercourse.
While this was going on,

[Page 542]

Bergstrom was outside the car. When Durack was
finished he ordered Bergstrom to have intercourse with the complainant.
Bergstrom, in his statement, said he refused to indulge in sexual intercourse with
the complainant but he feared Durack would use his knife and complied with
Durack’s demand that he do so. On Durack’s orders, the complainant performed
fellatio on both men. Each man had intercourse against her will and, while her
memory is vague as to detail and the sequence of events, according to her
evidence there were further acts of intercourse and there was no denial of them
by either accused. Despite her screams and her request to Bergstrom on at least
one occasion for help, the rapes were completed and no attempt was made at the
trial to assert that the acts of intercourse occurred with the consent of the
complainant. It was common ground that she did not consent and her resistance
and protests were overcome by her fear.

The attacks upon the complainant all took place
in the back seat of the car. While Durack was raping the girl, Bergstrom was
either in the front seat or, on one occasion at least, out of the car. There
was a farm-house in the vicinity. How far it was across the field is not revealed
in the evidence. Bergstrom said in his statement, however, that he had left the
car door open when Durack was raping the girl so that her screams might be
heard. No lights came on in the house, and he ‘guessed’ that its occupants had
not heard. Bergstrom expressed fear of Durack and said that he was a dangerous
man who had knifed a friend of Bergstrom and who, at the party that evening,
had threatened another person with a knife. Bergstrom said he feared for his
life at the hands of his violent associate, but it is nonetheless clear that he
had no less than two and probably three clear chances to escape and the
relative proximity of the farm-house could have provided a source of
assistance, not only for himself but for the complainant. When these events
were terminated the complainant was driven home and the two men left her.

Bergstrom and Durack were arrested. Durack
pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to four

[Page 543]

years in the penitentiary. Bergstrom was charged
with rape and acts of gross indecency. He was tried by judge and jury and
acquitted on both counts. He admitted the acts of intercourse against the
complainant’s will and without her consent. His sole defence was that of
compulsion under s. 17  of the Criminal Code . He gave no evidence at
his trial, but found an evidentiary base for his defence in the evidence of
other witnesses and on a long statement he made to the police, which was put in
evidence by the Crown.

This case raises two clear issues. Does the
defence of compulsion described in s. 17  of the Criminal Code  apply
to the crime of rape or is it excluded by the wording of the section and,
assuming the defence does apply, was there in this case sufficient evidence to
warrant the putting of the defence to the jury?

In the Court of Appeal the majority were of the
opinion that there was not sufficient evidence to warrant the putting of the
defence of compulsion under s. 17  of the Criminal Code  to the jury,
and they allowed the appeal and directed a new trial finding it unnecessary to deal
with the first question raised. Huband J.A., dissenting, was of the view that
the trial judge made no error in the matter and would have dismissed the
Crown’s appeal.

I will consider first the question of whether
the defence of compulsion is open on a charge of rape. Section 17 of the Code
provides for the defence in these words:

17. A person
who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate death or
grievous bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed
is excused for committing the offence if he believes that the threats will be
carried out and if he is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby he
is subject to compulsion, but this section does not apply where the
offence that is committed is high treason or treason, murder, piracy, attempted
murder, assisting in rape, forcible abduction, robbery, causing bodily harm or
arson.

[Page 544]

The defence applies, in accordance with the
conditions expressed in the section, to all criminal offences except those which
are excluded. It can only become effective to protect an accused when it can be
shown that the accused has, in fact, actually committed the offence. Where it
applies, the commission of the offence is excused. Bergstrom was charged with
the commission of rape and there was ample evidence drawn from his own
statement and from the testimony of the complainant to establish beyond any
reasonable doubt that he committed rape. His sole defence rests upon the
assertion that he carried out the crime under compulsion by threats of
immediate death or grievous bodily harm from Durack who was present at the
time. Before any examination need be made of the evidence of threats, fear, and
the existence of compulsion in fact, it must be decided if the section has
any application to this case.

Rape is not mentioned specifically as one of the
excepted offences in s. 17 . What is excepted is described as “assisting in
rape”. The meaning which may be attributed to those words must be determined.
Counsel for the appellant pointed out that there is no offence described in
those terms under the criminal law of Canada and, therefore, the words were not
of significance. Counsel for the Crown contended that the words included “rape”
and that, as a result, rape was an excepted offence under s. 17  and that
the defence under the section could not apply.

The words “assisting in rape” are a curious
feature of s. 17 . They have appeared in this section and in its
predecessors ever since the passing of the first Criminal Code  of Canada
in 1892. They were taken directly from the Draft Code of 1879 which was
an appendix to the Report of the Royal Commission Appointed to Consider the
Law Relating to Indictable Offences in the United Kingdom, which made its
report in 1879. Forming as they do part of the statute, a meaning must be
attributed to them because it cannot be presumed that they are, or were
intended to be, meaningless. What then did the words “assisting in rape” mean
when they were employed in the Draft Code and

[Page 545]

later enacted in law in the Criminal Code  of
Canada in 1892?

I have been able to find little Canadian
authority to assist me in the resolution of this question. Scarcely more has
been uncovered from English sources, but it is clear that in England in the
nineteenth century, during a period in which the drafting of the Draft Code occurred,
the concept of assisting in the commission of rape and the legal consequences
of such conduct received attention in the courts. A person against whom a
complaint of rape was made could be charged with the crime of rape as the
actual perpetrator (principal in the first degree) or, if the facts warranted,
he could be charged with aiding and assisting in rape (principal in the second
degree). Regardless of how the charge was framed in this respect, he could be
convicted of the crime of rape. The law in this particular had been clearly
settled for many years. In Hale’s History of the Pleas of the Crown, (1736),
vol. 1, at pp. 626-636, the subject is dealt with and it is stated at
p. 628:

If A. actually ravish a woman, and B. and
C. were present, aiding and abetting, they are all equally principal, and all
subject to the same punishment both at common law and since the statute of Westm.
2 de quo infra.

The nineteenth century position is illustrated
in three cases: R. v. Folkes and Ludds[2];
R. v. Gray and Wise[3] and
particularly R. v. Crisham[4].

The full report of the Crisham case is
reproduced below. A marginal note, or headnote, in the following terms
provides:

An indictment is good which charges that A.
committed a rape, and that B. was present aiding and assisting him in the
commission of the felony. In such a case the party aiding may be charged
either, as he was in law, a principal in the first degree, or, as he was in
fact, a principal in the second degree.

The report continues:

The indictment stated that one Peter
M’Donough upon one Bridget Lamb did make an assault, and her the said Bridget
Lamb violently, feloniously, and against her will did ravish, &c.; and went
on to state that the prisoner

[Page 546]

was present, and feloniously aided and
assisted the said Peter M’Donough in the commission of the said felony,
contrary to the statute, &c. After a verdict of guilty—

Payne, for
the prisoner, moved in arrest of judgment.—The indictment charges the prisoner
with aiding and assisting M’Donough in the commission of a rape, contrary to
the statute. Now, there not being any statutory provisions applicable to
persons aiding and abetting in cases of this nature, I submit that the
indictment is wrongly framed. The prisoner, in the absence of any express
provision by statute, should have been indicted as at common law; and the
indictment should have charged him as a principal, and stated that he, as well
as M’Donough, ravished the prosecutor. In Folke’s case, an indictment,
charging the prisoner both as principal in the first degree, and as aiding and
abetting other men in committing a rape, was held after conviction to be valid
on the count charging the prisoner as principal. The statute of 9 Geo.
4, c. 31, which declares, in the 16th section, that every person, convicted of
the crime of rape, shall suffer death, makes no specific provision as to aiders
and abettors, with reference to that offence. The 7 & 8 Geo. 4, c. 29, and
the 7 & 8 Geo. 4, c. 30, make provision for principals in the second
degree, with reference to the felonies mentioned in them respectively; but the
stat. 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, does not contain any such provision with respect to the
offence of rape.

Maule, J.—Then your objection is, that the
offence which has been committed is not stated in the indictment.

Payne.—My
objection is, that the person is not charged, as he ought to have been, as a
principal.

Rolfe, B.—Is he not so charged in the
indictment? It alleges that M’Donough committed a rape, and the prisoner aided
and assisted him. Is not that another way of saying that the prisoner committed
a rape? [Emphasis added.]

Maule, J.—There does not appear to me to be
any ground for the objection. It has been already decided that, in a case of this
description, the party may be charged according to the fact, or indicted as a
principal in the first degree.

The law as propounded in these cases, which
recognize no difference between the principal in the first degree and the
principal in the second degree, both being equally guilty of the crime charged,
became well-settled in England as a part

[Page 547]

of the base upon which the Draft Code was
prepared in 1879 and the Criminal Code  of Canada was enacted in 1892. In
Chitty on Criminal Law, 2nd ed., (1826), vol. 1, the following appears,
at p. 255a:

A man may be a principal in one of two
degrees. A principal in the first degree is he that is the actor
or actual perpetrator of the crime; and in the second degree, he who is
present aiding and abetting the fact to be committed. It is a question of law
whether a person is guilty as a principal in the first or second degree.

Principals in the second degree were
formerly denominated and regarded as only accessaries at the fact. And
it seems that he who actually committed the crime was alone guilty as
principal, and those who were present aiding and assisting, were but in the
nature of accessaries, and could not be put upon their trial until the
principal was first convicted. This distinction has, however, been long
since exploded, and now the stroke is constructively given by all who consent
and who are present at its infliction, and they may be put upon their trial
though the actual slayer is neither outlawed nor found guilty. In order,
however, to make the aiders and abettors thus highly culpable, three requisites
must combine; they must be present—aiding and assisting—with a felonious
intention to the felony. [Emphasis added.]

In Archbold’s Criminal Pleading &
Practice, 7th ed., (1860), vol. 1, at pp. 66-7, the following appears:

The law, however, recognizes no difference
between the offence of the principal in the first degree, and of the principal
in the second; both are equally guilty.

And so immaterial is the distinction
considered in practice, that if a man be indicted as principal in the first
degree, proof that he was present aiding and abetting another in committing the
offence, although his was not the hand which actually did it, will support the
indictment; and, on the other hand, if he be indicted as principal in the
second degree, proof that he was not only present, but committed the offence
with his own hand, will support the indictment. Therefore, if A. be indicted
for being present, aiding and abetting B. in committing a felony, A. may be
convicted, although B. is acquitted.

So, when an offence is punishable by a
statute which makes no mention of principals in the second degree,

[Page 548]

such principals are within the meaning of
the statute as much as the parties who actually commit the offence; and
therefore, in the case of rape, a person may be convicted on an indictment
charging him with being present aiding and abetting another who actually
committed it. [Emphasis added.]

In Archbold’s Pleading & Evidence in
Criminal Cases, 20th ed., (1886), dealing with English law as it stood only
a few years before the enactment of the Criminal Code  of Canada, an
example is given of an indictment charging the crime of rape, at p. 804.
Of particular interest is a note which follows the form of the indictment in
these terms:

An indictment is good which charges that
A. committed a rape, and that B. was present aiding and abetting him in the
commission of the felony; for the party aiding may be charged either as, as he
was in law, a principal in the first degree, or, as he was in fact, a principal
in the second degree. R. v. Crisham, C. & Mar. 187.
A general conviction of a defendant charged both as principal in the first
degree, and as an aider and abettor of other men in rape, is valid on the count
charging him as principal. And on such an indictment, evidence may be given of
several rapes on the same woman, at the same time, by the defendant and other
men, each assisting the other in turn, without putting the prosecutor to elect
on which count to proceed. R. v. Folkes, 1 Mood. C.C. 354; R. v.
Gray, 7 C. & P. 164.

The relationship between a principal in the
first and in the second degree applied in Canada, as well as England, in the
latter part of the nineteenth century: see Clarke’s Criminal Law of Canada, (1872),
at p. 97. The modern position in this country is illustrated in R. v.
Harder[5]. This
case dealt with the sufficiency of an indictment alleging that “he did have
carnal knowledge of V.B. a woman who was not his wife without her consent” when
the Crown case was that he had not had sexual intercourse with the complainant
but had aided others to do so. In allowing the Crown’s appeal and restoring the
conviction at trial the majority of the Court, in four separate judgments
(Fauteux, Rand, Kellock, Locke JJ., Kerwin C.J. and Taschereau J. agreeing with
Fauteux J. and

[Page 549]

Cartwright J. dissenting), reviewed the
development of the law on this point and collected and discussed several of the
authorities, which are cited above, covering the relationship of the principals
in the first and second degrees particularly in reference to rape, and
concluded that the law recognizes no difference in criminal culpability and
liability between the ravisher and the assister in rape.

It is my opinion that the phrase “assisting in
rape”, if not in full and common usage in England in the late nineteenth
century, was nevertheless an expression well-known in the law at the time of
the drafting of the Draft Code and the enactment of the first Criminal
Code  of Canada. It was an expression descriptive of participation in rape
and could include, and in its use in the Criminal Code  was intended to
include, the crime of rape whether committed by one acting as ravisher or by
one who participated by assisting. In my view the phrase was never intended to
include persons assisting to the exclusion of persons actually committing the
crime of rape. Therefore, the words so used in s. 12 of the original Code,
now s. 17 , were thus intended to exclude and did exclude rape, however
committed, from the scope of the defence of compulsion.

I do not consider that the view expressed above
involves any straining of the meaning of the words employed in the Criminal
Code . The word “assisting” is capable of various meanings and one of the
most significant involves the element of participation. Reference to standard
and authoritative dictionaries will reveal such definitions as “to aid or help,
to be present at, to second and support, to further and promote an action or
result, and to participate in an activity”. It is interesting to note as well a
judicial view on this question expressed in Mensinger v. O’Hara[6], at p. 50, where it was said
that “The words ‘assisted, aided and abetted’ import either active
participation or co-operation,

[Page 550]

or intentional encouragement”. It is in that sense that the words “assisting in rape” were employed
in the Draft Code and in the Criminal Code  in s. 17 .

The Commissioners who drafted the Draft Code which
was submitted to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1879 noted in Note A
to page 10 of their report in commenting on the defence of compulsion, which
they had included in the Draft Code in the same terms which now appear
as s. 17  of the Criminal Code , that “there is no doubt on the
authorities that compulsion is a defence where the crime is not one of a
heinous character”. By the exclusion of “assisting in rape” which was carried
forward in the Criminal Code  of Canada the Commissioners and the
Parliament of Canada recognized that rape was an offence of that heinous
character which warranted the exclusion from the defence of compulsion of any
participation in its accomplishment. It would be illogical in the extreme to
impute an intention to the drafters of the Draft Code and the Criminal
Code  of Canada to exclude aiders and abettors from reliance on the defence
of compulsion while according it to actual ravishers, particularly when the law
recognized equal culpability and equal punishment for both.

Why, it may be asked, was it necessary to employ
the words “assisting in rape” in respect of that offence in s. 17 of the Code?
In my opinion, the answer lies in the peculiar nature of the crime of rape.
It is a crime which, as described in the Criminal Code , may only be
committed by a male and then only upon a female not his wife. Nonetheless,
others may be convicted of rape even though, for legal or physiological
reasons, they may be incapable of committing the offence in fact. For example,
see R. v. Lord Baltimore[7], women
indicted as principals in the second degree; R. v. Audley (Lord)[8], husband convicted for assisting in
the rape of his own wife; R. v. Ram and Ram[9], woman indicted for rape as a
principal in the second degree for aiding her husband; and see,

[Page 551]

as well, R. v. Eldershow[10] where it was considered that a boy under
fourteen could not be found guilty of rape except as a principal in the
second degree. It is this feature of rape which distinguishes it from the
other offences which are excluded from the defence of compulsion provided for
in s. 17 of the Code. In the other offences all persons who have
the capacity to attract criminal liability may commit and be convicted of the
excluded offences. In rape, however, certain persons can be convicted of rape
only as aiders and to exclude from the defence all those who in law could be
guilty of and convicted of rape it was necessary to employ the concept of
assisting, as it forms the sole basis of guilt for some persons. There can be
no doubt in my mind that by including a reference to rape in s. 17 of the Code
the Parliamentary intent was to exclude it from the defence. The use of the
words “assisting in rape” was designed to broaden, rather than to restrict the
exclusion, and to bring into the exclusion from the defence those whose
liability depended upon assisting in the commission of rape, as well as the
rapers in fact.

Whatever the rationale behind the use of the
words in the Criminal Code , it is evident that since their introduction
into the Code it has been the view of high legal authority in this
country that the words were broad enough to include rape. In the first edition
of Crankshaw’s Criminal Code (1894), at p. 13, under the heading
“Compulsion by Force”, in a discussion of the effect of the then s. 12,
now s. 17 , the following appears:

Although the law will not excuse the
commission of any of the above excepted offences—such as murder, piracy, rape,
arson—done under cumpulsion [sic] by threats even of immediate
death, it will be different with a person who is not a free agent physically,
but who is subjected—not to threats operating on his mental faculties—but to
actual physical force exercised without or against his consent by a third party
at the time of the act being done.

[Page 552]

These words, or others of similar import,
appeared in subsequent editions of the Code down to the seventh edition
published in 1959, and this fact strengthens my view that the words were
considered to have the effect of excluding rape from the defence of compulsion.

It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider if
there was sufficient evidence of compulsion to leave the case to the jury as,
in my view, it was an error in any event to do so. I would accordingly dismiss
the appeal and confirm the order of the Court of Appeal for a new trial.

Appeal dismissed.

(Defendant) Respondent.

1980: May 13; 1981: March 2.

Present: Martland, Dickson, Beetz, Estey,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Murder—“Unlawful
object”—Defence of drunkenness—Reference to Hansard—Previous Court decision not
to be followed—Criminal Code , ss. 205(5) (a), 212 (a)(i), 212 (a)(ii), 212 (c).

The respondent, a chronic alcoholic, had set
fire to the house where he lived with a friend and her two children. The
children died. In his charge, the trial judge instructed the jury that in view
of the facts adduced in evidence a verdict of murder could, subject to certain
factual determinations by them, be grounded upon ss. 212  (a)(i), 212 (a)(ii)
or 212 (c) of the Criminal Code . The respondent was convicted of murder.
The Court of Appeal for Ontario found no misdirection in law by the judge with
respect to the application of the first two sections but found that the
trial judge had erred in his charge with respect to s. 212 (c) in that he
did not relate the defence of drunkenness to the issue of the respondent’s
knowledge of the surrounding circumstances at the time he did the act and in
that he failed to charge the jury with respect to the onus of proof and the
degree of proof as to the defence of drunkenness. A new trial was ordered.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Dickson, Estey, Mclntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: The first issue turns upon
the determination of the nature, and thereby the delimitation, of what may
constitute an “unlawful object” within the meaning of s. 212 (c). The
other two issues are whether drunkenness may be a defence in relation to an
accused’s knowledge of the surrounding circumstances at the time he did the act
in furtherance of the unlawful object and, if so, the onus and degree of proof
of such a defence.

With respect to the first issue, having
regard to the common law as it existed in 1892 and as it is expressed in the English
Draft Code of 1878 which was, subject to

[Page 470]

few changes, adopted in 1892: (1) in a
prosecution under s. 212 (c), the element of nlawfulness necessary to qualify a
homicide as culpable under s. 205(5) (a) is that which is the result of
the prosecution of the unlawful object by the act which is dangerous to life;
(2) there is no requirement that the dangerous act be itself unlawful; (3) when
the dangerous act is unlawful, the jury must be told, as he was here, that
there must be the prosecution of a further unlawful object clearly distinct
from the immediate object of the dangerous act; (4) the words “unlawful object”
mean the object of conduct which, if prosecuted fully, would amount to a serious
crime, i.e. an indictable offence requiring mens rea.

With respect to the other two issues: (1)
whilst the test under s. 212 (c) is objective and the behaviour of the
accused is to be measured by that of the reasonable man, such a test must
nevertheless be applied having regard, not to the knowledge a reasonable man
would have had of the surrounding circumstances that allegedly made the
accused’s conduct dangerous to life, but to the knowledge the accused had of
those circumstances; (2) drunkenness, though not relevant in the determination
of what a reasonable man, with the knowledge the accused had of those
circumstances, would have anticipated, is relevant in the determination of the
knowledge which the accused had of those circumstances. The decision in Graves
v. The King (1913), 47 S.C.R. 568 is no longer to be followed.

Per Beetz J.:
The Court of Appeal did nor err in holding that the trial judge erred in not
relating drunkenness to the question of whether the appellant had actual
knowledge of the surrounding circumstances which made his conduct likely to
cause death.

Graves v.
The King (1913), 47 S.C.R. 568, not followed; R.
v. Hughes et al., [1942] S.C.R. 517, distinguished; R. v. Tennant

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], allowing the
appeal by the accused from his conviction and ordering a new trial. Appeal
dismissed.

Murray Segal, for the appellant.

Marc Rosenberg, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Dickson, Estey,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

LAMER J.—Though s. 212(c) of the Criminal
Code  (R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34) has been with us since codification in 1892 (it
was then s. 221(d)), the more serious questions as to its
meaning and scope have, save a few exceptions, been raised in the courts below
only recently. We have been told that this may well be explained by the fact
that, on an indictment for murder, counsel for the Crown are more frequently
than in the past, and quite properly so, requesting, when the factual basis of
the case so justifies, that the judge instruct the jury as to the application
of this section in lieu of or subsidiarily to the other murder sections.

Only two cases are to be found in the law
reports where this Court has dealt with the meaning and purview of s. 212 (c)
of the Criminal Code : over 65 years ago, in the case of Graves v. The King[2] and
almost 40 years ago in the case of R. v. Hughes et al.[3]

The three issues raised in this appeal not only
afford but, in my respectful opinion, strongly suggest a reconsideration of how
this Court dealt with those issues in the Graves case.

Section 212 (c) reads as follows:

Culpable homicide is murder

(a)…

(b)…

(c) where a person, for an unlawful object,
does anything that he knows or ought to know is likely to cause death, and
thereby causes death to a human

[Page 472]

being, notwithstanding that he desires to
effect his object without causing death or bodily harm to any human being.

The first issue in this appeal turns upon the
determination of the nature, and thereby the delimitation, of what may
constitute an “unlawful object” within the meaning of s. 212 (c).

The other two issues are whether drunkenness may
be a defence in relation to an accused’s knowledge of the surrounding
circumstances at the time he did the act in furtherance of the unlawful object
and, if so, the onus and degree of proof of such a defence. In fact,
drunkenness raises the more fundamental issue as to whether the test applicable
to the knowledge of the surrounding circumstances is objective (that of the
reasonable man) or subjective.

Respondent was tried and convicted at Hamilton in the Province
 of Ontario by a jury on both
counts of the following indictment:

1. That he on or about the 14th day of March,
1976, at the City of Hamilton, in the Judicial District of Hamilton-Wentworth
did kill Lorna Gilchrist and did thereby commit murder punishable by
imprisonment for life contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

2. That he on or about the 14th day of March,
1976, at the City of Hamilton, in the Judicial District of Hamilton-Wentworth
did kill Allan Gilchrist and did thereby commit murder punishable by
imprisonment for life contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code  of
Canada.

Though the taking of life is always tragic, it
is in this case even more so as the victims are innocent young children in no
way involved in the events that led to the setting fire to the house where they
met death by asphyxiation. Nevertheless, whatever may be the degree of sympathy
one entertains for the victims, Vasil’s guilt must be determined not by the
degree of the innocence of the victims but by the nature or state of mind which
he possessed at the time of the fatal events, which took place during the
evening of Saturday the 13th and in the

[Page 473]

early hours of the morning of the 14th of March,
1976.

Respondent, Vasil, a chronic alcoholic, set fire
to the house where he lived with one Mrs. Gilchrist and her two young
children. He had been living with her since June of 1975.

Prior to these events life had not always been
easy; Vasil, who became unemployed shortly after going to live with
Mrs. Gilchrist, had difficulty accepting the role reversal that resulted
from the fact that, since Mrs. Gilchrist was working steadily, he was
expected to assume many of the domestic responsibilities in the household;
furthermore, he was very sensitive of the fact that Mrs. Gilchrist was
paying for the living and dining room furniture he had purchased in the autumn
of 1975.

Everybody seems to agree that his relationship
with the children was very good. Vasil was violently jealous of his companion
as is borne out by the unfortunate events of this case.

The following narrative by the Crown of the
facts has met, subject to very few qualifications, with the accused’s approval:

The respondent and Mrs. Gilchrist were
invited to a party at the home of Mr. and Mrs. W., in Hamilton, on the evening of Saturday, March 13th, 1976. The respondent
testified that he was not anxious to attend this party, but he acceded to
Mrs. Gilchrist’s wishes to go. The respondent picked up the babysitter, at
8:00 p.m., and they drove to the party at 8:30 p.m., arriving at approximately 8:45 p.m. A playmate of Allan Gilchrist
was present when the babysitter arrived. The respondent testified that before
leaving for the party that evening he had between three and five mixed drinks

…

Upon arriving at the W.’s house party, the
couple sat around and chatted with other guests who were comprised of married
couples. While at the party, the respondent had about 8 or 9 drinks over a
period of 3½ to 4½ hours. The drinks contained one to one and one-half
ounces of liquor each.

At the party, both Mrs. Gilchrist and
the respondent danced with other partners. The respondent became upset with
Mrs. Gilchrist through the course of the evening. He asked her to leave a
few times but she

[Page 474]

wished to remain until the food was served.
He testified that he saw her dancing very closely with another person on one
occasion and was upset because he was unable to locate her from time to time.

At one stage of the party when the
respondent wanted to leave he grabbed Mrs. Gilchrist by the arm and when
she pulled away he slapped her on the face.

The respondent went upstairs and was
followed by Mrs. Gilchrist about five minutes later. He asked her to go
home with him but she refused because he was in a foul mood.
Mrs. Gilchrist asked for her house keys back and the respondent grabbed
her wrist. He left alone.

Approximately one-half hour later, the
respondent returned to the party. Mr. Vasil had a cup of coffee with
Mr. W. and they talked for about one-half of an hour before the respondent
left.

The respondent returned home at 2:10 a.m. and woke the babysitter. He asked the
babysitter whether Mrs. Gilchrist had phoned. She had not. He drove her
home quickly but in a normal manner. She lived five minutes away by car. The
babysitter smelled the odour of alcohol in the car. Before dropping off the
babysitter, the respondent asked her if he had given her enough money. During
the evening he called the W.’s home at least three times, mentioning on one
occasion to Mrs. Gilchrist that he had driven the babysitter home. When
the respondent asked whether Mr. Gilchrist (sic)[4] would come home, she replied that
she would be home shortly. Mrs. Gilchrist feared the respondent that
evening.

What then happens is told us by Vasil. Most of
what he says is corroborated by the material evidence discovered by the firemen
and the investigators, their expert opinion and the results of laboratory
tests.

Vasil went to the basement, opened the freezer,
disconnected it and poured a can of barbecue fluid on the meat in order to
spoil it so that no one else could eat it, for he says he had decided to leave
Mrs. Gilchrist. He then went upstairs and did the same to the kitchen
refrigerator and to its contents. He then says:

I remember being in the living-room of the
house and I had a box of matches in my hand and I thought about the furniture,
that the living-room furniture had been quite a sore spot between the two of
us. It had come up

[Page 475]

in quite a few arguments and I figured if I
marked it in some way so as if she wants to use it she will have to get it
recovered or replaced or whatever rather than just come in and start using it
and I was thinking something about when we purchased the chesterfield and chair
we had paid extra to have it treated against different things and that the,
while looking at the rug I figured it was fire retarded (sic) and
fire proofed and the drapes were the type by looking at them, I’m not sure, but
by looking at them they looked the type that they were non-flammable and I
figured if I threw a match down on the rug I would mark it and would have to be
replaced if she wanted to have a rug there.

He denies having poured fluid in the living room
before striking the matches. An expert witness from the Fire Marshall’s office
who found a can of barbecue fluid near the kitchen refrigerator also found a
can similar in size and shape in the living room beside the front window. It
was totally charred and was without its cap. Though he could not establish
whether that can had contained an accelerant of any type he was of the opinion
that the fire had definitely originated in the living-room and that an
accelerant had been poured on the carpeting and ignited. (See A.C. at p. 226)

Vasil says that the matches he struck did not
set fire but that one of them caused, to use his words, “just a little dot”.
The jury undoubtedly disbelieved him on this point and accepted the expert’s
version of the setting of the fire. They were, I feel, amply justified in doing
so when one considers respondent’s subsequent conduct. Indeed, he went back to
the party.

…He attracted Mrs. Gilchrist’s
attention and endorsed his vehicle Transfer Permit over to her. Mrs. W. recalled
the respondent saying, “I am going to the police station now”.
Mrs. Gilchrist said to the respondent, “…you have done something to my
children” in a very upset voice. Mr. Vasil did not respond. The respondent
called the fire department. Mrs. Gilchrist said to Mrs. W. in the
Respondent’s presence, “Cam, he’s done something, he’s called the fire
department”, to which Mrs. W. responded, “no, he’s only trying to scare
you into going home”. The respondent then said, “Well! if you don’t come home
you won’t have one to go to”, and he walked towards the front door.
Mrs. Gilchrist asked Mrs. W. to

[Page 476]

call a taxi because she wanted to go home,
and the respondent said to her, “you rotten bitch, you are too fucking late”.
He drove off from the party alone to the police station.

…

The next thing the respondent recalled
after leaving the party was being at the intersection of East 23rd and
Fennell Streets, from where he could see the fire. He walked into the station
at approximately 5:00 a.m.,
threw his keys onto the counter, and said to Police Constable Patterson, the
station duty officer, “I am the guy you are looking for. I lit the fire”.
Police Constable Patterson asked, “What?” and the respondent responded, “I lit
the fire on East 23rd Street”.
At this point Police Constable Balnaves approached the respondent and cautioned
him, then escorted him into the Sergeant’s room. Police Constable Balnaves
asked if there was anybody at the house and the respondent replied, “Yes,
Lorna, 6 years, and Allan, 9 years. I took the babysitter home and went back to
the house. I opened the fridge and the freezer and poured barbecue fluid over
everything and set it alight. I drove around the block several times to make
sure it was going good, that the windows had a red glow”…

A half hour later he made another statement to
two police sergeants saying: “What’s to say. I lit it” and then added:

The only way I felt I could get back was to
do something physical. I went back to the house from the party and called her
several times. She said she would leave when she felt like it. I figured “You
bitch. I would fucking well fix you”. I unplugged the fridge and freezer and
soaked them with barbecue fluid. I threw a match on it between the hall and the
living-room. I left and drove around. I went back to the house where the party
was at and talked to her again. Then I went to the Mountain Police Station.

Up till that point he had been cautioned that he
was being charged with setting the fire. When at 6 a.m. the police, who by then
had found out that two bodies had been discovered in the house, informed him
that he was being charged with two counts of murder and cautioned him anew,
respondent became visibly upset and said: “I want to die. Tell me it isn’t
true. Charge me with murder. Oh my God, no, over a stupid argument. Oh my God,
I can’t face Lorna. Please tell me it

[Page 477]

isn’t true”. He then telephoned his brother to
whom he said: “I am charged with murder. I torched the house. Unfortunately the
kids were inside”. A while later, one of the sergeants asked him where he had
sprinkled the fluid to which he replied: “In the basement, in the freezer and
in the living room and on the sofa and rug”.

A little over an hour later, he made a statement
which was typed by one of the sergeants and that he then signed. In this
statement he said:

…I went back to 375
 East 23rd Street called her again and she said the
same thing and that’s when I figured I would ruin a couple of things around the
house. I unplugged the refrigerator and the freezer so the food would thaw out.
I poured the liquid on it so it would spoil and not be used. Question. What
kind of fluid? Answer. Barbecue fluid. Question. Where did you get the fluid?
Answer. In the basement. There was a box of matches sitting with the barbecue fluid.
I threw a part can in the living-room. I struck a match and threw it. I threw a
couple more which both went out. I dropped one on the rug about the size of a
dime which did not go out. I left the house and went around the block a few
times, then I went back to W.’s and asked her to go home and she said no. I
said will you please come home, if you don’t come home you won’t have a home to
go to. She wouldn’t go so I left I drove down Fennell looked up 23rd Street and
saw the flames, I then drove to the police station on Upper Wellington Street
in a hurry. I went in and told an officer I set the fire on 23rd Street. Question. Did you know anyone
was in the house when you set the fire? Answer. It never even registered. If I
had thought the children were in I never would have done it in the first place.
…

In his charge the judge instructed the jury that
in view of the facts adduced in evidence a verdict of murder could, subject to
certain factual determinations by them, be grounded upon ss. 212 (a)(i),
212 (a)(ii) or 212 (c) of the Criminal Code . The Court of Appeal
for Ontario found no
misdirection in law by the judge with respect to

[Page 478]

the application of ss. 212 (a) (i)
and (ii) of the Criminal Code  but found that the trial judge had erred
in his charge with respect to s. 212 (c) in two ways, in that he:

did not relate the defence of drunkenness
to the issue of the appellant’s knowledge of the surrounding circumstances at
the time he did the act in furtherance of the unlawful object…

and in that he:

failed to charge the jury with respect to
the onus of proof and the degree of proof as to the defence of drunkenness.

The accused had raised before the Ontario Court
of Appeal another ground to the effect that in any event, in view of the facts
adduced in evidence, the judge should not have left s. 212 (c) to the
jury as a possible basis for a verdict of murder. The Court of Appeal chose not
to deal with the arguments advanced by appellant in support of this ground.
Accused, now the respondent, again raises that ground before us.

In my opinion the trial judge was right in
leaving the case to the jury on the basis of para, (c) of s. 212 ;
however, since I agree with the Ontario Court of Appeal’s disposition of this
appeal and would order a new trial, I think it desirable that something be said
on the matter.

More specifically, respondent argues that the
judge erred when he directed that s. 212 (c) could apply to the case at
bar, and in saying “that the unlawful object” alleged by the Crown was to “seek
revenge and destroy property” and the “unlawful act” was “setting fire to the
house…”. On this point respondent argues:

1. It is respectfully submitted that the
“unlawful act” in s. 205(5) (a) which makes homicide culpable and which
is the foundation for murder in s. 212  and the equivalent of the “anything” in
s. 212 (c) must be distinct from and different than the “unlawful object” in s.
212 (c). Otherwise the subjective basis for liability in s. 212 (a) is
converted, in every case, to the objective liability of s. 212 (c).

[Page 479]

2. Further, it is respectfully submitted
that the distinction between the unlawful object and the unlawful act should be
sufficiently distinct to avoid criminal negligence causing death (manslaughter,
Code s. 25(5)(b)) being converted into murder in every case.

3. Finally, it is respectfully submitted
that “revenge” could not constitute the unlawful object. Revenge is not itself
unlawful it is merely the motive for (sic) commission of the
offence and circumstantial evidence from which the requisite intent could be
inferred. If revenge were a sufficient unlawful object for the purpose of s.
212 (c) then any killing for which the accused had a motive, such as
jealousy or revenge, would be murder without necessity of proving the intent
required by s. 212 (a). This would reserve s. 212 (a) for only those extremely
rare cases where there was no motive for the killing.

In his charge, the trial judge, who had
explained to the jurors what was homicide and what made it culpable, read s.
212 (c) and then said:

…With that (sic) object did
he light the fire and, secondly, did he know or ought he to have known that it
was likely to cause death. With what object did he light the fire; did he know
or ought he to have known that it was likely to cause death. Now as to the
first, I instruct you that generally it is unlawful to set fire to a building
or do anything that is likely to set fire to a building to spite another. In
the circumstances here, it is for you to determine that he set the fire with an
unlawful object; but the only lawful object that might appear is, if you accept
his evidence that all he was doing was marking his own rug and furniture to
spite Mrs. Gilchrist, or if you find that such evidence created a
reasonable doubt in your mind about his unlawful object. If that is the
situation, you cannot find him guilty of murder under Section 212 (c).
Now it is for you to determine but, I feel I should state my opinion on this
issue. I find it hard to come to any conclusion but that he was doing what he
did when he threw the fluid and the matches and did the other things in the
house that he did, that he was doing it for anything but an unlawful object,
but I am leaving it to you and my opinion should not determine yours.

[Page 480]

After the jury retired, the judge, at the
Crown’s request, agreed to give further instructions on the matter in the
following terms:

…Now I think I should make it clear that
the position of the crown and, is this with regard to two important matters
involved in murder as it is before you. First, that in this case the unlawful
object that the crown points to was to seek revenge and destroy property, and
that the unlawful act was setting the fire; and that if you go back to your
definitions you come to the proposition that if someone causes the death of
another by an unlawful act that is manslaughter; but if they have an unlawful
object and ought to have known that what they were doing was causing death then
that is murder under Section 212 (c). So the unlawful act is
necessary to the homicide, and the crown says that is setting the fire; and in
almost every case that I can think of, except a very, very narrow one if you
choose to find it on the facts, setting the fire is an unlawful act in these
circumstances; and the unlawful object to seek revenge and destroy property is
what has been put before you in the evidence, and it is that that the crown
rely on.

An hour or so later, the jury asked to be
instructed anew in regard to s. 212 (c). In complying with their request,
the judge told them:

Now culpable homicide is causing the death
of a human being by means of an unlawful act and this provides that, where the
death of a human being has been caused by an unlawful act, which the crown says
here was setting fire to the house, that if that were done for an unlawful
object, which the crown says here is to seek revenge and to destroy property,
then if the accused knows or ought to have known that it was likely to cause
death and death is caused, then that is murder…

…

…And, if here you find that there was an
unlawful object, and there was an unlawful act that caused death but you are in
doubt as to whether he knew or ought to have known that it was likely to cause
death, then you should find him guilty of manslaughter; …

Sections 205  and 212  of the Criminal
Code  read as follows:

[Page 481]

205. (1) A
person commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes
the death of a human being.

(2) Homicide is culpable or not culpable.

(3) Homicide that is not culpable is not an
offence.

(4) Culpable homicide is murder or
manslaughter or infanticide.

(5) A person commits culpable homicide when
he causes the death of a human being,

(a) by means of an unlawful
act,

(b) by criminal negligence,

(c) by causing that human
being, by threats or fear of violence or by deception,_to do anything that
causes his death, or

(d) by wilfully frightening
that human being, in the case of a child or sick person.

(6) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, a person does not commit homicide within the meaning of this Act by
reason only that he causes the death of a human being by procuring, by false
evidence, the conviction and death of that human being by sentence of the law.
1953-54, c. 51, s. 194.

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

(a) where the person who
causes the death of a human being

(i) means to cause his death, or

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or
not;

(b) where a person, meaning
to cause death to a human being or meaning to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and being reckless whether death ensues or
not, by accident or mistake causes death to another human being,
notwithstanding that he does not mean to cause death or bodily harm to that human
being; or

(c) where a person, for an
unlawful object, does anything that he knows or ought to know is likely to
cause death, and thereby causes death to a human being, notwithstanding that he
desires to effect his object without causing death or bodily harm to any human
being. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 201.

[Page 482]

It is argued that the trial judge left the jury
with the impression that “seeking revenge” could be an “unlawful object”, or
part thereof, as that expression is meant in s. 212 (c). True he did not
directly tell them so; but not having clearly told them what he thought could
be an unlawful object, he then said that, according to the Crown, seeking
revenge and destroying property could be such an unlawful object. This, in my
opinion, does not, given the circumstances of this case, amount to a
misdirection which would warrant the ordering of a new trial. Before giving my
reasons for this conclusion, I think it appropriate that a digression be made
to deal with what appears to be a misinterpretation of the relation between ss.
212 (c) and 205(5) (a) which, though of little consequence in this
case given its particular set of facts, could in others become the source of
great confusion.

In his charge to the jury the trial judge said
that, in order to comply with the requirement of an unlawful act so that the
homicide be culpable under s. 205(5) (a), there must be under s. 212 (c)
an unlawful act causing death and a further unlawful object. This
interpretation of the law appears to have been shared by appellant and
respondent. This is, in my opinion, wrong.

Section 205(5)  contains within its four
corners by virtue of subs. (4) all possible forms of murder, manslaughter and
infanticide, and is not merely a definition of manslaughter. When considering
s. 205(5) (a), it appears that what distinguishes murder from
manslaughter is the nature of the unlawful act causing death and the
circumstances under which that unlawful act was committed. True those
circumstances may well amount to the commission of other unlawful acts;
however, it is not the unlawfulness of those acts that makes that culpable
homicide murder, but the aggravated nature of the mental element those acts
import into the events.

Under s. 212(c), there is no requirement that
the dangerous act be itself unlawful, though, because it is dangerous to life,
it usually is. The

[Page 483]

unlawful act that must be found under s. 212(c)
in order to meet the requisite unlawfulness to qualify that homicide as being
culpable under s. 205(5) (a) is that which is the result of the
prosecution of the unlawful object by the dangerous act. To require an unlawful
act to meet the requirement of s. 205(5) (a) and then a further unlawful
object so that that culpable homicide be murder is wrong. I agree that if de
facto the dangerous act is itself unlawful, as in the case at bar, the jury
must then be told, as the trial judge did, that there must be the prosecution
of a further unlawful object, clearly distinct from the immediate object of the
dangerous (unlawful) act; but this is so not because the latter is the unlawful
act of s. 205(5) (a) and the former the unlawful object of s. 212(c), as
suggested by the trial judge, but because dangerous conduct causing death to
become the basis for a finding of murder must meet the test set out in ss. 212(a)
or (b) and not merely that of s. 212(c). This is not to
say that the usual unlawfulness of the dangerous act cannot be the unlawful act
of s. 205(5) (a) that renders that homicide culpable when considering
manslaughter, but only that the unlawfulness of its object, since all acts
have an object, cannot be the “unlawful object” when seeking to apply s. 212(c)
to a set of facts. (See the opinions of Martin J.A. in the case of R. v.
Tennant and Naccarato[5]; Zuber
J.A. in R. v. DeWolfe[6] and
those of North P. J.A. in Downey v. The Queen[7].

In the case at bar, when considering the charge
as a whole, it appears that in view of the unlawfulness of the alleged
dangerous conduct (which I discuss later on) the jury was properly directed as
to the requirement of a distinct unlawful object though wrongly so as to the
reasons for that requirement. But as I said, given the facts of this case, this
misdirection as to the unlawful act of s. 205(5) (a) was in my opinion of
no practical or meaningful consequence.

[Page 484]

Now to return to the judge’s charge relating to
the meaning of “unlawful object” as that is contained in s. 212(c).

Let it be said right now that, in my opinion the
“unlawful object” contemplated by Parliament in that section is that
which, if prosecuted fully, would amount to an indictable offence requiring mens
rea.

At the time Canada enacted its first Criminal
Code  (1892), both murder and manslaughter were the killing of a person by,
amongst other means, an unlawful act, and this was codified in s. 220 , now s.
205(5) (a). Murder and manslaughter were, because of the unlawful act,
both culpable homicides. What made one but manslaughter and aggravated the
other to make it murder was the presence or absence of malice aforethought on
the part of him who committed that unlawful act. Culpable homicide, i.e.
the killing by an unlawful act, without malice aforethought was
manslaughter, but, done with malice aforethought, was murder. Malice
aforethought was either express or implied by law. Express malice was present
when the purpose of the accused was to deprive another (not necessarily the
actual victim) of life or to cause grievous bodily harm to that person.
Sections 212 (a) and (b) of today’s Criminal Code  are
a codification of what was then the common law as it related to express malice
aforethought. As for implied malice aforethought, Halsbury’s Laws of
England, vol. 9, (1st ed.), 1909, describes it as follows (at p. 573):

1163. Malice aforethought is implied by law
(1) where the person killed is an officer of the law legally arresting or
imprisoning the accused or executing other process of

[Page 485]

law in a legal manner; (2) where, although
there may have been provocation, such provocation has not been sufficient to
reduce the offence to manslaughter; (3) where the killing has been caused by
the accused while he was committing some other felony. [The underlining is
mine]

Then in section 1171 (at p. 579):

1171. Where a person whilst
committing or attempting to commit a felony does an act which is known to be
dangerous to life and likely in itself to cause death, and the death of another
person results as a consequence of that act though not intended by the person
committing it, the law implies malice aforethought, and the person causing the
death is guilty of murder. [The underlining is mine]

A reading of these passages would quite
naturally suggest that there had to exist the commission of, or an attempt to
commit, an offence which in itself was a felony and that that be so without the
import of any unlawfulness that the dangerous act might offer. But doubt is
cast on this interpretation when one reads Humphreys J.’s description of the
common law in Larkin v. The King[8],
which was subsequently referred to and approved by the House of Lords in D.P.P.
v. Newbury[9] (H.L.),
as being “an admirably clear statement of the law”, where Humphreys J. said (at
p. 23 et seq.):

Perhaps it is well once more to state the
proposition of law which has been stated by Judges for generations and, so far
as we are aware, never disputed or doubted. If a person is engaged in doing a
lawful act, and in the course of doing that lawful act behaves so negligently
as to cause the death of some other person, then it is for the jury to say,
upon a consideration of the whole of the facts of the case, whether the
negligence proved against the accused person amounts to manslaughter, and it is
the duty of the presiding Judge to tell them that it will not amount to
manslaughter unless the negligence is of a very high degree. The expression most
commonly used is “unless it shows the accused person to have been reckless as
to the consequences of the act”. That is the law where the act is lawful. Where
the act which a person is engaged in performing is unlawful, then if at the
same time it is a dangerous act, that is, an act which is likely to injure
another person, and quite inadvertently the doer of the act causes the death of
that other person by

[Page 486]

that act, then he is guilty of
manslaughter. If, in doing that dangerous and unlawful act, he is doing an
act which amounts to a felony, he is guilty of murder and he is equally
guilty of murder if he does the act with the intention of causing grievous
bodily harm to the person whom in fact he kills.… [The underlining is mine]

Thus it would appear that, under the common law,
the felony could be the result of the aggravation of an unlawful, but less than
felonious, act by the dangerous conduct.

Be that as it may, it appears that s. 174(d)
of the English Draft Code was, save the doing away with the
reference to “a felony”, an attempt at codifying, if not the common law of the
day, at least what Stephen J. said it was (which was different from what he
thought it should be—see his History of the Criminal Law, vol. III,
1883, at pp. 23-87 and his Digest) and what Halsbury says was the
modern rule at the time (see Halsbury, The Laws of England, vol. 9, (1st
ed.), 1909, at p. 579 [fn. (h)]) and which he explained to the jury in the Serné
case (R. v. Serné and another[10]), in the following way (at p. 313):

“I think that, instead of saying that any
act done with intent to commit a felony and which causes death amounts to
murder, it would be reasonable to say that any act known to be dangerous to
life, and likely in itself to cause death done for the purpose of committing
a felony which caused death, should be murder. [The underlining is mine]

Indeed s. 174(d) of the English
Draft Code reads:

174.
Culpable homicide is murder in each of the following cases:

(a)…

(b)…

(c)…

(d) If the offender, for any
unlawful object, does an act which he knows or ought to have known to be likely
to cause death, and thereby kills any person, though he may have desired that
his object should be effected without hurting any one.

[Page 487]

Reference to Hansard is not usually advisable.
However, as Canada has, at the time of codification, subject to few changes,
adopted the English Draft Code of 1878, it is relevant to know whether
Canada did so in relation to the various sections for the reasons advanced
by the English Commissioners or for reasons of its own.

Indeed, a reading of Sir John Thompson’s
comments in Hansard of April 12, 1892, (House of Commons Debates, Dominion of
Canada, Session 1892, vol. I, at pp. 1378-85) very clearly confirms that all
that relates to murder was taken directly from the English Draft Code of
1878. Sir John Thompson explained the proposed murder sections by
frequently quoting verbatim the reasons given by the Royal Commissioners in
Great Britain, and it is evident that Canada adopted not only the British
Commissioners’ proposed sections but also their reasons.

The British Commissioners had suggested doing
away with the expression “malice” because, they said, “there is a considerable
difference between its popular and its legal meaning” and with “malice aforethought”
in reference to murder because it had received, they said, “judicial
interpretation which makes its use positively misleading”. As for the word
“felony”, they had this to say (at p. 14):

The distinction between felony and
misdemeanour was, in early times, nearly, though not absolutely, identical with
the distinction between crimes punishable with death and crimes not so
punishable. For a long time past this has ceased to be the case. Most felonies
are no longer punishable with death and many misdemeanours are now punishable
more severely than many felonies. The great changes which have taken place in
our criminal law have made the distinctions nearly if not altogether unmeaning.
It is impossible to say on what principle embezzlement should be a felony, and
the fraudulent misappropriation of money by an agent or the obtaining of goods
by false pretense a mis-demeanour; why bigamy should be a felony, and perjury a
misdemeanour; why child-stealing be a felony, and abduction a misdemeanour. The
result of this arbitrary classification is that the right to be bailed, the
liability to be arrested without warrant, and, to a certain extent, the right
of the court to order the payment of the costs

[Page 488]

of prosecutions vary in a manner equally
arbitrary and unreasonable.

It was precisely this passage of the British
Commissioners’ report that was quoted to Parliament by Sir John Thompson as the
reason for abolishing the use of the word “felony” throughout the Code, no
other particular reasons being offered for its being abolished in s. 221(d)
(now s. 212(c)).

Some have suggested that the meaning of
“unlawful object” should be determined in the light of the following passage of
what the Commissioners said in their Report:

For practical purposes we can make no
distinction between a man who shoots another through the head expressly meaning
to kill him, a man who strikes another a violent blow with a sword, careless
whether he dies of it or not, and a man who, intending for some object of his
own, to stop the passage of a railway train, contrives an explosion of
gunpowder or dynamite under the engine, hoping indeed that death may not be
caused, but determined to effect his purpose whether it is so caused or not.

(This passage can be found in Crankshaw’s first
edition of 1894, Criminal Code  of Canada, at p. 140.) Some might find in
that passage of the report an indication that the Commissioners intended to
include, as being an unlawful object for their proposed murder section,
endeavours such as those that would qualify as unlawful when considering
conspiracy for an unlawful purpose (s. 423(2) ) (those words have been recently
interpreted in Gralewicz et al. v. The Queen[11], where a majority of this Court decided
that “unlawful purpose” means contrary to law, that is prohibited by federal or
provincial legislation), or, if not to that extent, at least as an indication
that the unlawful conduct need not be a crime.

This, I submit, would be overlooking the fact
that in 1878 unlawfully obstructing a railway train was very serious, was
punishable by two years at hard labour, and, if done maliciously (i.e. an
act done mischievously, with an intention to obstruct

[Page 489]

but without the intention of causing injury,
could be malicious—see R. v. Upton and Gutteridge[12]) was then a felony punishable by life
imprisonment. (See ss. 35 and 36 of Malicious Damage Act, 1861 (U.K.),
c. 97.)

If not much can be concluded one way or the
other from that reference to railway trains, a great deal more may from the
fact that throughout their Report no reference was made by the Commissioners to
any sweeping reform of constructive murder such as that resulting from a
departure from the requirement of a felonious endeavour to infer malice
aforethought to the mere requirement of any unlawfulness, as petty as it may
be. Their concern, as the quoted excerpt of their Report indicates, was mainly
with doing away with what had become an irrelevant distinction between felonies
and misdemeanours, and with the use of the words “malice aforethought”; but it
would be, I suggest, unreasonable to conclude from this change of labels that
they intended doing away with the need for “malice” itself and that, as a
result, a verdict of murder be possible in the absence of “wickedness” or
“heinous” conduct on the part of the accused. (See Kenny’s Outlines of
Criminal Law, 1902, at p. 132.)

The requirement for some malice, wickedness or
heinous conduct should logically lead to the conclusion that the unlawful
object contemplated by Parliament in s. 212(c) is that which is a “malum
in se” as distinct from “malum prohibitum”. But what would be
logical is unfortunately impractical. Indeed, whilst Parliament does consider
whether conduct is “malum in se” or not in order to determine whether it
should be repressed through and to what degree by the criminal law or
otherwise, Parliament has chosen not to label offences in that way. As a result
identifying unlawful conduct of s. 212(c) by resorting to that criterion would
require difficult moral judgments and import into the criminal justice system,
at least for

[Page 490]

some time, unpredictability that should,
whenever possible, be avoided.

Under the circumstances, I think it not
unreasonable to recognize that the intent of Parliament in s. 212(c) is
best respected by circumscribing the words “unlawful object” when used in
that murder section as meaning the object of conduct which, if prosecuted
fully, would amount to a serious crime, that is an indictable offence requiring
mens rea.

Applying this interpretation of s. 212(c)
to the present case, the jury had to be told that, if they believed beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused intended to damage the food and furniture,
such an object was an unlawful object; indeed, the fact that
Mrs. Gilchrist was sharing in the cost of the furniture is not contested
and as a result the wilful destruction, damaging, obstruction, interference
with that property is mischief, an indictable mens rea offence. As for
the dangerous act, it would have been sufficient that they be told that it could
be the resorting to the use of fire as a means of prosecuting the unlawful
object (the destruction of the furniture), without any need to refer to the
fact that setting the fire under those circumstances was also in itself an
unlawful act.

The trial judge by telling the jury that the
destruction of the property that was in the house could be such an unlawful
object was not, in view of the circumstances of this case, misdirecting them.
The fact that he added “seeking revenge” not as an alternative but in addition
to the destruction of property was a misdirection favourable to the accused and
cannot be relied on by him to ask for a new trial.

Let us now deal with the Crown’s grounds
relating to drunkenness.

As I said earlier, the Court of Appeal for
Ontario found misdirection in the trial judge’s

[Page 491]

charge to the jury as regards drunkenness in
that he

1. did not relate drunkenness to the issue
of the accused’s knowledge of the surrounding circumstances at the time he did
the act in furtherance of the unlawful object;…

2. did not charge the jury with respect to
the onus and degree of proof as to the defence of drunkenness.

Appellant says that the Court of Appeal for
Ontario erred in so finding.

We need not deal at any length with the latter
of those grounds. The judge had charged the jury and then recharged them at
counsel’s request. Appellant is not suggesting that the judge adequately
charged the jury as to drunkenness in the course of the second charge, but
argues that the judge having adequately done so in the course of the main
charge, his omission in the course of the recharge did not constitute an error
in law. As I have come to the conclusion that a new trial should be ordered for
other reasons, the question whether the judge’s main charge to the jury was
adequate or not as regards the onus and degree of proof as to the defence of
drunkenness, and whether, assuming it were so, he needed or not under the
particular circumstances of this case to repeat those instructions to the jury,
need not be decided. I think it sufficient to say that, considering my
conclusion as to the other ground and assuming that the evidence adduced at
that new trial remains substantially the same, the requirement for proper
instructions as regards the onus and degree of proof[13] as to the defence of drunkenness would be
met by, using the words of the Ontario Court of Appeal, telling the jury that:

…if at the end of all of the evidence they had a
reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant by reason of his consumption of
alcohol had the intention to carry out the unlawful object or had the knowledge
of the circumstances which would make his act such that it was likely to cause
death, then he was not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

[Page 492]

Now, to consider the remaining ground of appeal.
In the course of his charge, the judge, dealing with the words “knows or ought
to know” of s. 212(c) told the jury the following:

…Now ought to know in this section is
judged by the standard of whether a reasonable person with knowledge of the
surrounding circumstances which make the situation dangerous to life should
have foreseen that it was likely to cause death. What would a reasonable
person, which is an ideal person in the community, not necessarily any one of
us, but what we think that a reasonable, prudent, responsible person in our
society, who knew the surrounding circumstances rendering the situation
dangerous, what would they have foreseen. Would they have foreseen that it
was likely to cause death. … [The underlining is mine]

The judge then dealt with the issue of
drunkenness in his charge and in his recharge:

…Now the theory of the defence is that the
accused’s evidence before you is the true version, that it was an accident,
that he only meant to mark the rug and furniture, that he was provoked, and
that by reason of shock and drunkenness he could not have the intent necessary
for his conviction for murder—intent or knowledge necessary for his conviction
of murder…

…

Now so far as shock and drunkenness are
concerned, they’re not a defence, because drunk and shocked people are not at
liberty to kill their fellow human beings; but they’re only evidence from which
you may infer that the accused did not have the necessary intent. If he did
not, then what would otherwise be murder is manslaughter and if the deaths were
caused—it is manslaughter if the deaths were caused by the accused’s unlawful
act.

Now the evidence as to drunkenness is only
the number of drinks he had at the party. Gary Herlick, the bar tender, said it
was approximately eight to nine. Mrs. Gilchrist said he had about four
before he hit her and more after. Mrs. W. said he was not intoxicated at
all. Mr. W. said he didn’t think he was drunk. Herlick thought him sober,
as did the police. You are to decide, was he drunk enough not to form the
intent to kill or not to have an unlawful object. If you find he was that
drunk or have a reasonable doubt of it, he can only be guilty of manslaughter,
but I suggest that if you accept the evidence of the police officers you will
have very

[Page 493]

little doubt as to the degree of sobriety,
but it is for you alone to decide.

…

Now with regard to drunkenness, I think I
should read to you a proposition of law that—I hesitate to say that it explains
more clearly what I was trying to say to you, but it explains in other language
what I was trying to say to you, the evidence, that evidence of drunkenness
falling short of incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to
constitute the crime and merely establishing that his mind was so affected by
drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion does not
displace or weaken an inference already drawn that he intended the natural
consequences of his acts. And my interpretation of that is that it is only, if
you find he was drunk on the evidence that is before you, that only affects his
criminal liability if you find that he was so incapable that he could not form
the intent necessary to constitute the crime. And if you do find that he was
drunk, then he is guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. That’s all then,
if you will return to your jury room. [The underlining is mine]

The fact that the judge did not relate
drunkenness to the accused’s knowledge of the surrounding circumstances is not
in dispute. Though he recognized, rightly so in my opinion, the prerequisite
that the reasonable man have knowledge of the surrounding circumstances, a
careful reading of his charge leaves it unclear whether he was telling the jury
that the behaviour of the accused had to be measured by that of “the reasonable
man” in the light of the accused’s “knowledge of the surrounding circumstances”
or in the light of the knowledge a reasonable man would have had of those
circumstances. Be that as it may, it is clear that the judge limited the
relevancy of drunkenness to “the intent to kill” and to that of having “an
unlawful object”.

Whether the trial judge was or was not in error
in failing to relate drunkenness to the accused’s knowledge of the
surrounding circumstances is dependent upon whether the test under s. 212(c)
is, given the circumstances of the case at bar, one or the other of the
following:

[Page 494]

did the accused know of the children’s
presence upstairs and if so, would a reasonable man have known that setting
fire was likely to cause their death

or

would a reasonable man (i.e. given
the circumstances of this case, a sober man) have known that the children were
upstairs and, if so, would he have known that setting the fire was likely to
cause their death.

It is clear that, whilst drunkenness of the
accused is of no relevance under the latter interpretation of s. 212(c), it is
under the former.

A mere reading of s. 212(c) is of little
help in determining whether Parliament intended, once a person is prosecuting
an unlawful object, that all of that person’s behaviour be measured by a purely
objective standard or whether that objective standard be restricted to
measuring, when considering murder, his morality in relation to a
factual situation of which he is conscious. Faced with the problem in the case
at bar, the Court of Appeal for Ontario followed one of its previous decisions,
that in the case of R. v. Tennant and Naccarato, supra.

In that case that Court had this to say (at pp.
90-91):

Where the provisions of s. 212(c)
are applicable, the words “ought to know” impose liability for murder where
death is unlawfully caused by conduct which a reasonable person, with knowledge
of the surrounding circumstances which make such conduct dangerous to life,
should have foreseen was likely to cause death.

…

…We have already pointed out, however, that
even under s. 212(c), the offender’s liability for murder depends upon his
knowledge of the surrounding circumstances which make the conduct in question
dangerous to life, for example, his knowledge that a pistol which he is
brandishing is loaded, or his knowledge of the presence or probable presence of
persons in a house to which he sets fire. (Holmes, The Common Law, pp. 52-7;
Molleur v. The King (1948), 93 C.C.C. 36, 6 C.R. 375, (1948) Que.
K.B. 406n.)

Where liability is imposed on a subjective
basis, what a reasonable man ought to have anticipated is merely evidence from
which a conclusion may be drawn that

[Page 495]

the accused anticipated the same
consequences. On the other hand, where the test is objective, what a reasonable
man should have anticipated constitutes the basis of liability.

The distinction between the imposition of
liability on an objective basis rather than on a subjective basis assumes
particular importance under s. 212(c), where the accused by reason of
intoxication or even stupidity did not in fact foresee the likelihood that his
conduct would cause death.

If the accused had the capacity to form the
intent necessary for the unlawful object and had knowledge of the relevant
facts which made his conduct such as to be likely to cause death, he is guilty
of murder if a reasonable man should have anticipated that such conduct was
likely to cause death. What the accused ought to have foreseen is judged under
s. 212(c) by the standard of the reasonable man.

It follows that the defence of drunkenness
is only relevant under s. 212(c) in relation to whether the accused had the
intent necessary to constitute the unlawful purpose alleged and had knowledge
of the relevant circumstances. …

Holmes J. in The Common Law, 1881,
defined “foresight of consequences” as being (at pp. 45 and 47):

…a picture of a future state of things
called up by knowledge of the present state of things, the future being
viewed as standing to the present in the relation of effect to cause. Again, we
must seek a reduction to lower terms. If the known present state of things
is such that the act done will very certainly cause death, and the
probability is a matter of common knowledge, one who does the act, knowing
the present state of things, is guilty of murder, and the law will not
inquire whether he did actually foresee the consequences or not. The test of
foresight is not what this very criminal foresaw, but what a man of reasonable
prudence would have foreseen…

…

But furthermore, on the same principle, the
danger which in fact exists under the known circumstances ought to be of a
class which a man of reasonable prudence could foresee. Ignorance of a fact and
inability to foresee a consequence have the same effect on blameworthiness. If
a consequence cannot be foreseen, it cannot be avoided. But there is this
practical difference, that whereas, in most cases, the question of knowledge is
a question of the actual condition of the defendant’s consciousness, the question
of what he might have fore-

[Page 496]

seen is determined by the standard of the
prudent man, that is, by general experience. [The underlining is mine]

With this, and with what the Court of Appeal for
Ontario said, I agree.[14]

Faced with a text that lends itself to two
interpretations one must search for Parliament’s intent at the time of its
enactment. I take the liberty of repeating that this text is that of a murder
section, essentially a crime of intent, of malice aforethought, the result of
“wickedness” and “heinous conduct” (Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal Law—supra).
In deciding what would be the more appropriate of the two possible
interpretations this I think should be borne in mind. To interpret the
section of the Code as is suggested by the Crown could result in a
conviction for murder of him whose sole malice would be that of the “unlawful
object” coupled to that of getting drunk.

When s. 212(c) includes amongst the guilty even
one who “desires to effect his object without causing death or bodily harm to
any human being”, reference is being made to one who consciously takes a
chance with the life of others by choosing a dangerous means to an unlawful
end; but Parliament could not, in my opinion, have intended to include one who
could not even realize he was taking such a chance with the life of others
because he could not, given his ignorance of the surrounding
circumstances, even foresee the dangerousness of those means.

Appellant has argued that the question was
decided by this Court in two cases: R. v. Hughes, supra, and Graves
v. The King, supra.

[Page 497]

Hughes was convicted of the murder of someone he
shot in the course of a hold up. The shooting took place either during or
immediately after a struggle between Hughes and his victim, one Yoshyuki Uno.
The majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia had held that it was
open to the jury to bring in a verdict of manslaughter if they found that the
gun went off by accident. On an appeal by the Crown to this Court, Sir Lyman P.
Duff C.J.C. speaking for the Court said (at p. 522):

I think I ought to say now, in the clearest
terms, that, in my opinion, even if the jury thought the pistol went off by
accident (or were not satisfied that it did not go off in that manner) they
might still have properly found a verdict of murder under these
sections if they were satisfied that the conduct of the accused was such
that he ought to have known it to be likely to induce such a struggle as that
which actually occurred, and that somebody’s death was likely to be caused
thereby and that such was the actual effect of his conduct and of the struggle.

[In] his judgment, delivered on behalf of
the majority of the Court, in Graves v. The King, [(1913), 9
D.L.R. 589 at p. 597, 21 Can. C.C. 44 at p. 55, 47 S.C.R. 568 at p. 583] Anglin
J. (as he then was) says:—”For the purposes of this appeal I assume that under
this provision it was not necessary, in order to bring the charge of culpable
homicide within it, that the jury should have found that the acts of the defendants
were such as they knew or should have known were likely to cause the very acts
to be done or the precise situation to arise which in fact resulted in the
homicide, or to cause the death of the person who was killed, but that it would
suffice if the jury had found that the accused did an act which they knew or
should have known would be likely to induce the doing of anything or to bring
about any situation likely to cause the death of some person—the person killed
or any other person.”

I think this passage ought to be accepted
as stating the law as it is, not merely as it is assumed to be. To repeat, I
think the act of Yoshyuki in attempting to disarm Hughes and the ensuing
struggle were so clearly the natural and ordinary consequences of Hughes’ conduct
that the jury might well, as reasonable men, have inferred that Hughes ought to
have anticipated some

[Page 498]

such occurrence and the probable
involuntary discharge of the pistol as a natural incident of the occurrence;…

I do not find in these comments any foreclosure
to my interpretation of s. 212(c). Indeed, Hughes’ gun was loaded, and
there is no suggestion that he claimed he did not know it to be so. His
knowledge of the surrounding circumstances which made his conduct dangerous to
life, that is the use of a loaded gun, was not in issue in that case.

Appellant is on much better ground when relying
on this Court’s decision in Graves,

Fred, Alfred and Harry Graves trespassed on one
Kenneth Lea’s property, caused a disturbance, insulted Lea and twice did not
heed his warnings to leave the premises. When Lea then appeared with a gun they
rushed him. Lea in using his gun as a club to ward off his attackers
accidentally shot himself and died shortly after.

There was evidence of their maltreating him after
the discharge of his gun; this raised the issue whether his death was the
result of the gun wound, the subsequent maltreatment or the cumulation of both.
For the purpose of deciding the case at bar, this aspect of the Graves case
is of no interest.

The trial judge had told the jury that if the
accused were actuated by spite or ill will towards the victim they should as a
result of necessity be found guilty of murder. This was evidently much too
encompassing an interpretation of the murder sections. As the trial judge had
not instructed the jury as to the applicability to the facts of the case of s. 259(d)
(now s. 212(c)), Anglin J. speaking for the majority of the Court, having
said what Sir Lyman P. Duff C.J.C. quoted in the Hughes case (supra),
then went on to say (at p. 586):

The vital distinction—that, while, to
sustain a charge of manslaughter, it would suffice that the acts of the
accused, whatever their character, should in fact have

[Page 499]

aroused in the mind of the deceased a fear
of violence which induced him to do that which resulted in his death
(section 252(2)), in order that that culpable homicide should amount to
murder those acts of the accused must have been such that they knew or should
have known that the death of some person would be likely to be caused by them
(section 259(d))—was not brought to the attention of the jury.
Whether the acts of the accused were of that character it was for the jury to
determine; and the inference which they should draw would depend to a great
extent upon whether in their opinion the accused knew or ought to have known
that the gun in the hands of the deceased was loaded and whether they knew or
should have known that their acts would be likely to lead to the deceased
making some use of it which would be likely to cause death. … [The underlining
is mine]

This last passage of his opinion could be argued
as suggesting that this Court decided in Graves that knowledge of the
surrounding circumstances is to be determined by an application of the
objective standard, and that, applying this finding to the present case, there
would as a result be no place for considering drunkenness in appreciating that
knowledge.

If that be the decision, then, with the greatest
of deference, and after having given the matter very careful consideration, I
would feel compelled not to follow that determination in Graves. Whilst
it is impossible to know with any degree of certainty what opinion one would
have advanced as correct had one had to deal with these questions at the time
(1913) they were put to this Court, it is likewise and to the same extent
impossible to know what the judges of this Court in the Graves case
would today decide, offered the same opportunity to interpret s. 212(c).
Indeed, over 65 years have since elapsed, and the law, specially the criminal
law, and even more so the attitudes of all of those administering it, have
greatly evolved. As an illustration one need but consider the concept of
“technical guilt”, which having over the years been gradually limited by a series
of decisions was finally drastically so by this Court’s decision in R. v.
City of Sault Ste. Marie[15]; or
again consider the

[Page 500]

evolution of the defense of duress from what
this Court decided in Dunbar v. The King[16] to its ruling in Paquette v.
The Queen[17].

For these reasons, I feel that the
interpretation of s. 212(c) as it relates to drunkenness adopted by the
Court of Appeal for Ontario in this case and in that of R. v. Tennant
and Naccarato is much more in harmony with the current attitudes of this
Court in relation to criminal liability than that adopted by this Court in Graves.
The order of the Court of Appeal directing a new trial should stand.

I would summarize my conclusions as to the
interpretation and application of para. 212(c), as follows:

(1) In a prosecution under that paragraph,
the element of unlawfulness necessary to qualify a homicide as culpable under
para. 205(5) (a) is that which is the result of the prosecution of the
unlawful object by the act which is dangerous to life;

(2) There is therefore no requirement that
the dangerous act be itself unlawful (though, because it is dangerous to life,
it usually is);

(3) When, as in this case, the dangerous
act is unlawful, the jury must be told, as the trial judge did, that there must
be the prosecution of a further unlawful object clearly distinct from the
immediate object of the dangerous (unlawful) act;

(4) The words “unlawful object” when used
in paragraph 212(c) mean the object of conduct which, if prosecuted fully,
would amount to a serious crime, that is an indictable offence requiring mens
rea;

(5) Whilst the test under 212(c) is
objective and the behaviour of the accused is to be measured by that of the
reasonable man, such a test must nevertheless be applied having regard, not to
the knowledge a reasonable man would have had of the surrounding circumstances
that allegedly made the accused’s conduct dangerous to life, but to the
knowledge the accused had of those circumstances;

(6) As a result, drunkenness, though not
relevant in the determination of what a reasonable man, with the knowledge the
accused had of those circumstances, would have anticipated, is relevant in the
determination

[Page 501]

of the knowledge which the accused had of
those circumstances.

One last matter must be dealt with.

In its reasons for judgment, the Court of Appeal
for Ontario said:

The Crown’s case was put principally on the
basis of s. 212 (c) of the Criminal Code , although having charged
the jury with respect to 212(a)(i) and (ii), the learned trial judge told them
in his final remarks that the case really didn’t belong under that section, but
rather stood to be decided under s. 212 (c). From what we have heard of
the facts here, we agree with him.

About an hour and a half after the judge’s
recharge, the jury had asked the judge the following question:

JURY FOREMAN: My Lord, would you please
re-read the law, especially on Section (c)?… And enlighten the jury as to
the definition of that.

The judge told them:

Now culpable homicide is causing the death
of a human being by means of an unlawful act and this provides that, where the
death of a human being has been caused by an unlawful act, which the crown says
here was setting fire to the house, that if that were done for an unlawful
object, which the crown says here is to seek revenge and to destroy
property, then if the accused knows or ought to have known that it was
likely to cause death and death is caused, then that is murder. [The
underlining is mine]

I agree with the Court of Appeal for Ontario
that the judge more or less told them that the case stood to be decided under
s. 212 (c). One cannot, however, assume that the jury had in their
deliberations set aside as non-applicable on the facts adduced ss. 212 (a)(i)
and (ii). All one can conclude from their question is that they were unclear as
to the law, mainly under s. 212 (c).

After a careful examination of the Appeal Case
book, I am unable to say that there are no facts upon which it would
necessarily be unreasonable for a jury to find guilt of murder under ss. 212 (a)
(i) or (ii).

[Page 502]

Respondent set fire to the premises upon
returning from driving the babysitter home; Mrs. Gilchrist says that when
she accused respondent when he returned to the party of having done something
to her children, he remained silent. At the police station when he reported the
fire, the police say that, when asked if there was anyone in the house, he told
them: “Yes, Lorna, 6 years, and Allan 9 years.” These facts are a matter for
the jury to consider when assessing if he knew or not that the children were
upstairs at the time of his alleged lighting of the fire and, if they find he
did know, what intent he possessed at that time.

I would therefore not comment on the
applicability of ss. 212 (a)(i) or (ii) one way or the other. In
any event the determination of what sections are to be left to the jury
will be done by the trial judge as required by the facts adduced in evidence at
that new trial.

I would dismiss this appeal.

BEETZ J.—In my opinion, the Court of Appeal for
Ontario did not err in holding that the learned trial judge erred in not
relating drunkenness to the question of whether the respondent had actual
knowledge of the surrounding circumstances which made his conduct likely to
cause death pursuant to s. 212 (c) of the Criminal Code . In this respect,
I agree with my brother Lamer’s summarized conclusions (5) and (6) as well as
with his approval of the interpretation of s. 212 (c), as it relates to
drunkenness, adopted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Tennant
and Naccarato[18].

I also agree that the case was rightly left to
the jury on the basis of paras. (a)(i) and (ii) and (c) of
s. 212 .

Since a new trial has been ordered, it may be
appropriate to express a view on certain related questions. As to these, I
concur in my brother Lamer’s summarized conclusions (1), (2), (3) and (4).

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Convictions for conspiring to
affect public market price of shares—Prosecution evidence by accomplices—Judge
left jurors the option of considering corroborative parts of evidence—Parts
suggested to jurors as corroborative in fact were not corroborative—Error of
law—Section 613(1)(b)(iii) not applicable—New trial ordered—Criminal Code,
R.S.C 1970, c. C-34 as amended, ss. 338(2), 423(1)(d), 613(1)(b)(iii).

Kirsch and Rosenthal were charged with
conspiring to affect the public market price of shares of Buffalo Gas and Oil
Ltd. As the witnesses for the prosecution were accomplices, the judge warned
the jurors against the danger of finding the accused guilty on the basis of
this testimony alone. He told them what parts of the evidence were capable of
constituting corroboration and left them free to find corroboration in other
parts of the evidence. Counsel for the Crown also indicated to the jurors as
being capable of providing corroboration evidence which as a matter of law
could not. Kirsch and Rosenthal were found guilty and appealed. The appeal was
dismissed.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial is ordered.

The trial judge erred in failing to instruct
the jury that the parts of the evidence which counsel for the Crown had
suggested as being capable of providing corroboration in fact could not, and
that they were not entitled to regard them as such. The Court does not think
that this is the kind of error which should be dealt with by resort to
s. 613(1)(b)(iii), as respondent did not demonstrate that without
this error the verdict would of necessity have been the same.

As to whether the judge should tell the
jurors to confine themselves to the corroborative points he had

[Page 441]

indicated to them, the Court was not required
to answer this question for the purposes of this appeal.

English version of the judgment of the Court
delivered by

LAMER J.—The two appellants are challenging by
their appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Quebec, dismissing the appeal brought by them from the verdict of an
assize jury in the judicial district of Montreal, finding them guilty on the
following indictment:

…IRVING KIRSCH and HERSCHEL ROSENTHAL, at
Montreal, district of Montreal, between December 1st, 1971 and March 31st,
1972, conspired with ROBERT BROADLEY, JAMES DANIELSON, STEPHEN DINNEEN, FRED
GABOURIE, RON GOLDEN, and PAOLO VIOLI to commit an indictable offense not
provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c), to wit: by deceit, falsehood or
other fraudulent means, whether or not a false pretence, with intent to
defraud, affect the public market price of shares of BUFFALO GAS AND OIL
CORPORATION LIMITED that were being offered to the public, the whole contrary
to Section 423, paragraph (d), in relation to Section 338 , paragraph (2)  of the
Criminal Code …

It is common ground that the evidence for the
prosecution was provided in part by witnesses who are “accomplices” under the
rules of evidence. In his charge to the jury the trial judge, as he was in law
required to do, warned them against the danger of finding the accused guilty on
the basis of uncorroborated testimony of accomplices; he explained to them what
an accomplice witness is, and the meaning of corroboration, told them that they
had to decide whether these witnesses were accomplices, and that if they found
them to be so, they should guard against the danger of finding the accused
guilty on the basis of the uncorroborated testimony of these accomplices.
Appel-

[Page 442]

lants agreed that these directions to the jury
by the trial judge are not subject to challenge.

After performing this duty in accordance with
the law, the judge went on to say:

But to assist you in this connection, I
would like to call to your attention—and it’s my duty to call to your
attention—those pieces of evidence that exist which are capable of being
corroboration.

It will be for you to decide whether in
fact they do corroborate the evidence of the accomplices; but it is my duty to
at least put them before you as the kind of evidence which is susceptible of
being corroboration.

And of course I do not pretend to offer
you an exhaustive list of the items of possible corroborative evidence. I think
you can examine all of the facts and circumstances in the case and, providing
you conclude that they do meet the test of corroboration that I mentioned to
you earlier, you’re entitled to consider them.

But I’d like to put before you now the
elements that come to my mind which can, if you accept them and believe them,
serve as corroboration in the direct evidence given by Danielson and Dinneen.
[My emphasis]

Appellants are challenging this procedure, which
was approved by the Court of Appeal for Quebec, arguing, with the support of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Racine[1], that the judge not only had a duty to
indicate to the jury what evidence in the case at bar was capable of
constituting corroboration, but also had to tell them that they should confine
themselves to the points he had indicated to them and should not, as he did,
have left them free to search through other parts of the evidence, using his
definition of corroborative evidence.

There is however another ground raised by
appellants and which was pleaded as an alternative, and which is more a matter
particular to the facts of this case than one of principle.

When arguing his case before the jury, counsel
for the Crown indicated to the jurors as being capable of providing
corroboration evidence which, as a matter of law, could not; this was
acknowledged by respondent Crown.

[Page 443]

The trial judge, who had left the jurors free to
find corroboration in parts of the evidence other than those which he had
indicated, did not instruct them that the parts of the evidence which the Crown
had suggested as being capable of providing corroboration in fact could not,
and that they were not entitled to regard them as such.

It is for this reason that appellants now argue
before us that, even assuming that the judge committed no error of law by
proceeding as he did, he should have—and not having done so was a fatal error
on his part—nevertheless warned the jurors that they could not accept the Crown’s
suggestion as regards the corroborative value of those passages of the
evidence. With this I agree.

It is therefore not necessary to deal with the
main ground of appeal.

Furthermore, respondent in her brief and orally
at the hearing in this Court took no position on the main ground, and on both
grounds merely relied on the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code  so that we have not had the advantage of hearing argument
in support of the position adopted as regards the main ground by the trial judge
and by the Court of Appeal for Quebec.

As for the omission by the judge to instruct the
jury properly as regards the Crown’s remarks to them, I do not think this is
the kind of error which should be dealt with by resort to s. 613(1) (b)(iii).
Respondent did not demonstrate to my satisfaction that without this error the
verdict would of necessity have been the same.

Before concluding, I think it only fair to point
out that the ground upon which I would allow this appeal was not raised in the
Quebec Court of Appeal.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Quebec Court of Appeal and direct a new trial.

Appeal allowed.

Criminal law—Fraud and conspiracy

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Judge’s charge to jury—Failure
to summarize certain testimony—Failure to simplify expert testimony.

Appellant was charged with murder in the
first degree. Following an altercation in a tavern, he went to his home nearby,
got a dismantled firearm, assembled and loaded it, returned to the tavern and
shot the victim. The evidence disclosed that the accused had a history of
mental disturbance and of treatment for drug and alcohol abuse. At his trial,
the accused relied on the defence of insanity under s. 16(2)  of the Criminal
Code .

He was convicted by a judge and jury and the
Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal.

Three grounds of appeal were submitted to the
Court: 1. the evidence of insanity was not contradicted, and thus the jury
verdict was incompatible with the evidence presented; 2. the trial judge did
not adequately sum up the evidence, and thus the jury could not properly assess
the defence presented; 3. the trial judge did not fully explain the defence of
insanity, and thus the jury was not able to understand the characteristics of
mental illness as defined by the law.

Held (Lamer J.
dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ.:
For the reasons stated by Lamer J., grounds 1 and 3 are without merit and
cannot be sustained. With regard to the second ground: the trial judge is not
bound to summarize unimportant testimony, nor is he required to translate the
language used by expert witnesses into the vernacular for the benefit of the
jury; finally, the trial judge is not required in his summary of the evidence
to refer to the testimony of every single witness. In the case at bar, the evidence
of a policeman, a lawyer and a doctor was only peripheral, tending to
demonstrate that the accused was mentally disturbed, a point which was not
contested by the Crown: the essential difference was

[Page 337]

as to the accused’s mental condition at the
time of the offence alleged. Counsel for the accused himself referred to this
evidence only in passing and did not comment, at the conclusion of the charge,
on the failure of the judge to direct the attention of the jury to the
testimony of these three persons. In the case at bar, failure to mention these
witnesses does not constitute procedural error necessitating a new trial.

Per Lamer J., dissenting:
The charge was relatively short in the case at bar. Certain testimony did not
call for any further summary. Additionally, a judge is not obliged to simplify
the testimony of an expert witness: he may ask the witness to do so himself,
and if he does so in his charge to the jury, he must warn the jurors that his
interpretation of the testimony is only an opinion, but he cannot be said to
have failed to simplify. However, although a judge is not required to summarize
all the evidence or refer the jury to the testimony of each and every one of
the witnesses, he must draw the jury’s attention to testimony and to passages
from the testimony tending to support the defence argument. A summing up must
be fair having regard to the circumstances of the particular case and the
nature of the defence put forward by the accused, and the testimony by means of
which it is presented. In the case at bar the accused, who pleaded insanity,
having no witnesses to call who could have examined him shortly after the
crime, called witnesses to testify to his condition before the crime and some
time afterwards, and they indicated the possibility of a relapse, a matter of
capital significance. Although in general a judge may take the short duration
of the trial into account and conclude that the jurors still had all the
evidence fresh in their minds, this fact clearly could not relieve him of the
necessity of presenting the defence argument, or of doing so fairly.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
of Quebec[1], dismissing the
appeal from a

[Page 338]

guilty verdict of a judge and jury. Appeal
dismissed, Lamer J. dissenting.

Alain Généreux, for the appellant.

English version of the judgment of Laskin C.J.
and Martland, Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre and Chouinard JJ.
delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant, Christian Thériault,
was charged before judge and jury and convicted of murder in the first degree
of Jimmy Massey, at Joliette, in the Province of Quebec. The facts and the
circumstances of the murder were not contested. The appellant relied, however,
upon the defence of insanity under s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code . He
said that he had a disease of the mind to an extent that rendered him incapable
of appreciating the nature and quality of his act or of knowing that the act
was wrong. An appeal to the Court of Appeal of Quebec was dismissed (Bélanger and Jacques JJ.A., Kaufman J.A.
dissenting).

I

The facts may be briefly stated. Shortly before
1:00 a.m. on the morning of July 2, 1976 an altercation took place between Thériault and one Claude Foucher
in a tavern in the Hotel St‑Louis in Joliette. The victim, Jimmy Massey, intervened to tell Thériault to leave.
Thériault went to his home nearby, got a firearm which was in a box,
dismantled. He assembled the firearm, loaded it with what he called a “slug”,
returned to the hotel and shot Massey through the head, killing him. After his
arrest Thériault made a statement which was taken down in writing and confirmed
the essential facts. He refused to sign the statement but initialed a
correction. At the time Thériault was nineteen years of age with a history of
mental disturbance and of treatment for drug and alcohol abuse.

The Crown and defence evidence was adduced
during three and one-half days of trial. Twenty-one witnesses were called. On
the morning of December 20, 1976, defence and Crown counsel delivered their
respective addresses to the jury. Later on the same day, the trial judge
delivered his

[Page 339]

charge and the verdict of the jury was rendered
that evening.

II

On appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal counsel
for the accused took three points, which Bélanger J.A. summarized as follows:

[TRANSLATION] (1) the evidence of insanity
at the time of the offence was not contradicted by the evidence for the
prosecution, so that the jury verdict is incompatible with the evidence
presented and unreasonable overall;

(2) this verdict was rendered because, in
his charge, the trial judge did not sum up the evidence so that the jury could
properly assess the defence presented;

(3) the trial judge did not give sufficient
information on the defence of insanity to enable the jury to understand the
characteristics of mental illness as defined by the law.

All of the judges in the Court of Appeal were of
the view that grounds (1) and (3) were not well founded and could not be
sustained. The same grounds of appeal, worded in slightly different language,
were advanced in this Court. I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons
prepared by my brother Lamer for delivery in this appeal. I share the view of
Mr. Justice Lamer and of the judges of the Court of Appeal that neither of
these grounds of appeal has merit and I do not think that I can usefully add
anything to what has been said on these two grounds by Mr. Justice Lamer
and the judges of the Quebec Court of Appeal.

The difference of opinion in the Quebec Appellate
Court, and in this Court, arises in respect of what was the second ground of
appeal in the Quebec Court and the first ground of appeal in this Court,
namely, that the trial judge, in his charge to the jury, failed to deal
adequately with the defence evidence. On this subject, Mr. Justice
Bélanger noted that the inquiry had lasted only three and one-half days and
that the Crown evidence in chief concluded on the second day, consisting, as it
did, of the uncontested circumstances and acts constituting the offence. The
two other days were devoted to proof of the insanity of the

[Page 340]

accused and Crown rebuttal evidence in respect
of that defence. Mr. Justice Bélanger said:

[TRANSLATION] In my opinion, the trial
judge adequately summarized the defence evidence, which the jurors certainly
still had fresh in their minds. He referred to the main facts on which legal
evidence was provided by witnesses who did not testify as expert witnesses, and
to the broad outlines and conclusions of the opinions given by expert witnesses
for the defence. He even read the jury extracts from the testimony of the chief
expert witness for the defence. To my mind, he did not have to follow the
expert witnesses in theories foreign to the standards of s. 16  of the Criminal
Code , which are the only ones that should guide the jury.

Mr. Justice Jacques, who concurred in the
judgment of Mr. Justice Bélanger was of the view that the medical
diagnosis of the medical experts heard in defence had been recalled by the
trial judge and that of Dr. Talbot, an important defence witness, cited “in
extenso”. Mr. Justice Jacques said:

[TRANSLATION] As was their right, the
jurors chose the diagnosis made by the expert witness for the Crown. The reason
they did so was surely not because the judge failed to explain the defence
argument; he even said that he considered the extracts from the testimony of
Dr. Talbot which he cited to be “most important”.

Mr. Justice Kaufman in dissent expressed
himself as unable to agree that the trial judge, in his charge to the jury,
adequately dealt with the evidence on which the appellant’s sole defence was
based. It is upon Mr. Justice Kaufman’s dissent that the appellant relies
in coming to this Court without leave. Mr. Justice Kaufman observed that
seven witnesses had been called by the accused: a social worker, a policeman, a
lawyer, two general practitioners and two psychiatrists and that their evidence
covered 276 pages of the Joint Record, of which 212 pages were devoted to
psychiatric assessments. Mr. Justice Kaufman considered it imperative that
the evidence be summed up for the jury not, as the trial judge said, by giving
[TRANSLATION] “merely a very short summary of the testimony of these witnesses,
what I regard as most important”, but rather by “distilling” from the mass of
evidence those parts which would help the jury in reaching their verdict.

The justice of appeal said:

The judge’s résumé occupies less than five
pages of the transcript, and while he did touch on some highlights, he

[Page 341]

failed to review parts of the evidence
which the defence clearly considered important. Thus, the lawyer, the policeman
and one of the doctors are not mentioned at all, and while the impact of their
testimony may not have been great, it should, at least, have been discussed.

The next passage in the judgment of
Mr. Justice Kaufman which I think is of particular importance is this:

As I indicated before, the defence, which
was serious, should, in my view, have been put to the jury in much greater
detail. It should also, where necessary, have been explained in terms which
were more comprehensible than those employed by the witnesses. That is a
difficult task, beset by the risk of losing precision. But, as was said by the
Supreme Court of Canada in Azoulay v. The Queen (1952), 15 C.R.
181 [reported also in [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495] “highly technical and conflicting
evidence” (of experts) must be stripped of non-essentials so that the jury may
“fully appreciate the value and effect of the evidence” (per Taschereau
J., at 184) [at p. 499 in the S.C.R. report].

The first objection raised by Mr. Justice
Kaufman was that the trial judge had given an overly short résumé of the
evidence of some of the defence witnesses. I agree with my brother Lamer that
when the trial judge spoke of giving a résumé of the evidence, he was referring
simply to the testimony of the social worker and Dr. Reid. The testimony
of these witnesses did not merit any more than a brief reference. The social
worker had not seen the accused since 1973, three years before the crime was
committed. Dr. Reid did not feel competent to express an opinion on the
mental state of the accused, not being a psychiatrist.

The second objection of Mr. Justice Kaufman
was that the trial judge did not explain to the jury in layman’s language the
technical testimony of the medical experts. Mr. Justice Kaufman felt that
the evidence of these experts was overly technical and should have been
simplified for the jury. On this point, in the Quebec Court of Appeal,
Mr. Justice Jacques had this to say:

[Page 342]

[TRANSLATION] In my opinion there is no
need to require a trial judge to re-word in popular language the technical
language used by expert witnesses, when the technical expressions have been
explained during the course of the testimony.

With respect, I agree with Jacques J.A. and
Mr. Justice Lamer that there is no obligation on the trial judge to
interpret the testimony of experts. Mr. Justice Kaufman speaks of the risk
of “losing precision”. Equally grave is the danger of error in translating
technical language into common and everyday vernacular. If the testimony is
highly technical counsel who has called the expert witness should ask the
witness to explain himself in language the layman can understand. The judge
may, in his discretion, decide that some simplification is desirable but
failure on his part to undertake this difficult and potentially hazardous task
is not, in my view, reversible error.

The final objection of Mr. Justice Kaufman
and the one to which my brother Lamer would give effect was that the trial
judge had not referred to the testimony of other defence witnesses: these
witnesses were a policeman, a lawyer and another doctor.

With the greatest of respect for the contrary
opinion, I disagree. The evidence of the lawyer was that he had been consulted
by the accused one month before the shooting after minor provocation from the
police. To the lawyer, Thériault seemed lost, dangerous and aggressive.
Thériault spoke of wanting to kill police officers. The evidence of the doctor,
not a psychiatrist, was that he had seen the accused for fifteen minutes, one
month before the shooting. Thériault had spoken to him of having problems and
of hallucinations. He appeared anxious and aggressive. The doctor recommended
psychiatric treatment and prescribed mild Valium. The policeman had seen the
accused in February of 1976, some months before the shooting. The evidence of
these witnesses was only peripheral. At most, it demonstrated that the accused
was mentally disturbed. This was not contested by the Crown. Thériault had been
in treatment for an extended period some months before the shooting.

[Page 343]

The issue at trial, however, was not the general
mental health of the accused but whether he was, at the time of the offence
alleged, ‘insane’ within the legal definition of the term. Was he incapable of
appreciating the nature and quality of his act? The important defence evidence
on this point was offered by the two psychiatrists. The defence would stand or
fall on whether or not the jury accepted their testimony. The testimony of the
other witnesses was of secondary importance. Mr. Justice Kaufman
recognized that “the impact of their testimony may not have been great”.

In his address to the jury, counsel for the
accused devoted one paragraph to the evidence of the doctor. The evidence of
the lawyer merited one paragraph. Thirty-three paragraphs of the address were
devoted to the evidence of the two psychiatrists called by the defence. And
properly so, because, as I have said, the only issue was insanity and the only
persons who could speak authoritatively on that subject were the psychiatrists.
The other background witnesses, including the lawyer and the doctor, who was
not a psychiatrist, could only speak to what was a non-issue—the fact that
Thériault was mentally disturbed.

It is important to note that the trial judge
repeatedly directed the attention of the jury to the entirety of the evidence.
He spoke of [TRANSLATION] “the evidence overall”, “after examining all the
evidence”. The last words the jury heard from him before rendering their
verdict were these:

[TRANSLATION] As I have already told you,
you are bound to consider not only the evidence or testimony of the physicians,
but all the evidence presented before you, before you arrive at a conclusion:
you can take into account all the actions of the accused, the words spoken by
him, his acts, immediately before, a long time before, and those which he did
immediately before and at the instant of the crime.

Although by no means determinative, it is not
irrelevant that counsel for the accused did not comment, at the conclusion of
the charge, upon the failure of the trial judge to direct the attention of

[Page 344]

the jury to the evidence of the lawyer, the
doctor and the policeman.

As Sir William Brett M.R. said in Abrath v.
North Eastern Ry Co[2]. at
p. 453, “It is no misdirection not to tell the jury everything which might
have been told them”. It was open to the trial judge to make reference to the
evidence of the lawyer and of the doctor in his charge but this evidence had
been reviewed earlier in the day by defence counsel. It was fresh in the minds
of the jury. It was well within the bounds of the wide discretion enjoyed by
trial judges that he should decide not to repeat it. Failure to mention these
two witnesses in the charge does not, in my view, constitute procedural error
necessitating a new trial. This conclusion finds support in the unanimous
decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Demeter[3], at p. 340:

There will probably never be a perfect
charge or one that cloistered appellate counsel cannot find objectionable after
minute scrutiny. However, no case has been cited to us where non-direction on a
matter of evidence has been held to be misdirection requiring a new trial except
where a single item of evidence is the foundation of the defence.

I would dismiss the appeal.

English version of the reasons delivered by

LAMER J. (dissenting)—This appeal is from
a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Quebec. By its decision the Court dismissed
the appeal brought by the accused from the verdict of a court of assizes for
the Judicial District of Joliette, finding him guilty of the first degree
murder of one Jimmy Massey. The facts are not in dispute. They are summarized
by Bélanger J.A. of the Court of Appeal as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The murder occurred in a
public house in the Hôtel St-Louis, in Joliette, at about 1:00 a.m. on July 2,
1976. There had earlier been a brawl involving appellant, Christian Thériault,
and one Foucher. They were separated after a time. The victim, Jimmy Massey,
intervened to tell Thériault to leave. At this point,

[Page 345]

Thériault left the premises and went to his
home, a short distance from the Hôtel St‑Louis, to get his gun which he
kept there dismantled in a box.

Five to ten minutes after his departure
from the hotel, Thériault returned through the back door, aimed at Massey and
fired. Thériault had loaded his gun with what he called a “slug”. The bullet
passed through Massey’s head and he was killed on the spot.

The only defence put forward by the accused was
that of insanity, as provided in s. 16  of the Criminal Code  of
Canada (R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34).

In the Court of Appeal, the accused submitted
three grounds, summarized by Bélanger J.A. as follows:

[TRANSLATION] (1) The evidence of insanity
at the time of the offence was not contradicted by the evidence for the
prosecution, so that the jury verdict is incompatible with the evidence
presented and unreasonable overall;

(2) This verdict was rendered because, in
his charge, the trial judge did not sum up the evidence so that the jury could
properly assess the defence presented;

(3) The trial judge did not give sufficient
information on the defence of insanity to enable the jury to understand the
characteristics of mental illness as defined by the law.

The three appellate judges unanimously dismissed
the first and third of these grounds as without foundation. The Court did not
allow the second ground either, but one of the three judges wrote a dissenting
opinion. Appellant’s appeal to this Court is based on this dissent, as of
right; thus, though he raised other grounds in his factum, the jurisdiction of
this Court is limited to this dissent on a question of law.

In the judgment, the dissent reads as follows:
[TRANSLATION] “(Kaufman J.A. dissenting, on the ground that the trial judge
inadequately summarized the evidence for the defence).” The reasons for Kaufman
J.A.’s dissent are contained in the written opinion in the record. Before
referring to this (as the Court may do: see Savard and

[Page 346]

Lizotte v. The
King[4], at
p. 23), it is preferable to consider the evidence of insanity put forward
by the defence and the evidence of the prosecution in rebuttal.

The accused called seven witnesses.

A social worker, who had not seen him since 1973
(the murder occurred in 1976), told the jury of the accused’s unhappy and
turbulent childhood, and the fact that he was aggressive.

Another witness, Gaétan Barrette, a police
officer in the City of Joliette, met him in February 1976. Answering a call for
help placed by Thériault’s mother, he went to their home and found Thériault
apparently deranged, saying he wanted to die, and constantly eyeing the service
revolver carried by the officer. Instead of incarcerating him, he was taken to
the St-Charles Hospital in Joliette. The officer added that Thériault had
behaved in a similar fashion in the past.

Charles Reid, a doctor attached to the
St-Charles Hospital, specifically to the department where alcoholics and drug
addicts are treated, related the circumstances under which he became acquainted
with and treated Thériault in 1973 and 1974. In his opinion, Thériault
frequently consumed an excessive quantity of drugs, but he was not physically
addicted. He considered that the accused took drugs because he was unhappy,
uncomfortable around other people, and in revolt against authority. He found
that the accused’s mental condition was lucid, except of course when he had
taken drugs. He did not find in him any indication of physical aggression.
Finally, he related an incident in which his patient told him he wanted to
commit suicide, but said that in his opinion he was not serious, and that it
was only a game since the incident occurred in the presence of hospital staff.
The witness refused to give any opinion as to the accused’s mental condition,
as he was not a psychiatrist.

Pierre Thibault, a general practitioner at the
St-Charles Hospital, saw Thériault on June 3, 1976 for reasons which he said
were psychological. The accused claimed that he was hearing threaten-

[Page 347]

ing voices, was having hallucinations, felt
depressed and wanted to kill himself. The interview lasted fifteen minutes and
the doctor prescribed “valium”.

Mr. Ferland, a lawyer in Joliette, had a
surprise visit from the accused at his office a few weeks before the murder. He
said that Thériault seemed nervous, his eyes were glassy, he was trembling and
that he said he wanted to kill policemen.

Following this testimony, two psychiatrists were
heard: Drs. Cayouette and Talbot, of the St‑Charles Hospital in Joliette
and the Philippe Pinel Institute in Montreal respectively.

Dr. Cayouette treated Thériault from
February 4 to March 18, 1976. In his opinion, there was no doubt that he was a
schizophrenic, whose illness was of such a nature that he was sometimes
dangerous to himself and to others, and sometimes not. Dr. Cayouette had
to place him in close treatment (involuntary treatment) on two occasions:
first, from February 4 to 24, 1976, and the following day, February 25, until
March 5. He placed the patient in open treatment on March 5 because his
behaviour indicated that he was no longer dangerous, and especially—at least
this is the impression given by his testimony as a whole—because of the
clinical advantages of open treatment:

[TRANSLATION] Q. You feel that open
treatment is easier, it is easier for treatment…

A. Well, yes, because close treatment
really is an enormous handicap for the doctor treating patients, he can be
given absolutely no rights to leave the hospital, the law is specific on this
point; you cannot—it is really a great limitation in terms of treatment—the
patient says that the people who look after me don’t really have my interests
at heart, they won’t even let me put my foot outside the hospital; the law
states in as many words that as soon as the treatment can be changed it should
be.

…

Q. In your opinion at that point, in
ordering open treatment, would Thériault have had to remain in open treatment
for very long?

…

[Page 348]

A. The situation usually depends on the
individual patient: for a patient who co-operates fairly well with the doctor,
it is a matter of judgment as to the patient’s condition, and what the doctor
thinks can be done, and it may be a matter of a few weeks, it may sometimes
even continue for a month or two, and medical leave may be given if you think
that the patient will continue to co-operate and come in on an out-patient
basis, but in the case under consideration, which is important, there were five
earlier instances in which the patient signed a refusal of care; in any case,
in order for the treatment to progress the therapeutic approach has to be
varied a bit at some point, because it is true that an environment like the
close department in our hospital—we have only one for men, it is called
department 2D, and patients sometimes feel a bit unhappy at being there, and
think they are not being well treated if they are left there.

Nonetheless, the doctor did not think that his
patient had ceased to be dangerous. This is in fact why he refused to sign the
patient’s leave. It is worth mentioning that a patient in open treatment really
does not need leave in order to unilaterally terminate his treatment, and this
is what Thériault did on March 18. When questioned by his counsel, who asked
him whether Thériault, when he took leave from the hospital, constituted a
danger to the public, Dr. Cayouette replied:

[TRANSLATION] Q. Did you sign medical
leave—in other words, to put it another way, was Thériault free to disappear?

A. Certainly not.

Q. In your opinion on March 18, when he
left, when he signed a refusal of treatment and was legally able to go, should
he in your opinion have remained in the hospital or was he ready to return to
the outside world, as we say?

A. Not based on my experience; the reason I
refused to sign medical leave is because I thought that the patient had not
sufficiently improved, although he had made some progress.

Q. He still needed treatment?

A. Absolutely, in my opinion.

He later told the judge, who returned to the point:

[Page 349]

[TRANSLATION] A. At the point when the
patient gave himself leave, he represented a relative danger, because a relapse
can occur at any time, but the danger was undoubtedly relative.

Q. Was it a possibility or a probability?

A. Well, I would say a possibility, perhaps
a little greater than the average patient in his condition in the hospital
centre: when they have made some progress and leave, there are seventy (70%)
per cent of our patients that do all right.

To the reasons already given, and cited above,
why he terminated the close treatment, he added:

[TRANSLATION] Q. There was surely a
difference in your opinion when you ordered close treatment the first time and
the second time, and in both cases when you did not give leave—you did not give
leave but terminated the close treatment—what is the difference?

A. The difference is based mainly on one’s
practical understanding of a given case, and it is also based on what one might
call general experience of cases resembling the one in question, but once
again, if nothing is changed, to begin with, the patient’s attitude to the
treatment centre, including the doctor and all the staff, becomes so negative,
he becomes convinced that he will not progress, there is thus a practical
change by the treatment facility, because otherwise we would be into a vicious
circle, with no way out. The fact that we know the patient a bit better, that
our relationship with him is somewhat better, all of this helps because
otherwise the treatment would never be changed, because it is an illness which
goes through successive phases, phases of remission, and when there is
co-operation on the part of the patient progress is made. I think that the
turning point is when the patient co-operates in his treatment.

Discussing the guidelines contained in
s. 16  of the Criminal Code , the doctor considered that his
patient’s capacity to appreciate his own actions was impaired to various
degrees as the illness developed, but he could give no opinion as to the degree
of such impairment at the precise time of the murder. Finally, the judge asked
him:

[TRANSLATION] If I have understood your
testimony correctly, a person with the symptoms you have just

[Page 350]

mentioned could at one point be sound of
mind, able to distinguish between right and wrong, and at another point, a few
days later, perhaps a few weeks, be unable to do so, that is, be unable to make
this distinction: is that correct?

to which he replied:

[TRANSLATION] Essentially that is correct,
with perhaps one qualification, that it is mainly his judgment—because the
individual’s understanding does not change so much, what happens is that when
the illness worsens the practical judgment is greatly disturbed, much more than
his understanding, and at such times the subject is able to recognize the
doctor, to recognize the nurses, to recognize the staff present, but his
practical judgment is much more distorted at such times.

Dr. Talbot testified at length. His opinion
was based on the patient’s condition from the time when he saw him shortly
after the murder, on August 12, 1976, and on Thériault’s psychiatric record at
the Joliette Hospital. He explained in detail the diagnostic progression which
led him to a conclusion of schizophrenia. I grant that these explanations are
often difficult to follow, because they are learned in nature and replete with
highly technical terms; however, I hasten to add that, in my opinion, the
primary and secondary conclusions are clear and readily understandable by the
layman. On August 26, 1976, Dr. Talbot noted the presence “of a very
marked homicidal aggression”. The doctor observed, regarding appellant’s mental
condition on the day of the murder:

[TRANSLATION] …he is unable to perceive
reality in the usual way, he cannot accurately analyse events which occur, he
cannot control…

…

…could not exercise rational judgment on
what took place around him and on his actions.

…

Q. How would you characterize the judgment
of a schizophrenic in circumstances like those of July 2?—as we know he related
the facts very clearly the following day, but in a phase like that of July 2,
in the case of Christian Thériault, to what extent was he able to understand
what was happening?

[Page 351]

A. As I mentioned earlier, his judgment was
based on premises, on perceptions which were inaccurate, which were incomplete,
and at the same time he was subject to a sort of internal aggressive explosion
as a result of which, in my opinion, he could no longer exercise rational
judgment.

Q. At the present time, Dr. Talbot,
with the treatment you gave Christian Thériault—you heard the testimony of
other doctors—do you still maintain the opinion that on July 2 he was unable to
appreciate the consequences of his actions?

A. Yes.

…

Q. In your view, on July 2, could Christian
Thériault appreciate the quality of the act he committed when he shot Jimmy
Massey?

A. I answered this question a minute ago,
when I tried to show and to illustrate the processes leading one to make a
judgment: in the case of a psychotic individual, in the case of an individual
like Mr. Thériault, with his particular pathology, I think it is very
difficult if not impossible for him to arrive at a rational judgment.

Further, because he has difficulty
apprehending reality as it is, perceiving it as it is, he adds to this reality
other aspects which are peculiar to him, and which he projects onto the world
around him.

The strength of the tension, of the
internal aggression is such that it impedes or will not allow the faculties of
judgment to operate.

…

A. As a consequence of compensating for
disorientation, when he is subject to the internal pressure, to the explosive
aggression which I referred to, I think he is unable to exercise rational,
truly normal judgment.

Q. As to the quality, the nature of his
act?—is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Was he in your opinion able to
appreciate whether the act which he committed was right or wrong?

A. I think that at this time what was
happening inside of him was of such intensity that the question had no
significance, that in fact such a question was not even asked, because this is
a process, this is a condition in which the patient is disorient-

[Page 352]

ed and acts on impulse, without the
question of right or wrong being raised—that is not important: what is
important is the action he is in the course of taking, to satisfy a psychotic
hostility. [My emphasis.]

The doctor went on to say that at the time
Thériault went to get the rifle he was in a psychotic state. To the question:

[TRANSLATION] In your opinion the fact that
he left the Hôtel St-Louis, the fact that he went home, the fact that he
assembled his gun and returned to the Hôtel St-Louis, did not succeed in
quelling the irritation he felt when Jimmy Massey told him to leave?

he answered:

[TRANSLATION] Apparently not. I had an
opportunity while the patient was at the institute under my care, and when I
evaluated him, to see this vigorous aggression in action, disorienting and
disoriented, on certain occasions while he was there. This aggressive
disorientation was not of a permanent nature. There were highs and lows, there
were improvements; as I said a moment ago, in my view at the time in question
Mr. Thériault was subject to the pathology, that he exhibited, that he
suffered from this pathology when he was incapable, as a result of it, to exercise
a rational judgment.

…

…that at the time in question the patient
was acting under a significant mental disorder of psychotic intensity. [My
emphasis.]

When questioned by the judge, the doctor
admitted that the accused, between leaving St‑Charles and arriving at
Pinel, may have had moments when he was perfectly lucid. But he also stated:

[TRANSLATION] Q. You said, doctor, that on
July 2 the accused could not understand the nature of the quality of the act he
committed—is that correct?

A. Could not appreciate its nature.

Q. Could not appreciate its nature?

A. Yes.

Q. In your opinion, did the accused know he
was committing a crime?

A. During this period his cognitive
faculties do not appear to have been greatly or markedly affected;
additionally, I think what is important…

[Page 353]

Finally, his lengthy testimony was summed up in
these concluding words:

[TRANSLATION] Q. In the specific case of
Christian Thériault, on July 2, was his judgment impaired?

A. I told you this morning, I think that,
in my view, at that time, this is my opinion, he was incapable of exercising
rational judgment.

The evidence in rebuttal was brief. Aside from
the testimony of a former employer of Thériault, who said he found him normal
in April 1976, it consisted of only one other witness, Dr. Daoust, a
psychiatrist employed by the Department of Justice of Quebec.

He stated that Thériault’s action was not that
of a schizophrenic, but rather of an individual who had problems with his
temper and behaviour.

He maintained that Thériault was capable of
appreciating the nature and quality of his action. He agreed it was possible
that he might be suffering from schizophrenia, but the doctor stated that he
rather inclined to the view that he was a problem personality— “…a fellow with
a bad temper, with an impulsive, bad temper, lacking the usual degree of
self-control”.

In his written opinion, Kaufman J.A. stated his
dissent as follows:

However, with the greatest respect, I am
unable to agree that the learned trial judge, in his charge to the jury,
adequately dealt with the evidence on which Appellant’s sole defence was based.

He further stated:

The expert evidence abounds with words and
phrases like “symptômes primaires ou secondaires de la schizophrénie”, “trouble
de l’affectivité”, “affectivité profondément aplatie”, “flambée de psychose”,
“autisme” [[TRANSLATION] Primary or secondary symptoms of schizophrenia,
manic-depressive disorder, deeply deflated affectivity, exacerbated psychosis,
autism] and the like. This, as I already noted, makes heavy reading, and I dare
say it is even harder to follow in court.

It was therefore imperative that the
evidence be summed up for the jury not, as the learned trial judge said, by
giving “simplement un très petit résumé des témoignages de ces témoins, ce que
je considère le plus important” (J.R., at p. 723), but rather distilling
from

[Page 354]

this mass of evidence those parts which
would help the jury in reaching their verdict.

The judge’s résumé occupies less than five
pages of the transcript, and while he did touch on some highlights, he failed
to review parts of the evidence which the defence clearly considered important.
Thus, the lawyer, the policeman and one of the doctors are not mentioned at
all, and while the impact of their testimony may not have been great, it
should, at least, have been discussed.

Finally, he summarized the essence of his
reservations regarding the judge’s charge as follows:

As I indicated before, the defence, which
was serious, should, in my view, have been put to the jury in much greater
detail. It should also, where necessary, have been explained in terms which
were more comprehensible than those employed by the witnesses. That is a
difficult task, beset by the risk of losing precision. But, as was said by the
Supreme Court of Canada in Azoulay v. The Queen (1952), 15 C.R.
181, “highly technical and conflicting evidence” (of experts) must be stripped
of nonessentials so that the jury may “fully appreciate the value and effect
of the evidence” (per Taschereau, J., at p. 184).

It appears, therefore, that in the opinion of
the dissenting judge, the trial judge should have:

(1) summed up the evidence by something
other than “merely a very short summary”;

(2) explained to the jurors in terms more
accessible to a layman the meaning of what Drs. Cayouette and Talbot had
stated;

(3) referred the jurors to the testimony of
the Joliette policeman, of the lawyer, and to that of Dr. Pierre Thibault,
testimony which he did not deal at all with in his charge.

Before examining what the judge said to the
jurors, it is appropriate to recall here certain rules by which judges must be
guided in making their charges to jurors, and in giving them instructions on
the law; but first we must recall the principles applicable to judges weighing
these instructions on appeal.

The first rule which an appellate judge must
remember is that he is not called upon to assess a judge’s charge in terms of
what he himself would have done, but in terms of the standard laid down

[Page 355]

in Bray v. Ford[5], by the House of Lords, which, obvious
though it may be, is still in the final analysis the real standard. In that
case, Lord Watson observed (at p. 49):

Every party to a trial by jury has a legal
and constitutional right to have the case which he has made, either in
pursuit or in defence, fairly submitted to the consideration of that
tribunal. [My emphasis.]

A few years later, this Court issued a warning
to guard against certain dangers awaiting those called on to review charges to
the jury, in Spencer v. Alaska Packers Association[6]. Nesbitt J. stated (at p. 367):

I think it is very dangerous to quote from
cases statements of the duty of a judge in directing a jury which are only
applicable to the particular case.

Killam J., on his part, wrote (at p. 373):

Stated in the abstract, it may be said that
it is the duty of a judge presiding at a jury trial to see that the jury are
instructed as to what are the issues of fact upon which their findings are
required, and the law relating to these, and how their verdict should be
according as their findings of fact are in one way or another. But the degree
in which it is important to point out these things expressly in a formal charge
must always depend upon the circumstances of the case.

The rule stated by Lord Watson and the warning
given by this Court in Spencer have been restated on several occasions,
their formulation varying with the circumstances presented by the cases in
question. There is no need here to make a complete review of the point; this
Court has done it so many times; it will suffice to refer to the statements of
the Court in three cases: Azoulay v. The Queen[7]; Kelsey v. The Queen[8] and Lizotte v. The Queen[9].

Nonetheless, I should like to add to this
reference the remarks of Lord Goddard of the Court of Appeal of England,
remarks relied on by the

[Page 356]

judges of this Court in Kelsey and Lizotte,
when he said, in the case of Derek Clayton‑Wright[10] (at p. 29):

The duty of the Judge… is adequately and
properly performed… if he puts before the jury clearly and fairly the
contentions on either side, omitting nothing from his charge, so far as the
defence is concerned, of the real matters upon which the defence is
based. He must give… a fair picture of the defence, but that does not mean to
say that he is to paint in the details or to comment on every argument which
has been used or to remind them of the whole of the evidence which has been
given by experts or anyone else. [My emphasis.]

Now to consider the judge’s charge to the jury
on the defence of insanity and the observations of Kaufman J.A. of the Court of
Appeal.

The charge was relatively short, since the only
question was whether the accused had succeeded in establishing on a balance of
probabilities that at the time of the crime he was suffering from a “disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature of
an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong”.

After giving general instructions, the judge
considered the evidence as follows:

[TRANSLATION] I now intend to indicate what
I consider to be the essence of the evidence presented by the prosecution and
by the defence. I do not intend to repeat the testimony given word for word; I
shall simply summarize what I take to be the facts proven. If your memory differs
from mine in this regard, do not rely on my observations, but trust to your
memory. You are entitled to ignore my opinion in its entirety with regard to
the interpretation of one or more facts or of the evidence.

He subsequently commented on the nature of the
defence as follows:

[TRANSLATION] The defence is based on the
insanity of the accused, that is, the defence contends that at the time of the
crime the accused was suffering from insanity. The defence maintains that at
that time, when the crime was committed, the accused could not appreciate the
nature and quality of the act committed by him. Several witnesses were heard
for the defence. Yvan Goulet, a social worker, saw the accused in September

[Page 357]

and October 1973, and he stated that the accused
mistreated animals and that, on one or more occasions, he held his mother with
his arms.

Dr. Reid, a physician, met the accused
in December 1973. I am giving you, I am giving you merely a very short summary
of the testimony of these witnesses, what I regard as most important. When he
saw the accused, the accused told him that “I am crazy, a lunatic, I’m
uncomfortable with other people”. He further stated that the accused knew where
he was, but that he was utterly miserable. The doctor further testified that
the accused did not commit violent acts, he was merely aggressive, aggressive
in what he said.

These remarks were followed by his commentary on
the testimony of Drs. Cayouette and Talbot. We may pause here a moment to
consider the first of the reservations made by Kaufman J.A., namely, that the
trial judge summarized the testimony too briefly.

In this regard, it should first be noted that
when the judge told the jury that he was making “merely a very short summary”,
he was referring to the testimony of the social worker Yvan Goulet and of
Dr. Reid, not to the testimony as a whole, as Kaufman J.A. appears to
suggest. In my opinion, this is all that the testimony of these two witnesses
called for. The social worker had not seen the accused since 1973, and in any
case did not say anything of great relevance, except perhaps for offering some
background to the accused’s family life. Dr. Reid, for his part, pointed
out that he was not competent to make any judgment as to his patient’s mental
condition, as he was not a psychiatrist. Accordingly, the judge properly gave
only a brief summary of this testimony.

Kaufman J.A. further concluded that the trial
judge had not explained the purport and meaning of the testimony of Drs.
Cayouette and Talbot, using language which a layman could understand.

I have carefully examined the testimony of these
doctors and the remarks of the judge. I find that the judge took care to cite
for the jury only passages from the testimony where, at his urging, at that of
one of the counsel or of their own accord, the two doctors had explained the
meaning of the terms they were using; other examples are

[Page 358]

provided by their testimony. Moreover, in my
view the jury should not be underestimated. The trial judge was in a better
position than this Court to determine, in view of the personality and education
of each juror, the extent to which he should further simplify what the doctors
had already explained.

In this connection, I feel I should add that a
judge is not obliged to simplify the testimony of an expert witness. He may, as
may counsel, ask the witness to do so. The judge may do so in his charge to the
jury, but if so he must warn them that his interpretation of the meaning and
purport of what the witness has said is only an opinion and that, in the final
analysis, it is up to them and no one else, including the judge, to draw their
own conclusions as to what the witness meant. Here, the judge used the passages
from the testimony which were most readily comprehensible. In my view, he
cannot be said to have failed to simplify, let alone be required to do so,
beyond what the witnesses stated.

The third ground of appeal remains: the fact
that he made no mention of the testimony of police officer Barrette,
Dr. Thibault and of the lawyer Ferland.

It was mentioned earlier that a judge is not
required to summarize all the evidence or to refer the jury to the testimony of
each and every one of the witnesses. He must draw the jury’s attention to
testimony and to passages from the testimony tending to support the defence
argument; and as each case is different, there is in the end no other rule than
that a summing up must be fair having regard to the circumstances of the
particular case and the nature of the defence put forward by the accused,
and the testimony by means of which it is presented. The accused, who pleaded
in his defence that he was insane at the time of the crime, namely on July 2,
1976, having no witnesses to call who could have examined him at the actual
instant of the crime or immediately thereafter, called witnesses to testify to
his condition before the crime and some time afterwards. It is on the basis of
these findings and the circumstances of the murder that Drs. Cayouette, Talbot
and Daoust arrived at their opinion that, at the time of

[Page 359]

the murder, Thériault probably was, according to
Cayouette and Talbot, or was not, according to Daoust, insane within the
meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal Code .

Dr. Cayouette explained at some length that
his patient was subject to dangerous periods and that the level of this danger
could be reduced, by medication and other treatment, for more or less lengthy
periods. His testimony as a whole indicates that always lurking was the
possibility of a relapse. In addition, the situation is clearly illustrated by
the alternation between open and close treatment at the St-Charles Hospital.
The possibility of a relapse is further increased when all treatment ceases, as
happened from March 18, 1976 onwards. Dr. Talbot was of the same opinion.
When these two psychiatrists gave their opinions on the accused’s mental
condition at the date of the crime, they undoubtedly took into account, as they
had to do, the testimony of witnesses at the hearing who provided them with
factual information enabling them to speculate in terms of probability on the
development of the accused’s schizophrenia between the date on which he left
the St-Charles Hospital (against the doctor’s orders), on March 18, 1976, and
the day of the murder, the following July 2. The only witnesses who saw the
accused during this time were Mr. Ferland and Dr. Thibault. The
accused’s bizarre behaviour at Mr. Ferland’s office early in June and the
aggressiveness noted by Dr. Thibault on June 3 are facts which, in light
of the circumstances of this case, are of capital significance in that they may
perhaps have indicated—and this was for the jury to decide—a relapse, thus
supporting the opinion of the two psychiatrists summoned for the defence, who
concluded that at the date of the murder the accused had in fact suffered a
relapse. No mention was made by the judge of these two witnesses, or of the
disturbing events related by them.

Bélanger J.A. of the Court of Appeal, approving
the manner in which the judge summed up the evidence, pointed to the fact that
in view of the short duration of the trial the jurors still had all the
testimony fresh in their minds. This fact, I agree, is one factor which a judge
takes into

[Page 360]

account in determining, in light of the
circumstances peculiar to each trial, the manner in which he must summarize
the evidence and present the defence arguments. (See, in this regard, Chartrand
v. The Queen[11]; R.
v. Borg[12].) However,
this fact clearly could not relieve a judge of the necessity of presenting the
defence argument, or of doing so fairly. In the case at bar, assuming that the
jury remembered the witnesses Ferland and Thibault, the fact that the judge
omitted to refer to them probably left them with the impression that this
testimony was of so little relevance that it did not even require being
mentioned.

In my view, the judge should have given these
witnesses all the importance which they deserved, especially as it is not
immediately apparent to a layman. To do this, he should have linked the facts
related by them to the possibilities of a relapse explained by Drs. Cayouette
and Talbot.

This omission seems to me to have been of such
seriousness that it is impossible to conclude that the accused nevertheless had
his defence fairly presented to the jury.

Before concluding, I should emphasize that I am
not unaware that the task incumbent upon trial judges of presenting a defence
of insanity to the jury is a most demanding one in view of the state of the
law, the nature of the questions raised by the defence itself and the
difficulty which when testifying psychiatrists have in presenting in legal
terms (s. 16  of the Criminal Code ) conclusions based on reasoning very
remote from the determination of legal responsibility.

Nonetheless, I would allow this appeal and order
a new trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Evidence—Admissibility of an
oral statement made by the accused to police officers—Counsel waived the voir
dire—Recognition of the right to waive a voir dire—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C-34, s. 582.

The appellant was charged and convicted of
unlawfully breaking and entering a dwelling. An appeal to the Court of Appeal
for Ontario was dismissed
without written reasons.

The admissibility of a statement made by the
appellant to the police, without which the conviction could not stand, was at
issue. Counsel for the appellant waived the voir dire normally held to
determine the voluntary nature of the statement. The question was whether an
accused could waive the holding of a voir dire and, if so, whether there
was a proper waiver.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

(1) The right to waive a voir dire:
Whether the right rests upon s. 582 of the Code or upon broader ground (R.
v. Dietrich (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 49), the accused, personally or through
his counsel, had the right to waive the holding of a voir dire. Although
no particular form was essential the waiver had to be express. All that was
necessary was that the trial judge be satisfied that counsel understood the
matter and had made an informed decision to waive the voir dire. Counsel
needed only to indicate that no objection was taken to admission of the
statement without a voir dire or that voluntariness was not in issue.
Silence or mere lack of objection did not constitute a lawful waiver.

Despite the waiver, there was not a duty on
the trial judge to hear enough evidence, in the absence of the jury, to satisfy
him that the statement was voluntarily made. The Court did not recognize any
such requirement as a rule of law.

Determination of voluntariness of a
confession was essentially a question of fact and waiver of a voir dire

[Page 65]

constituted an admission of primary facts
that the statement was not made in circumstances where the accused person was
the subject of coercive conduct on the part of a person in authority. The
question of admissibility of the statement was for the trial judge to decide.

(2) Was the statement in fact made: In
every case in which the Crown sought to adduce evidence of a statement made by
an accused, there had to be, by definition, “some evidence” that the statement
was made. Once the issue of voluntariness was resolved, normal principles of
evidence applied and there was no necessity for the judge to hold a voir
dire on this issue.

(3) Inducement or threat: The
appellant testified that his conversation with the police had been preceded by
both a threat and an inducement such as may have rendered any resulting
statement involuntary. The judge, having heard the evidence, decided to
continue with the trial. Such an exercise of his discretion was not a
procedural error of law.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario, dismissing the
appellant’s appeal against his conviction by a County Court Judge of breaking
and entering a dwelling. Appeal dismissed.

Gordon F. Henderson, Q.C., and Edward L.
Greenspan, for the appellant.

S. Casey Hill, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

DICKSON J.—The appellant, John Kenneth Park, was
charged with unlawfully breaking and

[Page 66]

entering a dwelling in Toronto and stealing jewelry and a sum of money. He pleaded not guilty and
was tried in the County Court Judges Criminal Court of the Judicial District of
York, by a judge without a jury. Convicted, he was sentenced to a term of
imprisonment. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed without written reasons and the matter has now
reached this Court, by leave.

At issue is the admissibility of a statement
made by Mr. Park, without which the conviction cannot stand. The statement was
made to police officers. In order to render the statement admissible it was
incumbent upon the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the statement
had not been obtained by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or
held out by a person in authority. (Ibrahim v. The King[1] at p. 609, adopted in this Court in Boudreau
v. The King[2] and
R. v. Fitton[3], and
recently affirmed in Rothman v. The Queen (judgment delivered
March 2, 1981, as yet unreported[4]).

Proof of the voluntary nature of the statement
is generally, though not invariably, made on a voir dire, a trial within
a trial. In this case, however, counsel for Mr. Park purported to waive the
holding of a voir dire. The issue is whether in law an accused, or
counsel on his behalf, may waive the holding of a voir dire and, if so,
whether there was, in the circumstances of this case, a proper waiver.

Whether an accused may waive the necessity for a
voir dire has hitherto been an open question. In Powell v. The
Queen[5], Mr.
Justice de Granpré expressed the view in obiter dicta that a voir
dire could be waived (at p. 368):

While I might be ready to accept in a
proper case that counsel for an accused may well waive the holding of a voir
dire, I see a considerable difference between an expressed waiver
surrounded by all the precautions indicating that the question has been
examined in depth and mere silence on counsel’s part. The heavy onus

[Page 67]

resting on the Crown certainly cannot be
displaced in such an informal fashion.

In Erven v. The Queen[6], the point was raised but expressly
left open (at p. 940):

Further, I would not want to say that
counsel may not expressly waive the holding of a voir dire in a proper
case where all precautions have been taken: See Powell v. The Queen, [[1977]
1 S.C.R. 362] at p. 368; R. v. Sweezey [(1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 400] at
p. 416; R .v. Dietrich, [1970] 3 O.R. 725 at pp. 734-7 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to this Court
dismissed [1970] S.C.R. xi). I do not express any concluded view on the matter
of waiver, however, as there is no suggestion that defence counsel waived voir
dire in the case at bar.

I

The Facts

The dwelling house at which the break, entry and
theft occurred was located at 57 York Downs Drive. Dr. Morris Herman resided next door. At about 7:15 p.m. on the
evening in question, in early December, Dr. Herman was turning into his
driveway in his car when, from a distance of 20 to 30 feet, he glanced
fleetingly at a man walking from his next door neighbour’s property. He did not
consider it of importance at the time. There was no natural light but a bright
street lamp provided illumination. A four-foot hedge separated the two
properties, and to some extent obstructed Dr. Herman’s view of the man.

Four days later Dr. Herman picked out, from a
random selection of a dozen photographs, two photographs of Mr. Park as
resembling (ninety-nine percent certainty) the man he had seen. At trial Dr.
Herman testified that Mr. Park strongly resembled the man, although he seemed
of lighter weight and was not wearing the same type of clothes. Dr. Herman
could not be certain.

After the plea and before evidence was offered
at Mr. Park’s trial the following remarks were made by Mr. Lewis, counsel for
Mr. Park (now His Honour Judge Lewis) in relation to (i) the potential evidence
of the constable who had arrest-

[Page 68]

ed Mr. Park, and (ii) the defence position
regarding the voluntariness of the only statement made to a police officer,
Sergeant Cosgrove:

MR. WILEY: (Crown Counsel)

And I believe when the appropriate time
comes in the evidence my friend knows of the Constable’s evidence and he is
prepared to admit that, and is prepared to concede that it doesn’t concern the
fact of the voluntariness of any statement that the Crown may proceed to
introduce.

MR. LEWIS: (Defence Counsel)

That is correct, Your Honour. In fact, I am
prepared to allow him to direct evidence at this time with the permission of
the Court; I am not going to be attacking the voluntariness and there is no
statement made to that officer. [Emphasis added]

When Crown counsel at trial proposed to
introduce evidence of the statement made by Mr. Park to Sergeant Cosgrove,
the following colloquy took place:

Q. Could you tell His Honour what you know
about this matter?

MR. LEWIS:

At this point, Your Honour, I should point
out that there’s going to be a statement offered by the Crown and I’m not
accepting the statement in its totality as it stands but there’s no question of
a voir dire. [Emphasis added]

The witness then proceeded to recite the
circumstances under which the statement had been made and the substance
thereof. Mr. Park is alleged to have said, when informed of the charge of break
and enter on York Downs Drive
and that he had been seen coming out of the house, “that’s no problem, the
witness can’t identify me; it was dark and I’ve been to the barber’s since
then”. Sergeant Cosgrove testifed that he had told Mr. Park nothing with
respect to the break and enter other than that the location was on York Downs Drive.

After Crown counsel closed his case, defence counsel
moved for a dismissal of the charge. The Court ruled there was sufficient
evidence for a prima facie case and denied the motion. Mr. Park

[Page 69]

testified. The trial judge concluded his reasons
for judgment in these words:

I feel that the statements the accused
made, and I do not have them verbatim, and I am subject to correction, but as I
recall from my notes, they were to the effect, in reply to the statement, “You
were seen coming out of the house on York Downs Drive,”—”That’s no problem, it
was dark, I can’t be identified, and I’ve had my hair cut since”—These
comments, to me, are sufficient to corroborate and strengthen (beyond a
reasonable doubt) the identification, and as a result, on the whole of the
evidence, I have come to the conclusion that the accused is guilty of the
offence.

In his notice of appeal to this Court, the
appellant raises the following issues:

1. Did the trial judge err in failing to conduct
a voir dire to determine whether the statement was voluntary and
admissible regardless of the fact that the appellant’s counsel purported to
waive the voir dire?

2. Did the trial
judge err in failing to conduct a voir dire to determine whether the
statement allegedly made by the appellant was in fact made?

3. Did the trial judge err in failing to conduct
a voir dire, notwithstanding the purported waiver, after the
appellant testified that his conversation with the police was preceded by both
a threat and an inducement?

II

The Right to Waive a Voir Dire

Generally speaking, the only way that a trial
judge, trying an accused with a jury, can determine whether any statement given
by the accused is voluntary is by holding a voir dire in the absence of
the jury. The same holds true of a judge sitting alone: R. v. Gauthier[7]. As a matter of sensible and general
practice, a voir dire should be conducted whenever defence counsel so
requests, or does not waive the voir dire. Normally, the failure to hold
a voir dire will amount as a matter of law to procedural error capable
of vitiating a conviction, sub-

[Page 70]

ject to the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii).

I am of opinion that voluntariness, as a test of
admissibility of a confessional statement, may be determined without the
procedural necessity of a voir dire where the voir dire is waived
by the accused or his counsel. Determination of voluntariness is essentially a
question of fact and waiver of a voir dire constitutes an admission of
primary facts that the statement was not made in circumstances where the
accused person was the subject of coercive conduct on the part of a person in
authority. The question of admissibility of the statement is, of course, for
the trial judge to decide, and he has a wide discretion either (i) to accept
the waiver and dispense with the holding of a voir dire or (ii) to hold
a voir dire or (iii) to inquire directly of counsel for the accused as
to, and his understanding of, the underlying factual admissions implicit in the
waiver of the voir dire.

Some courts which have recognized the legality
of a waiver of voir dire have done so on the basis that the waiver is an
admission by the accused of a fact alleged against him and s. 582  of the Criminal
Code  applies. That section provides that where an accused is on trial for
an indictable offence he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him
for the purpose of dispensing with the proof thereof. In R. v. Dhaliwal[8], Mr. Justice Moir on behalf of the
Alberta Court of Appeal held that a waiver of a confessional voir dire by
defence counsel constituted a s. 582  admission.

Other courts have held the view, which I am
inclined to share, that whether or not s. 582  is authority for the accused to
waive a voir dire as to the voluntariness of a confession, such a right
exists apart from the provisions of the Code. This was best expressed by
Gale C.J.O. delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.

[Page 71]

Dietrich[9] (leave to appeal refused[10]). In
that case, counsel for the Crown had taken the position that if no objection
was made at trial to the admission of an inculpatory statement it was
unnecessary to inquire into the circumstances under which the statement had
been given. Chief Justice Gale adverted to that submission, and continued, at
p. 58:

Without deciding that point, I am of the
opinion that a voir dire is not required when counsel for the accused
unequivocally states to the Court that a statement made by his client is
voluntary and that an inquiry on the point can be dispensed with. I put my
conclusion on the broad principle that it is proper and desirable for the
accused or his counsel to expedite a trial by admitting that a confession was
voluntary in the legal sense, if such be the case, in order to obviate the need
for a voir dire. That is precisely what occurred in this case and I am
persuaded that the trial Judge was right in proceeding without conducting a voir
dire on the pertinent statements made by the appellant. To have done
otherwise would have been absurd and would have been contrary to the interests
of justice. After all, the most important consideration is that an accused be
safeguarded against the admission of a confession which has not been
voluntarily given; if the accused or his counsel openly specify that the
statement is voluntary in all senses of the word, I see no reason for the Judge
to go through a farce to prove something which has been conceded and therefore
is really not in issue.

Chief Justice Gale noted that no case had been
found which bound the Ontario Court on the question of waiver. R. v. LeBrun[11] was directly on point but the Court
declined to follow that judgment, preferring the earlier decision of the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Deacon[12] and the suggestion of O’Halloran
J.A. in R. v. Melnyk[13]. Adverting
to s. 562 of the Code, now s. 582 , Chief Justice Gale said at p.
59:

[Page 72]

I am inclined to the view that it is a
mistake to attempt to force the issue of voluntariness into s. 562. Despite
adherence by our Courts to the old English common law (see R. v. St. Clair (1900),
27 O.A.R. 308, 3 C.C.C. 551, and R. v. Brooks (1906), 11 C.C.C. 188)
which no longer prevails, I endorse the concept that a trial should be capable
of being expedited when the accused consents to the waiving of a voir dire and
that his right to do so exists apart from any provision of the Code and
consequently apart from any consideration of questions of fact and law. When
such a consent is given, the trial Judge should then be able to make a ruling
on the basis of the consent that the particular statement is admissible.

The discussion on the point was concluded with
these words at p. 60:

It would be equally anomalous, as it seems
to me, if an accused or his counsel should be able to admit facts in the
indictment and yet be precluded from admitting as a fact, the voluntariness of
a confession. In doing so, the accused is only impliedly admitting facts from
which the Judge may conclude that the statement is voluntary in the legal sense
and thus is admissible.

With respect, I agree. The Dietrich decision
has been followed in a number of cases. In R. v. Sweezey[14], Martin J.A., speaking for the
Ontario Court of Appeal, and relying on Dietrich, said, at p. 416:
“Counsel may, of course, expressly waive the necessity for a voir dire even
where one would normally be required, and so, in appropriate circumstances, dispense
with its necessity.” In the later case of R. v. Clayton[15] the same court said, at p. 92:

We were invited to say that as a result of
the decision in Powell v. R., [1977] 1 S.C.R. 362, 33 C.R.N.S. 323,
28 C.C.C. (2d) 148, 66 D.L.R. (3d) 443, there was now doubt as to whether
counsel could make an admission of the type to which I have referred. Counsel
submitted that despite the admission of trial counsel, there was a duty on the
trial judge to hear enough evidence, or, at least, an agreed statement of
facts, in the absence of the jury, to satisfy him that the statement was
voluntarily made, within the meaning of the cases. In our view, unless and
until there is some clear statement by the Supreme Court of Canada to the
contrary, we ought to

[Page 73]

follow the principle which was laid down by
this court in R. v. Dietrich, [1970] 3 O.R. 725, 11 C.R.N.S. 22, 1
C.C.C. (2d) 49, leave to appeal refused [1970] 3 O.R. 744n, 1 C.C.C. (2d) 68n
(Can.) and followed in R. v. Sweezey (1974), 27 C.R.N.S. 163, 20 C.C.C.
(2d) 400 at 418, the effect of which is that counsel can expressly waive a voir
dire when the admissibility of a statement is in question.

See also R. v. Spencer[16], at p. 37.

In the present appeal the argument advanced in Clayton’s
case was again pressed. It was argued that despite the waiver of defence
counsel, there was a duty on the trial judge to hear enough evidence, in the
absence of the jury, to satisfy him that the statement was voluntarily made.
With respect, I do not recognize any such requirement, as a rule of law. It may
well be that, in order to avoid the danger of a mistrial, the trial judge will
wish to make some inquiries and hear some evidence in the absence of the jury
before accepting the waiver, particularly if the accused is represented by
inexperienced counsel or unrepresented, but I do not think there is any rule
obliging him to do so.

No particular words or formula need be uttered
by defence counsel to express the waiver and admission. All that is necessary
is that the trial judge be satisfied that counsel understands the matter and
has made an informed decision to waive the voir dire. It is sufficient
for counsel to indicate that no objection is taken to admission of the
statement without a voir dire, or that voluntariness is not in issue. In
R. v. Dietrich, supra, counsel for the defence “admitted” or
“stipulated” that the statements of the accused sought to be introduced were in
fact voluntary. In R. v. Clayton, supra, counsel for the defence was
asked by the court if he desired a voir dire regarding a statement which
the Crown proposed to introduce. Defence counsel replied that the statement was
“… admitted to be voluntarily made… “. In R. v. Melnyk, supra, counsel
for the defence in

[Page 74]

response to an inquiry from the court as to his
position stated that he “had no objection to the confession being admitted into
evidence”. Although no particular form of words is necessary the waiver must be
express. Silence or mere lack of objection does not constitute a lawful waiver.
The question is—does the accused indeed waive the requirement of a voir dire
and admit that the statement is voluntary and admissible in evidence? If
that question can be answered in the affirmative I cannot think that any
further procedural safeguards are necessary to protect the rights of an accused
person.

If further support be needed for recognition of
a right of waiver of voir dire reference can be had to the decision of
the Court of Appeal of the Yukon Territory in R. v. Isaac[17]. The
only decision which runs counter to the various appellate court decisions is R.
v. LeBrun, supra, a one paragraph judgment of a single
Supreme Court Judge in British Columbia. He held that an admission by counsel that a statement is voluntary
is not a lawful admission of fact pursuant to s. 582 of the Code, the
issue being a question of law. That decision was specifically disapproved in R.
v. Dietrich, supra.

The argument was advanced, what might be termed
the in terrorem argument, that grave problems may arise from allowing
counsel for the accused to waive a voir dire without indicating the
factual assertions to support it. Counsel may fail to appreciate the proper
legal test to be invoked. Following a waiver, the accused may give evidence
which discloses a threat or inducement, possibly leading to a mistrial. It was
said there is room for abuse when, for the purpose of obtaining a mistrial,
counsel waives a voir dire and the accused then gives evidence which
shows that the waiver should not have been given by counsel or accepted by the
court. That these potential problems exist cannot be denied but I should think
they will be rare. I do not believe that we should fashion our criminal law

[Page 75]

on the assumption that defence counsel will be
ignorant of elementary rules of criminal evidence or act in a manner abusive of
the processes of the court.

I conclude that whether the right rests upon s.
582 of the Code or upon the broader ground chosen by the Ontario Court
of Appeal in Dietrich’s case the accused, personally or through his
counsel, has the right to waive the holding of a voir dire.

While conceding that a voir dire may be
waived, Mr. Greenspan, counsel for Mr. Park, contended that it must be an
“expressed waiver surrounded by all the precautions indicating that the
question has been examined in depth” [per Mr. Justice de Grandpré in Powell
v. The Queen, supra, at p. 368]. It was contended that the purported waiver
here did not relieve the trial judge of his responsibility, as it was not
unequivocal and it was not surrounded by precautions indicating the question
had been examined in depth. The argument rests largely upon the following
passage from the transcript:

At this point, Your Honour, I should point
out that there’s going to be a statement offered by the Crown and I’m not
accepting the statement in its totality as it stands but there’s no question of
a voir dire. [Emphasis added]

It is important to place this statement in
context. The Crown had just called its witness Sergeant Cosgrove. Before he
could testify, defence counsel interjected with the comment, “there’s going to
be a statement offered by the Crown”. It seems clear from this that defence
counsel was familiar with the evidence about to be tendered. Counsel then
stated, “I’m not accepting the statement in its totality as it stands but
there’s no question of a voir dire”. This indicates not only that a statement
was made but that counsel was familiar with its contents. When defence counsel
stated he was not accepting the statement ‘in its totality’, he was not referring
to any problem with voluntariness but simply indicating his position that the
statement was not made in the precise words attributed to the accused by the
police officer. I do not think

[Page 76]

that, as to its voluntariness, the waiver can
properly be said to have been equivocal.

On the matter of precautions it is apparent that
Mr. Park was represented by experienced counsel. As Crown counsel notes
delicately in his factum “there were indications before the court, that the
appellant was not inexperienced with the criminal justice system”. Mr. Park had
had the benefit of a preliminary hearing where the issue of the taking of the
statement had been canvassed by counsel. I do not think the trial judge erred
in failing to make inquiry. Such cases as R. v. Mulligan[18] at pp. 176-77 and R. v. Roberts[19], at pp. 344-45 were cited but these
authorities have no application in the case at bar.

I conclude that there is no merit to the first
ground of appeal.

III

Was the Statement in Fact Made

The second ground of appeal was framed in terms
of error on the part of the trial judge in failing to conduct a voir dire to
determine whether or not a statement allegedly made by Mr. Park was in
fact made by him. The appellant argues that on a voir dire, there are
always two issues facing the trial judge: the first issue is whether or not the
statement was voluntary, the second issue is whether or not there is ‘some
evidence’ that the statement was in fact made. The argument is summarized by
the appellant in his factum as follow:

It is thus submitted that the trial judge,
before admitting an accused’s statement, must make a preliminary finding that
there is some evidence that the statement was in fact made (that issue
ultimately then being left to the jury for its final determination in the same
manner as any other factual assertion) and therefore, in order to waive the
holding of a voir dire, an admission is required that the statement was
in fact made.

 [Page 77]

In this case, counsel for Mr. Park admitted that
the statement was voluntary. He did not admit, as has been noted, that the
statement had been made in terms alleged by Sergeant Cosgrove. It is argued
that the trial judge ought to have conducted a voir dire in order to
determine whether or not there was some evidence that the statement was, in
fact, made. There is no merit to the submission. In every case in which the
Crown seeks to adduce evidence of a statement made by an accused, there must,
by definition, be “some evidence” that the statement was made. This evidence exists
by virtue of the fact that a police officer (or other ‘person in authority’) is
seeking to tender direct evidence of the making of the statement. Whether or
not the officer is to be believed, and the weight to be given to the statement,
is a matter for the trier of fact. The special rules of evidence relating to
statements made to persons in authority flow from the concern of the courts to
ensure that such statements are made voluntarily. Once the issue of
voluntariness is resolved, normal principles of evidence apply. The fact that
the testimony of the police officer is contradicted by the accused cannot
affect the admissibility of the officer’s evidence. Where there are conflicting
versions of what was said by the accused, the jury will decide which is to be
believed. There is no necessity for a voir dire on this issue. The
second ground of appeal fails.

IV

Inducement or Threat

I come now to the final point of appeal, pressed
rather faintly, as it seemed to me, by counsel for the appellant. It is said that
the trial judge erred in failing to conduct a voir dire when,
notwithstanding the waiver of voir dire by counsel, the appellant later
testified that his conversation with the police officers had been preceded by
both a threat and an inducement. He said that at the outset of his conversation
with Sergeant Cosgrove he was told by the officer “there’s two ways we can do
this—the hard way and the easy way”. The appellant also testified that Sergeant
Cosgrove told him, “if you talk nice to me, if you do that, we will

[Page 78]

release the young lady [a friend of the
appellant]”. It is submitted these statements respectively constituted a threat
and an inducement such as may have rendered any resulting statement
involuntary. The trial judge, having heard the evidence, had three alternatives
(i) to continue with the trial, (ii) to hold a voir dire, (iii) to
declare a mistrial. He decided to continue with the trial. Such an exercise of
his discretion was not, in my opinion, a procedural error of law. As counsel for
the Crown points out, correctly, the following factors were relevant to the
exercise of such discretion, (i) the defence through experienced defence
counsel had waived the voir dire and stated that voluntariness as a test
of admissibility was not in issue, (ii) the defence had not cross-examined
Sergeant Cosgrove as to any circumstances which could be said to cast doubt
upon the voluntariness of the statement, (iii) the objection of the defence
throughout was not voluntariness but whether the words attributed to the
appellant were the words he had spoken, (iv) the judge was hearing the case
without a jury, (v) when the evidence now alleged to constitute evidence of
involuntariness was given defence counsel did not suggest either voir dire or
mistrial.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR NEW
BRUNSWICK

Criminal law—Summary conviction
offence—Information defective because of multiplicity—On mandamus, trial
ordered to proceed, with variation on appeal, that Crown elect charges to be
dealt with—Game Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. G-1, s. 23(a)—Summary Convictions
Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. S-15.

On application for mandamus arising from the
quashing of an information for multiplicity in a summary conviction matter, the
Court of Queen’s Bench ordered the provincial court to proceed with the trial
and to adjudicate on the merits of the information. The Court of Appeal
dismissed an appeal but varied the order to permit the Crown Prosecutor to
elect the charges in the information to be proceeded with, provided that the
information could be amended without injustice to the appellant. Appellant
appealed that decision.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

There was nothing wrong in the order made by
the Court of Appeal; if not the only way, it was one of the ways to deal with
the practicalities of the case. The endorsement of the reasons of the Court of
Appeal dismissing the appeal was predicated on there being no express
prohibition in New Brunswick’s Summary
Convictions Act against an information charging more than one offence.

Archer v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 33, distinguished.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal
of New Brunswick[1],
dismissing an appeal from an order of the Court of Queen’s Bench and varying
that order requiring the Provincial Court Judge to proceed to trial and
adjudicate on the

[Page 435]

merits of the information. Appeal dismissed.

Camille Vautour, for the appellant.

Graham Sleeth, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Appellant, one Richard Patrick Neville,
was charged in the Provincial Court in New Brunswick with a breach of the Game
Act of that Province, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. G-1, s. 23(a), a
summary conviction offence governed by the Summary Convictions Act, R.S.N.B.
1973, c. S-15. The Provincial Court Judge quashed the information as being void
because of multiplicity.

The Court of Queen’s Bench, pursuant to an
application by informant, issued an order of mandamus requiring the Provincial
Court Judge to proceed to trial and adjudicate upon the merits of the
information.

Neville appealed to the Court of Appeal for New Brunswick. That Court dismissed the
appeal but varied the order of the Queen’s Bench Justice to read as follows:

An order of mandamus will issue requiring
His Honour Judge Sirois to give the Crown Prosecutor an election as to which of
the charges contained in the information sworn November 23, 1978 charging the
appellant with offences against s. 23(a) of the Game Act he wishes to
proceed upon, and provided the Crown Prosecutor makes such an election and the
trial judge finds the information can be amended accordingly without injustice
to the appellant herein, the trial Judge shall proceed with the trial on the
amended information.

Neville is now appealing to this Court from that
decision.

I am of the view that for the reasons given in
the Court of Appeal by Chief Justice Hughes, Richard Patrick Neville’s appeal
was properly dismissed. I find nothing wrong with the order made by that Court
to the Provincial Court Judge; if not the only way, it was one of the ways to
deal with the practicalities of the case at bar.

[Page 436]

Though Chief Justice Hughes has canvassed the
question as thoroughly as need be, I should nevertheless like to add one
comment.

This endorsement of Chief Justice Hughes’
reasons is predicated upon the fact that there is no express prohibition in the
New Brunswick Summary
Convictions Act against an information charging more than one offence.

Appellant seeks support in this Court’s decision
in Archer v. The Queen[2]. In
that case, the effect of multiplicity on the charge’s validity was considered
in the light of s. 710(3)  of the Criminal Code , as that
section read at the time, which applied to the proceedings by virtue of
subs. (1) of s. 3 of The Summary Convictions Act, R.S.O. 1950, c.
379; s. 710(3) read as follows:

710. …

3. Every complaint shall be for one matter
of complaint only, and not for two or more matters of complaint, and every
information shall be for one offence only, and not for two or more offences.

I would dismiss this appeal. There should be no
order as to costs.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Trial—Trial judge declining to
grant further adjournment—Power to grant or refuse adjournment—No error
established on part of trial judge in the exercise of his discretion.

The accused was convicted after a trial by
judge and jury on four counts, two of possession of stolen property, one of
breaking and entering business premises and one of breaking and entering a
dwelling house. On appeal, two grounds of appeal were argued on behalf of the
accused: that the trial judge erred in law in proceeding with the trial when
the accused was not represented by counsel; and that the trial judge erred in
law in not offering sufficient advice and assistance to the appellant in the
course of the trial. The British Columbia Court of Appeal, by a majority,
dismissed the appeal. The accused then appealed to this Court.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British
 Columbia dismissing the appellant’s appeal against his conviction of two
counts of breaking and entering and two counts of possession of stolen
property. Appeal dismissed.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

there was no error of law in the decision of the trial judge in declining to
grant a further adjournment of the trial on November 28, 1977. The power to
grant or refuse an adjournment was one which could be exercised at the
discretion of the trial judge. The appellant has not established that in the
exercise of his

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Criminal law — Summary convictions — Appeal costs — Payment
by the Crown — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 720(1), 738(4), 744(1),
748, 752.1, 755, 758, 759, 771 — Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.1-23, s.
16.

Respondent was found guilty by a summary convic­tion
court of failing to stop at the scene of an accident and ordered to pay a fine
of $250 and costs or one month in jail in default of payment. His appeal to the
Superior Court from this judgment was dismissed as to the conviction but
allowed as to the sentence, which was reduced to a $100 fine. In addition, the
Superior Court judge ordered the Crown to pay the costs of the appeal, which he
set at $75. Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal from the part of the
judgment which ordered it to pay costs to respondent. A majority of the Court
of Appeal dismissed the appeal and in its turn ordered the Crown to pay the
costs of this second appeal, amounting to $200. Hence the appeal to this Court,
which must decide whether the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal could
order Her Majesty to pay costs to respondent.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The dissenting judge on the Court of Appeal relied on
the common law rule in concluding that the Crown cannot be obliged to pay
costs. However, this rule is far from being as firm and precise as he
considered it to be, and it is by no means certain that at the present time it
prevents the courts from ordering the Crown to pay costs. In any case, in the
instant case the question can be resolved solely on the basis of the relevant
provisions of the Criminal Code . As s. 16 of the Interpretation Act does
not exclude the rule by which the various provisions of the statute are each
interpreted in light of the others, ss. 758  and 771(3)  of the Criminal Code  must
be interpreted as implicitly binding Her Majesty, when they are read not in
isolation but in the context of Part XXIV on summary convictions. With regard
to an appeal by trial de novo in the Superior Court, Parlia­ment wished
to confer on the Superior Court the widest

[Page 569]

possible discretion regarding costs, a discretion
limited only by what is just and reasonable. In some cases, it would not be
either just or reasonable that the Crown be not ordered to pay the costs of the
appeal. It follows that the provision of s. 758  is binding on Her Majesty. With
regard to the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal, they are covered by
s. 771(3) , which is also binding on Her Majesty. It is worded in terms at least
as broad as s. 758 , and it would be extraordinary for the Court of Appeal to
have powers in the matter of costs less wide than the Superior Court,
especially as no action can be brought before it without leave.

[Page 570]

Jean-Marie Tanguay, for the appellant. 

Richard Perras, for the respondent.

English version of the judgment of the Court delivered by

BEETZ J.—The issue is whether the Superior Court, sitting in
appeal from a judgment of a summary conviction court, and the Court of Appeal,
sitting in appeal from the judgment thus given by the Superior Court, may order
Her Majesty to pay costs to respondent.

The circumstances which gave rise to the case are straightforward
and not in dispute.

Respondent was found guilty by a summary conviction court,
pursuant to s. 233(2)  of the Criminal Code , of failing to stop at the
scene of an accident, and ordered to pay a fine of $250 and costs or one month
in jail in default of payment. He appealed from the conviction and the sentence
to the Superior Court. His appeal was dismissed as to the conviction but
allowed as to the sentence, which was reduced to a $100 fine. Boilard J. of the
Superior Court handed down the following judg­ment regarding the costs of
appeal:

[TRANSLATION] That leaves the costs of appeal that may
exist, which as Mr. Beaudoin pointed out are now the same as the conviction—and
I refer to these when I deal with the appeal from the sentence.

The accused was right to appeal from the sentence. I allowed
his appeal, I did not give him a medal, I lowered

. I reduced the sentence, I made it, in my humble opinion
and with the greatest respect for the trial judge, I made it what appeared to
me to be adequate. I think it would be unfair to oblige the accused to pay the
costs of appeal in order to come before a court and ask it to make, within
reasonable and adequate limits, a sentence which he complains of.

I think, as I say, that it would clearly be improper to
oblige him to invest a sum of money to ask a court to reduce a penalty which
has been imposed on him.

For this reason, I have decided to grant the accused, or
rather the appellant, costs which I now set at seventy-five dollars ($75.00),
and I order the Attorney General to pay the said sum of seventy-five dollars
($75.00) within thirty (30) days of this judgment to the office of

[Page 571]

the Clerk of the Peace and the Crown for the district of
Terrebonne.

On receipt of the said sum, the Clerk shall pay it to
appellant or to any person authorized by the latter to receive it.

Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal from this judgment, and
in a majority decision by Kauf­man J., concurred in by Dubé J., the Court
dismissed the appeal and in its turn ordered the Attorney General to pay
respondent the costs of the appeal, amounting to $200. Paré J. dissented on the
ground that, at common law, [TRANSLA­TION] ""the Crown cannot be obliged to
pay costs unless this is expressly provided for by law"", and that the
provision relating to the appeal heard by the Superior Court, s. 758 of the Criminal
Code , contains [TRANSLATION] ""no provision expressly applicable to Her
Majesty"", and cannot be applied to her in view of s. 16 of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23:

16. No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her
Majesty or Her Majesty's rights or preroga­tives in any manner, except only as
therein mentioned or referred to.

The dissenting judge would therefore have reversed the judgment
of the Superior Court and recommended only that the Attorney General pay the
office of the Clerk of the Peace and the Crown the sum of $75 to be disposed of
in accordance with law.

This is the decision against which this appeal is brought.

In my view, the Court of Appeal correctly inter­preted the
relevant sections of the Criminal Code , the provisions of which suffice
to dispose of the case. However, before coming to that, it may be useful to
show that the common law rule on which the dissenting judge relied is far from
being as firm and precise as he considered it to be.

This is how Blackstone states this rule in his Commentaries on
the Laws of England, 18th ed., 1829, Vol. III, *399:

The king (and any person suing to his use) shall neither pay
nor receive costs; for ... as it is his preroga­tive not to pay them to a
subject, so it is beneath his

[Page 572]

dignity to receive them.

(See, to the same effect, Joseph Chitty, A Treatise on the Law
of the Prerogatives of the Crown, 1820, at pp. 310 and 311).

In a frequently cited case, Johnson v. The King[2],
the Judicial Committee of the Privy Coun­cil announced that it proposed to
abide by this rule in the future but qualified it as follows (at p. 825):

... their Lordships are of opinion that, in dealing with
costs in cases between the Crown and a subject, this Board ought to adhere to
the practice of the House of Lords, and that in future the rule should be that
the Crown neither pays nor receives costs unless the case is governed by some
local statute, or there are exceptional circumstances justifying a departure
from the ordinary rule.

In another case, Vaithinatha Pillai v. The King-Emperor[3],
the Judicial Committee indicated its intention to follow the same policy in
criminal cases.

It should be observed, first of all, that the question appears to
be regarded as one of practice rather than of prerogative.

It must also be noted that the rule is not abso­lute: apart from
any legislative provision, it contemplates the possibility of derogations which
are not identified apart from their exceptional nature.

Furthermore, the Judicial Committee Act, 1833 (3 & 4
Will. IV, c. 41), one of the principal statutes setting forth the jurisdiction
of the Judi­cial Committee of the Privy Council, includes a provision, s. 15,
on the awarding of costs, but does not empower the Judicial Committee either
expressly or by implication to award them to the Crown or against it.

In spite of the absence of any enabling legisla­tive provision, and
despite the rule which it had

[Page 573]

just created for itself in Johnson, the Judicial
Committee, though without mentioning the excep­tional nature of the
circumstances, at least not expressly, has several times ordered the Crown to
pay costs or awarded costs to the Crown, up to the last cases which it heard on
Canadian matters: Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Canadian Pacific
Railway[4];
Royal Bank of Canada v. Rex[5];
Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. Ritchie Contracting and Supply
Company[6];
Caron v. The King[7];
Attorney-General for Quebec v. Nipissing Central Ry. Co. and Attorney-General
for Canada[8];
Corporation of the City of Toronto v. The King[9];
Treasurer of Ontario v. Blonde and Treasurer of Ontario v. Aberdein[10];
Attorney-General for Saskatchewan v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[11];
Attorney-General for Ontario v. Israel Winner[12].

In fact, the Judicial Committee merely con­tinued, in the matter
of costs, the policy which it followed before the Johnson case: Russell
v. The Queen[13];
Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer[14];
Hodge v. The Queen[15];
Attorney-General for Quebec v. Reed[16];
Liquidators of the Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[17].

It is true that, for historical reasons, the conclu­sion of a
decision of the Judicial Committee takes the form, on costs as with anything
else, of a recommendation to Her Majesty, but this is purely a matter of form: British
Coal Corporation v. The King[18], at
p. 512.

In Canada, practice appears to have varied at different times and
depending on the province. In

[Page 574]

the absence of legislative provisions empowering them to award
costs to the Crown or against it, certain courts have felt themselves bound by Johnson:
this is what the Supreme Court of Alberta held in R. v. Royal
Bank of Canada[19];
this case was taken on appeal to the Judicial Committee, which on this point
disregarded its own decision in Johnson and ordered the Crown to pay
costs in all courts (supra).

The Court of Appeal of New Brunswick also followed this practice
in Attorney-General of Canada v. Jackson[20], a
civil case, but reversed field in R. v. Guidry[21],
a summary conviction case.

In Nova Scotia, it appears to be the practice to award costs to
the Crown, or to order it to pay costs on appeal in summary conviction cases: R.
v. Higgins[22].

In Ontario, legislative provisions empowered the courts to make
rules of practice allowing them to order the Crown to pay costs; after these
rules were repealed, the custom has continued without legislative foundation;
this sequence of events is described in a judgment of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia, Ferguson v. Attorney-General of Canada[23],
and a decision of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, Re Imperial Canadian
Trust[24], reversed
by this Court, but on the merits, and without any particular discussion of the
question of costs: Provincial Treasurer for the Province of Manitoba v.
Minister of Finance for Canada[25].

In cases cited in the Ferguson judgment, the common law
rule is described as an anachronism that should be eliminated. Accordingly, it
is by no means certain that at the present time the common law prevents the
courts from ordering the Crown to pay costs.

In any case, the question can be resolved solely on the basis of
the relevant provisions of the

[Page 575]

Criminal Code . However, it should
first be noted that s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, cited above,
no longer includes the word ""expressly"" as it did formerly. This
section does not exclude the rule by which the various provisions of a statute
are each interpreted in light of the others, and it is possible that Her
Majesty be implicitly bound by legisla­tion if that is the interpretation which
the legisla­tion must be given when it is placed in its context. In my view,
this is the interpretation that must be given to ss. 758  and 771(3)  of the Criminal
Code , when they are read not in isolation but in the context of Part XXIV
on summary convictions.

The first section of Part XXIV, s. 720, contains definitions
including the following:

720. (1) In this Part

…

""informant"" means a person who lays an
information;

…

""prosecutor"" means an informant or the Attorney
Gen­eral or their respective counsel or agents.

The legislator accordingly intended to refer to the Crown and
bind it every time he used the expression ""prosecutor"". The Crown may
thus be ordered to pay costs at trial in the situation con­templated by s.
738(4):

(4) Where the prosecutor does not appear at the time and
place appointed for the resumption of an adjourned trial, the summary
conviction court may dismiss the information with or without costs.

On the other hand, it would appear that only the informant or the
defendant, and not the Crown, may be ordered to pay costs under s. 744(1),
since there is no mention of a presecutor:

744. (1) The summary conviction court may in its discretion
award and order such costs as it considers reasonable and not inconsistent with
such of the fees established by section 772 as may be taken or allowed in
proceedings before that summary conviction court, to be paid

(a) to the informant by the defendant, where the summary
conviction court convicts or makes an order against the defendant, or

[Page 576]

(b) to the defendant by the informant, where the summary
conviction court dismisses an informa­tion.

Is there an anomaly here? Although in principle costs are
compensatory and not punitive, it is possible that the intent was to
discourage, through fear of being ordered to pay costs, private frivolous
prosecutions inspired by vindictiveness. Such con­siderations are deemed not to
apply in the case of prosecutions authorized by the Attorney-General or
undertaken by him, and in any event the fear of costs would not discourage
prosecutions in such a case.

At the appellate level such considerations give way to factors of
a different kind, like those men­tioned by Boilard J. of the Superior Court in
the judgment referred to above. Moreover, ordering the informant to pay costs,
which remains possible when the information is dismissed, would mean in
practice that the costs would be paid by the Attor­ney-General when, as in the
case at bar, the informant is an officer of the Quebec Police Force authorized
by the Attorney-General to act as an informant.

The case at bar is concerned with the costs of appeal, but the
foregoing indicates that the legisla­tor specifically contemplated the
possibility that the Crown be ordered to pay the costs at trial.

Section 748 gives a right of appeal, in the circumstances which
it states, to the defendant, the informant, the Attorney-General of the
province or his agent and the Attorney-General of Canada or his agent. To some
extent, therefore, it defines the word ""appellant"", which thus
includes the Attorney-General.

Section 752.1 prescribes the procedure when the appellant is the
informant:

752.1 (1) The prosecutor in proceedings before a summary
conviction court by whom an appeal is taken under section 748 shall, forthwith
after filing the notice of appeal and proof of service thereof in accordance
with section 750, appear before a justice, and the justice shall, after giving
the prosecutor and the respondent a reasonable opportunity to be heard, order
that the prosecutor

[Page 577]

(a) give an undertaking as prescribed in this section, or

(b) enter into a recognizance in such amount with or without
sureties and with or without deposit of money or other valuable security as the
justice directs.

(2) The condition of an undertaking or recognizance given or
entered into under this section is that the prosecutor will appear personally
or by counsel at the sittings of the appeal court at which the appeal is to be
heard.

Because the word ""prosecutor"" is used, these
provisions, which deal inter alia with security for costs, would be
binding on the Attorney-General. This is why the legislator excludes him in s.
752.1(3):

(3) This section does not apply in respect of an appeal
taken by the Attorney General or by counsel acting on behalf of the Attorney
General.

The same principle is observed in ss. 763, 764(3) and 766(5) in
connection with an appeal by stated case.

Furthermore, under the provisions of s. 766(1) and (2), where a
summary conviction court refuses to state a case the ""appellant"" may
apply to the Superior Court for an order directing it to proceed, but be
ordered to pay costs if he fails. As we have seen, the word ""appellant""
includes the Attorney-General.

Section 755, relating to an appeal by trial de novo, provides
that the provisions of ss. 729 to 744 apply mutatis mutandis for
this purpose, to the extent that these sections are not inconsistent with ss.
748 to 760. It follows that s. 738(4) must be applied to any appeal by trial de
novo, and that the Crown may be ordered to pay costs when its
representative does not appear at the resumption of an adjourned hearing.

Sections 758  and 759(1) , relating to trials de novo heard
by the Superior Court, read as follows:

758. Where an appeal is heard and determined or is abandoned
or is dismissed for want of prosecution, the

[Page 578]

appeal court may make any order with respect to costs that
it considers just and reasonable.

759. (1) Where the appeal court orders the appellant or
respondent to pay costs, the order shall direct that the costs be paid to the
clerk of the court, to be paid by him to the person entitled to them, and shall
fix the period within which the costs shall be paid.

By these sections, the legislator indicated his intent to
dispense in part at the appellate level with the provisions of s. 744 relating
to trial level costs. First, the quantum of the costs is left entirely in the
discretion of the Superior Court and is no longer limited by s. 772, to which
s. 744 refers. Second, the order to pay costs is no longer tied to the success
or failure of the action. Additionally, there is no further mention of an
""informant"" and a defendant, but, in s. 759(1) there is mention of an
""appellant"" or a respondent. Finally, it would appear that by s. 758 
Parliament wished to confer on the Superior Court the widest possible discre­tion
regarding costs, a discretion limited only by what is just and reasonable. In
some cases, it would not be either just or reasonable that the Crown be not
ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.

In my opinion the legislator intended, at the appellate level, to
place the Attorney-General and the accused on an equal footing from the
standpoint of costs, except, as Kaufman J. correctly points out, in the case
where he expressly provided to the contrary with regard to the necessity of
providing security. The dissenting judge observed that s. 759(3) provides for
imprisonment in the event that costs are not paid. In my opinion, this argument
is not conclusive: as respondent noted in his brief, s. 759(3) cannot be
applied to corpora­tions either, yet these remain subject to s. 759(1).

Accordingly, I conclude that the provision of s. 758  is binding
on Her Majesty.

There remains the question of the costs of the appeal to the
Court of Appeal. It is covered by s. 771:

771. (1) An appeal to the court of appeal, as defined in
section 601 may, with leave of that court, be taken on any ground that involves
a question of law alone, against

[Page 579]

(a) a decision of a court in respect of an appeal under
section 755, or

(b) a decision of a superior court in respect of a stated
case under section 768, except where the superior court to which the case was
stated is the Court of Appeal.

(2) Sections 601 to 616 apply mutatis mutandis to an
appeal under this section.

(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), the court of appeal may
make any order with respect to costs that it considers proper in relation to an
appeal under this section.

(4) The decision of the court of appeal may be enforced in
the same manner as if it had been made by the summary conviction court before
which the proceedings were originally heard and determined.

(5) The Attorney General of Canada has the same rights of
appeal in proceedings instituted at the instance of the Government of Canada
and conducted by or on behalf of that Government as the Attorney General of a
province has under this Part.

In my opinion, subs. (3) of this section is also binding on Her
Majesty. First, it is worded in terms at least as broad as s. 758 . Secondly, I
think it would be extraordinary for the Court of Appeal to have powers in the
matter of costs less wide than the Superior Court, especially as no action can
be brought before it without leave.

The appeal should be dismissed and, in accordance with the order
giving Her Majesty The Queen leave to appeal to this Court, the
Attorney-General of Quebec shall pay solicitor and client costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Charge to jury—Testimony of an
accessory after the fact—Rule of caution applicable—Opinion expressed by the
Court earlier—Authority of this opinion—Obiter dictum—No substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice—Criminal Code , s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

Appellant was found guilty of murder after
being tried by a court consisting of a judge and jury. At the hearing, the
prosecution called as a witness one Welch who was admittedly an accessory after
the fact. A majority of the Court of Appeal of Quebec upheld the guilty verdict. In this Court appellant raised only one
question: he argued that the rule requiring a judge to warn the jury of the
risk of basing a guilty verdict on the uncorroborated testimony of an
accomplice extends to an accessory after the fact. Respondent contended that
even if appellant was correct on this point, the appeal should be dismissed in
accordance with s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code , which
provides that “notwithstanding that the Court is of the opinion that… the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant”, on the ground that the
trial judgment constituted an erroneous decision on a point of law, it may
dismiss the appeal if “it is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice has occurred”.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Appellant’s argument must be admitted on the
first point. In Paradis v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 264, this Court in
fact held that the same rule of caution must be applied to the testimony of an
accessory after the fact as to that of an accomplice. Although it was not
absolutely necessary to do so in order to dispose of the appeal, the Court has
ruled on the point and this interpretation must be followed.

However, in light of the evidence and taking
into consideration all the circumstances of the case, respondent’s argument
based on s. 613(1) (b)(iii) Cr.C . must be allowed. Although the
trial judge did not apply the rule of caution mentioned above to the testimony
of an

[Page 528]

accessory after the fact, he nonetheless
instructed the jury on the credibility of witnesses and the factors by which it
may be affected. In particular, he asked the jury to consider Welch’s
character, his reputation, in conjunction with his past conduct and his action
in the case at bar. Urging the jurors to caution because Welch was an accessory
after the fact would not have had a different effect on them from that produced
by the caution contained in the judge’s remarks. Accordingly, no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred. Moreover, apart from Welch’s
testimony, the evidence appears to be overwhelming.

Edward Island v. Egan, [1941] S.C.R. 396; Schwartz v. The Queen, [1977]

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec[1],
affirming a guilty verdict renderd by a jury of the Superior Court, criminal
side. Appeal dismissed.

Jean R. Salois, for the appellant.

Ronald Schachter, for the respondent.

English version of the judgment of the Court
delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—Only one question is raised by
appellant, namely whether the rule requiring a judge to warn the jury of the
risk of basing a guilty verdict on the uncorroborated testimony of an
accomplice extends to an accessory after the fact.

The justification for this rule is the interest
which an accomplice is presumed to have in attributing responsibility for a
crime to another person in order thereby to exculpate himself. Some believe
that an accessory after the fact lacks this interest, since his crime is
distinct and subsequent and he escapes all liability if the person he helped is
acquitted. Others take the view that he may nonetheless have an interest likely
to lessen his

[Page 529]

credibility, as for example in co-operating with
the prosecution in the hope of a lighter sentence. Briefly stated, these are
the two approaches between which opinion has long been divided.

However, in Paradis v. The Queen[2], a majority of this Court expressed the
opinion that the same rule of caution must be applied to the testimony of an
accessory after the fact as to that of an accomplice, and in my opinion,
therefore, this is the interpretation that must prevail.

As it does from time to time, the Court has thus
ruled on the point, although it was not absolutely necessary to do so in order
to dispose of the appeal.

In Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward
Island v. Egan[3], which
has since been followed on the constitutional question decided in that case,
Rinfret J., as he then was, wrote at pp. 411 and 412:

The Supreme Court en banc, however,
thought it advisable to deal with the question of the constitutionality of
section 84(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, 1936, since the Criminal
Code  has enacted sec. 285 , subs. 7, amended by sec. 6  of
ch. 30 of the Statutes of Canada, 3 Geo. VI (1939). And that Court
declared ultra vires the provision of the Highway Traffic Act “as
to cancellation of a licence on a conviction for driving a motor car whilst
intoxicated.”

It is because of the declaration on that
point that the Attorney-General of Prince Edward Island has carried his appeal
to this Court and that the Attorney-General of Canada and the Attorney-General
for Ontario have been allowed to intervene. It was represented to us that this
declaration has an important and wide consequence and that, while only an obiter
dictum, it might affect the jurisprudence not only in Prince Edward Island
but also in other provinces. It appears desirable, therefore, that this Court
should express its opinion upon the matter.

Similarly, in Schwartz v. The Queen[4], the Court, although this was not necessary
to its decision, expressed a majority opinion on the meaning of the word
“wrong” in s. 16(2)  of the Criminal Code . Martland J. wrote at pp.
694 and 695:

[Page 530]

In my opinion the judge’s charge upon the
meaning of the word “wrong” in s. 16(2)  was not erroneous. I propose to
deal with this issue only because the matter was fully argued before us, and it
would be desirable that an expression of opinion on this point by this Court
should be made.

See also Switzman v. Elbling[5], and R. v. Zelensky[6].

In Attorney General for the Province of
Quebec v. Cohen[7], the
Court affirmed the authority of a statement of principle contained in one of
its decisions. Pigeon J., speaking for the Court, wrote at p. 308:

I cannot accept that what was said in Patterson
by the two judges who disagreed with Judson J. on what he said in the last
quoted paragraph, although one of them agreed on the conclusion, in any way
detracts from the authority of this statement of principle approved by a
majority of this Court.

The Patterson[8] decision, was also followed by the Court of
Appeal of Alberta in Re Depagie and The Queen[9], in which McDermid J., citing the same
passage as Pigeon J. in Cohen, wrote on behalf of the majority, at
p. 92:

…However, even if the last paragraph of the
judgment I have quoted is obiter, as stated by Bouck, J., in R. v.
Hubbard et al., [1976] 3 W.W.R. 152, I would not feel justified in not
following it even if I thought it was not in accord with the previous
authorities.

In Ottawa v. Nepean Township et al.[10], Robertson C.J. wrote for the Court of
Appeal of Ontario, at p. 804:

…What was there said may be obiter, but
it was the considered opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada, and we should
respect it and follow it even if we are not strictly bound by it.

In the case at bar the trial judge did not apply
the foregoing rule, as in his opinion it did not apply to the testimony of an
accessory after the fact. He said the following in his charge to the jury:

[Page 531]

…Witness Welch was not an accomplice
because he was not one who knowingly and voluntarily cooperated with or
assisted or advised or encouraged another to commit a crime.

If and it would appear that he was an
accessory after the fact, he is not an accomplice in the sense that I must warn
you of the danger of condemning the accused on the strength of his uncorroborated
testimony.

It should be mentioned that the judge’s charge
dates back to July 5, 1976, before the judgment of this Court in Paradis, which
was handed down on February 8, 1977. The trial judge properly relied on the
judgment of the Court of Appeal in the same case, handed down on January 7,
1975.

However, in the case at bar, a majority judgment
of the Court of Appeal of Quebec dismissed the ground of appeal based on the
failure to apply this rule.

In view of the foregoing conclusion that, as
determined by this Court in Paradis, the same rule must be applied to
the testimony of an accessory after the fact, appellant’s argument on this
point must be upheld.

However, respondent contended that the appeal
should be dismissed nonetheless, pursuant to s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code , which reads:

613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal
against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit, on
account of insanity, to stand his trial, or against a special verdict of not
guilty on account of insanity, the court of appeal

(a) …

(b) may dismiss the appeal
where

…

(iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
the opinion that on any ground mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii) the
appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is of the opinion that
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.

In light of the evidence, and taking into
consideration all the circumstances of this case, I would dismiss the appeal on
this ground.

[Page 532]

The facts are summarized by Dubé J. of the Court
of Appeal as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Pierre Côté, a bachelor,
residing at 34 rue Claudel, Lévis, was last seen alive on August 23, 1975 at
Lévis by his sister-in-law, Mrs. Hélène Carrier Côté; at the time he was
in possession of his car, a yellow-gold 1972 Mustang, registered in his name
with licence number 254A671.

On October 4, 1975, at St-Philippe de Néri,
ninety-five (95) miles east of Quebec City, a youth named Philippe Bélanger
found a body in an advanced state of decomposition in the forest: subsequent
research showed the body to be that of Pierre Côté.

Pierre Côté’s cause of death was attributed
to two 22-calibre revolver bullets found in the skull of the victim.

On February 3, 1976, a car which was
subsequently identified as that of Pierre Coté was seen on a parking lot at
Fredericton in New Brunswick; Joseph-Pierre Chauvin, a member of the RCMP
disguised as an ordinary citizen, met with appellant Sellars who lived in
Fredericton, and the latter told him that he had the car in question for sale
for the sum of $1,500 from the real owner, who was planning to report his car
as stolen and so claim the amount from his insurance company.

The foregoing facts are not in dispute and
no evidence was presented to rebut them.

At the hearing, one Ralph Welch testified
that he was a friend of Sellars and that he had sold him an old 22-calibre
revolver in July 1975. He stated that he saw Sellars in possession of Pierre
Côté’s automobile in Fredericton during the weekend before the Labour Day
holiday, that is at the end of August; Sellars told him that he had received
the car in payment of a debt, but that he had no registration; Welch further
stated in his testimony that Sellars told him that he had killed a man with the
22 revolver which he had bought from him, and had subsequently gotten rid of
the revolver by throwing it away.

Welch stated that he helped Sellars clean
up Pierre Côté’s car and found in it a watch, which he gave to one of his
friends who had apparently since lost it; he also discovered a case used to
keep identification papers, which he turned over to the RCMP.

Ralph Welch stated that he had previously
been found guilty of unlawful possession of alcoholic bever-

[Page 533]

ages, and stated that he had obtained by
theft the revolver which he sold to Sellars.

An expert witness for the Crown on
firearms, a physicist named Antoons, stated that the two bullets found in the
head of the victim, Pierre Côté, came from two different weapons; however, in a
subsequent report Antoons added that it was possible for the two bullets to
have been fired by the same weapon, if the weapon was an old and defective
revolver. Welch stated that the weapon he sold Sellars was “sound, but it was
very old and dirty”.

Appellant did not testify and called no
witnesses.

While the judge did not apply the rule mentioned
above to the testimony of an accessory after the fact, he nonetheless
instructed the jury on the credibility of witnesses and the factors by which it
may be affected, in particular the interest which a witness may have, and in
the case of Welch in particular, his reputation.

To begin with, he said:

The next subject I am going to speak to you
about is the credibility or truthfulness of witnesses. You have had in this
case an opportunity of hearing evidence by various witnesses; giving accounts
of what occurred. You must bring to bear upon the question of credibility or
the truthfulness of a witness your experience as men and women in the ordinary
affairs of life. You may believe all the evidence given by a witness, a part of
the evidence given by the witness or none of the evidence given by a witness.

When deciding upon the credibility of a
witness or the weight you are going to give to the evidence of a witness you
should consider what chance the witness had to observe the facts to which he or
she testified and how capable the witness is of giving an accurate account of
what he or she saw or heard. You must also decide whether the witness is biased
or prejudiced. Whether the witness has any interest in the case. These are the
principal factors which must be considered when deciding upon the credibility
or the truthfulness of a witness or the weight to be attached to the evidence
of a witness.

He later stated, with respect to Welch:

I want to say a word about Welch and how
you should consider his testimony. Witness Welch was not an accomplice because
he was not one who knowingly and voluntarily co-operated with or assisted or
advised or

[Page 534]

encouraged another to commit a crime.

If and it would appear that he was an
accessory after the fact, he is not an accomplice in the sense that I must warn
you of the danger of condemning the accused on the strength of his
uncorroborated testimony. But there have been statements by our higher Courts
to the effect that evidence given by a disreputable person even though he is
not an accomplice must be scrutinized and weighed with the greatest care. Is
Welch a disreputable person in the eye of the law? Is he disreputable because
he was convicted at an early age of possessing liquor? It is true he admitted
that he stole the revolver in question and that he tried also to sell the
automobile which he must have known did not come from the lawful owner.

I make those remarks about Welch’s
testimony. I leave it to you to decide how much credit you will place on his
testimony after seeing him in the witness box.

In my opinion, the judge’s remarks constitute a
caution. In particular, the judge alluded to the interest which a witness may
have, and this is the justification for the rule of caution regarding the
uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. He further asked the jury to
consider Welch’s character, his reputation, in conjunction with his past
conduct and his actions in the case at bar, after telling them “evidence given
by a disreputable person even though he is not an accomplice must be
scrutinized and weighed with the greatest care”. The judge then stated that he
left it to the jury to determine the credibility of the witness. I do not
consider that urging the jurors to caution because Welch was an accessory after
the fact would have had a different effect on them from that produced by the
foregoing remarks, and I have no hesitation in concluding that, in my opinion,
no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred.

This conclusion is strengthened by the fact
that, quite apart from Welch’s testimony, the evidence appears to be
overwhelming in the absence of some explanation: in particular, the possession
of the victim’s car, the attempt to sell it to a member of the RCMP, and the
reasons given to the latter for selling it.

[Page 535]

In Avon v. The Queen[11], Fauteux C.J., speaking for the majority,
wrote at pp. 656 and 657 a passage which I think it is appropriate to cite:

As far as the second grievance raised by
appellant is concerned, namely the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury
on an accomplice’s testimony, Owen J. speaking on behalf of all his colleagues
on the Court of Appeal, stated:

However, after considering the record I am
of the opinion that a reasonable jury, after being properly directed, would
necessarily have found the Appellant guilty of non-capital murder. Therefore, I
think this is a case for the application of the provisions of Section 592(1) (b)(iii)
Cr.C . In my opinion no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred
by reason of the defective charge with respect to accomplices.

I respectfully agree with these views, and
would only add this passage taken from the reasons of Sloan C.J. in The
Queen v. Pavlukoff (1953), 106 C.C.C. 249, 17 C.R. 215, 10 W.W.R. (N.S.)26:

…the fact that accused did not testify in
the face of inculpatory facts was a matter which the Court of Appeal could
place on the scale in applying s. 1014(2).

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Trial—Election by
accused—Re-election—Whether accused properly re‑elected trial by judge
alone—Compliance with Code provisions—Criminal Code , ss. 492 , 496 .

Respondents, Dwyer and Lauzon, were convicted
on indictment of receiving and giving a bribe respectively under s. 109 of the Code.
The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial because,
the accused not having elected of re-elected in the manner prescribed by the Code
for trial by judge alone, the trial and convictions were a nullity. The
issue raised on appeal is whether ther was an effective re-election.

Respondents were charged under an information
consisting of one count and committed to trial. Other informations were
outstanding with reference to them but no other preliminary hearing was held
although counsel agreed that the preliminary hearing and the evidence there
taken would apply to the other outstanding matters. An indictment dated
November 29, 1976, containing six counts was ultimately preferred. On December 22, 1976, Lauzon through counsel advised
the sheriff at Ottawa of his
wish to re-elect trial by judge alone. On January 10, 1977, counsel for
both accused appeared to fix a date for election and trial. In an affidavit
counsel for Lauzon stated that the letter of December 22 was written “to the
Sheriffs office” to say that both co-accused would be re-electing trial by
judge alone. While this may have been sworn in error it was not contradicted in
the record and the letter was apparently acknowledged and relied upon by
counsel for both accused before Weatherston J. and thereafter before the late
Garrett J. The trial began before Garrett J. on February 8, 1977, when there was inter
alia a discussion as to election proceedings. Counsel for both accused
indicated that they regarded the matter as properly before the judge alone. On
appeal the Crown position

[Page 482]

was that either there had been an effective
re-election in compliance with s. 492 of the Code or that there was an
express waiver by the accused of a jury trial. The Court of Appeal however was
of opinion that in the absence of a re-election the trial judge was precluded
from trying the case without a jury. That Court rejected any notion of
substantial compliance with s. 492  or that the respondents had waived
their right to re-election.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

The appeal turns on the precise meaning of
the s. 492  when read as a whole. In this case there was no question of
substantial compliance because the respondents had complied precisely with the
provisions of the section and in the sequence prescribed.

Section 492(1) creates a right in an
accused to reelect to be tried by a judge without a jury. The accused expressed
desire(s) to re-elect, both accused attended at the time and place fixed by
subs. (2) for trial, and, after the charge had been read, made the election
prescribed by subs. (1). There is no question that such an election can be made
through counsel in the presence of the accused, as was done here. There was
therefore a proper re‑election. Further, while s. 496  provides that
following a re-election a new indictment in Form 4 shall be preferred by the
Attorney General or his agent the failure to prefer such after re-election
rather than proceeding on the old indictment did not affect the validity of the
proceedings particularly since here the indictment was already in Form 4.

Finally, while s. 492(3) provides that “after
the charge upon which he has been committed for trial…has been read to him” the
accused shall “be put to his election”, this should be interpreted as requiring
the accused to hear the actual charge with which he is faced before he
is required to make his election as to the mode of trial. The Court of Appeal
erred in its conclusion that the initial charge, i.e., the one contained in the
information was the charge which had to be read to the accused and that
following re-election the new indictment preferred pursuant s. 496  “would have
been prepared and formed the basis of the trial”.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1] allowing appeals by
the accused from convictions for accepting a bribe and bribing a police officer
contrary to s. 109 (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code . Appeal
allowed, convictions restored.

Lauzon.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

ESTEY J.—The respondents, Dwyer and Lauzon, were
convicted of receiving and giving a bribe respectively under s. 109  of the Criminal
Code  pursuant to an indictment preferred in the Supreme Court of Ontario,
by Garrett J. sitting without a jury. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction
and ordered a new trial on the principal ground that the accused, not having
elected or re-elected in the manner prescribed by the Criminal Code  for
trial by judge alone, the trial and convictions were a nullity.

The issue raised by the Crown on this appeal is
simply whether there was an effective re‑election by the respondents of
trial of the charges brought against them by a judge sitting without a jury.
This issue calls for the interpretation of many of the procedural provisions in
the Criminal Code  relating to the preferring of indictments, the forum
for the trial of certain offences including those under s. 109  of the Criminal
Code  and the many inter-related provisions concerning the rights of the
accused to elect and to re-elect forum and mode of trial. I propose to dispose
of the appeal with reference to the latter provisions only because if the
respondents have in law re-elected, as submitted by the Crow, trial by judge
sitting without a jury, it is unnecessary to proceed to the other issues raised
by the respondents.

[Page 484]

The principal provision with which we are here
concerned is s. 492  which provides:

492. (1) Where an accused has elected or is
deemed to have elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury, the
accused may notify the sheriff in the territorial division in which he is to be
tried that he desires to re-elect under this section,

(a) to be tried by a judge without a
jury; or

(b) if he has the consent in writing
of the Attorney General or counsel acting on his behalf, to be tried by a
magistrate without a jury.

(2) A sheriff who receives a notice and a
consent, if required, pursuant to subsection (1) shall forthwith inform a
judge or magistrate having jurisdiction and the judge or magistrate, as the
case may be, shall fix a time and place for the accused to re-elect and shall
cause notice thereof to be given to the accused.

(3) The accused shall attend or, if he is
in custody, shall be produced at the time and place fixed under
subsection (2) and shall, after the charge upon which he has been
committed for trial or ordered to stand trial has been read to him,

(a) if the notice states that the
accused desires to re-elect to be tried by a judge without a jury, be put to
his election in the following words:

You have elected or are deemed to have
elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. Do you now elect
to be tried by a judge without a jury?

or

(b) if the notice states that the
accused desires to re-elect to be tried by a magistrate without a jury, be put to
his election in the following words:

You have elected or are deemed to have
elected to be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. Do you now elect
to be tried by a magistrate without a jury?

(4) Where an accused elects under this
section to be tried by a judge without a jury or a magistrate without a
jury, the judge or magistrate, as the case may be, shall proceed with the trial
or fix a time and place for the trial.

(5) Where an accused who desires to
re-elect to be tried by a judge without a jury does not notify the sheriff in
accordance with subsection (1) more than fourteen days before the day
fixed for the opening of the sittings or session of the court sitting with a
jury by

[Page 485]

which he is to be tried, no election may be
made under this section unless the Attorney General or counsel acting on
his behalf consents in writing.

Before dealing in detail with the operative
provisions of this section, something should be said about the procedural
history of this prosecution. The respondents were originally charged under an
information consisting of one count as a result of which the respondents were
committed to trial. Other informations were outstanding with reference to the
respondents but no other preliminary hearing was held although it was agreed
between counsel representing the accused and the Crown that this preliminary
hearing and the evidence taken therein would be deemed to apply to the other
informations then outstanding. Counsel for the respondents later withdrew from
this agreement. An indictment dated November 29, 1976 containing six counts was
ultimately preferred. Parallel proceedings in the Supreme Court of Ontario
culminating in the quashing of another indictment in which the respondents were
accused are of no interest in these proceedings. In the indictment with which
we are concerned, count 1 approximates the charge in the aforementioned initial
information.

By letter dated December 22, 1976, the respondent Lauzon,
through counsel, advised the Sheriff at Ottawa:

re: Regina vs Clause Dwyer and Richard Lauzon

Please be advised that we act for Richard
Lauzon who is to appear in the Supreme Court of Ontario at the Sittings
commencing the 10th January.

Originally, Mr. Lauzon had elected
trial by Judge and Jury. However, subsequent to that date, namely, on or about
the 17th November, 1976 the Crown preferred an indictment with the consent of
the Attorney General under section 507.

In view of this, please be advised that the
accused Lauzon now wishes to re-elect trial by Judge alone under
Section 492 .

I am sending a copy of this letter to the
Crown Attorney’s office.

[Page 486]

On January 10, 1977, counsel for both accused
appeared before Weatherston J. for the purpose of fixing a date for election
and trial. In an affidavit forming part of the record before this Court,
counsel for the respondent Lauzon at trial states that the letter of December
22, quoted above was written “to the Sheriffs office” to say that both
co-accused would be re‑electing trial by judge alone. While counsel for Lauzon
before this Court stated that this must have been sworn in error, the fact is
that the affidavit was sworn on December 27, 1977 and has not been contradicted
in the record, and the letter of December 22 was apparently acknowledged and
relied upon by counsel for both accused before Weatherston J. and thereafter
before the late Mr. Justice Garrett.

The trial was convened before Garrett J. in Ottawa on February 8, 1977 as directed by
Weatherston J. At the opening of trial, a considerable discussion ensued
concerning the collateral proceedings with respect to the indictment quashed by
Goodman J., and thereafter the accused were arraigned and all six counts of the
indictment were read by the Registrar. After a discussion concerning the
propriety of the form of the indictment and its preferment in the Court, and a
discussion of the election proceedings to which I will refer below, the two
accused then pleaded “not guilty.”

I turn back to the issue of re-election and the
events connected therewith before Garrett J. Because of the lengthy and
complete argument which took place before this Court wherein every apparent
facet of the proceedings and the procedure was examined, I set out the entire
discourse between Garrett J. and counsel on this subject:

HIS LORDSHIP: NOW this is something,
Mr. Reilly, that I’m afraid that I haven’t looked into myself but as I
recall matters, I understand there is no longer any election in these cases—

MR. REILLY: NO, sir.

HIS LORSDSHIP:—(continued) it’s a
request for a plea, and then the matter proceeds.

[Page 487]

MR. REILLY: That’s right. Perhaps,
sir, I would like one matter on the record.

The right to proceed before your lordship
presiding as a judge of the Superior Court of Criminal Jurisdiction sitting
alone is something, of course, that has been exercised fairly recently. It is
probably something that was not originally anticipated by Parliament when they
allowed provisions for re-election, definition of your lordship as a judge,
etcetera to give that right.

I would like on the record, sir, that my
friends have in fact requested that I prefer the indictment in this court, that
is in your lordship’s court, sitting as a judge in the Superior Court of
Criminal Jurisdiction without a jury. There is no question you have the right,
sir, to hear charges, and I would like my friends’ indication—

HIS LORDSHIP: Rightly or wrongly, I
apprehend a Supreme Court judge can try anything at an assize—

MR. REILLY: That’s right, sir—

HIS LORDSHIP:—(continued) which is
contained in the Criminal Code .

MR. REILLY: That’s right, sir. I would
like my friends’ agreement on the record that it’s at their request that I
prefer this indictment in this forum and they in fact attorn to your
jurisdiction.

HIS LORDSHIP: Mr. Chilcott?

MR. CHILCOTT: My lord, there is no
question about that. It is, as far as Lauzon is concerned properly before your
lordship, and again as far as Lauzon is concerned, we ask that it be tried
without a jury.

HIS LORDSHIP: Mr. Houston.

MR. HOUSTON: Insofar as Mr. Dwyer
is concerned, my lord, I completely adopt my friend, Mr. Chilcott’s
statement.

HIS LORDSHIP: Mr. Simpson?

[Page 488]

MR. SIMPSON: I adopt, my friend,
Mr. Chilcott’s statement.

The Crown takes the position that either there
has been an effective re-election in compliance with s. 492 , or alternatively,
that there was an express waiver by the accused of a jury trial in such a way
as to give the trial judge jurisdiction over the accused to try them without
the intervention of a jury. The Court of Appeal in a unanimous judgment stated,
through Lacourciere J.A.:

We are all of the view therefore, that
Garrett J., in the absence of a re-election, was precluded from trying the case
without a jury.

In the course of reaching such conclusion, the
Court rejected any notion of “substantial compliance” with the provisions of s.
492 , or that the respondents, represented as they were by experienced counsel,
had “waived their right to a re-election or dispensed the presiding judge with
his duty to comply with the procedure which was a condition precedent to his
jurisdiction to try these offences without a jury.”

The respondents support the decision below on
the basis that:

(a) there was no compliance whatever with
the requirements of s. 492 ;

(b) the provisions of s. 492  are mandatory
and complete compliance is a condition precedent to the jurisdiction of a trial
judge hearing the charges without a jury;

(c) the respondents had no capacity in law
to waive compliance with s. 492 ;

(d) finally, the respondents meet the
appellant’s submissions with the argument that the question as to whether there
was substantial compliance with s. 492  is a mixed question of fact and law, and
not open to the appellant in this Court.

The last mentioned submission by the respondents
was put to rest in the recent judgment of this

[Page 489]

Court in R. v. Moreau[2] where, speaking for the majority of the
Court, Beetz J. stated at p. 274:

I now briefly turn to the other issue, that
is whether the main issue raises a question of law. I think it does. It hinges
upon the interpretation of a provision of the Criminal Code : what is
capable of being “evidence to the contrary” within the meaning of s. 237(1) (c)?
The Courts of Appeal of Nova Scotia, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan
have indicated that they consider the issue as a question of law: Shafer v. Regina
[1971] 5 W.W.R. 692; R. v. Gaetz (1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 3; R. v. Westman
(1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 355; R. v. Davis (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 573; R.
v. Falkenham (1974), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 385. I agree with their approach on this
point.

Here the Court is engaged with a determination
of the proper interpretation in law of the provision contained in s. 492 , and
therefore, the submission of the appellant with reference to compliance or
substantial compliance with the Code provisions raises a question of
law.

This appeal turns upon the meaning of the
detailed provisions and subprovisions of the section when read as a whole.
It is hardly necessary to observe that the patent purpose of the
section is to create a right in an accused person to re-elect to be tried
by a judge without a jury even after the accused has elected once before to be
tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. This section is part of a
complex network of sections which in effect give an accused in many instances
at least five alternative modes of trial, being: trial by magistrate without a
jury (subject to the qualification of consent of the Attorney General in some
instances); trial by a county court judge without a jury; trial in the county
court before judge and jury; trial in the supreme court (where the province
distinguishes between county and superior court) by a court composed of judge
and jury; and finally, trial before a supreme court judge sitting without a
jury. The interaction of the many sections of the Code setting out
these rights and these procedures is very complex, but dealing with s. 492 
there are certain features of this statutory provision which are abundantly
clear.

[Page 490]

Subsection 1, for example, clearly creates
a right in an accused to re-elect to be tried by a judge without a jury. This
right both accused set out to exercise as can be seen by the letter and the
affidavit described above, and the appearance before Weatherston J. There is no
question of waiver or substantial compliance with subs. 1. The accused clearly
expressed a “desire(s) to re-elect under this section…”

As for subs. 3, both accused clearly attended at
the time and place fixed under subs. 2 for trial, and after the charge had been
read, made the election described in subs. 1. It was not submitted before us
that such an election cannot be made through the intervention of counsel in the
presence of the accused, as was done here. In my reading of the section as
a whole, and particularly when such reading is made in the context of the
pattern established in the Code for the election and reelection by the
accused of modes and level of trial, the accused through counsel may excuse the
court from reading subs. 3 and may proceed directly to the communication of the
election. This must be so, particularly where the notice under subs. 1 and 2
expressly states that the re-election is being made under s. 492 . It is not a
question of a waiver of a right by the respondents or by the appellant or by
the Court. The respondents, being aware of the formal question, simply answered
it by an essential repetition of the letter of notice already given.

Subsection 2 deals with the action by the
Sheriff acting in the course of the administration of justice upon receipt of a
notice given under subs. 1. The Sheriff must have responded by arranging the
hearing before Weatherston J. who in turn fixed the date for trial before
Garrett J.

Subsection 4 directs that the judge on
receiving the election of the accused shall proceed with the trial or fix a
time and place for the trial. Garrett J. proceeded with the trial forthwith in
the manner requested by the respondents in their re-election.

[Page 491]

Subsection 5 is not here applicable because
the respondents did notify the Sheriff in the manner set out above.

I therefore conclude that there is no question
here of substantial compliance because the respondents have complied precisely
with the provisions of s. 492  and in the sequence prescribed by that section.
Fortunately, we are not called upon to determine, and I specifically refrain
from so determining, whether substantial compliancce with s. 492(3) would
indeed be sufficient for the purposes of re-election under the section. If we
were by the facts and circumstances here called upon to answer such a question,
considerable support could be found in the line of reasoning applied by the
Court of Appeal of the Province of Alberta in R. v. Sydney MacKenzie (unreported,
released March 22, 1978) where Sinclair J.A., speaking for the Court stated:

In my view the election put to the accused
in the present case was substantially in the language of
Section 492(3)(a), and could have left them in no doubt that they had a
choice of trial by judge alone or by judge and jury. [emphasis added]

It should be added that if any relaxation of the
rules had occurred here such would not have been done so as to diminish any
rights of the accused, but in fact would have taken place at their request.
Mr. Manning was very frank in acknowledging that this was so and with proper
candour advanced the case of the respondent Dwyer on purely technical grounds.

Upon a re-election under s. 492  other
sections come into operation including s. 496  which prescribes that the
indictment in Form 4 shall be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent.
Here the indictment which had been presented to the Court by the Crown Attorney
was that which had been drawn up on November 29, 1976. After the election, the
pleas of the respondents to that indictment were taken. No new indictment was
prepared and preferred by the Attorney General or his agent. This procedure was
precisely the same as that with which the court was concerned in R. v.

[Page 492]

Caccamo and Caccamo[3], where Gale C.J.O.,
speaking on behalf of the Court, stated:

Another point was taken with respect to the
fact that s. 496(1) was not complied with in that after defence counsel
re-elected for a trial by Judge alone, a new indictment in Form 4 was not
preferred and that trial proceeded on the form of indictment normally used in
the Court of General Sessions of the Peace. May I say, in the first place, that
this has not heretofore been raised, either at the trial, in the notice of
appeal, or in the memorandum of fact and law filed on behalf of the appellant.
But, in any event, the fact that the form of the indictment was not altered did
not constitute an error such as to deprive the Judge of jurisdiction. The
indictment in Form 4 is substantially the same as the form of the indictment in
Form 3, with respect to notifying the accused of that with which he was
charged. It would be shocking that an eight-day trial could be rendered
abortive if this point could be raised successfully at or near the conclusion
of the trial.

As in that case, neither respondent made any
issue of the failure to prefer a new indictment at the opening of trial, in the
Court of Appeal, or before this Court. I adopt the reasoning of the Chief
Justice of Ontario and conclude that the failure to prefer a new indictment
after re-election rather than proceeding on the indictment dated November 29,
1976 does not affect the validity of the ensuing proceedings before Garrett J.
In this case, the requirement of the preferment of an additional indictment is
of even less substantive import because the indictment of November 29, 1976 does not follow Form 3 in any
case, but is in the form prescribed in Form 4. The indictment upon which the
trial proceeded was preferred in the manner prescribed by subs. 1 of s. 496  and
bore the written consent of the Attorney General of Ontario as required by the
section. The section contemplates, and indeed authorizes, the inclusion of
a number of counts in an indictment, as was the case here, with reference to
the requirement in subs. 2 of s. 496  that an indictment may include:

(b) counts relating to offences
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or
in substitution for any offence for which the accused was committed for trial.

[Page 493]

The Court of Appeal stated:

At the trial, counsel (who were not the
same as counsel on appeal), were in agreement that all the evidence that could
have been heard on any of the six counts in the indictment was heard at the
preliminary inquiry. On the hearing of this appeal, Mr. Manning was
prepared to admit that this was so, but Mr. Ruby was not prepared to make
this admission. There can be no question that defence counsel had the
opportunity to hear and cross-examine every Crown witness at a preliminary
inquiry, although in strictness, there was no preliminary inquiry conducted with
respect to counts 2 to 6 inclusively.

No evidence was drawn to the attention of this
Court which would indicate any error on the part of the Court of Appeal in
reaching this conclusion.

There remains to be considered whether s. 492(3)
has been complied with in that the charge read to the respondents on the
opening of the trial was the indictment, and the six counts included therein,
dated November 29, 1976, rather than the information as originally laid and
which, of course, included only the charge described somewhat differently in
count 1 of the indictment. The date of the information upon which the
preliminary hearing was held is not revealed in the record but after the
preliminary hearing therein had been completed, the indictment upon which the
trial proceeded was drawn up and placed before Mr. Justice Donahue on
December 6, 1976. It was, of course, before Weatherston J. in the hearing
pursuant to subs. 2 of s. 492 , on January 10, 1977. Subsection 3
prescribes that “after the charge upon which he has been committed for trial or
ordered to stand trial has been read to him,” the accused shall, pursuant to
subs. 3(a) “be put to his election…” It is difficult to interpret those
words as requiring that there be read to the accused a form of charge which, by
the stage of the proceedings then reached, has been replaced by a preferred
indictment. I interpret the subsection, therefore, as requiring that the
accused hear the actual charge with which he is faced before he is required to
make his election as to the mode of trial. Any other interpretation would
expose the accused to being misled as to the nature of the charge upon which he
is about to be tried at the very moment when he is given the opportunity of
exercising his

[Page 494]

right under the Criminal Code  to select
the nature of the forum for trial. In this case, the problem has little
material content because count 1 and the charge as contained in the information
are substantially the same, the only variances being:

(a) The information specified that the offence
occurred “at the City of Vanier
and elsewhere in the Province
of Ontario” whereas count 1 of the indictment is limited to the City of Vanier;

(b) The information charged the respondents
with conspiring with one another “and with divers other persons,” whereas the
indictment confines the conspiracy to the two respondents;

(c) The original information charged the
respondents with “corrupt payments of money”, whereas the indictment adds “or
other valuable consideration”; and,

(d) The information specified that such
payment was made with intent to interfere with the administration of justice
whereas the indictment alleges the subject was done with the intent that the
respondent Dwyer should protect from detection or punishment the respondent
Lauzon who had committed or intended to commit offences by acting as a keeper
of a common bawdy house.

Both forms of the charge recite ss. 109 and
423(1)(d) of the Code and with the exception of the other items
noted, are identical. I deal with this aspect of s. 492 , although counsel for
the respondents did not raise it, because a parallel argument was made with
reference to the application of s. 507 to the form of indictment in these
circumstances. By reason of the interaction of ss. 492  and 496  it is not
necessary, in my view of this appeal, to deal with the other issues arising
under s. 507 relating to the preferment of the indictment. However, in order to
put to rest the parallel argument under s. 492  which might well have arisen, I
have made the foregoing observations and construe the section as it
relates to these circumstances as requiring the reading of the actual charge
with which the accused is faced at the opening of trial

[Page 495]

and which charge was read to him by the
Registrar of the Court here.

I reach this conclusion with the greatest
respect to the members of the Court below who concluded that the initial
charge, that is the one contained in the information, was the charge which must
be read to the accused and that following re-election, the new indictment
preferred pursuant to s. 496  “would have been prepared and formed the basis of
the trial.” I very much prefer the reasoning followed by the same court in the Caccomo
appeal, supra, as it applies to s. 496 . The sequence of events in
these proceedings, including the quashing of an earlier indictment and the
preferring of an indictment in November 1976, rendered the original charge, as
embodied in the information, completely obsolete and indeed misleading to the
accused at the time of the exercise of his rights under s. 492(1).

We are here, of course, concerned only with the
legality of the convictions.

For these reasons I would therefore allow the
appeal, set aside the order of the Court of Appeal, and restore the conviction
of each respondent as entered at the trial court, together with the sentence
there embodied.

Appeal allowed, convictions and
sentences restored.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Charge of rape—Certiorari—Motion to
quash—Preliminary hearing—Committal for trial—Whether complainant compellable
witness at in camera hearing—Questions on sexual conduct—Adequacy of notice and
particulars—Denial of natural justice—Right to cross-examine—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended, ss. 142, 455.3(1)(a), 468(1)(a).

The appellant and a co-accused were charged with rape. During
the preliminary inquiry, the appellant was denied the right to question the
complainant with respect to her sexual conduct with persons other than himself
in an in camera hearing held pursuant to s. 142(1)  of the Criminal
Code . A request of appellant’s counsel to cross-examine a police sergeant
on the notes he made during an interview with the complainant was also refused.
The appellant was eventually committed for trial and he applied for an order
quashing the committal for trial. The application was dismissed by the Supreme
Court of Ontario and the appeal from that judgment was dismissed by the Court
of Appeal.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

That certiorari may be invoked to quash a committal for
trial is accepted law in Canada, but only in cases of lack or loss of
jurisdiction, which can only occur when a magistrate fails to observe a
mandatory provision of the Criminal Code  or when there is a denial of
natural justice, which denial, in the case of a preliminary inquiry, has to be
a complete denial to the accused of a right to call witnesses or to
cross-examine prosecution witnesses. Mere disallowance of questions on
cross-examination or a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, even if
erroneous, do not go to jurisdiction and do not open the way to certiorari. The
refusal of a request to cross-examine a police sergeant on some notes does not,
therefore, even if wrong, support reviewability on certiorari.

With respect to the in camera hearing, it is the first time

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Defence—Non-insane
automatism—Insanity—Disease of the mind—Question of law—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 16, 542, 545.

At the time of the alleged offence, the
appellant, twenty years of age, was a student at the University of Toronto and shared a number of classes with the complainant for
whom he began to develop strong feelings that were not reciprocated. While
flipping through the complainant’s books, the appellant found a letter she had
written to a female friend in which she described him as one in a “bunch of
nothings”. The appellant was hurt and angry as he read the letter. The
following morning, he removed a rock sample of galena from the geology lab. At noon, he met the complainant by chance and, as
they were talking to each other, the appellant suddenly grabbed her around the
arms and struck her on the head. She lost consciousness momentarily. When she
recovered consciousness, he was choking her… The appellant advanced the defence
of non-insane automatism. He was acquitted at trial, the trial judge finding
that the appellant was not insane within the meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal
Code  and that he had acted in a state of automatism brought about by an
external cause. On appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the acquittal was
reversed and a new trial ordered, the Court holding that the psychological blow
suffered was not an externally originating cause of the dissociative state.

Held (Dickson,
Estey and Mclntyre JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.: The meaning of the word “automatism”, in any
event so far as it is employed in the defence of non-insane automatism, is a
term used to describe unconscious, involuntary behaviour, the state of a person
who though capable of action is not conscious of what he is doing. What is said
here is that, although the defence of non-insane automatism is available to the
appellant, he was not suffering from a disease of the mind and was therefore
not insane

[Page 514]

and could not be committed to an institution.
The central question in deciding any case involving the defence of automatism
is whether or not the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind. The
opinions of psychiatrists go no further than characterizing the condition in
which the appellant was found as being “a dissociative state” but it is clear
that the question of whether or not such a state amounts to “a disease of the
mind” is a question of law for the judge to determine. In general, the
distinction to be drawn is between a malfunctioning of the mind arising from
some cause that is primarily internal to the accused, as opposed to a
malfunctioning of the mind, which is the transient effect produced by some
specific external factor and which does not fall within the concept of disease
of the mind. The ordinary stresses and disappointments of life which are the
common lot of mankind do not constitute an external cause constituting an
explanation for a malfunctioning of the mind which takes it out of the category
of a “disease of the mind”.

Here, it seems that the accused’s infatuation
with the complainant had created an abnormal condition in his mind under the
influence of which he acted unnaturally and violently to an imagined slight to
which a normal person would not have reacted in the same manner. The
confinement to an institution does not involve gross unfairness to the
appellant for, under ss. 545  and 547  of the Criminal Code , the
Lieutenant-Governor may order the discharge of the person found not guilty.

Per Dickson,
Estey and Mclntyre JJ., dissenting: The issue in this appeal is whether
automatism resulting from a “psychological blow” is available to an accused in
answer to a charge of causing bodily harm with intent to wound. The theory of
the defence was that the appellant’s behavior was caused by a psychological
blow, an intense emotional shock which induced a “dissociative state”, during
which for a time, the appellant was neither conscious of nor able to control
his conduct, so that it was involuntary. This is sometimes spoken of as
non-insane automatism, to distinguish it from the cases in which the state of
automatism is attributable to disease of the mind. The defences of automatism
and insanity are separate and distinct. In the case of insanity, the defect of
the understanding must originate in the disease of the mind, whereas in the
defence of automatism the criminal law is not concerned with any question of
the disease of the mind. Here, medical examinations disclosed no evidence of
neurological disease and no indication of psychotic process, and the Crown did
not challenge the finding of automatism. The only question for decision is
whether, having found automatism, the

[Page 515]

trial judge was bound in law to find that the
appellant was a proper subject for indefinite detention as an insane person or,
in other words, whether the accused, having acted in a state of unconsciousness
while in a transitory mental state, was suffering from a disease of the mind
and had to be committed to an institution.

The first principle fundamental to our
criminal law which governs this appeal is that no act can be a criminal offence
unless it is done voluntarily. The prosecution must prove the state of mind of the
accused. The circumstances are normally such as to permit a presumption of
volition and mental capacity. That is not so when the accused, as here, has
placed before the court evidence sufficient to raise an issue that he was
unconscious of his actions at the time of the alleged offence. No burden of
proof is imposed upon an accused raising such defence beyond pointing to facts
which indicate the existence of such a condition.

The second principle is that no person found
not guilty by reason of insanity should be committed to a hospital for the
criminally insane unless he suffers from disease of the mind in need of
treatment or likely to recur. Here, on medical evidence accepted by the trial
judge, the prospect of a recurrence of dissociation is extremely remote. There
was no finding that the appellant suffered from psychosis, neurosis or
personality disorder. He does not have an organic disease of the brain. This
was an isolated event. The appellant has already spent several weeks in a
mental institution undergoing psychiatric, neurological and psychological
assessment, the result of which did not indicate need for treatment. There are
undoubtedly policy considerations to be considered, such as the in terrorem argument
that the floodgates will be raised if psychological blow automatism is
recognized in law.

There are competing policy interests. Where
the condition is transient rather than persistent, unlikely to recur, not in
need of treatment and not the result of self-induced intoxication, the policy
objectives in finding such a person insane are not served. Such a person is not
a danger to himself or to society generally. The notion cannot be accepted,
that an extraordinary external event, i.e., an intense emotional shock,
can cause a state of dissociation or automatism, if, and only if, all normal
persons subjected to that sort of shock would react in that way. The inquiry is
directed to the accused’s actual

[Page 516]

state of mind. It is his subjective mental
condition with which the law is concerned. Nor can it be accepted that whether
an automatic state is an insane reaction or a sane reaction may depend upon the
intensity of the shock. In principle, the defence of automatism should be
available whenever there is evidence of unconsciousness throughout the
commission of the crime that cannot be attributed to fault or negligence on the
part of the accused. Such evidence should be supported by expert medical
opinion that the accused did not feign memory loss and that there is no
underlying pathological condition which points to a disease requiring detention
and treatment.

v. A.G. Northern Ireland, [1963] A.C. 386, referred to.]

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario[1], allowing an appeal
from the acquittal of the appellant by a Country Court judge and ordering a new trial. Appeal dismissed, Dickson, Estey
and Mclntyre JJ. dissenting.

Michael A. Wadsworth, for the appellant.

Douglas C. Hunt, for the respondent.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon and
Beetz JJ. was delivered by

RITCHIE J.—This is an appeal from a judgment of
the Court of Appeal for Ontario
whereby that Court set aside the appellant’s acquittal at trial for “causing
bodily harm with intent to wound”. The appellant had, at the same time, been
charged with having a rock in his possession “for the purpose of committing the
offence of wounding” but no appeal was taken from his acquittal on this charge.

The circumstances under which the alleged
offences were committed are recounted with accuracy in the reasons for judgment
prepared for delivery by my brother Dickson in this case which I have had the
advantage of reading and also in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice
Martin on behalf of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. An “Agreed Statement of Facts” has also been filed

[Page 517]

as a part of the record in these proceedings
and, when read together with the factual analyses provided by the judges
concerned, it becomes plain that there is no dispute as to the behaviour of the
appellant on February 28 and March 1, 1974. On the former date, he had agreed
to help a girl friend with some work which she was doing for a geology class of
which they were both members and in the course of the afternoon he had access,
while he was alone, to the girl’s notebook in which he found a letter written
to one of her friends disclosing that she considered other members of the
opposite sex more exciting and desirable than the appellant to whom she
referred somewhat obliquely as “a nothing”.

It appears to me to be important to note at this
stage that it is agreed by paragraph 5 of the Agreed Statement of Facts that
“The appellant had never dated any other girl for any length of time and had
only a minimal amount of sexual experience. An introvert, he was infatuated
with the attractive outgoing” (girl). In any event, the appellant took the
letter out of his friend’s notebook and taking it home with him he appears to
have brooded on it during the evening and underlined certain portions.

On the following day (March 1), the appellant
had arranged to watch a friend play a game of squash at about noon and on his
way to the squash courts “quite by chance” he met his girl friend and asked her
to join him; when they reached the squash court, however, they entered a gallery
from which to view the players but no one was playing and they started
downstairs towards the locker area but on reaching the foot of the stairs the
appellant asked the girl what she thought of a mutual friend and upon her
replying that he was “just a friend”, the appellant asked what she thought of
him and it was when she said that he was a friend too that he hit her on the
head with a rock wrapped in cloth which he had brought from the geology
laboratory that morning—the next thing the girl knew was that the appellant was
kneeling on the floor with his hands around her neck choking her and crying out
“You bitch”, “You bitch”.

[Page 518]

I have found it necessary to recite the facts in
skeletal form in order to illustrate the background against which the defence
of non-insane automatism was advanced on behalf of the appellant.

It should be observed also that the appellant
was subjected to a number of interviews with psychiatrists with the result that
the courts have found themselves involved in the shadowy area of mental
disorders concerning which it is not surprising to find that there are wide
differences in opinion amongst the “experts”. The meaning of the word
“automatism”, in any event so far as it is employed in the defence of
non-insane automatism, has, in my opinion, been satisfactorily defined by
Mr. Justice Lacourcière of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in the case of R.
v. K.[2]:

Automatism is a term used to describe
unconscious, involuntary behaviour, the state of a person who, though capable
of action is not conscious of what he is doing. It means an unconscious
involuntary act where the mind does not go with what is being done.

The defence of automatism as used in the present
case of course involves a consideration of the provisions of s. 16  of the Criminal
Code  which read as follows:

16. (1) No person shall be convicted of an
offence in respect of an act or omission on his part while he was insane.

(2) For the purposes of this section a
person is insane when he is in a state of natural imbecility or has disease of
the mind to an extent that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and
quality of an act or omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong.

(3) A person who has specific delusions,
but is in other respects sane, shall not be acquitted on the ground of insanity
unless the delusions caused him to believe in the existence of a state of
things that, if it existed, would have justified or excused his act or
omission.

(4) Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 16 .

What is said here is that although at the
relevant time the appellant was in a state where,

[Page 519]

though capable of action he was not conscious of
what he was doing, and more particularly that he was not suffering from a
disease of the mind and was therefore not insane. The central question in
deciding any case involving the defence of automatism is whether or not the
accused was suffering from a disease of the mind. The opinions of psychiatrists
go no further than characterizing the condition in which the appellant was
found as being “a dissociative state” but it is clear, at least since the case
of Bratty v. A.G. Northern Ireland[3],
that the question of whether or not such a state amounts to “a disease of
the mind” is a question of law for the judge to determine. The general rule is
that it is for the judge as a question of law to decide what constitutes a
“disease of the mind”, but that the question of whether or not the facts in a
given case disclose the existence of such a disease is a question to be
determined by the trier of fact. I think it would be superfluous for me to
retrace the line of authorities in this area as they have been so exhaustively
discussed by my brother Dickson and also by Mr. Justice Martin of the
Court of Appeal and by the learned trial judge. I am satisfied in this regard
to adopt the following passages from the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Martin which are now conveniently reported in (1977), 40
C.R.N.S. 46. He there said at p. 62:

In general, the distinction to be drawn is
between a malfunctioning of the mind arising from some cause that is primarily
internal to the accused, having its source in his psychological or emotional
makeup, or in some organic pathology, as opposed to a malfunctioning of the
mind, which is the transient effect produced by some specific external factor
such as, for example, concussion. Any malfunctioning of the mind or mental
disorder having its source primarily in some subjective condition or weakness
internal to the accused (whether fully understood or not) may be a ‘disease of
the mind’ if it prevents the accused from knowing what he is doing, but
transient disturbances of consciousness due to certain specific external
factors do not fall within the concept of disease of the mind. (For an
interesting and helpful discussion see ‘The Concept of Mental Disease In
Criminal Law Insanity Tests’ 33 University of Chicago L. Rev. 229, by
Herbert Fingarette. Particular transient mental disturbances may not, however,
be capable of being properly categorized in relation to

[Page 520]

whether they constitute ‘disease of the
mind’ on the basis of a generalized statement and must be decided on a
case-by-case basis.

The same learned judge later stated in the same
judgment at p. 68:

In my view, the ordinary stresses and
disappointments of life which are the common lot of mankind do not constitute
an external cause constituting an explanation for a malfunctioning of the mind
which takes it out of the category of a ‘disease of the mind’. To hold
otherwise would deprive the concept of an external factor of any real meaning.
In my view, the emotional stress suffered by the respondent as a result of his
disappointment with respect to Miss X cannot be said to be an external factor
producing the automatism within the authorities, and the dissociative state
must be considered as having its source primarily in the respondent’s
psychological or emotional make-up. I conclude, therefore, that, in the
circumstances of this case, the dissociative state in which the respondent was
said to be constituted a ‘disease of the mind’. I leave aside, until it becomes
necessary to decide them, cases where a dissociative state has resulted from
emotional shock without physical injury, resulting from such causes, for
example, as being involved in a serious accident although no physical injury
has resulted; being the victim of a murderous attack with an uplifted knife,
notwithstanding that the victim has managed to escape physical injury; seeing a
loved one murdered or seriously assaulted, and like situations. Such
extraordinary external events might reasonably be presumed to affect the
average normal person without reference to the subjective makeup of the person
exposed to such experience.

For the above reasons I am of the opinion,
with deference, that the learned trial judge erred in holding that the
so-called ‘psychological blow’, which was said to have caused the dissociative
state, was, in the circumstances of this case, an externally originating cause,
and she should have held that if the respondent was in a dissociative state at
the time he struck Miss X he suffered from ‘disease of the mind’. A new trial
must, accordingly, be had on count 2.

In my view, a possible key to the cause of the
malfunctioning of the appellant’s mind at the time of the alleged assault is to
be found in paragraph 5 of the Agreed Statement of Facts to which I have
already referred, and where it is said of him:

5. The Appellant had never dated any other
girl for any length of time, and had only a minimal amount of sexual

[Page 521]

experience. An introvert, he was infatuated
with the attractive, out-going…

It seems to me that his infatuation with this
young woman had created an abnormal condition in his mind under the influence
of which he acted unnaturally and violently to an imagined slight to which a
normal person would not have reacted in the same manner.

It was contended on behalf of the appellant that
a finding of disease of the mind and consequently of insanity in the present
case would involve gross unfairness to the appellant who could be subject to
the provisions of s. 545  of the Criminal Code  and thus detained at the
pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor of the province. That such a result does
not carry with it the hardship contended for is illustrated by the following
passage from the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Martin at p. 69:

It would, of course, be unthinkable that a
person found not guilty on account of insanity because of a transient mental disorder
constituting a disease of the mind, who was not dangerous and who required no
further treatment, should continue to be confined. The present provisions of s.
545(1)(b) [re-en. 1972, c.13, s.45], however, authorize the
Lieutenant-Governor to make an order if, in his opinion, it would be in the
best interest of the accused and not contrary to the interest of the public for
the discharge of a person found not guilty on account of insanity, either
absolutely or subject to such conditions as he prescribes. In addition to the
periodic reviews required to be made by a board of review appointed pursuant to
s. 547(1) of the Code, the Lieutenant-Governor under s. 547(6) of the Code
may request the board of review to review the case of any person found not
guilty on account of insanity, in which case the board of review is required to
report forthwith whether such person has recovered and, if so, whether in its
opinion it is in the interest of the public and of that person for the
Lieutenant-Governor to order that he be discharged absolutely or subject to
such conditions as the Lieutenant-Governor may prescribe.

For all these reasons, as well as for those
expressed by Mr. Justice Martin in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, I
would dismiss the appeal and dispose of the matter in the manner proposed by
him.

[Page 522]

The reasons of Dickson, Estey and Mclntyre JJ.
were delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The automatism
“defence” has come into considerable prominence in recent years. Although the
word “automatism” made its way but lately to the legal stage, it is basic
principle that absence of volition in respect of the act involved is always a
defence to a crime. A defence that the act is involuntary entitles the accused
to a complete and unqualified acquittal. That the defence of automatism exists
as a middle ground between criminal responsibility and legal insanity is beyond
question. Although spoken as a defence, in the sense that it is raised by the
accused, the Crown always bears the burden of proving a voluntary act.

The issue in this appeal is whether automatism
resulting from a “psychological blow” is available to an accused in answer to a
charge of causing bodily harm with intent to wound. The appellant, Wayne
Kenneth Rabey, suddenly and without warning assaulted a fellow student and
friend, causing her injury. The theory of the defence was that his behaviour
was caused by a psychological blow, an intense emotional shock which induced a
“dissociative state”, during which for a time, the appellant was neither conscious
of, nor able to control his conduct, so that it was involuntary. This is
sometimes spoken of as non-insane automatism, to distinguish it from cases in
which the state of automatism is attributable to disease of the mind.

At common law, a person who engaged in what
would otherwise have been criminal conduct was not guilty of a crime if he did
so in a state of unconsciousness or semi-consciousness. Nor was he responsible
if he was, by reason of disease of the mind or defect of reason, unable to appreciate
the nature and quality of an act or that its commission was wrong. The
fundamental precept of our criminal law is that a man is responsible only for
his

[Page 523]

conscious, intentional acts. Devlin J. summed up
the position in R. v. Kemp[4]:

In the eyes of the common law if a man is
not responsible for his actions he is entitled to be acquitted by the ordinary
form of acquittal, and it matters not whether his lack of responsibility was
due to insanity or to any other cause. (at p. 251)

In order to protect the public from the
dangerous criminally insane, the common law was changed by statute, long ago.
By the Criminal Lunatics Act, 1800, and the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883,
and in Canada by the Criminal
Code , a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity results in committal to
an institution. The purpose of the qualified verdict of acquittal is, of
course, to ensure custody and treatment for those who might pose a continuing
threat to society by reason of mental illness. In Canada, an accused who is acquitted on the ground of insanity is kept in
strict custody in the place and in the manner that the Court directs, until the
pleasure of the lieutenant-governor of the province is known [s. 542(2) of the Code].

The term “automatism” first appeared in the cases
and in the periodical literature about thirty years ago. It is seen with
increasing frequency. The defence of automatism is successfully invoked in
circumstances of a criminal act committed unconsciously; and, in the past, has
generally covered acts done while sleepwalking or under concussional states
following head injuries.

The defence of automatism is, in some respects,
akin to that of insanity. In both instances, the issue is whether an accused
had sufficient control over, or knowledge of, his criminal act, to be held
culpable. The two defences are, however, separate and distinct. As Professor
Edwards observed in 21 Mod. L. Rev. 375, at p. 384:

…Both circumstances are concerned to prove
mental irresponsibility, the essential difference… being that in the case of
insanity the defect of the understanding must originate in a disease of the
mind, whereas in the defence of automatism simpliciter the criminal law
is

[Page 524]

not concerned with any question of the
disease of the mind.

Although separate, the relationship between the
two defences cannot be discounted. Automatism may be subsumed in the defence of
insanity in cases in which the unconscious action of an accused can be traced
to, or rooted in, a disease of the mind. Where that is so, the defence of
insanity prevails. This is all felicitously expressed by Gresson P. in R. v.
Cottle[5], at
p. 1007:

It would appear that automatism raised as a
defence to a criminal charge may be something quite different and distinct from
insanity. In a particular case, it may be that the automatism relied on is due
to some ‘disease of the mind’ but it is not necessarily so. Automatism, which
strictly means action without conscious volition, has been adopted in criminal
law as a term to denote conduct of which the doer is not conscious—in short
doing something without knowledge of it, and without memory afterwards of
having done it—a temporary eclipse of consciousness that nevertheless leaves
the person so affected able to exercise bodily movements. In such a case, the action
is one which the mind in its normal functioning does not control. This may be
due to some ‘disease of the mind’ or it may not; it may happen with a perfectly
healthy mind (e.g. in somnambulism which may be unaccompanied by an abnormality
of mind), or it may occur where the mind is temporarily affected as the result
of a blow, or by the influence of a drug or other intoxication. It may on the
other hand be caused by an abnormal condition of the mind capable of being
designated a mental disease. What are known as the M’Naghten Rules can have no
application unless there is some form of ‘disease of the mind’, which is not
necessarily present in all cases of automatism.

I

The Facts

At the time of the alleged offence, March 1,
1974, the appellant, twenty years of age, was a third year geology student in
an honours science course at the University of Toronto. During the fall of 1973, he had
spent some time with the

[Page 525]

complainant, also a third year science student,
with whom he shared a number of classes. Along with two male classmates, the
two studied and lunched together. Their social activities extended to walks
together, dinner at one another’s homes and forays to a local bar. The
appellant was somewhat shy and though he began to develop strong feelings for
the attractive, out-going complainant, the sentiment was not reciprocated.

Plans for the ski trip to Quebec were made in
November and the two planned to share a room. The complainant then invited
another student to accompany them, creating a more platonic overtone. The three
did in fact go to Quebec. The appellant testified that his relationship with
the complainant deteriorated in early 1974. They no longer went on walks or
visited for dinner. He still saw much of her at school.

On February 28, 1974, the complainant asked the
appellant to assist her with an assignment. While she was absent a few moments,
he flipped through her books to locate an equation and found a letter she had
written to a female friend. He took the letter without her knowledge and read
it at home that evening. The letter contains a number of references to sexual
activity, both actual and wished for. Toward the end of the letter, this
paragraph appears:

And for some reason all the guys I know
want to go out with me and not be just friends any more so I can’t talk to
them. I don’t want to go out with them and they know it so there is static in
the air which is why I want to leave. Hell I can insult Wayne [the appellant]
and Rick and they still bug me in class. I want to be alone or with just one
good guy, not with a bunch of nothings.

The appellant was hurt and angry as he read the
letter. He marked the passages referred to above with a pen.

The following morning, he removed a rock sample
of galena from the geology lab. This was not unusual, for he was permitted to
take samples

[Page 526]

home for purposes of study. At about noon, as he
left to watch a squash match, he met the complainant. He testified that, “just
for about a second, not even that, I felt sort of strange, I can’t describe how
I felt”. He referred to it as a flash. He suggested she watch the match with
him. The two proceeded to the squash court. The game was not in progress, so
they left by the far stairwell. The appellant remembered asking her what she
thought of Gord, a friend of theirs, hearing the reply that he was “just a
friend”, and “really the next thing I remember was choking her and I remember
the face was a funny colour and I remember seeing a lot of blood and I
stopped”. He realized his hands were around her throat.

The complainant testified that following the
question about Gord, the appellant then asked, “What do you think of me?” She
replied, “You’re just a friend too”. As she opened a set of fire doors, she
heard a crash and a “crumbling sound”. The appellant grabbed her around the
arms and struck her on the head. She lost consciousness momentarily. When she
recovered consciousness, he was choking her.

A student happened along, to whom the appellant
said, “there’s been a terrible accident”. He was pale, sweating, glassy-eyed
and had a frightened expression. When the witness looked over the railing and
saw the complainant’s head, her body being under the stairs, the appellant
said, “I’ve killed her and I am going to kill you too”. The appellant had only
a partial recollection of his encounter with this witness.

A professor who was summoned testified that the
appellant was very pale and bewildered. His description of the appellant was
that he was perspiring; very, very nervous; distraught; upset; absolutely pale,
no colour in his face; had moisture about the mouth; was shakey, jerky in his
speech; absolutely bewildered, “out of it”. In reply, he said that although the
appellant was halting in his

[Page 527]

speech, he was coherent. According to the nurse
who next saw the appellant, he looked very upset. His pulse was very fast and
not strong; he had a limp “clammy” appearance. She was unable to convince him
he had not killed the complainant. To the Dean, the appellant said, “I don’t
know why I started or why I stopped” and that, “he liked her better than anyone
he had ever known”. The Dean testified the appellant spoke slowly in a confused
sort of way, was very depressed and perhaps dazed.

To Constable Pollitt, the appellant said, “I did
it, I know I did it, I just couldn’t stop hitting her”. The appellant gave a
statement to the police, which reads in part:

I was asking her about the ballet, then I
asked her if she liked this guy Gord. She said something about just as a
friend, then I guess I hit her right then on the head, she was bleeding from
the head and the next thing I remember it all happened so fast she was on the
floor and I was sitting on top of her choking her. I thought she was dead there
was blood everywhere, I just don’t know what happened.

The statement concluded:

I don’t know why I did it because I wasn’t
even mad when this happened, and I don’t remember parts of what happened and
when I realized what I had done I went to the nurse’s office and then to phone
the police, I actually thought I’d killed somebody.

A number of character witnesses spoke highly of
the appellant. Evidence was led that he had been a well behaved young man until
this incident. He had never lost his temper or displayed signs of anger.

The complainant made a complete recovery within
a short time.

II

The Medical Evidence

The appellant was remanded for psychiatric
assessment and committed on March 5, 1974, to

[Page 528]

the Lakeshore Hospital. He was discharged on
April 1, 1974. Detailed medical examinations disclosed no evidence of neurological
disease. A psychological survey showed no indication of psychotic process. Dr.
Slyfield conducted a number of interviews in the preparation of his report
which concludes:

Psychological testing done by
Mr. Wejtko indicates superior intellectual ability, a personality profile
within the range of normality, and a tendency to use the psychological defenses
of avoidance, repression and blocking. There was no evidence of psychotic
disintegration.

If Wayne is telling the truth about his
amnesia for most of the incident, then it is probable that his consciousness
was dissociated at the time. His somnambulistic episode lends some support to
this explanation. However, such a psychological mechanism need not indicate
mental illness.

In the opinion of Dr. Orchard, assistant
professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto and witness for the
defence, the appellant entered into a complete dissociative state, a disorder
of consciousness which occurs as a result of part of the nervous system
“shutting off.” A person in a severe dissociative state may be capable of
performing physical actions without consciousness of such actions. When the
appellant entered the dissociative state near the foot of the stairs, his mind
“shut off”, and the return of consciousness was gradual. In Dr. Orchard’s
opinion, the dissociative state which occurred was comparable to that produced
by a physical blow; though caused by a “psychological blow”, certain physical
effects were produced as observed by the student, the professor, the nurse and
the Dean.

According to Dr. Orchard, the appellant was a
young man of average health, or better than average health, with no
pre-disposition to dissociate. The severe dissociative state, such as the
appellant suffered, usually occurs in persons within the category of normal
people. According to Dr. Orchard, it is rare for the severe dissociative state
not

[Page 529]

caused by some underlying pathology to recur. In
his opinion, there was only a very slight possibility that the appellant would
suffer a recurrence of this disorder of consciousness. Dr. Orchard could
find no indication of any pathological condition, which he defined as a
“diseased condition or abnormally sick condition”. In his view, the
dissociative state itself is an “occurrence”, not a mental illness and not a
disease of the mind.

Dr. Rowsell who, like Dr. Orchard, is a
psychiatrist of eminence, examined the appellant and testified on behalf of the
Crown. In his opinion, the appellant was not in a dissociative state, but
rather was a controlled young man who went into an extreme state of rage at
that moment and, while in that state, struck the complainant on the head and
choked her. Dr. Rowsell felt that if, contrary to his opinion, the appellant
was in a dissociative state, he suffered from disease of the mind. According to
Dr. Rowsell, consciousness is the distinguishing factor of mental life; the
dissociative state is, by definition, a subdivision of hysterical neurosis,
which is a definite mental illness. It is by definition a disorder of the mind.
Dr. Rowsell did not suggest there was an underlying pathology which induced the
alleged dissociative state. His report reads in part:

He shows no evidence of psychosis. (A
psychosis is a disorder of thinking, feeling and behaviour, accompanied by a
break with reality. This means that the individual is no longer able to
interpret events, both internal and external, as would a person in good mental
health.)…

There is no evidence of any organic brain
disorder which would impair his consciousness. Therefore, the issue could be
raised as to whether he was in an automatic state at the time of the event. In
my opinion he was not. The psychiatric term for such a state would be
Dissociative Reaction.

The evidence of Dr. Rowsell was that Rabey was conscious
at the time of the act but suffered hysterical amnesia after the event, which
Dr. Rowsell categorized as neurosis, a disease of the mind.

[Page 530]

Dr. Rowsell, unlike Dr. Orchard, was of the
opinion that the appellant still had a psychiatric problem for which he
required treatment to help him face up to what occurred. The treatment would
take six months to a year, and could be undertaken on an out-patient basis. The
prognosis was excellent.

Dr. Orchard, on the other hand, was of the view
that inasmuch as the appellant had been a relatively normal person prior to the
occurrence, likelihood of any recurrence was negligible. In Dr. Orchard’s
words:

I think he has a pretty healthy personality
and he will find a healthy way through all this. So I don’t see it in need of
any treatment. I don’t see him as sick. I do agree with Dr. Rowsell he is
not in any way a criminal type of person.

Dr. Rowsell considered that the appellant was
not “in any way a criminal type of person”. Dr. Orchard shared that view.

III

At Trial and on Appeal

The trial judge, Dymond Co. Ct. J., rejected the
Crown theory of planned revenge and the medical opinion advanced by Dr. Rowsell
of tremendous rage and loss of memory from protective hysterical amnesia.
Referring to R. v. K.[6] and
Parnerkar v. The Queen[7], the
judge concluded that a dissociative state brought on by psychological trauma
can support a defence of automatism. The ruling in Parnerkar flowed from
the medical evidence there, distinctly different from the evidence in this case.

On the issue of automatic behaviour the judge
held:

…I am satisfied from the evidence given by
Dr. Orchard, by the accused himself, and by the witnesses Pollard, Turner,
Houston, Huggett and Degutis that there was evidence before the Court to
paraphrase from

[Page 531]

Mr. Justice Kelly in Reg. v. Sproule,
a decision released April 16th 1975, quote, and I’m paraphrasing: “upon
which a jury properly instructed could have found that at the time of the
wounding Rabey had been suffering from a malfunction of mind described as
dissociation of the type brought about by an externally originating cause”.
Such external cause would have been the words about Gord being a friend, which,
tied with the knowledge of what the letter had said, constituted an external blow
or trauma which resulted in Rabey’s being in a dissociative state. It can be
compared with the blow to the skull causing a concussion where the skull is
thin.

Elsewhere in the judgment the following passage
appears:

I am therefore of the opinion that a defence
of malfunction of the mind described as a dissociative state or a dissociation
brought about by an externally operating cause is still open when the external
cause is a psychological trauma, provided the other necessary conditions are
met.

The “necessary conditions” to which the judge
referred were:

1. There must be no disease of the mind, Bratty
v. Attorney-General. In this case both psychiatrists have given as
their opinion that at the time of the event the appellant was not suffering
from any disease of the mind and no evidence was led to indicate that he was so
suffering, other than Dr. Rowsell’s opinion that if he were in a dissociative
state, it would be a disease of the mind.

2. The condition must not arise as a result
of some pre-existing pathological condition or disease. Both doctors agreed
there was none.

3. The condition must not be attributable
to some self-advanced incapacity, such as the consumption of liquor. The only
self-advanced incapacity conceivable was the taking of the letter, and I do not
believe the consequences thereof could have been foreseen.

4. The condition could not have been
reasonably foreseen as the result of a particular act of omission or
commission.

5. According to Lord Denning, a disease of
the mind is any mental disorder which has manifested itself in violence and is
prone to recur. The opinion of Dr. Orchard was that in so far as there can be
any certainty in medicine the state will not recur. This is

[Page 532]

far from “prone to recur”, and Dr. Rowsell
did not indicate he thought the actions would recur.

The judge concluded:

I am satisfied that Rabey was not insane
within the meaning of section 16  of the Criminal Code  when the acts were
committed, and I am in a state of real doubt and I believe reasonable doubt as
to whether the accused acted in a state of automatism, so that there was no
mind behind the actions, and in effect the actions were not his or whether he
intended to perform the acts. I must therefore give the benefit of the doubt to
the accused, since I have found that a proper foundation was laid for an
inference to be reasonably made that the accused acted in a state of automatism
brought about by an external cause.

In acquitting the appellant the judge made two
findings of particular significance: first, that the appellant was not insane
within the meaning of s. 16  of the Criminal Code  when the acts were
committed and, second, that the appellant had acted in a state of automatism
brought about by an external cause.

It is important to note that the Crown did not
challenge the finding of automatism in this Court or in the Ontario Court of
Appeal. We must therefore accept, for the purposes of this appeal, that the
acts to which I have referred occurred without will, purpose or reasoned
intention on the part of the appellant. The only question for decision is
whether, having found automatism, the trial judge was bound in law to find that
the appellant was a proper subject for indefinite detention as an insane
person.

On appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal, the
acquittal on the charge of causing bodily harm was reversed and a new trial
directed on that count. The Court held that the psychological blow suffered was
not an externally originating cause of the dissociative state. The acquittal at
trial on a companion charge of possession of a rock for the purpose of wounding
was upheld.

Mr. Justice Martin delivered a lengthy
judgment on behalf of the Court of Appeal. He held that disease of the mind is
a legal term, having both medical, and legal or policy, components. The

[Page 533]

policy component must compromise exemption from
responsibility with the need to protect the public. Ultimately the issue as to
what constitutes a disease of the mind is a legal one; the concept is broad,
embracing mental disorders of organic and functional origin, whether curable or
incurable, temporary or not, recurring or non-recurring. With respect, I agree
with these views, which were confirmed, at least in part, by this Court in Cooper
v. The Queen[8].

Mr. Justice Martin went on to hold,
however, that the likelihood of recurrence is not a factor to be taken into
account. In this respect, he differed from Lord Denning in Bratty v Attorney‑General
for Northern Ireland[9]. Mr. Justice
Martin noted that it would be unreasonable to hold that a serious mental
disorder did not consitute a disease of the mind simply because it was unlikely
to recur. I agree. A test of proneness to recur does not entail the converse
conclusion, that if the mental malady is not prone to recur it cannot be a disease
of the mind. A condition, organic in nature, which causes an isolated act of
unconscious violence could well be regarded as a case of temporary insanity. I
question, however, whether Lord Denning intended to exclude temporary insanity
as a disease of the mind. The phrase “prone to recur” is, I should have
thought, merely another manner of connoting a need for treatment which is,
after all, one of the principal reasons for confinement of the mentally ill
offender.

The learned Justice of Appeal held that transient
mental states produced by external causes (i.e., drugs, concussion) are
not diseases of the mind. This is accepted legal doctrine. He held also that
the distinction between insanity and automatism rests upon determining whether
the cause of the malfunction is internal to an accused or is produced by an
external factor. As to this, there may be more doubt. Mr. Justice Martin
said:

[Page 534]

In general, the distinction to be drawn is
between a malfunctioning of the mind arising from some cause that is primarily
internal to the accused, having its source in his psychological or emotional
make-up, or in some organic pathology, as opposed to a malfunctioning of the
mind which is the transient effect produced by some specific external factor
such, as, for example, concussion. Any malfunctioning of the mind, or mental
disorder having its source in some subjective condition or weakness internal to
the accused… may be a “disease of the mind”… but transient disturbances of
consciousness due to specific external factors do not fall within the concept
disease of the mind.

I will have more to say on this point as well as
upon the opinion of Mr. Justice Martin that in Parnerkar the view
of Culliton C.J.S. was not dependent on the evidence of the medical witness; rather,
the dissociated state, as induced by the psychological blow, was a pathological
condition.

It was the further view of Mr. Justice
Martin that the ordinary stresses and disappointments of life which are the
common lot of mankind do not constitute an external cause; the emotional stress
suffered by the appellant could not be said to be an external factor producing
automatism within the authorities; the source of the dissociative state was the
appellant’s psychological or emotional makeup.

Mr. Justice Martin considered it
“unthinkable” that a person found not guilty on account of insanity because of
a transient mental disorder constituting a disease of the mind, who was not
dangerous and who required no further treatment, would continue to be confined.

IV

I turn now to the authorities, with the
threshold observation that none of them is binding upon this Court or
particularly helpful in the resolution of this case.

The English decisions provide some guidance as
to the general principles though none of them deals directly with the plea of
automatism in the context of psychological blow. Canadian decisions on
automatism have tended to be erratic. In one or

[Page 535]

two of the cases, the Courts have permitted the
defence on the strength of a psychological blow in circumstances which suggest
the presence of a pathological condition or disease of the mind.

The defence of automatism was first successfully
raised in R. v. Charlson[10],
in which Barry J. instructed the jury in these broad terms:

If he did not know what he was doing, if
his actions were purely automatic and his mind had no control over the movement
of his limbs, if he was in the same position as a person in an epileptic fit
and no responsibility rests on him at all, then the proper verdict is “not guilty”.
(at p. 864)

The decision introduced a defence of automatism
based on involuntary conduct and made it clear that it was possible to prove
involuntariness through mental disorder not amounting to a disease of the mind.

In the later decision of R. v. Kemp,
supra, in which the accused suffered from the organic disease of
arteriosclerosis, Devlin J. did not accept the distinction between diseases
affecting the mind, according to origins, mental or physical; the concern of
the law is with the mental condition which brought about the criminal act. The
critical passage of the judgment is at p. 253:

In my judgment the condition of the brain
is irrelevant and so is the question of whether the condition of the mind is
curable or incurable, or whether it is temporary or permanent. There is no
warranty for introducing those considerations into the definition of the
M’Naghten rules. Either temporary or permanent insanity is sufficient to
satisfy them.

Devlin J. also spoke of the purpose of a
qualified verdict of guilty but insane (at p. 251):

The object of the Act, no doubt, was that
people who committed crimes of violence, even though they were not responsible
for their actions, ought not to be allowed to go free because they might commit
an act of violence again…

[Page 536]

Although Kemp claimed an outright acquittal on
the basis of Charlson’s case, Devlin J. instructed only on insanity. It
is important to note, however, that far from doubting the correctness of Charlson’s
case, Devlin J. pointed out that if the accused was otherwise sane at the
time of the act, but was then not conscious of his acts, he was entitled to an
unqualified acquittal.

Hill v. Baxter[11] is the first of a series of driving
cases. Here, although the accused claimed to have suffered a “black-out” while
driving, there was no medical evidence to support his plea of automatism. The
notion of automatism discussed in the several judgments was limited in scope.
Apart from the possibility of a stroke or epileptic fit, Lord Goddard spoke in
terms of novus actus interveniens.

The reasons of Devlin J. are more interesting,
bearing in mind his earlier pronouncement in Kemp. At p. 285, he stated:

For the purposes of the criminal law there
are two categories of mental irresponsibility, one where the disorder is due to
disease and the other where it is not. The distinction is not an arbitrary one.
If disease is not the cause, if there is some temporary loss of consciousness
arising accidentally, it is reasonable to hope that it will not be repeated and
that it is safe to let an acquitted man go entirely free. But if disease is
present, the same thing may happen again, and therefore, since 1800 (i.e.,
Criminal Lunatics Act), the law has provided that persons acquitted on this
ground should be subject to restraint.

Kemp was not
considered in Baxter.

The decision in Bratty v. Attorney-General,
supra, is important, as a pronouncement by the House of Lords recognizing
automatism and distinguishing it from insanity. The facts are familiar. The
appellant had killed a young girl and shortly thereafter stated to police, “I
had some terrible feeling and then a sort of blackness”. On evidence of a
condition of psychomotor epilepsy, the defence

[Page 537]

of insanity was left to the jury. The Law Lords
agreed that automatism was not available as a defence in the circumstances of
that case. Where disease of the mind is the only explanation of the unconscious
acts, automatism is not a defence alternative to insanity.

Viscount Kilmuir recognized, however, that in
some circumstances, the two defences can be raised simultaneously. Where the
loss of conscious control can have arisen from disease or from another cause
not indicative of disease, whether it is insanity or automatism which
ultimately excuses is a question of fact:

…it may be alleged that the accused had a
blow on the head, after which he acted without being conscious of what he was
doing or was a sleep-walker. There might be a divergence of view as to whether
there was a defect of reason from disease of the mind (compare the curious
position which arose in R. v. Kemp). The jury might not accept
the evidence of a defect of reason from disease of the mind, but at the same
time accept the evidence that the prisoner did not know what he was doing. (at
p. 403)

Though not a majority opinion, the judgment of
Lord Denning has attracted attention. He spoke generally of automatism. While
he referred specifically to concussion and somnambulism as examples, his
definition does not attempt an exhaustive list of causes, and frames the defence
for all involuntary acts:

No act is punishable if it is done
involuntarily: and an involuntary act in this context—some people nowadays
prefer to speak of it as “automatism”—means an act which is done by the muscles
without any control by the mind, such as a spasm, a reflex action or a
convulsion; or an act done by a person who is not conscious of what he is
doing, such as an act done whilst suffering from concussion or whilst
sleep-walking.

...

Loss of memory afterwards is never a
defence in itself, so long as he was conscious at the time… (at p. 409)

[Page 538]

Not every involuntary act leads to an absolute
acquittal. A finding of insanity follows where there exists the prospect of
recurrence:

Suppose a crime is committed by a man in a
state of automatism or clouded consciousness due to a recurrent disease of the
mind. Such an act is no doubt involuntary, but it does not give rise to an
unqualified acquittal, for that would mean he would be let at large to do it
again. The only proper verdict is one which ensures that the person who suffers
from the disease is kept secure in a hospital so as not to be a danger to
himself or others. (at p. 410)

Lord Denning expressed disagreement with the
decision in Charlson’s case and proposed this test:

It seems to me that any mental disorder
which has manifested itself in violence and is prone to recur is a disease of
the mind. (at p. 412)

In another leading case, R. v. Carter[12], a defence based on post-traumatic
automatism was raised. Sholl J. regarded the practice instituted by the English
Lunatics Acts (1800 and 1883) as being “designed to protect the public
from possible attacks by persons acquitted on the ground of mental
irresponsibility which might recur” (at p. 109). In his opinion, in view of the
increase in medical knowledge in the intervening century and a half, “it would
be unwise to extend the practice with which the M’Naghten Rules are associated
to cases where there is no reason to apprehend any similar danger to the
public” (at p. 109). It is outside the policy of the law to extend the practice
where there is no reason to fear repetition of the crime and no evidence of
brain damage or disease. He would not stretch the concept of disease of the
mind to the length of Devlin J. in Kemp and Dixon J. in R. v. Porter[13].

There is a series of lesser English and
Australian cases dealing with automatism. R. v. Wakefield[14] is concerned with the plea in
circumstances of a

[Page 539]

physical blow. In Cooper v. McKenna[15], the accused had suffered a
concussion from a severe blow on the head incurred a few hours previously in a
football match. Though the defence was given effect on the basis the accused
had not acted consciously, Stable J. commented at p. 419:

…It is a defence that must be closely
scrutinized. It is common knowledge that “black‑out”, to use one of the
titles, is one of the first refuges of a guilty conscience, and a popular
excuse.

See also Armstrong v. Clark[16] (insulin); Watmore v. Jenkins[17] (insulin); R. v. Sibbles[18] (high blood pressure, beer and a
minor blow).

In a more recent judgment, R. v. Quick,
R. v. Paddison[19], the
English Court of Appeal held that hypoglycaemia, a condition in which there is
an excess of insulin in the bloodstream relative to the concentration of sugar,
was not a disease of the mind.

Lawton L.J. proposed these guidelines, somewhat
narrower than the formulation of Devlin J. in Kemp (at pp. 734-5):

In our judgment, the fundamental concept is
of a malfunctioning of the mind caused by disease. A malfunctioning of the mind
of transitory effect caused by the application to the body of some external
factor such as violence, drugs, including anaesthetics, alcohol and hypnotic
influences cannot fairly be said to be due to disease. Such malfunctioning…
will not always relieve an accused from criminal responsibility. A self-induced
incapacity will not excuse… nor will one which could have been reasonably
foreseen. From time to time difficult border line cases are likely to arise.
When they do, the test suggested by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Cottle,
supra, is likely to give the correct result, viz. can this mental
condition be fairly regarded as amounting to or producing a defect of reason
from disease of the mind?

[Page 540]

The first Canadian decision is R. v. Kasperek[20], a case in which the defence raised
was “temporary blackout” and “amnesia”. It was held the denial of insanity,
with an assertion of amnesia, was untenable. This decision predates the English
authorities which recognized a defence of automatism.

In R. v. Minor[21], a death resulted from the
accused’s dangerous and erratic handling of his car. The facts indicated that
just prior to driving, the accused, in attendance at a wedding reception, had
been struck and knocked down. According to medical evidence, he had suffered
from an injury which rendered him unconscious for an unknown interval. The
salient passage is at pp. 34-5:

There is ample authority to the effect that
when a person is unconscious from any cause and is in a condition when he
cannot form an intent… he had a good defence… In my opinion the provisions with
respect to insanity… do not apply to the defence set up in this case, namely,
that the accused did not know what he was doing at the time of the accident.

The decision of the Saskatchewan Appeal Court in
R. v. Hartridge[22] provides
a thorough review of the authorities dealing with automatism. The case has
limited value as a precedent due to the factor of alcohol-induced amnesia.
Culliton C.J.S. said, however, on behalf of the Court:

Difficulty may arise in determining what constitutes
a disease of the mind. In the application of the M’Naghten rules, disease of
the mind has generally been accepted as any pathological condition, organic or
otherwise, which effectively prevents an accused from knowing the nature and
quality of his acts. This I take to have been the definition adopted by all of
the Law Lords except Lord Denning. (at p. 351)

Pathology is that branch of medicine which
treats of the essential nature of disease, especially of the structural and
functional changes in tissues and organs of the body which cause or are caused
by disease. The definition of disease of the mind in

[Page 541]

Hartridge simply
brings us back to the question of “disease”, which, upon the medical evidence,
was noticeably absent in the case of the present appellant. A like emphasis
upon “disease” is to be noted in R. v. Quick, R. v. Paddison,
supra, where, at p. 734, Lawton L.J. delivering the judgment of the Court
said:

Our task has been to decide what the law
means now by the words “disease of the mind”. In our judgment, the fundamental
concept is of a malfunctioning of the mind caused by disease.

The jury charge in R. v. K., supra, as
far as I am aware, contains the first plea of psychological blow automatism in
this country. Both insanity and automatism were before the jury. In view of the
uncontradicted evidence of an underlying pathological condition and a course of
psychiatric treatment prior to the killing, one may seriously query whether the
trial judge correctly left the alternative defence of automatism with the jury.
In the event, the defence gained the accused an acquittal.

A plea of automatism raised at trial was
sustained before this Court in Bleta v. The Queen[23], a case in which the Court was
concerned, however, with an evidentiary matter. In the course of an affray
between the appellant and the deceased, the former was knocked onto the
pavement, whereupon he forcibly struck his head. Moments later, he got up and
delivered a fatal blow. Witnesses testified that after the fall, the appellant
was dazed. On medical evidence that the physical blow deprived him of voluntary
control of his actions, the appellant was acquitted at trial. With no
discussion as to the availability of the defence of automatism, which appears
not to have been in issue in this Court, the acquittal was restored.

Parnerkar v. The
Queen, supra, is perhaps the case most directly in point in the resolution
of the present appeal. The trial judge and appellate court

[Page 542]

in the case at bar disagreed in their respective
interpretations of the judgment rendered by Culliton C.J.S. The case reached
this Court, but the plea of non-insane automatism was not directly considered.
Only Ritchie J. (in whose judgment Spence J. concurred) expressed a view on the
issue of automatism. He agreed that the defence of automatism should not have
been left with the jury.

The passage in the judgment of Culliton C.J.S.
which has given rise to uncertainty reads:

In my opinion, if the evidence of Dr.
Benjamin is accepted, that Parnerkar was in a dissociated state at the time he
killed Anna, he was, at that time, suffering from a disease of the mind within
the M’Naghten rules as defined by this Court. If the acts committed by
Parnerkar were unconscious acts, they depended upon a defect of reason from
disease of the mind, and consequently the defence, if any, was one of insanity,
and not of automatism. Therefore, in my respectful view, the learned trial
judge erred in law in putting the defence of automatism to the jury. I would
also point out that Dr. Benjamin stated, if Parnerkar was in a dissociated
state, then during that time he was temporarily insane. (at p. 24)

It is unclear whether Culliton C.J.S.,
unsupported by earlier authority, made a finding that, as a matter of law, a
dissociated state is a disease of the mind, or whether he merely accepted the
medical opinion that, on these facts, there was a disease of the mind. In the
present case Mr. Justice Martin took the former view of the meaning to be
attributed to the words of Culliton C.J.S.; the trial judge took the latter
view. There is little in the way of elaboration, beyond that contained in the
quoted passage, on the issue of disease of the mind.

There are three or four decisions since Parnerkar
in which automatism induced by a psychological blow has been pleaded. In R.
v. James[24], dissociation
caused by emotional stress was categorized as insanity rather than as
non-insane automatism but in that case the medical evidence disclosed an
underlying pathological condition of

[Page 543]

psychotic proportion. In R. v. Cullum[25], Zalev Co. Ct. J. acquitted an
accused who was in a dissociated state due to situational emotional stress. In Cullum,
there was evidence that the factors inducing the dissociative state were
“alcohol and the girls”; there was also evidence of a predisposition to
dissociate; recurrence could not be ruled out. See also R. v. Cusack[26], in which the Prince Edward Island
Supreme Court on appeal dismissed a Crown appeal from an acquittal by a jury on
a charge of attempted murder. The sole defence was one of non-insane
automatism. There was considerable evidence that the accused was not in
conscious control of his actions.

Another case to which one might refer is R.
v. Sproule[27], decided
by the Ontario Court of Appeal differently constituted than in the case at bar.
In that case, the accused had an argument with a girl who had earlier informed
him her interest was on the wane. A discussion between the two rapidly
escalated into an argument during which the girl was shot. The judgment of the
Court was delivered by Kelly J.A. who stated that the defence sought to tender
evidence to prove that Sproule, at the time of the shooting, had been acting in
a state of automatism. Mr. Justice Kelly then continued:

Such a condition, the state of automatism,
is a demonstration of a malfunction of the mind technically described as
dissociation. That malfunction may be non-recurring, brought about by an
externally originated cause, examples of which are a blow on the head (Regina
v. Bleta, [1964] 1 O.R. 485, 41 C.R. 377, [1964] 2 C.C.C. 190,
reversed [1964] S.C.R. 561, 44 C.R. 193, [1965] 1 C.C.C. 1, 48 D.L.R. (2d) 139)
or hypoglycemia (Regina v. Paddison, [1973] Q.B. 910, 57 Cr. App.
R. 722, [1973] 3 All E.R. 347 at 356). That type of malfunction is not a
disease of the mind within the M’Naghten rule and (save when self-induced) is
capable of being a defence which would entitle a jury to bring in a verdict of
acquittal. (at p. 64)

[Page 544]

The final case I wish to note is Cooper v.
The Queen[28],
a recent decision in which this Court considered the obligation of the trial
judge to charge on insanity where the accused had a lengthy psychiatric
history, but the medical evidence was that he did not suffer from disease of
the mind. In the course of the judgment, the Court had occasion to make the
following observations: (at p. 1158)

Disease of the mind is a legal term. It is
within the province of the judge to determine what mental conditions are within
the meaning of that phrase and whether there is any evidence that an accused
suffers from an abnormal mental condition comprehended by that term. More
importantly, if there is any evidence the accused did suffer such a disease in
legal terms, the question of fact must be left with the jury.

In the context of that case, the Court held: (at
p. 1159)

In summary, one might say that in a legal
sense, “disease of the mind” embraces any illness, disorder or abnormal
condition which impairs the human mind and its functioning, excluding however,
self-induced states caused by alcohol or drugs, as well as transitory mental
states such as hysteria or concussion.

In Cooper and in the case at bar, there
was evidence of interruption of the thought processes in the course of
committing certain acts and criminal responsibility was in issue. In Cooper,
the question was whether the trial judge was required to charge on
insanity. The inquiry in the present case goes somewhat deeper. The question
here is whether the accused, having acted in a state of unconsciousness, while
in a transitory mental state, must be committed to an institution.

V

This case raises interesting issues, and the
judicial conclusion, in my view, should be guided by general principles of
criminal responsibility. Before alluding to those principles, it is useful to
recall s. 16(4)  of the Criminal Code  which reads:

[Page 545]

Every one shall, until the contrary is
proved, be presumed to be and to have been sane.

In the usual case in which an accused pleads
insanity, he has the burden of overcoming the presumption of sanity. In the
present case, the appellant is not seeking to establish that he was insane on
March 1, 1974. The Crown is asserting the insanity in answer to the defence of
automatism raised by the appellant. The presumption of sanity runs in the
appellant’s favour.

We turn to s. 16(2): a person is insane when he
is in a state of natural imbecility or has a disease of the mind to an extent
that renders him incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of an act or
omission or of knowing that an act or omission is wrong. The important words,
for present purposes, are “disease of the mind”.

The first principle, fundamental to our criminal
law, which governs this appeal is that no act can be a criminal offence unless
it is done voluntarily. Consciousness is a sine qua non to criminal
liability.

The prosecution must prove every element of the
crime charged. One such element is the state of mind of the accused, in the
sense that the act was voluntary. The circumstances are normally such as to
permit a presumption of volition and mental capacity. That is not so when the
accused, as here, has placed before the court, by cross-examination of Crown
witnesses or by evidence called on his own behalf, or both, evidence sufficient
to raise an issue that he was unconscious of his actions at the time of the
alleged offence. No burden of proof is imposed upon an accused raising such
defence beyond pointing to facts which indicate the existence of such a
condition: R. v. Berger[29], at
p. 379. Whether lack of consciousness relates to mens rea or to actus
reus or both may be important in a case in which the offence charged is one
of absolute liability, but the conceptual distinction does

[Page 546]

not concern us in the case at bar.

The second principle is that no person should be
committed to a hospital for the criminally insane unless he suffers from
disease of the mind in need of treatment or likely to recur.

The Ontario Court of Appeal held that the
excusing factor was insanity. This finding was reached though the appellant
exhibited no pathological symptoms indicative of a previously existing, or
ongoing, psychiatric disorder. On medical evidence accepted by the trial judge,
the prospect of a recurrence of dissociation is extremely remote. There was no
finding that the appellant suffered from psychosis, neurosis or personality
disorder. He does not have an organic disease of the brain. This was an
isolated event. The appellant has already spent several weeks in a mental
institution undergoing psychiatric, neurological and psychological assessment,
the result of which did not indicate need for treatment.

There are undoubtedly policy considerations to
be considered. Automatism as a defence is easily feigned. It is said the
credibility of our criminal justice system will be severely strained if a
person who has committed a violent act is allowed an absolute acquittal on a
plea of automatism arising from a psychological blow. The argument is made that
the success of the defence depends upon the semantic ability of psychiatrists,
tracing a narrow path between the twin shoals of criminal responsibility and an
insanity verdict. Added to these concerns is the in terrorem argument
that the floodgates will be raised if psychological blow automatism is
recognized in law.

There are competing policy interests. Where the
condition is transient rather than persistent, unlikely to recur, not in need
of treatment and not the result of self-induced intoxication, the policy
objectives in finding such a person insane are not

[Page 547]

served. Such a person is not a danger to himself
or to society generally.

The Ontario Court of Appeal in the present case
focused upon “external cause”. The “ordinary stresses and disappointments of
life” were held not to constitute an external cause. The Court considered that
the “emotional stress” suffered by the appellant could not be said to be an
external factor producing the automatism; the dissociative state had its source
primarily in the psychological or emotional make-up of the appellant.

There is no evidence to support Mr. Justice
Martin’s statement attributing the dissociated state to psychological or
emotional make-up of the appellant. To exclude the defence of automatism, it
lay upon the Crown to establish that the appellant suffered from a disease of
the mind at the time of the attack. The existence of the mental disease must be
demonstrated in evidence. Here there is no such evidence from any of the expert
or other witnesses with references to the crucial period of the assault.
Moreover as earlier noted, s. 16(4)  presumes sanity. The Court of Appeal’s
conclusion was directly contrary to the testimony of Dr. Orchard, accepted by
the trial judge, and finds no support in the testimony of Dr. Rowsell.

Martin J.A. left open the question whether it is
possible to dissociate as a result of emotional shock rather than physical
injury. The effect of the appellate court judgment was to differ with the trial
judge’s finding that the dissociation was brought about by an externally
operating cause. In the circumstances, I do not think it is open to this Court
to disturb the findings of fact at trial.

If the effect of the appellate court judgment is
that, as a matter of law, emotional stress can never constitute an external
factor then, with respect, I disagree. Indeed, in the passage quoted below the
court seems to concede as much. If the controlling factor is one of degree of
emotional stress, and the

[Page 548]

application of some form of quantitative test,
then the question becomes one of fact for the trier of fact and not one of law
for an appellate court.

It is not clear to me why, as a matter of law,
an emotional blow, which can be devastating, should be regarded as an external
cause of automatism in some circumstances and an internal cause in others, as
the Court of Appeal would seem to propose in this passage:

…I leave aside until it becomes necessary
to decide them, cases where a dissociative state has resulted from emotional
shock without physical injury, resulting from such causes, for example, as
being involved in a serious accident although no physical injury has resulted;
being the victim of a murderous attack with an uplifted knife, notwithstanding
the victim has managed to escape physical injury; seeing a loved one murdered
or seriously assaulted, and the like situations. Such extraordinary external
events might reasonably be presumed to affect the average normal person without
reference to the subjective make-up of the person exposed to such experience.

I cannot accept the notion that an extraordinary
external event, i.e. an intense emotional shock, can cause a state of
dissociation or automatism, if and only if all normal persons subjected to that
sort of shock would react in that way. If I understand the quoted passage
correctly, an objective standard is contemplated for one of the possible causes
of automatism, namely, psychological blow, leaving intact the subjective
standard for other causes of automatism, such as physical blow, or reaction to
drugs.

As in all other aspects of the criminal law,
except negligence offences, the inquiry is directed to the accused’s actual
state of mind. It is his subjective mental conditions with which the law is
concerned. If he has a brittle skull and sustains a concussion which causes him
to run amok, he has a valid defence of automatism. If he has an irregular
metabolism which induced an unanticipated and violent reaction to a drug, he
will not be responsible for his acts. If he is driven into shock and
unconsciousness by an emotional blow, and was susceptible to that reaction but has
no disease,

[Page 549]

there is no reason in principle why a plea of
automatism should not be available. The fact that other people would not have
reacted as he did should not obscure the reality that the external
psychological blow did cause a loss of consciousness. A person’s subjective
reaction, in the absence of any other medical or factual evidence supportive of
insanity, should not put him into the category of persons legally insane. Nor
am I prepared to accept the proposition, which seems implicit in the passage
quoted, that whether an automatic state is an insane reaction or a sane
reaction may depend upon the intensity of the shock.

Schiffer states in his text, “Mental Disorder
and The Criminal Trial Process” (1978), that psychological blow automatism
is described as a reaction to a shock (at p. 101):

However, in cases where the psychological
stress has taken the form of a sudden jolt or blow to the accused, the court
may be more willing to treat a short-lived bout of automatism as sane. Because the
automatism, in order to be a defence in itself, must be an “on the sudden”
reaction to psychological stress, the defence of “psychological blow
automatism” may be seen as somewhat analogous to the defence of provocation.

I agree with the requirement that there be a
shock precipitating the state of automatism. Dissociation caused by a low
stress threshold and surrender to anxiety cannot fairly be said to result from
a psychological blow. In a recent decision of the B.C. Court of Appeal, R.
v. MacLeod, as yet unreported, Craig J.A. adopted the judgment of
Martin J.A. in Rabey. The facts of MacLeod cannot be compared
with those in the instant appeal. There, the accused absorbed four double
drinks of liquor prior to entering the alleged state of dissociation. His loss
of consciousness cannot be traced to an immediate emotional shock. He had been
subject to ongoing stress for some time, which was heightened by his wife’s
recent departure. Though unwilling to classify it a disease of the mind, the
accused’s medical witness described it as a “neurotic disorder” which could be
induced

[Page 550]

by an “anxiety reaction”. The Court of Appeal
held non-insame automatism was not available.

Dr. Glanville Williams’ new book “Textbook of
Criminal Law” (1978) is helpful in this discussion, in particular chapter
27. The author cites as the main instances of automatism: “sleepwalking,
concussion, some cases of epilepsy, hypoglycaemia and dissociative states”.
Williams says (at pp. 608-9) that “automatism” has come to express “any
abnormal state of consciousness (whether confusion, delusion or dissociation)
that is regarded as incompatible with the existence of mens rea, while
not amounting to insanity”, adding:

It would better be called “impaired
consciousness”, but the orthodox expression can be used if we bear in mind that
it does not mean what it says.

and in a footnote:

Because automatism is a legal concept, a
psychiatrist should be asked to testify to the mental condition as
psychiatrically recognized, not to “automatism”. It is for the judge to make
the translation. In most of the conditions referred to legally as automatism
the psychiatrist would speak of an altered state of consciousness. (at p. 609)

The Parnerkar case is discussed at some
length and the following observations made with respect thereto:

The decision illustrates the difficulty
that can be caused to the courts by over‑enthusiastic psychiatrists. If
such evidence were regularly given and accepted a considerable breach would be
made in the law of homicide. A medical witness who proclaims that the
defendant, though awake, did not know that he was stabbing a person because of
his dissociated state invites incredulity, particularly where it is shown that
the defendant immediately afterwards telephoned for an ambulance and the
police. Further, to assert that this medical condition amounts to insanity
ignores the distinction that has been developed between sane and non-sane
automatism. If Parnerkar was in a state of automatism at all it was of the
non-insane variety, since there was no

[Page 551]

evidence of psychosis or brain damage or
continuing danger. (at p. 613) (Underlining added.)

At the conclusion of the discussion on Parnerkar,
Williams makes the following comment, particularly apt in the present case:

It may also be remarked that commitment to
hospital is inappropriate in a case of hysterical dissociation, since once the
episode is over the patient does not need to be detained. (at p. 613)

Under the heading “Insanity versus Automatism”
Williams states that before the decision in Quick, Lord Denning’s view
in Bratty was generally accepted. The test of insanity was the
likelihood of recurrence of danger. In Quick, the Court of Appeal
adopted what might seem at first sight to be a different test for insane versus
non-insane automatism. But the real question is whether the violence is likely
to be repeated. Williams concludes that “On the whole, it would be much better
if the courts kept to Lord Denning’s plain rule; the rule in Quick adds
nothing to it”. (at p. 615)

This view, which the Ontario Court of Appeal
appears to have rejected, finds ample support in the legal literature. See
Beck, “Voluntary Conduct: Automatism, Insanity and Drunkenness”, (1966-67) 9 Crim.
L.Q. 315, at p. 321, “The cause of the automatic conduct, and the threat of
recurrence, are plainly factors that determine the line between sane and insane
automatism”; Whitlock, “Criminal Responsibility and Mental Illness” at
p. 120, “The test of whether or not an episode of automatism is to be judged as
sane or insane action seems to rest on the likelihood of its repetition”; J.
LI. J. Edwards, “Automatism and Criminal Responsibility”, 21 Mod. L. Rev. 375,
at p. 385, “Where evidence is available of recurrent attacks of automatism
during which the accused resorts to violence… inevitably leads to consideration
of the imposition of some restraint”; Prevez-

[Page 552]

er, “Automatism and Involuntary Conduct” [1958] Crim.
L.R. 440, at p. 441, “If… it can safely be predicted that his conduct is
not likely to recur, having regard to the cause of the automatism, there can be
no point in finding him insane and detaining him in Broadmoor”; Martin,
“Insanity as a Defence”, (1965-6) 8 Crim. L.Q. 240, at p. 253, “Perhaps
the distinction lies in the likelihood of recurrence and whether the person
suffering from it is prone to acts of violence when in that state”.

In principle, the defence of automatism should
be available whenever there is evidence of unconsciousness throughout the
commission of the crime, that cannot be attributed to fault or negligence of
his part. Such evidence should be supported by expert medical opinion that the
accused did not feign memory loss and that there is no underlying pathological
condition which points to a disease requiring detention and treatment.

I would only add that s. 16  determines the
consequences of the finding of “no consciousness”, on the basis of a legal
conclusion guided by the medical evidence of the day. What is disease of the
mind in the medical science of today may not be so tomorrow. The court will
establish the meaning of disease of the mind on the basis of scientific
evidence as it unfolds from day to day. The court will find as a matter of fact
in each case whether a disease of the mind, so defined, is present.

The circumstances in this case are highly
unusual, uncomplicated by alcohol or psychiatric history. The real question in
the case is whether the appellant should be confined in an institution for the
criminally insane. The trial judge negated an act of passion, lack of self‑control
or impulsiveness. The medical evidence negated a state of disease or disorder
or mental disturbance arising from infirmity. Save for what was said by Dr.
Rowsell,

[Page 553]

whose evidence as to ex post facto hysterical
amnesia was rejected by the trial judge, the medical experts gave the appellant
a clean mental bill of health. I can see no possible justification for sending
the case back for a new trial.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Ontario Court of Appeal, and restore the verdict of acquittal.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL OF ALBERTA

Criminal law—Fraudulent use of
telecommunication facilities—Computer—Criminal Code , s. 287(1) (b).

The accused was convicted of theft in that he
without colour of right used a computer to obtain internal progammes of the
computer and information from other persons’ files in the computer contrary to
s. 287(1) (b) of the Criminal Code . The trial judge
held that the computer system consisting of the central processing unit, the
memory and the printers and connected terminals constituted a telecommunication
facility within the meaning of s. 287(1)(b) of the Code. The
appeal from the conviction was allowed by a majority of the Alberta Court of
Appeal. Morrow J.A. stated that the accent of a computer system is computing or
calculation, with the relay or communication aspect only incidental and
therefore such a device did not constitute a telecommunication facility.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Laskin
C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson and Lamer JJ.: What is involved here is a data processing
facility as opposed to a telecommunication facility. Although there was
transmission of intelligence from one part of the facility to another, there
was no reception by other facilities nor emissions from the facility. What was
aimed at in s. 287 is the theft of information from a facility through
which it is channelled. The function of a computer is not the channelling
of information to outside recipients so as to be susceptible to
unauthorized use but rather to permit the making of complex calculations and to
process, correlate, store and retrieve information. Criminal statutes should,
where there is uncertainty or ambiguity of meaning, be construed in favour of
rather than against an accused. The accused must be brought fully within the
statute and cannot be held guilty of a violation if it is only applicable in
part. In this case the conduct of the accused was not clearly caught

[Page 332]

by the statute so as to warrant a conviction.

Per Ritchie
and Estey JJ.: An essential characteristic of a “telecommunication” is the
“transmission… of signals”. Transmission connotes delivery from an origination
point to a reception point. It does not connote a conceptual transfer of
something with neither sender nor receiver, such as the electromagnetic impulses
which flow inside a computer during its operation. It is useful to note that
the same definition of “telecommunication” is used in various broadcasting
legislation unrelated to the licensing or regulation of computers.

Maltais v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 441, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal[1],
setting aside the conviction of the respondent. Appeal dismissed.

M.D. Thachuk, for the appellant.

Dan Hagg, for the respondent.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Dickson
and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The issue in this appeal,
which is here as of right pursuant to Criminal Code , s 621(1)(a),
is whether theft is committed, contrary to Criminal Code , s. 287(1) (b),
where a person, without colour of right, uses a computer to obtain internal
programmes of the computer and information from other persons’ files in the
computer. The issue is a narrow one, turning on whether the appropriation of
the programmes and other information involves use of a “telecommunication
facility”.

Section 287(1) (b) reads as follows:

287.(1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently, maliciously, or without colour of right,

…

(b) uses any
telecommunication facility or obtains any telecommunication service.

[Page 333]

Subsection 2 defines “telecommunication” to
mean “any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing,
images, sounds or intelligence of any nature by radio, visual, electronic or
other electromagnetic system”.

The accused was indicted on two counts, one of
theft under s. 287(1)(b) and one of mischief under s. 387(1)(c).
He was acquitted on the second count and it is no longer in issue. However, he
was convicted on the theft count by Hope J. who held that the computer system,
consisting of the central processing unit (the main frame), the memory and the
printers and connected terminals (of which there were about three hundred at
the material time) constituted a “telecommunication facility” which was used by
the accused. This brought him, according to the trial judge, within the terms
of s. 287(1) (b). Hope J. apparently did not find it necessary to
examine whether there was a “transmission” or “reception” involved in the use
made of the computer by the accused, as those terms are found in the statutory
definition of “telecommunication”. After referring to the evidence touching the
components of the computer system, he concluded as follows:

…I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the computer in all its components is a telecommunication facility within
the meaning of the very wide definition that I have previously mentioned.

The accused’s appeal from his conviction was
allowed by a majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal, McClung J., ad hoc, dissenting.
Morrow J.A. who spoke for the majority (Laycraft J.A. concurring with him) said
that the evidence showed that “the unauthorized use was with respect to
processing of material although it had to move from the central processing unit
to the actual access point being used by the appellant”. Proceeding from this,
and noting the principle that any ambiguity in a criminal provision should be
resolved in favour of the accused, he then adopted the approach in Maltais
v. The Queen[2], (to
which I will refer later in these reasons) and came to the following
determination:

[Page 334]

…I am unable to read “telecommunication
facility” along with the statutory definition of “telecommunication” as having
application to the unit or device with all its various components under
consideration in the present case. The whole accent here is on computing or
calculation with the relay or communication aspect as only incidental. It seems
to me it would be an improper extrusion of the language to hold that such a
device constituted a telecommunication facility.

McClung J., ad hoc, in his dissent
referred to the purpose for which the computer and its access lines were
constructed, namely, as a time sharing service for the various programmes at
the University of Alberta which owned the computer, with access to it permitted
both from inside and outside the university. He was of the view that “this
could only be done by telecommunication and the appellant, obviously, was aware
of it”, and he supported the conviction in the following terms:

…His asportation of the data provided by
the central processing system was made possible by the very telecommunication
that he now denounces as ancillary to it. The evidence persuades me that the
facility intercepted by the accused was a computer designed to electronically
receive and furnish information with speed and convenience to a wide but
selective audience of recipients. The electronic transmission of the
information was not incidental to its function—it was integral of it.

Section 287 has a history which began in simpler
times when electricity alone was the protected resource, as expressed in the Electric
Lighting Act, 1882 (Imp.), c. 56, s. 23, making it an offence
maliciously or fraudulently to, inter alia, abstract or use any
electricity. This provision was adopted in Canada by The Electric Light Inspection Act, 1894 (Can.), c. 39, s. 10, and was carried
into s. 351 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146. It was the
same numbered provision in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. In
1934, the prohibition was extended to encompass the use of a telephone or
telegraph line or the obtaining of telephone or telegraph service maliciously
or fraudulently: see 1934 (Can.),
c. 47, s. 10. In the revision and re-enactment of the Criminal Code  by
1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, “gas”
was brought within the prohibition which became s. 273 . This
section was

[Page 335]

repealed by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 6, and the following substituted:

273. (1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently, maliciously, or without colour of right,

(a) abstracts, consumes or
uses electricity or gas or causes it to be wasted or diverted; or

(b) uses any
telecommunication wire or cable or obtains any telecommunication service.

(2) In this section, “telecommunication”
means any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing,
images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire or cable.

It was this provision which, as R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, s. 287, was before this Court in Maltais v. The Queen, supra. In
that case, Dickson J., speaking for the full Court, held that
“telecommunication”, defined to mean transmission by wire or cable, did not
cover transmission by air waves and hence did not embrace radio transmission.
What was involved in the Maltais case was the seizure of a radio station
by teachers seeking to air their grievances. The microphone in the radio
station studio was commandeered to broadcast their views. Broadcasts went by
wire to a transmitting tower a mile away and, from there, were transmitted by
Hertzian waves to receiving sets in various homes. This Court, dealing as it was
with a charge of theft as a statutory crime, refused to draw a distinction
between a transmission which was partly by wire and cable and a transmission
which was wholly by wire and cable. The effective transmission was radio
transmission and this was not then covered by s. 287.

The Maltais case is not of direct
assistance here in construing and applying the present s. 287(1) (b),
although it does affirm the general rule that in construing criminal statutes
they should, where there is uncertainty or ambiguity of meaning, be construed
in favour of rather than against an accused. In short, he must be brought fully
within the statute and cannot be held guilty of a violation if it is only
applicable in part. It is clear now, as it was not in the Maltais case, that
radio

[Page 336]

and television broadcasting facilities are
covered by the re-enacted s. 287.

I have no doubt that a computer system may be
termed a “facility”, as being something built, installed or established to
serve a particular function or to accomplish some end or provide a certain
service. Is it, however, a facility constructed to serve a telecommunication
function, within the definition of “telecommunication” in s. 287(2)?

“Transmission… or reception of… intelligence of
any nature” connotes to me, in the light of the history of s. 287, that
what is aimed at is the theft of information from a facility through which it
is channelled. True, what is involved here is an electronic system, but the
function of the computer is not the channelling of information to outside
recipients so as to be susceptible in that respect to unauthorized use. Rather,
it is to permit the making of complex calculations, to process and correlate
information and to store it, and to enable it to be retrieved. The distinction
I would draw is, admittedly, narrow. However, I do not think that using a
terminal, as did the accused, to plug into the central processing unit and to
retrieve information stored there brings such use within s. 287(1) (b).
The use of the terminal itself would not bring s. 287(1) (b) into
play, and the fact that the accused, by using the terminal, was able to make
electronic connection with the central processing unit to capture information
that was stored there does not advance the case against him.

What is involved here is a data processing
facility rather than a telecommunication facility, although it incorporates
electronic equipment. Taking the facility as a whole (the central processing
unit and the terminals), there was no transmission or reception externally.
Although there was transmission of intelligence from one part of the facility
to another, there was no reception by other facilities nor emissions from this
facility. In my opinion, the conduct of the accused is not so

[Page 337]

clearly caught by the statute as to warrant a
conviction thereunder.

I would dismiss the appeal.

Ritchie J. concurred with the reasons delivered
by

ESTEY J.—I have had the advantage of reading the
reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice herein and wish only to add these comments
concerning the nature of the charge, the section under which the charge
has been laid, and the activities of the accused which gave rise to the charge.

The accused is charged that he “did fraudulently
and without colour of right use a telecommunication facility, the property of
the University of Alberta, Edmonton, and did thereby commit theft contrary to
s. 287(1) (b) of the Criminal Code ” Section 287
of the Code provides as follows:

287.(1) Every one commits theft who
fraudulently, maliciously, or without colour of right,

(a) Not applicable;

(b) uses any
telecommunication facility or obtains any telecommunication service.

(2) In this section… “telecommunication”
means any transmission, emission or reception of signs, signals, writing,
images, sounds or intelligence of any nature by radio, visual, electronic or
other electromagnetic system.

The facts are very simple. The accused, without
any authority, made use of the computer and its associated facilities. The
computer is described in the evidence as being, in the words of the Court of
Appeal:

…made up of several components which were
essential to its operation. These included a main frame, a central processing
unit, terminals, memory and printers.

The associated equipment included some three
hundred terminals scattered about the campus of the university and connected to
the computer by electric wires.

The charge must stand or fall on the simple
issue as to whether or not a computer is “a tele-

[Page 338]

communication facility” as that term is used and
partially defined in the section of the Code. “Facility” is defined
as follows:

…something (as a hospital, machinery,
plumbing) that is built, constructed, installed, or established to perform some
particular function or to serve or facilitate some particular end.

Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary (1976)

…something designed, built, installed,
etc., to serve a specific function affording a convenience or service:
transportation facilities…

Random House Dictionary of the English
Language (1973)

The term “telecommunication” is defined in subs.
(2) above and is identical with the definition found in the Radio Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. R-1, s. 2(1), and the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission Act , 1974-75-76 (Can.), c. 49, s. 2, except
that, unlike the definition in the Code, the word “wire” is added before
“radio” and the word “electronic” is excluded so that the definition reads:

“telecommunication” means any transmission,
emission or reception of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or
intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual or other electromagnetic
system;

The combination of the two words connotes, in my
view, a physical establishment or combination of physical components employed
in the transmission or reception of signals by electromagnetic systems. We are
not concerned with the activating source of the telecommunication facility
whether it be a human voice, a telex machine, or other device for the
generating of impulses to be delivered by a “telecommunication facility”. Thus
we are not concerned with the situation where a computer might be employed to
activate a telecommunication facility. We are simply concerned with whether or
not a computer is “a telecommunication facility”. Computers are variously
defined according to the nature of the audience to which the publication may be
directed. We find, for example, in 16 Am Jur Proof of Facts 273:

[Page 339]

Computers may be defined as systems of
machines that process information in the form of letters, numbers, and other
symbols, and that are selfdirecting within predetermined limits.

Another more cryptic definition, “Basically, any
kind of computing device”, is found in Peter Seipel’s Computing Law, (Stockholm, 1977) at p. 344.

“Computer” is also defined as follows:

…a calculator esp. designed for the
solution of complex mathematical problems; specif: a programmable electronic
device that can store, retrieve, and process data… any of several devices for
making rapid calculations in navigation or gunnery…

Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1976)

…a mechanical or electronic apparatus
capable of carrying out repetitious and highly complex mathematical operations
at high speeds. Computers are used in business for the maintenance of
inventories, the calculation and preparation of payrolls, etc.; in industry for
the automatic operation of machinery, the control of refinery operations, etc.;
and in research for the determination of flight characteristics of missiles and
spacecraft, the prediction of the behavior of substances acted upon by a number
of variables, etc.

Random House Dictionary of the English
Language (1973)

That information in the form of electromagnetic
impulses flows inside the computer during its operations is unquestioned in the
evidence. As pointed out in 16 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts at p. 291,
information flows between and within “various portions of the computer” and
“must be guided from source to destination in logical sequence according to a
prescribed plan…” The sequence of the flow of information within the device is,
of course, all directed to the discharge of the device’s function, namely, the
provision of a solution for a particular problem. Counsel were unable to direct
the Court’s attention to any authority which indicated any classification of
the computer as a unit which might either be described as a telecommunication
facility or a component in a telecommunication facility “or other
electromagnetic system”. Again the distinction must be emphasized

[Page 340]

between an activating device connected to a
telecommunication facility and that facility itself. It is trite to observe
that a pocket calculator or a digital watch functions by means of electrical
impulses which eventually produce a result sought by the operator. It could
hardly be within the normal contemplation of the language that either of these
devices is a “telecommunication facility”. No doubt either one could be
connected to a telecommunication facility for the communication of signals to
it for “transmission or… reception”.

An essential characteristic of a
“telecommunication” according to subs. (2) of s. 287 is “transmission… of
signals”. “Transmission” in the ordinary sense of the language connotes the
delivery from an origination point to a reception point. It does not connote a
conceptual transfer of something with neither sender nor receiver. In the Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary “transmission” is defined as:

…the act of transmitting or fact of being
transmitted; conveyance from one person or place to another; transference.

“Transmission” is also defined as follows:

…an act, process, or instance of
transmitting…

Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary (1976)

…act or process of transmitting… fact of
being transmitted…

Random House Dictionary of the English
Language (1973)

“Transmit” is defined as follows:

…to cause to go or be conveyed to another
person or place…

Webster’s Third New International
Dictionary (1976)

…to send or forward, as to a recipient or
destination

…

Random House Dictionary of the English
Language (1973)

[Page 341]

The internal processing of data by the central
processing unit of the computer and the transfer of the results of the
operation of that device to a terminal for reproduction in the form of
characters on a sheet of paper or luminous points on a cathode ray tube is
hardly within the ordinary concept of the transmission of information from one
point or one person to another point or person. Taken too literally, the
language may, of course, embrace the operation of a simple Xerox machine since
it results in the transfer of optical images from one point (the item being
printed) to another point (the blank sheet of paper on which the item is
printed), but it would hardly fall within the ordinary usage of the language to
classify such a device or system as being a telecommunication facility. The
term telecommunication as defined in the Criminal Code  connotes a sender
and a receiver. The computer, being a computing device, contemplates the
participation of one entity only, namely, the operator. In a sense, he
communicates with himself, but it could hardly be said that the operator by
operating the terminal or console of the computer is thereby communicating
information in the sense of transmitting information and hence it stretches the
language beyond reality to conclude that a person using a computer is thereby
using a telecommunication facility in the sense of the Criminal Code .

It is helpful in my view to note that precisely
the same definition of telecommunication is used by Parliament in the
broadcasting legislation noted above where clearly the statutes are in no way
concerned with the licensing and regulation of computers.

I adopt entirely the observations of the Chief
Justice with reference to the proper interpretative technique to be used when
construing a criminal statute. Had Parliament intended to associate penal
consequences with the unauthorized operation of a computer, it no doubt would
have done so in a section of the Criminal Code  or other penal
statute in which the term which is now so permanently embedded in our language
is employed. The Court would not be expected by Parliament to

[Page 342]

glean from words generally associated with the
communications industry an intent to attach penal consequences to the
unauthorized operation of a computer. I therefore concur in the disposition of
this appeal as proposed by the Chief Justice.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Combines—Conspiracy to prevent
or lessen competition unduly—Market shares maintained—Tacit agreement or
“conscious parallelism”—Burden of proof—Mens rea—Combines Investigation Act,
R.S.C 1970, c. C-23, ss. 32(1)(b), 32(1)(c)—Criminal Code , ss. 605(1) (a),
618(2) (a).

The three appellants were charged by a bill
of indictment containing two counts, both relating to the period January 1,
1960, to May 31, 1973. In count
1 the charge was that the appellants conspired to enhance unreasonably the
price of sugar in eastern Canada, and in count 2 the appellants were charged
with conspiracy to prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the production,
transportation, sale and supply of sugar in eastern Canada, contrary to
s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act.

The evidence indicated that each of the
appellants operated sugar refineries in which imported sugar was refined for
marketing in the region extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the western
boundary of Ontario. During
World War II, the marketing of sugar was regulated by the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board and the appellants, then the only sugar refiners in business, were
allotted shares of the market in eastern Canada. When the controls ended in 1949 the appellants had the following
shares of the market: Atlantic, 35.6 per cent, Redpath, 42.7 per cent and
St. Lawrence, 21.7 per cent. This proportional participation in the market
continued without interruption until 1958 when Redpath set about to increase
its market share by reducing its prices, and its share of the market rose from
42.8 per cent in 1957 to 46.6 per cent in 1958. As a result of this
price-cutting program the appellant Redpath suffered a severe financial drain
and was taken over by Tate & Lyle Limited. Thereafter, the price-cutting
policy was discontinued

[Page 645]

and each of the accused settled down to a
policy of maintaining their traditional market shares.

At trial the appellants were found not guilty
on both counts. The Court of Appeal for Quebec dismissed the appeal of the Crown with respect to count 1 but found
all the appellants guilty on count 2. The accused appealed as of right under Cr.
C. s. 618(2) (a).

Held (Estey J.
dissenting): The appeals should be allowed, the convictions set aside and the
acquittals restored.

Per Martland,
Ritchie, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and McIntyre JJ.: On the facts before him, the
trial judge found no evidence of communication between the accused on the
subject of price. He was of the opinion that while identical price lists might
give rise to an inference of an arrangement to fix price, such inference
is unwarranted where it is shown that conformity of prices was not arrived at
as a result of collusion. He concluded that since the Combines Investigation
Act does not prohibit a member of an industry from taking into account and
following his competitor’s price changes, be they up or down, it follows that
he is not prohibited from taking into account and following the system upon
which these price changes are made. The trial judge rightly held, on the
evidence, that the uniform prices were the result of independent decisions,
which he called “conscious parallelism” and do not amount to conspiracy.

With respect to the maintenance of the market
shares, the trial judge, on the evidence, found that it was the result of a
tacit agreement between the accused but that it had not been shown that the
agreement was arrived at with the intention of unduly preventing or lessening
the competition. He also said that he was not able to infer from the totality
of the evidence on this point that market shares were maintained for the
purpose of stifling competition. He found evidence of actual competition. None
of the refiners was obliged to compete more strongly than it felt desirable in
its own interest. Each refiner was entitled to decide not to seek to increase
its market share as long as this was not done by collusion. In the present
case, the “tacit agreement” which the trial judge found was obviously to lessen
competition. Whether this was a criminal offence depends exclusively on whether
competition was thus intended to be lessened “unduly”, i.e., on whether the
agreement was intended to lessen competition improperly, inordinately,
excessively, oppressively or to have the effect of virtually relieving the
conspirators from the influence of free competition. The trial judge came to
the conclusion that

[Page 646]

the Crown had failed to prove an agreement to
lessen competition unduly and there is no sound basis in the reasons for
judgment in the Court of Appeal for concluding otherwise.

While the offence charged is truly criminal
in nature and therefore requires mens rea, this does not mean that,
assuming the “tacit agreement” was illegal, the accused, or rather their
officials who are their directing minds, had to be conscious of its illegality.
If it had been intended to lessen competition “unduly” it would have been no
defence that the accused mistakenly thought that the intended lessening of
competition would not be “undue”. It is always for the Court to decide on the
facts whether an agreement to lessen competition means that competition is to
be lessened “unduly” and the views of the accused on that are irrelevant.
Finally, while the trial judge was in error in referring to the rule in Hodge’s
case with respect to circumstantial evidence, his conclusion was not based
on this view of the law and this error was, here, of no consequence.

Per Estey J., dissenting:
The Court was faced with two opposing explanations of the strange sight of
the three accused sharing virtually all the eastern Canada sugar market in
constant proportions for eleven years and thereafter sharing ninety per cent of
the market in the same proportion for another fourteen years. The theory of the
Crown is that there existed a market sharing agreement which was maintained by
the accused for many years despite changing circumstances and the fact that any
one of the accused could readily through various means have obtained a greater
share of the market, and that the agreement had the effect of lessening
competition. The theory of the defence is that the only way to increase sales
of an homogeneous product in an oligopoly is to reduce prices, the result of
which is either a depletion of supplies and depressed earnings by the firm
lowering its prices or a price war. Since the results in either case are
disastrous, the only alternative is for each member of the oligopoly to seek to
maintain its traditional market share.

The trial judge described the onus upon the
Crown as follows: a) that the accused entered into an agreement; b) that the object
of the agreement was to lessen competition; c) that the intended lessening of
competition was undue. The third element, when read with other comments in the
trial judgment, reveals an error in law and opens up the avenue of appeal to
the Court of Appeal by

[Page 647]

way of s. 605(1) (a) of the
Criminal Code , as it imposes a greater burden of proof than that imposed
by the law. The appellants contended, however, that in any event they could not
be convicted under s. 32(1) (c) on the basis of a “tacit agreement”,
for there were no communications between the parties as a result of which an
expectation was aroused in each that the others would act in a certain way.
That argument carries by implication the notion that s. 32  somehow imports
the doctrines of the law of contracts into the criminal law. That view cannot
be sustained. The section refers to “conspires, combines or agrees or
arranges”. The agreement clearly need not be enforceable for axiomatically it
is not. The parties to the transaction must be deemed to know that it is
unenforceable as being illegal. They have by their conduct indeed foresaken the
ordinary recourse to the civil law. Therefore the agreement may be proven, in
the sense of being made capable of discernment by the finder of fact from all
the surrounding facts and circumstances, including the conduct of the parties.
Conspiracy, like all other crimes, may be established by inference from the
conduct of the parties. The trial judge has expressly found a tacit agreement
to limit market shares. He went on to find that in the circumstances an
agreement to lessen competition would be undue. The onus on the Crown had been
met, and the defence of conscious parellelism, which might be a valid element
in the legal position of an accused under s. 32  in some commercial
circumstances, is not opened in a case, as here, where the tribunal is not
concerned with a market shared by a wide range of suppliers but with a market
shared by three suppliers. The tacit agreement as found was to maintain the
proportion of the sugar trade historically enjoyed by each of the accused. This
relationship necessarily involved the curbing of free competition where it
would upset this balance of trade shares. It matters not that these reins on
free competition are imposed for good motives on the part of the accused. The
tacit agreement axiomatically entails a restraint on competition and that
restraint produced a lessening which the trial judge has found in all the
circumstances of this case to be undue. Finally, the trial judge erred in law
in directing himself to the effect that proof of intent made by circumstancial
evidence must meet the test in Hodge’s case, such formula having been
rejected by the Court as an inexorable rule of law in Canada. That error is, of course, against the interest of the respondent
and not the appellant.

The judgment of Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon,
Dickson, Beetz and McIntyre JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J.—The appellants were charged by
indictment on two counts for offences under the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-23, ss. 32(1)(b) and 32(1)(c) respectively between
January 1, 1960 and May 31, 1973, as follows:

1. Conspiracy “to enhance unreasonably the price
of” sugar;

2. Conspiracy “to prevent or lessen, unduly,
competition in the production … or supply of” sugar.

After a protracted trial, the accused were
acquitted on both counts by Mackay J. (1976, 26 C.P.R. (2d) 14). On appeal by
the Attorney General of Canada the acquittal was affirmed on the first count
but reversed on the second count and a verdict of guilty was entered on that
count (1978, 3 B.L.R. 221, 41 C.C.C. (2d) 209). The appeal by

[Page 649]

the accused to this Court was taken as of a
right under Cr. C s. 618(2) (a).

On the facts before him Mackay J. found no
evidence of communication between the accused on the subject of price (at
p. 96). Dealing with the allegation of price fixing as an element of the
alleged conspiracy to prevent or lessen competition, he said (at p. 97):

In an oligopolistic situation where the
product is homogeneous—as in sugar—the price of the product must inevitably be
the same, for if one member priced his product higher than the others he would
have no sales. If he posted a lower price he would soon be inundated with
buyers, would realize his price was too low, perhaps unprofitable, and raise
it. Thus by natural osmosis the price of an homogeneous product tends to reach
the same level. But the process might be costly and is certainly inefficient.
There are two ways to avoid it. Firstly, by the members of the industry
conspiring to fix prices, which is illegal, or by the members of the industry
making a conscious effort to parallel the prices of the leader.

After referring to the judgment of Lerner J. in R.
v. Armco Ltd. and others[3], Mackay
J. said (at p. 98):

With great respect, I am of opinion that
while identical price lists might give rise to an inference of an arrangement
to fix prices, such inference is unwarranted where it is shown that conformity
of prices was not arrived at as a result of collusion.

Then, after quoting from several witnesses, he
held against any inference of a price fixing arrangement, concluding his
remarks on that point as follows (at pp. 100-101):

Since the Act does not prohibit a member of
an industry from taking into account and following his competitors’ price
changes, be they up or down, it follows that he is not prohibited from taking
into account and following the system upon which these price changes are made.

[Page 650]

Moreover, although all Canadian refiners
had identical price lists, there were, as Miller said, exceptions when the
actual sales prices varies as a result of customers’ discounts, not including
discounts for prompt payment.

Mr. T. Moorse, former Vice President
of Neilson’s Lowneys testified:

“A. … That price list is for anybody and
everybody. And if we were a big buyer, like any other big buyers, we would feel
entitled to certain extra consideration for the volume.

Q. Mm-hmm. Discounts of some sort?

A. Yes.

Q. When you approached two or more of the
refineries in the way you have just described. What sort of results did you get
in the way of price levels? Did they vary or were they identical or what?

A. They varied. Of course they varied,
because—they weren’t certainly all the same, because first of all I was dealing
with different people”.

Testimony of the officers of other
industrial sugar users, such as Loeb Ltd., Coca-Cola Ltd., Rowntree-MacIntosh,
Fry-Cadbury and General Foods, was to the effect that the refiners’ quotes
invariably differed appreciably.

Then dealing with the allegation of a market
sharing agreement Mackay J. said (at pp. 101-103):

In virtue of Wartime Controls, quotas for
the production of refined sugar in Eastern Canada had been allotted to the accused
in the following proportions (ex. P-1-A):

 


 
  
  Atlantic
  
  
  35.5%
  
 
 
  
  Redpath
  
  
  43.0%
  
 
 
  
  St. Lawrence
  
  
  21.5%
  
 


Their shares of the refined sugar market
until controls ended in 1949 were (ex. P-1-A):

 


 
  
  Atlantic
  
  
  35.6%
  
 
 
  
  Redpath
  
  
  42.7%
  
 
 
  
  St. Lawrence
  
  
  21.7%
  
 


During the next decade, the market shares
varied slightly. But in 1958, Redpath having just opened its Toronto refinery
and being anxious to increase sales and recoup some of the heavy expenses
involved, surrepti-

[Page 651]

tiously began to cut prices in the Toronto
area. Atlantic felt the loss of sales in that area and so began to cut its
prices there, although this represented a serious expense, due to the
absorption by Atlantic of the unsubsidized portion of the freight from the
refinery in St. John to the nearest basing point which was now Toronto
instead of Montreal as it had been before the new refinery was constructed. The
price war spread to include St. Lawrence. There were two results—First:
Redpath increased its market share at the expense of the others from 42.8% in
1957 to 46.6% in 1958. Second: it lost the price war against its two
well-funded opponents, and having sustained serious financial losses it was
ripe for a take-over by Tate and Lyle.

Thereafter, each of the accused settled
down to a policy of maintaining their traditional market shares. Although each
stressed that this was the result of an independent decision, one would be
ingenuous not to be aware that there was and continues to be a tacit agreement
to this effect.

But with respect, I do not think the
competitive stratagems suggested by the Crown, apart from increasing discounts,
that is price cutting, would have any effect on individual market shares. And
the unhappy results of price cutting still remain fresh in the corporate
memories …

On the evidence, I find that the
maintenance of traditional market shares—which were adjusted but in the same
proportion when Cartier came on steam—was the result of a tacit agreement
between the accused. But in my opinion, it has not been shown that this
agreement was arrived at with the intention of unduly preventing or lessening
competiton. The reason for maintaining traditional market shares was to avoid a
price war which would have resulted had the accused taken the only method of
increasing them by price cutting through extensive discounts. Nor am I able to
infer from the totality of the evidence on this point, including overt acts,
that market shares were maintained for the purpose of stifling competition. On
the contrary, Cartier was launched in 1964 and none of its initial difficulties
were due to the maintenance of market shares. West‑cane was launched
successfully in 1969. Austin attempted to launch Austin Sugar Refineries
Limited in the Cornwall area with Government support in 1971 (ex. D-11 A and
B). That this project was never realized was

[Page 652]

in no way due to the maintenance of market
shares by the accused.

In passing, it is interesting to read in
the prospectus for this last project that (ex. D-11-A):

“The purchase of raw sugar on the
International markets for refining and the development of sales for refined
sugar products, present no formidable obstacles in a market in which Robin
Austin & Co. Ltd. has operated successfully for over twenty years”.

Therefore, after considering all the
evidence, both of the prosecution and the defence, and the arguments of
counsel, I have come to the conclusion that the prosecution has not satisfied
me beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, as charged in the second count
of the indictment, unlawfully conspired, combined, agreed or arranged together
and with one another and with certain named co-conspirators to prevent or
lessen, unduly, competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter,
sale, transportation or supply of raw or refined sugar. And as such it is my
duty to give the accused the benefit of the doubt and to find them not guilty
of that offence.

With respect I must point out that the reasons
for judgment in the Court of Appeal fail to show on what basis competition
should be held to have been agreed to be lessened “unduly”. Mayrand J.A., with
whom Owen J.A. concurred, dealt with the case on a misconception of the
evidence as to market shares saying (at p. 237):

[TRANSLATION] Following this costly
commercial experience, the three refineries gave up their price war and simply
divided the market as it was at that time. This division corresponded almost
exactly to the following territorial division: Atlantic controlled the three
maritime provinces, while Redpath had sole control of the Ontario market and
divided the Quebec market with St. Lawrence (at first St. Lawrence
Sugar Refineries Ltd., which was succeeded by S.L.S.R. Holdings Ltd., and is
now Sucronel Ltd.). In 1973, these three respondents by themselves controlled
some 74.09 per cent of the entire Canadian market.

Counsel for the Crown at the hearing in this
Court admitted that there was no evidence of a territorial market division
between the accused. His submission was that the “tacit agreement” for the
maintenance of traditional market shares

[Page 653]

which was found by Mackay J. was undue in law.
His contention was that an agreement to restrict competition so as not to alter
relative market shares was the equivalent of an agreement not to compete at
all, that it was totally destructive to competition and therefore undue in law.
As to this I might point out immediately that the trial judge did find evidence
which he accepted of actual competition and would refer to the passage quoted
from his judgment at pp. 100-101 of the report. I fail to see how it can be
said that the “tacit agreement” found by the trial judge meant the elimination
of competition when it is a fact that competition did subsist and that it did
subsist, not in violation of the “tacit agreement”, but as an integral part of the
course of conduct from which the “tacit agreement” was inferred. To support his
submission that the “tacit agreement” meant the practical destruction of
competition not just a lessening which would not be unlawful unless found
undue, counsel for the Crown referred to a memorandum dated September 16, 1966,
which was prepared by the President of the Company then known as Canada and
Dominion Sugar, now known as Redpath Industries Ltd., the largest concern in
the field and the acknowledged price leader. This memo starts with a sales
analysis for the first eight months of 1966 and the comment on those figures
reads:

C & D share of market for period Jan./March was too high,
therefore competitors started increased price cutting (in any of its forms). In
fact our desire to hold our share of the market plus meet the Cartier situation
must have hurt the others before the end of December 31st, 1965. The increased
cutting of prices had a definite, compounding effect on our sales, i.e.

[Page 654]

What we failed to do was to start meeting
cuts to stop the declining trend around July/August. We, in fact, did the
opposite. We withdrew all cuts in order to restore price stability. This was
reasonable attitude or position to take but in retrospect, we should have been
the last to withdraw cuts, not the first, to flatten out the declining trend.

Then, after a statement of possible courses of
action, there is the following comment:

If prices are equal, i.e. no price cutting,
C & D will obtain gradually more than its share of the market because we
are in a better position from a product and service view point to satisfy
customer needs. Competitive reaction will be price cutting and unless this
price cutting is limited in nature (time and volume) C & D will begin to
lose out. It is at this point that timing is critical. Any price cutting by C
& D to restore its share can prompt additional price cutting by competitors
if they have failed to realize that their share of the market has been
restored.

Ability to price cut. Because of the
structure of the raw sugar market in recent months, a relatively high margin,
profitable differentials on bulk/liquid, 5 and 10 lb. bags, all refiners are in
a position to price cut without too much hesitation. Many price cuts have been
directed towards those items. Large sophisticated buyers who keep a close watch
on refining margin are aware that the real margin has increased substantially
because refiners are not paying full forward premiums for future raw sugar
deliveries. These buyers are demanding price cuts.

On page 8 of a memo to members of the Management
Committee also dated September 1966 and entitled: “The Next Five Years’
Objectives and Strategy”, the conclusion is:

From the foregoing policy an explicit
strategy arises which impinges on all our sugar operations. This is that we
will look for extra profit in the immediate future from improving the
efficiency of our operations and from concentrating on the more profitable
products rather than from taking more margin or increasing

[Page 655]

volume above our historical market share.
As our marketing operation gains in sophistication, we will from time to time
review the appropriateness of this strategy.

Those statements substantiate the trial judge’s
finding of a “tacit agreement” to maintain “historical market shares”. From
that angle, the second passage quoted is specially important. When reaching the
decision to start price cutting again so as to “restore” its market share,
Redpath took it for granted that its competitors would not resort to additional
price cutting so long as their own shares of the market would remain intact. It
was also realized that time had to be allowed for the competitors to become
aware of Redpath’s course of action. Thus, the meaning of the “tacit agreement”
becomes clear: Redpath felt sure that its competitors would not resort to
“increased price cutting” if their “historical market shares” were restored. On
the other hand it did realize from the results of this course of action that if
it renounced any form of price competition, it would not maintain its own
“historical market share”. It therefore decided to make some price cutting
again but to restrict this form of competition so as not to do more than
restore its “historical market share”, feeling confident that its competitors,
provided the timing was careful, would realize what was being done and would
also be satisfied to keep their “historical market share”.

Counsel for St. Lawrence Sugar Ltd. has
contended that such a “tacit agreement”, being merely the conscious adoption of
a uniform course of action without any communication, assent or promise, did
not amount to a conspiracy. He pointed out that there was no illegality in the
independent adoption of such a policy of limited competition. A conspiracy
requires agreement. Is a finding of a “tacit agreement “sufficient?

[Page 656]

It must be accepted that a conspiracy may be
effected in any way and may be established by inference. In dealing with the
refiners’ uniform prices, the trial judge felt that they raised an inference of
collusion. However he accepted (at p. 98) that this was a result of
independent decisions called “conscious parallelism” which is not illegal. The
evidence was clear, however, that not only were its competitors immediately
aware of Redpath’s list price the moment a new price was posted in its lobby,
they also in time were able to discover Redpath’s pricing formula by a process
of deduction from available data. Yet the trial judge held, correctly I think,
that this did not constitute a conspiracy to maintain uniform prices according
to Redpath’s formula but merely “conscious parallelism”. Could this not be just
as accurately called “parallelism by tacit agreement”?

The basis for an inference of “tacit agreement”
was in a way stronger for the uniform list price than for the maintenance of
market shares. There was a feature which could be considered as the making of
an offer, that is the publication of a list price which meant that it was
immediately made known to the competitors by the brokers. Hence, I find that
the trial judge quite properly on that point put the burden on the defence to
disprove the evidence of collusion.

The situation was different in respect of the
adoption by Redpath of a maintenance of traditional market share sales policy.
There is no evidence that this policy was in any way made known to its
competitors. Furthermore, it was not like the list price a perfectly defined
policy. The method by which it was to be in force, the selective price cuts to
big buyers, was left to the judgment of those who were to implement that
policy. There is no suggestion that the extent of the price cutting was to be
made known to the competitors. On the contrary the evidence is that, when there
was competitive bidding, the quotations submitted dif-

[Page 657]

fered appreciably. On the other hand, just as
the competitors would in time become aware of Red-path’s pricing formula, they
would inevitably become aware of its marketing policy and Red-path’s president
was conscious of this when adopting it.

When, as expected, the competitors did adopt a
similar policy, did this mean that an agreement had been reached? In order to
make an agreement by tacit acceptance of an offer there must not only be a
course of conduct from which acceptance may be inferred, there must also be
communication of this offer. In the case of the list price, this was apparent
and did cast a burden on the defence. But there was no such communication of
the marketing policy. In those circumstances, did the “tacit agreement”
resulting from the expected adoption of a similar policy by the competitors
amount to a conspiracy? I have great difficulty in agreeing that it did because
the author of Redpath’s marketing policy was conscious that its competitors
would inevitably after some time become aware of it in a general way and also
expected them to adopt a similar policy which would also become apparent.

It appears to me that the Crown’s contention
implies (and this is apparent from what the trial judge says at p. 101)
that, in the situation of the sugar industry in Eastern Canada, each of the
refiners was obliged to endeavour to increase its market share at the expense
of the others, otherwise it was agreeing to lessen competition unduly. In my
view, the trial judge was correct in rejecting this submission. None of the
refiners was obliged to compete more strongly than it felt desirable in its own
interest. Each refiner was entitled to decide not to seek to increase its
market share as long as this was not done by collusion and, in my view, the
trial judge was right in coming to the conclusion that what he called the
“tacit agreement” to maintain market shares was not an agreement to lessen

[Page 658]

competition unduly.

As I have already indicated, I cannot agree with
the submission that this “tacit agreement” to maintain market shares involved
the elimination of competition. On the contrary, as we have just seen, the
evidence is clear that it involved only a lessening of competition. When it
discontinued the financially disastrous price cutting whereby it had increased
its share of the market, Redpath realized that without any price cutting it was
not only losing the excess but failing to maintain its former market share. The
decision to strive for stability on the basis of maintaining “historical market
share” was therefore not a decision to forego all price competition. On the
contrary, it meant that some price concessions would be made to the big buyers
but that this would be adjusted so as to maintain the “historical market share”
as close as possible without any increase or diminution. That this involved a
lessening of competition is apparent. However, it is equally clear that it did
not involve a suppression of competition. The question is whether it meant that
competition was intended to be “unduly” lessened.

Section 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act reads:

32. (1) Every one who conspires, combines,
agrees or arranges with another person …

(c) to prevent, or lessen,
unduly, competition in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter, sale,
storage, rental, transportation or supply of an article, or in the price of
insurance upon persons or property, or

…

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

I see no need to review the authorities on the
meaning of “unduly” in this enactment. Together

[Page 659]

with the leading case of Howard Smith Paper
Mills Ltd. et al. v. The Queen[4], they
have recently been exhausively examined by Ritchie J. when writing the majority
opinion in Aetna Insurance Co. and others v. The Queen[5]. At page 748 he quoted as an
accurate assessment of the meaning of “unduly” the trial judge’s conclusion of
this point as follows:

This review of the various statements on
the meaning of “unduly” as it relates to the offence of lessening competition
brings me to these conclusions. An agreement to prevent or lessen competition
alone is not an offence. What is criminal is an agreement that is intended to
lessen competition improperly, inordinately, excessively, oppressively or one
intended to have the effect of virtually relieving the conspirators from the
influence of free competition. There is no requirement for the Crown to prove
the existence of a monopoly and it is a question of fact as to whether the
agreement reaches the point of intending to lessen competition unduly and
therefore becomes a criminal conspiracy.

I find it abundantly clear that, applying this
test to the facts found by the trial judge, it is impossible to say that he
erred in law when coming to the conclusion that the Crown had failed to prove
an agreement to lessen competition unduly. I am unable to find in the reasons for
judgment in the Court of Appeal any sound basis for concluding otherwise and,
as I have already indicated, I am unable to find any valid reason for so
concluding on the facts relied on by counsel for the Crown.

I must note, however, that it has correctly been
pointed out that, in view of the decision of this Court in R. v. Cooper[6], Mackay J. was in error in his
statement, when dealing with the law, (at p. 23) that “the law concerning
circumstantial evidence must be applied and the rule in Hodge’s case followed”.
In fairness to the trial judge, I will note that his judgment is dated December
19, 1975 and

[Page 660]

the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal
which quashed Cooper’s conviction by application of the rule in Hodge’s
case and was later reversed in this Court, had been rendered March 24, 1975
(7 O.R. (2d) 429). This would not, of course, save the trial judge’s conclusion
if it was actually based on this view of the law which must now be held
erroneous. I am however satisfied that the trial judge’s conclusion on the
point presently being considered was in no way reached by the application of
that rule in this case. In considering whether he ought to make the inference
of a “tacit agreement” to maintain market shares, he did not put the question
whether this was the only possible conclusion consistent with the proven facts,
he just said (at p. 102):

Although each stressed that this was the
result of an independent decision, one would be ingenuous not to be aware that
there was and continues to be a tacit agreement to this effect.

I must also point out that while, as was
stressed in Aetna, the offence lies in the agreement made with the
intention to lessen competition unduly, not in the actual result of the
agreement, no such distinction has to be made when, as here, the only evidence
of the agreement is found in the course of conduct from which it is inferred.
In the present case, the “tacit agreement” which the trial judge found was
obviously to lessen competition as it was in fact lessened in the manner above
described. Whether this was a criminal offence depends exclusively on whether
competition was thus lessened “unduly”. While the offence charged is truly
criminal in nature and therefore requires mens rea, this does not mean
that, assuming the “tacit agreement” was illegal, the accused, or rather their
officials who are their directing minds, had to be conscious of its illegality.
If it had been intended to lessen competition “unduly” it would have been no
defence that the accused mistakenly thought that the intended lessening of
competition would not be “undue”. It is always for the Court to decide on the
facts whether an agreement to lessen competition means that competition is to
be lessened “unduly” and the views of the accused on that are

[Page 661]

irrelevant.

I would allow the appeals, set aside the
convictions entered by the Court of Appeal and restore the acquittals.

The following are the reasons delivered by

ESTEY J. (dissenting)—This appeal from a
conviction entered by the Court of Appeal of Quebec after an acquittal by the
Superior Court raises a number of issues of importance, the examination of
which requires a consideration at the outset of the principal facts, and the
law applied to those facts in each of the Courts below.

The three appellants were charged by a bill of
indictment containing two counts, both relating to the period January 1, 1960
to May 31, 1973. In count 1 the charge is that the appellants conspired to
enhance unreasonably the price of sugar in eastern Canada (that is to say, in
the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward
Island and Newfoundland); and in count 2 the appellants are charged with
conspiracy to prevent or lessen unduly competition in the production,
transportation, sale and supply of sugar in eastern Canada, contrary to
s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C‑23.

The evidence indicates that each of the
appellants operated sugar refineries in which imported sugar was refined for
marketing in the region extending from the Atlantic to the western boundary of
Ontario. During World War II, the marketing of sugar was regulated by the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, a federal agency, and the appellants, then the
only sugar refiners in business were allotted shares of the market in eastern
Canada by that agency. When the controls ended in 1949 the appellants had the
following shares of the market:

[Page 662]


 
  
  Atlantic
  
  
  35.6 per cent with refinery at St.
  John, N.B.
  
 
 
  
  Redpath
  
  
  42.7 per cent with refineries at
  Chatham, Ont. and Montreal
  
 
 
  
  St. Lawrence
  
  
  21.7 per cent with refinery at Montreal
  
 


This proportional participation in the market
continued without interruption until 1958 when Redpath (formerly known as
Canada and Dominion Sugar Company Limited) set about to increase its market
share by reducing its prices, and its share of the eastern Canada market rose
from 42.8 per cent in 1957 to 46.6 per cent in 1958. As a result of this
price-cutting program the appellant Red-path suffered a severe financial drain
and was taken over by Tate & Lyle Limited, “the world’s largest integrated
sugar company”, as the trial judge described it.

At trial the appellants were found not guilty on
both counts. The Court of Appeal of Quebec dismissed the appeal of the Crown
with respect to count 1 but found all the appellants guilty on count 2 with
which we are now solely concerned and which reads as follows:

2. THAT at Montreal, district of Montreal,
Province of Quebec, and in divers places throughout Canada, between January
1st, 1960, and May 31st, 1973, both inclusive, ATLANTIC SUGAR REFINERIES CO.
LIMITED, REDPATH INDUSTRIES LIMITED (formerly known as Canada and Dominion
Sugar Company Limited, ST. LAWRENCE SUGAR LIMITED, and S.L.S.R. HOLDINGS
LIMITED (formerly known as St. Lawrence Sugar Refineries Limited), did
unlawfully conspire, combine, agree or arrange together and with one another
and with Czarnikow (Canada) Limited, Czarnikow-Rionda Company of New York City,
State of New York, U.S.A., Czarnikow Limited of London, England, Hodgson (East
India) Ltd., Man-sugar Ltd., M. Golodetz & Co. of New York City, State of
New York, U.S.A., Indian Sugar Mills Association of India and South African
Sugar Association of South Africa, M. Golodetz of London, England, State
Trading Corporation of India and other persons unknown or with some of them or
with one of them, to prevent or lessen, unduly, competition in the production,
manufacture, purchase, barter, sale, transportation or supply of an article or
commodity that may be the subject of trade or commerce, to wit: sugar, raw or
refined, in divers places throughout the provinces of

[Page 663]

Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and did thereby commit an
indictable offence contrary to Section 32(1)(c) of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1970, Chapter C-23.

The appeal by the Crown to the Court of Appeal
was made pursuant to s. 605 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code . The
appellants contend that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to hear the
appeal because no error of law had been committed by the learned trial judge.
If that be so, then this Court is without jurisdiction as well and therefore
the primary question to be answered is whether the Court of Appeal did indeed
entertain an appeal in which the issue was properly classified as raising a
question “of law alone” and not one of mixed fact and law.

The Court of Appeal concluded that the learned
trial judge misdirected himself in the law and concluded that had the proper
law been applied, the appellants ought to have been convicted on count 2. The
appellate court interpreted the reasons at trial to mean that in the view of
the trial judge, the law imposed a duty or burden on the Crown to prove not
only an intent on the part of the appellants to enter into an agreement to
maintain their respective shares of the sugar market but also that in doing so,
they intended thereby to lessen competition unduly. The Court of Appeal was of
the view that the Crown need only prove beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to
agree to maintain market shares, and the trier of fact, upon finding such an
agreement to have been reached by the accused, must thereupon determine as a
question of fact whether as a consequence thereof competition was unduly
lessened.

In my view the judgment at trial and the
disposition of count 2 there made, raise on appeal to the Court of Appeal a
question of law alone. Therefore the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction under
s. 605(1) (a) to entertain the appeal and I will revert to this
matter at the conclusion of these reasons.

It is convenient first to assemble and examine
the law which the learned trial judge found to be applicable to the findings he
has made; and thereafter to examine the conclusions he reached, lim-

[Page 664]

ited of course to count 2. All references to the
judgment at trial will be to (1976), 26 C.P.R. (2d) 14.

With reference to the onus on the Crown in
proving its case, Mackay J. stated at p. 23:

I cannot agree with the Crown’s statement
(legal authorities, p. 51) that “The Crown is only required to prove that
there was a conspiracy which, if carried out, would unreasonably enhance the
price of the article … It is submitted that it is not necessary to show that
the accused intended to unreasonably enhance the price of sugar any more than that
they intended to unduly lessen or prevent competition.” Surely, the
conspirators must have the intention of entering into an agreement and in fact
do enter into an agreement which, if carried out, would have the result of
unreasonably enhancing the price of an article. It need not be shown that if
the agreement was put into effect, that prices were enhanced, but simply the
agreement must have been intended to have that effect.

It will be observed that the second last
sentence requires only the single intention of entering into an agreement that
when carried out would result in unduly lessening competition (adapting it to
the words of the second count). The last sentence, however, imports the double
intent requirement, the first being the intent to enter the agreement, and the
second being the intent to lessen competition unduly.

However at p. 27, the trial court described
the onus upon the Crown as follows:

The Crown is only required to prove that
the accused intended to and did enter into an agreement which they intended to
put into effect and if put into effect, would have resulted in the unreasonable
enhancement of the price of the article. [R. v. Eddy Match Co. Ltd. et al. (1951),
13 C.R. 217 (affirmed at 18 C.R. 357)]

At p. 31, however, the Court returns to the
question of onus upon the Crown:

In brief, then the Crown, if it is to
succeed in a prosecution under the Combines Investigation Act, must
establish …

[Page 665]

As to the second count:

(a) That the accused entered into an
agreement at any time between January 1, 1960 and May 31, 1973, with one
another and/or with others named in the indictment;

(b) that the object of the agreement was to
lessen competition in the production and sale of raw or refined sugar in
eastern Canada;

(c) that the intended lessening of
competition was undue.

As to the rule in Hodge’s[7] case, the trial judge, after setting
out the rule, continues at p. 23:

Proof of intent, like proof of an
agreement, is seldom susceptible of being made by direct evidence in combines
cases and is generally established by inferences drawn from the evidence and
having a cumulative effect. This being so, the law concerning circumstantial
evidence must be applied and the rule in Hodge’s case, supra, followed.

I will return to the application of the rule in Hodge’s
case later in this judgment.

Thereafter the Court proceeded to draw certain
conclusions of law beginning with the meaning of the term ‘unduly’ as it
appears in s. 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act, supra.

In the light of these cases, it has been
suggested by Mr. Richard Gosse in an annotation “How Much May Competition
be Lessened?”, 36 C.R. 28 at p. 29, that “to obtain a conviction under
s. 32(1)(c) it must be shown that the accused entered into an
agreement to suppress competition in their particular sector of trade”.

In the view of the foregoing I am of the
opinion that, in the case at bar at least, Mr. Gosse’s interpretation of
“unduly” is the correct one to adopt. Where the accused at the beginning of the
period controlled 99.8 p. 100 of the eastern Canadian market, an agreement
to lessen competition would be tantamount to extinction, and so would be undue.
The extinction of competition would in those circumstances require the combined
action of all the accused to be effective, for if one decided to allot a
portion of its market share to a newly arrived competitor, whatever the other
two planned would be for nought. (at p. 30)

[Page 666]

Much later in his reasons the learned trial
judge makes this finding with reference to an agreement between the accused:

On the evidence, I find that the
maintenance of traditional market shares—which were adjusted but in the same
proportion when Cartier came on stream—was the result of a tacit agreement
between the accused. But in my opinion, it has not been shown that this
agreement was arrived at with the intention of unduly preventing or lessening
competition. The reason for maintaining traditional market shares was to avoid
a price war which would have resulted had the accused taken the only method of
increasing them by price cutting through extensive discounts. Nor am I able to
infer from the totality of the evidence on this point, including overt acts,
that market shares were maintained for the purpose of stifling competition. On
the contrary, Cartier was launched in 1964 and none of its initial difficulties
were due to the maintenance of market shares. West-cane was launched
successfully in 1969. Austin attempted to launch Austin Sugar Refineries
Limited in the Cornwall area with Government support in 1971 (ex. D-11A and B).
That this project was never realized was in no way due to the maintenance of
market shares by the accused, (at p. 103)

It will be observed that the Court finds that
there was a tacit agreement which resulted in the maintenance of fixed
proportions of the eastern Canada sugar market between the accused but that
such agreement was not reached for the purpose of stifling competition but
rather to avoid a price war. It should be noted that the Westcane operation
mentioned in the above excerpt commenced not in 1969 but in 1974 after the
period of the charges herein.

Earlier the learned trial judge on this point
stated:

Thereafter, each of the accused settled
down to a policy of maintaining their traditional market shares. Although each
stressed that this was the result of an independent decision, one would be
ingenuous not to be aware that there was and continues to be a tacit agreement
to this effect. (at p. 102)

[Page 667]

There is, it must be noted, an express finding
“that there was no evidence of any communication between [the accused]”. (at
p. 96)

The Court was faced with two opposing
explanations of the strange sight of the three accused sharing virtually all
the eastern Canada sugar market in constant proportions for eleven years and
thereafter sharing ninety per cent of the market in the same proportions for
another fourteen years. (The ten per cent reduction in the total share of the
three accused of the eastern Canada market went to Cartier Sugar Limited,
incorporated in 1969, which is a vertically integrated facet of the Steinberg
Limited food marketing enterprise which in turn accounted for about 50 per cent
of Carder’s sales.) These contending theories were summarized as follows:

The theory of the Crown with regard to the
accused’s maintenance of their traditional market shares is that:

There existed a market sharing agreement
which was maintained by the accused for many years despite changing
circumstances and the fact that any one of the accused could readily have obtained
a greater share of the market by, inter alia:

(a) giving greater discounts to customers,

(b) more vigorous advertising,

(c) better packaging,

(d) abolishing the basing point pricing and
freight absorption system of marketing,

(e) using maximum plant capacity,

and the agreement had the effect of
lessening competition.

The theory of the defence may be simply
put. The only way to increase sales of an homogeneous product in an oligopoly
is to reduce prices, the result of which is either a depletion of supplies and
depressed earnings by the firm lowering its prices or a price war. Since the
results in either case are disastrous, the only alternative is for each member
of the oligopoly to seek to maintain its traditional market share. (at
p. 101)

The judgment concludes with the acceptance by
the Court of the “good motive” explanation advanced by the accused and embodied
in the quotation from p. 103 of the trial judgment, supra. I
reproduce the key sentence for convenience:

[Page 668]

The reason for maintaining traditional
market shares was to avoid a parice war which would have resulted had the
accused taken the only method of increasing them by price cutting through
extensive discounts.

In the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Mayrand,
with whom Owen J.A. concurred, found that the trial judge erred in law in
determining that the Crown was required to prove that the defendant intended to
prevent or lessen competition unduly; and that in view of his finding of fact
the learned trial judge would have convicted the accused on the second count
but for the foregoing error in law. After reciting the elements of the second
count (quoted, supra, from 26 C.P.R. at p. 31 and p. 103, supra)
Mayrand J.A. concludes:

In our case, the Judge formulates an
erroneous rule of law not by inadvertence but when he wishes to be more precise
and when he declares in distinct paragraphs the three elements of proof which
are incumbent upon the Crown. We are, therefore, faced not with a wrong
formulation, but rather with a false conception of the rule of law. As a
result, the appellant is right in saying that on this point there has been an
error of law.

(41 C.P.R.(2d) 5 at p. 16 from which
all excerpts hereafter made from the Court of Appeal judgments will be taken.[8])

[Page 669]

As to the facts required to be proven by the
Crown, Mayrand J.A. states:

Three essential facts must be proven by the
Crown:

(a) an agreement in which the respondents
have participated:

(b) the object of this agreement was the
lessening of competition;

(c) the carrying out of this agreement had
to result in an undue lessening of competition.

I consider that these three essential facts
have been established if one abides by the conclusions that the Judge drew from
the evidence. (at p. 16)

Bélanger J.A. concurred in the result and
emphasized that the error in the court below lay in requiring the Crown to
prove “that the lessening of competition was intended to be undue”. (at
p. 8)

I have come to the conclusion, with all respect
to those who hold a contrary view, that the learned trial judge erroneously
determined that the Crown had a greater burden of proof than that imposed by
the law and that given the findings of fact the learned trial judge has made,
he would have convicted all the accused on the second count had he correctly
directed himself on the law.

This section of the Combines
Investigation Act has been before the Court recently in Aetna Insurance
Company et al. v. The Queen[9], where
Ritchie J., speaking for the majority, described the onus upon the Crown under
s. 32 in these terms:

[Page 670]

The burden lying upon the Crown in this
case is to establish beyond a reasonable doubt first, that the respondents
intended to enter into a conspiracy, combination, agreement or arrangement and,
secondly, that that conspiracy, combination, agreement or arrangement if
it were carried into effect would prevent or lessen competition unduly. These
are questions of fact and the only question of law to which this appeal can be
said to give rise is the meaning of unduly in the context of s. 32(1)(c).
(at p. 748)

To the same effect, Kerwin J., as he then was,
in Container Materials, Ltd. et al. v. The King[10], at p. 158, stated:

It was argued that it was not sufficient
for the Crown to show an agreement or arrangement, the effect of which would be
unduly to prevent or lessen competition, but that the agreement or arrangement
must have been intended by the accused to have that effect. This is not the
meaning of the enactment upon which the count was based. Mens rea is
undoubtedly necessary, but that requirement was met in these prosecutions when
it was shown that the appellants intended to enter, and did enter, into the
very arrangement found to exist.

Houlden J.A. accepted this to be the law in R.
v. Anthes Business Forms Limited et al.[11],
when he said at p. 373:

If the Court could find on the evidence
that the purpose or intention of the parties was to prevent or lessen
competition unduly, undoubtedly this would be sufficient for a conviction. But
the Crown was not required to prove such a purpose or intention. On the basis
of the Container Materials judgment, it was only necessary for the Crown to
prove that the effect of the agreement, if it was put into operation, would be
to prevent or lessen competition unduly.

McRuer C.J.H.C. said the question had been “set
at rest” by the Container Materials judgment in R. v. Northern
Electric Co. Ltd. et al.[12] at
p. 263.

The purpose behind the Combines Investigation
Act was discussed by Duff C.J. in Container Materials, Ltd., supra, where
he said at p. 152:

[Page 671]

The enactment before us, I have no doubt,
was passed for the protection of the specific public interest in free
competition. That, in effect, I think, is the view expressed in Weidman v.
Shragge (1912), 2 D.L.R. 734, 46 S.C.R. 1, in the judgments of the learned
Chief Justice, of Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Anglin, as
well as by myself. This protection is afforded by stamping with illegality
agreements which, when carried into effect, prevent or lessen competition
unduly and making such agreements punishable offences; and, as the enactment is
aimed at protecting the public interest in free competition, it is from that
point of view that the question must be considered whether or not the
prevention or lessening agreed upon will be undue ….

Cartwright J., in Howard Smith Paper Mills,
Ltd. et al. v. The Queen[13], carried
the discussion on to the interpretation of ‘undue’ as it applies to the
consequences of the agreement amongst the conspirators:

In essence the decisions referred to appear
to me to hold that an agreement to prevent or lessen competition in commercial
activities of the sort described in the section becomes criminal when the
prevention or lessening agreed upon reaches the point at which the participants
in the agreement become free to carry on those activities virtually unaffected
by the influence of competition, which influence Parliament is taken to regard
as an indispensable protection of the public interest; that it is the
arrogation to the members of the combination of the power to carry on their
activities without competition which is rendered unlawful; that the question
whether the power so obtained is in fact misused is treated as irrelevant; and
that the Court, except I suppose on the question of sentence, is neither
required nor permitted to inquire whether in the particular case the intended
and actual results of the agreement have in fact benefited or harmed the
public.

In other words, once it is established that
there is an agreement to carry the prevention or lessening of competiton to the
point mentioned, injury to the public interest is conclusively presumed, and
the parties to the agreement are liable to be convicted of the offence
described in s. 498(1)(d) [now s. 32(1)(c)]. The
relevant question thus becomes the extent to which the prevention and
limitation of competition are agreed to be carried and not the economic effect
of the carrying out of the agreement. In each case which arises under the
section the question whether the point described has been reached becomes one
of fact. (at pp. 426-7)

[Page 672]

I turn back to the conclusions of law and
findings of fact at trial. The learned trial judge in enumerating the three
elements of proof required of the Crown, supra, stated the third element
in language which is at least ambiguous and which I repeat for convenience:

(c) that the intended lessening of
competition was undue.

Later in his reasons the statement is amplified:

But in my opinion, it has not been shown
that this agreement was arrived at with the intention of unduly preventing or
lessening competition. (at p. 103)

In my respectful view, the combination of these
two statements reveals an error in law and opens up the avenue of appeal to the
Court of Appeal by way of s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code .

It becomes clear that the trial judge, having
found a tacit agreement affecting competition in a way which “would be undue,”
did not take the next step in the logical sequence and convict the accused on
count 2 because the Crown had, in the learned justice’s view, not demonstrated
the requirement added by the trial judge in his summary of the law that the
accused must be shown to have intended to lessen competition unduly when they
entered into the agreement. The appellants contended that, notwithstanding this
sequence of statements and findings by the trial court, they could not be
convicted under s. 32(1)(c) on the basis of a ‘tacit agreement’. It
was said, in reliance partly on the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Armco Canada Ltd. et al.[14], that
to constitute an agreement within the meaning of s. 32(1)(c) there
must be some communication between the parties as a result of which an
expectation is aroused in each that he will act in a certain way. Furthermore,
the four verbs in subs. (1) of s. 32 in any case amount to “the act of
agreeing”.

Consipracy at common law was classically defined
by Willes J. in Mulcahy v. The Queen[15],
at p. 317:

[Page 673]

A conspiracy consists not merely in the
intention of two or more, but in the agreement of two or more to do an unlawful
act, or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a decision rests
in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it into
effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties,
promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced if
lawful, punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.

This statement of the law was adopted in this
Court in R. v. O’Brien[16], at
p. 674.

We are not, of course, here confined to
authorities such as Mulcahy which were not concerned with the precise
wording employed by Parliament in this section of the Combines
Investigation Act, supra. As was said by Laidlaw J.A. in R. v.
Electrical Contractors Association of Ontario and Dent[17], at pp. 276-7:

The scope of the section is not
confined to conspiracy. It extends to and includes the wrong committed by a
person who “combines”, “agrees” or “arranges” with another person. Two or more
persons may wrongfully combine by joining together their acts and activities to
accomplish a result or by co-operating one with the other for the desired end.
Each of them may take steps to put matters in such order as will lead to a
common objective and thus arrange it. Without attempting to define the scope of
the class of persons falling within the section it would appear to me
sufficient to say that it is not limited to persons who agree one with the
other but it includes also persons who combine or arrange to do what is
prohibited by the section.

See also R. v. Armco Canada Ltd. et al.,
supra, per Houlden J.A. at pp. 41-2; R. v. Cominco Ltd.—Cominco Ltée et
al.[18]

The argument of the appellant that a tacit
agreement cannot support a conviction under s. 32(1)(c) carries by
implication the notion that s. 32 somehow imports the doctrines of the law
of contracts into the criminal law. “Agreement” with

[Page 674]

nothing more perhaps would connote parties
competent at law, the presence of an animus contrahendi, consideration
flowing between the parties, and the rules of contract law as to form and
perhaps even proof. Here, however, we have a section that refers to
“conspires, combines or agrees or arranges”. Each word adds meaning to the
sentence. The agreement clearly need not be enforceable for axiomatically it is
not. The parties to the transaction must be deemed to know that it is
unenforceable as being illegal. They have by their conduct indeed foresaken the
ordinary recourse to the civil law. The agreement may be proven, in the sense
of being made capable of discernment by the finder of fact from all the
surrounding facts and circumstances, including the conduct of the parties.
Rinfret J., as he then was, in Paradis v. The King[19], said at p. 168 that:

[c]onspiracy, like all other crimes, may be
established by inference from the conduct of the parties. No doubt the
agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but only in very rare cases
will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence. Ordinarily the evidence
must proceed by steps. The actual agreement must be gathered from “several
isolated doings”, (Kenny—”Outlines of Criminal Law”, p. 294) having
possibly little or no value taken by themselves, but the bearing of which one
upon the other must be interpreted; and their cumulative effect, properly
estimated in the light of all surrounding circumstances, may raise a
presumption of concerted purpose entitling the jury to find the existence of
the unlawful agreement.

The trial judge here has expressly found a tacit
agreement to limit market shares. There is ample evidence, in my view, for a
jury properly charged to so find. The trial judge then went on to find that in
the circumstances an agreement to lessen competition would be undue. Again this
finding rests on evidence capable of supporting it. The law applicable in such
circumstances is either that pronounced by Duff C.J. in Container Materials,
Ltd., supra, at p. 152, or by Cartwright J. as he then was in Howard
Smith Paper Mills, Ltd., supra, at p. 425; the finding having been so
made

[Page 675]

and supported by evidence it matters not upon
which basis in law it is founded.

In count 1 the Court responded to submissions on
the defence of conscious parallelism falling short by axiom of a conscious
agreement to enhance prices unduly. In count 2 the undue lessening of competition
has been alleged to have been brought about by the consistent practice on the
part of the accused of proportional market sharing. It might be in some
commercial circumstances that the defence, or at least the consideration, of
conscious parallelism would be a valid element in the legal position of an
accused under s. 32. It should be borne in mind, however, that the
tribunal here was not concerned with a market shared by a wide range of
suppliers in which a pattern of ‘conscious parallelism’ arose. There were three
principal suppliers serving ninety-eight per cent of the market for some years
during the period of charge and thereafter serving ninety per cent of the
market. For almost a quarter of a century they remained in almost
arithmetically perfect formation. Different considerations might come into play
in a shifting market region or area supplied by a large number of participants
each disporting itself according to its own interpretation of the doctrine of
economic survival of which conscious parallelism apparently forms a part. I do
no more than observe that this defence does not appear to have been advanced
under count 2 and certainly forms no part of the judgments below.

It has been said that the section describes
a relationship founded on “the act of agreeing” (R. v. Gage[20], per Perdue J.A. at p. 220).
The “act of agreeing” is but another way of describing a meeting of the minds
of the persons charged. How those minds meet or how the act of agreeing

[Page 676]

occurs is not limited to the rules and practices
of contract law. The four words describe ‘agreement’ in the broad sense
accorded to that word in the language and not the narrow term of art from a
specialized branch of the law. The tacit agreement as found was to maintain the
proportion of the sugar trade historically enjoyed by each of the accused. This
relationship necessarily involved the curbing of free competition where it
would upset this balance of trade shares. It matters not that these reins on
free competition are imposed for good motives on the part of the accused: see R.
v. Burrows et al.[21], at
p. 135; Howard Smith Paper Mills, Ltd., supra, at pp. 406-7. The
tacit agreement axiomatically entails a restraint on competition and that
restraint produced a lessening which the learned trial judge has found in all
the circumstances of this case to be undue.

In my view, the wording of the section of
the statute embraces the situation or relationship here described by the
learned trial judge as a “tacit agreement”.

I return to the reference above to the rule in Hodge’s
case. This rule has long been the subject of judicial discussion in this
country even after its demise in its country of origin (see McGreevy v.
Director of Public Prosecutions[22]). Spence
J. in R. v. Mitchell[23], said
of this rule at p. 479:

The direction in Hodge’s case did
not add to or subtract from the requirement that proof of guilt in a criminal
case must be beyond a reasonable doubt. It provided a formula to assist in
applying the accepted standard of proof in relation to the first only of the
two essential elements in a crime; i.e., the commission of the act as distinct
from the intent which accompanied that act. The first element, assuming every
circumstance could be established by evidence, would be capable of proof to a demonstration.
The latter element, save perhaps out of the mouth of the accused himself, could
never be so proved. The circumstances which establish the former

[Page 677]

not only can be, but must be consistent
with each other, as otherwise a reasonable doubt on the issue arises.

This statement was applied in this Court in John
v. The Queen[24] at
p. 791; in R. v. Bagshaw[25] and
R. v. Paul[26]. Most
recently the rule has been examined in this Court in R. v. Cooper[27] where Ritchie J., speaking for the
majority, said at p. 879:

… it will be apparent that I consider [the
factual issue] to turn on a pure question of “intention” to which the Hodge’s
rule does not apply,…

At page 881, after referring to the Mitchell case
and the others mentioned above, he added that Spence J.’s statement, supra,

must, I think, be taken to have been
accepted as confining the application of the Hodge’s case formula in the
manner there stated. This is not to say that, even where the issue is one of
identification, the exact words used by Baron Alderson must necessarily be
incorporated in a judge’s charge. It is enough if it is made plain to the
members of the jury that before basing a verdict of guilty on circumstantial
evidence they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of the
accused is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the proven facts. In
this regard it will be seen that I agree with the Chief Justice in his
rejection of the Hodge formula as an inexorable rule of law in Canada.

The Chief Justice, writing in dissent, stated
with reference to the rule in Hodge’s case with which, as we have seen,
Ritchie J. agreed, at pp. 865-6:

The time has come to reject the formula in Hodge’s
case as an inexorable rule of law in Canada. Without being dogmatic against
any use of the formula of the charge in Hodge’s case I would leave the
matter to the good sense of the trial judge (as was said in McGreevy),
with the reminder that a charge in terms of the traditional formula of
required proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the safest as well as the simplest
way to bring a lay jury to the appreciation of the burden of proof resting on
the Crown in a criminal case.

[Page 678]

Here the learned trial judge directed himself to
the effect that proof of intent may be made by circumstantial evidence and
accordingly the principle in Hodge’s case must be applied. This is
contrary to the principle enunciated in Mitchell and Cooper, supra, and
must, with respect, be said to be an error in law. The error is, of course,
against the interest of the respondent and not the appellant and in the result
does not affect the disposition I propose to make of this appeal.

I therefore would dismiss these appeals:

[8] The judgments of Bélanger and Mayrand JJ.A. were delivered in
French and it should be noted that the English translation which appears in the
C.P.R. is unofficial and must be approached with caution. There are at least 2
blatant errors, one at p. 10 where the last sentence of Bélanger J.A.’s
opinion is translated as:

If the said conclusion is based upon
this error in law, which is the case in point, relative to the second count of
the indictment, but not with respect to the first count it does not have the
consequence that my colleague has mentioned.

when in the original French version
it reads:

[S]i ladite conclusion est basée sur
cette erreur de droit, ce qui est le cas dans l’espèce, relativement au second
chef d’accusation, non pas quant au premier chef sur lequel elle n’a pas de
portée tel que l’a mentionné mon collègue.

A better translation would be:

If the said conclusion is based upon
this error in law, which is the case here, it is relative to the second count
of the indictment but has no bearing on the first count, as my colleague has
mentioned.

The difference is crucial, as the
C.P.R. version indicates that Bélanger J.A. is dissenting on this point, when
he is actually supporting Mayrand J.A.

Another clear error can be found on
p. 17, where Mayrand J.A.’s statement that

Westcane Sugar Ltd. d’Oshawa en Ontario
… ne produisait pas encore en mai 1973

has been rendered

Westcane Sugar Ltd. of Oshawa,
Ontario … was no longer producing in May, 1973. (Emphasis added)

“No longer” should of course read
“not yet”.

The translation at 41 C.C.C. (2d) 209
appears to be identical to the C.P.R. version. [Editorial note—The original
French version is reported at C.A. [1978] 25.]

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Battery—Consent—Disclosure—Endarterectomy to reduce risk of
later stroke—Risk of stroke or death during or in aftermath of surgery—Stroke
suffered causing paralysis—No disclosure save for advice that possibility of
stroke greater without operation—Whether or not consent valid—Whether or not
battery.

Physicians and surgeons—Negligence—Duty of
care—Disclosure—Causation—Endarterectomy to reduce risk of stroke—Risk of
stroke or death during or in aftermath of surgery—Stroke suffered causing
paralysis—No disclosure save for advice that possibility of stroke greater
without operation—Respondent aware of appellant’s concern about the vesting of
his pension—Whether or not respondent negligent.

While or immediately after undergoing serious but competently
performed surgery, Reibl suffered a massive stroke causing paralysis on the
right side of the body and impotence. Stroke, paralysis, or even death, were
among the risks attending both this surgery or its aftermath and the patient’s
refusal to undergo the operation. In answering the patient’s query about the
possibility of stroke, the surgeon did not inform him of his chance of being
paralyzed during or shortly after the operation but stressed that the chances
of paralysis were greater if the patient did not undergo surgery. The patient
testified that he would have foregone this elective surgery until a lifetime
retirement pension had vested in a year and a half, and would have opted for a
shorter, normal life rather than a longer one as a cripple. The nature of the
information provided by the respondent surgeon and its adequacy in the
circumstances were central to the matters considered by the Court.

Reibl, at trial, recovered damages in both battery and negligence,
despite his formal consent to the surgery, on the ground that his was not an
“informed consent”; he had claimed that he had not been informed of stroke and
paralysis as a result of the operation. The Ontario Court

[Page 881]

of Appeal ordered a new trial on both liability and damages
but ruled out battery as a possible ground of liability. Only liability was
disputed before this Court. Defendant respondent sought both to hold the
judgment in appeal and to vary it by dismissal. The time elapsed since the
physical damage was suffered made a new trial undesirable.

Held: The appeal should be allowed.

In the absence of good reasons to order a new trial on
liability alone, the proper course was either to restore the judgment at trial
on either or both grounds upon which it proceeded or to relieve the defendant
respondent of his ability.

The popularization of the term “informed consent” for what
was, in essence, a duty of disclosure of certain risks or therapy influenced
the retention of battery as a ground of liability, even where there was express
consent which was not exceeded. The distinction between situations where a
failure of duty of disclosure would support an action of battery and where such
failure was indicative of negligence alone was, however, not only difficult to
apply but also incompatible with the elements of the cause of action in
battery. Such actions, in respect of surgical or other medical treatment,
should be confined to those cases where surgery or treatment had been performed
or given without any consent or, emergency situations aside, beyond the consent
given. This standard comprehended cases where there was misrepresentation of
the surgery or treatment for which consent was elicited and a different
surgical procedure or treatment was carried out. In situations where it was
alleged that attendant risks that should have been disclosed were not
communicated to the patient and yet the surgery or other medical treatment
carried out was that to which the plaintiff consented (assuming no basis of
liability on the ground of negligence), the consent was not vitiated by the
failure of disclosure so as to make the surgery or other treatment an
unprivileged, unconsented to and intentional invasion of the patient’s bodily
integrity. In spite of the temptation to say that the genuineness of consent to
medical treatment depended on proper disclosure of the risks which it entailed,
unless there had been misrepresentation or fraud to secure consent to the
treatment, a failure to disclose the attendant risks,

[Page 882]

however serious, should go to negligence rather than battery.

When dealing with the standard of disclosure of risks, it
would be going too far to say “the manner in which the nature and degree of
risk was explained to a particular patient was better left to the judgment of
the doctor in dealing with the man before him”. To allow expert medical
evidence to determine what risks were material and to be disclosed and what
risks were not material, would be to hand over to the medical profession the
entire question of the duty of disclosure, including whether there was a breach
of that duty. Expert medical evidence was, of course, relevant to findings as
to risks that resided in or were a result of recommended surgery or other
treatment. Testing the standard of disclosure of risks by expert medical
evidence was not determinative because the patient could have expressed
concerns to the doctor which the doctor would be obliged to meet in a
reasonable way. What the doctor knew or should have known that the particular
patient deemed relevant to a decision whether or not to undergo prescribed
treatment went equally to his duty of disclosure as did the material risks
recognized as a matter of required medical knowledge. The materiality of
non-disclosure of certain risks to an informed decision was a matter for the
trier of fact—a matter on which there would be probably medical evidence but
also other evidence from the patient or other member of his family.

On the issue of causation, the Court considered objectively
how far the balance in the risks of surgery or no surgery was in favour of
undergoing surgery. The failure of proper disclosure pro and con and any
special considerations affecting the particular patient became very material.
Merely because medical evidence established the reasonableness of a recommended
operation did not mean that a reasonable person in the patient’s position would
necessarily agree to it if proper disclosure had been made of the risks
attendant upon it, balanced by those against it. The patient’s particular
situation and the degree to which the risk of surgery or no surgery were
balanced would reduce the force, on objective appraisal, of the surgeon’s
recommendation. In deciding what decision a reasonable person in the patient’s
position would have made, the patient’s particular position should be
considered objectively and not subjectively.

Here, a reasonable person in the plaintiffs position would, on
the balance of probabilities, have opted

[Page 883]

against the surgery rather than undergoing it at the
particular time.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1],
ordering a new trial on both liability and damages. Appeal allowed.

D.W. Goudie, Q.C., for the plaintiff, appellant.

D.K. Laid law, Q.C., and C.L. Campbell, Q.C., for the
defendant, respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—The plaintiff appellant, then 44 years of age,
underwent serious surgery on March 18, 1970 for the removal of an occlusion in
the left internal carotid artery, which had prevented more than a fifteen per
cent flow of blood through the vessel. The operation was competently performed
by the defendant respondent, a qualified neurosurgeon. However, during or
immediately following the surgery the plaintiff suffered a massive stroke which
left him paralyzed on the right side of his body and also impotent. The
plaintiff had, of course, formally consented to the operation. Alleging,
however, that his was not an “informed consent”, he sued for damages and
recovered on this ground in both battery and negligence. The trial judge,
Haines J., awarded a global sum of $225,000.

A majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on
both liability and damages. Speaking through Brooke J.A. (Blair J.A.
concurring) the Court ruled out battery as a possible ground of liability on
the facts of the case. Jessup J.A., dissenting in part, would have ordered a
new trial on damages alone, accepting the judgment at trial on liability.

[Page 884]

On the hearing of the appeal by this Court, leave to come here
having been obtained by the plaintiff, counsel for the defendant respondent
agreed to accept the award of damages and limited his contestation to
liability, seeking not only to hold the judgment in appeal but a “variation”
thereof by way of dismissal of the action. Although, strictly speaking, the
claim for a variation should have been made the subject of a cross-appeal,
counsel for the appellant took no objection and I see no reason why I should
not regularize the claim for dismissal nunc pro tunc. Indeed, neither
counsel wished to have a new trial, an understandable position when the
physical damage suffered took place more than ten years ago. Unless, therefore,
there are good reasons to support the order for a new trial on liability alone,
the proper course is to determine whether to restore the judgment at trial on
either or both grounds upon which it proceeded or whether the defendant should
be relieved of liability.

It is now undoubted that the relationship between surgeon and
patient gives rise to a duty of the surgeon to make disclosure to the patient of
what I would call all material risks attending the surgery which is
recommended. The scope of the duty of disclosure was considered in Hopp v.
Lepp[2],
at p. 210, where it was generalized as follows:

In summary, the decided cases appear to indicate that, in
obtaining the consent of a patient for the performance upon him of a surgical
operation, a surgeon, generally, should answer any specific questions posed by
the patient as to the risks involved and should, without being questioned,
disclose to him the nature of the proposed operation, its gravity, any material
risks and any special or unusual risks attendant upon the performance of the
operation. However, having said that, it should be added that the scope of the
duty of disclosure and whether or not it has been breached are matters which
must be decided in relation to the circumstances of each particular case.

The Court in Hopp v. Lepp, supra, also pointed out
that even if a certain risk is a mere possibility which ordinarily need not be
disclosed, yet if its occurrence carries serious consequences, as for

[Page 885]

example, paralysis or even death, it should be regarded as a
material risk requiring disclosure.

In the present case, the risk attending the surgery or its
immediate aftermath was the risk of a stroke, of paralysis and, indeed, of
death. This was, without question, a material risk. At the same time, the
evidence made it clear that there was also a risk of a stroke and of resulting
death if surgery for the removal of the occlusion was refused by the patient.
The delicacy of the surgery is beyond question, and its execution is no longer
in any way faulted. (I would note here that in this Court no issue was raised
as to the adequacy of post-operative care.) How specific, therefore, must the
information to the patient be, in a case such as this, to enable him to make an
“informed” choice between surgery and no surgery? One of the considerations
weighing upon the plaintiff was the fact that he was about a year and a half
away from earning a lifetime retirement pension as a Ford Motor Company
employee. The trial judge noted (to use his words) that “due to this tragedy
befalling him at the time it did, he was not eligible for certain extended
disability benefits available under the collective agreement between the Ford
Motor Company of Canada, Limited and its hourly employees of ten years’
standing”. At the time of the operation, the plaintiff had 8.4 years’ service
with his employer. He stated in his evidence that if he had been properly
informed of the magnitude of the risk involved in the surgery he would have
elected to forego it, at least until his pension had vested and, further, he
would have opted for a shorter normal life than a longer one as a cripple
because of the surgery. Although elective surgery was indicated for the
condition from which the plaintiff suffered, there was (as the trial judge
found) no emergency in the sense that immediate surgical treatment was
imperative.

[Page 886]

This brings me back to the question of the nature of the information
provided by the respondent surgeon to the plaintiff and its adequacy in the
circumstances. I will deal, in turn, with (1) the findings and conclusion of
the trial judge on this issue; (2) whether, even on his findings, there was a
basis for imposing liability for battery; (3) the assessment made by the Court
of Appeal in ordering a new trial; (4) the evidence in the case, which
consisted, in support of the plaintiff’s case, mainly of the testimony of the
plaintiff and of two neurosurgeons, Dr. Irving Schacter and Dr. Robert Elgie,
and portions of the examination for discovery of the defendant and, in support
of the defendant’s case, the testimony of the defendant and of a neurosurgeon,
Dr. William Lougheed, who were the only two witnesses called for the defendant;
(5) the duty of disclosure and review of the findings below and (6) whether
causation was established.

1. The Findings of the trial judge

The trial judge approached the question of proper disclosure of
the attendant risks by first defining the scope of the duty of disclosure. He
said this:

In respect of a claim in negligence, the issue of informed
consent to treatment is a concomitant of the physician’s duty of care. A
surgeon’s duty to exercise due skill and care in giving his patient reasonable
information and advice with respect to the risks specifically attendant on a
proposed operative procedure arises out of the special relationship between
them. It is a particular case of the duty which is cast on professional persons
in a fiduciary position called upon specifically or by implication to give
information or advice to a client intending and entitled to rely on his
statements to determine his course: Nocton v. Lord Ashburton, [1914]
A.C. 932; Kenny v. Lockwood [1937] O.R. 142. That duty does not
require warning the patient of the dangers incident to or possible in any
surgical procedure, such as the dangers of anaesthesia or the risk of
infection, matters which men of ordinary knowledge are presumed to appreciate.
It relates to the specific risks within the surgeon’s knowledge peculiar to the
contemplated treatment. The scope of this professional duty of care is defined
by the evaluation of a variety of inter-related factors which bear uniquely on
each case, factors such as the presence of an emergency requiring immediate

[Page 887]

treatment; the patient’s emotional and intellectual make-up,
and his ability to appreciate and cope with the relevant facts; the gravity of
the known risks, both in terms of their likelihood and the severity of this
realization. The difficulty evident for the independent evaluation of these
factors by a lay tribunal has caused the law of this jurisdiction to leave the
definition of the scope of this duty in any particular case a matter
essentially of medical judgment, one to be determined by the court on the basis
of expert medical evidence.

The trial judge then proceeded to make his findings, as follows:

I find, on the basis of the expert evidence of Doctors
Schacter and Elgie, that in the circumstances of this case, the duty of the
surgeon as defined by accepted general practice in the neurosurgical community
was to explain to the patient the problem presented by stenosis [that is,
narrowing] in such an artery, and because of the serious possible complications
to the central nervous system, to do his best to explain to the patient the
specific risks inherent in arterial surgery of this kind, with sufficient
attention to anatomical and statistical detail to import to the patient an
understanding of the degree of risk which he faced of either dying as a result
of the operation or of suffering a stroke that might leave him disabled. It was
further the duty of the surgeon in these circumstances to explain to the
patient the risks of continuing without surgery. The choice whether to proceed
was then one which the patient would make for himself, armed, albeit, with what
both experts agreed would be the surgeon’s recommendation to proceed, but
aware, nevertheless, that for good reason there was an acceptable option to forego
the procedure.

The duty of which I speak is not one which in the
circumstances was difficult to execute. As I have indicated, the plaintiff is
an intelligent man and fully capable of following a simple but sufficient
explanation of the risk he was being asked to undertake. I am satisfied had Dr.
Hughes said to the plaintiff calling him in and a sketch if necessary to
clarify his meaning—”I propose to remove a partial plug in an artery a few
inches from your brain. There is a risk that as a result a fragment of tissue
may slip into your brain and if it does, you have a 4 per cent chance of dying
and a further 10 per cent chance of having a stroke”, there is no question the
plaintiff would flatly have refused. The plaintiff was entitled to know that
risk and the defendant owed a duty to disclose it to him. I am left with no
doubt, after evaluating the testimony of the plaintiff and

[Page 888]

his wife, and that of the defendant, as well as the relevant
portions of the transcript of the defendant’s examination for discovery that
the defendant fell short in his performance of this duty in two material
respects. First, I find that although the defendant did impart to the plaintiff
an understanding of the mechanics of the operation, to the extent that the
plaintiff was made aware that pluggage was to be surgically removed from an
artery leading to his brain, the defendant did not take sufficient care to
communicate to the plaintiff the purpose of the operation, I find that as a
result the plaintiff was probably left with the misunderstanding that the
operation was being undertaken to alleviate his headaches and hypertension and
to permit him to function effectively at his job. Further, and most
importantly, I find that the defendant did not take sufficient care to convey
to the plaintiff and assure that the plaintiff understood the gravity, nature
and extent of risks specifically attendant on the endarterectomy, in particular
the risk that as a result of the operation he could die or suffer a stroke of
varying degrees of severity. The defendant’s evidence on this issue suffers
from the understandable inconsistencies and vagueness that the passage of six
and one-half years of time will import. What on balance, I take from his
evidence however is that he informed the plaintiff that he would be better off
to have the operation than not. At best, the ambiguity of his language I find
was such that it would likely convey, even to a patient whose command of
English was more perfect than was the plaintiff’s, the understanding that the
single relevant area of concern was the relative likelihood of a healthy
existence in the coming years with, as opposed to without, the surgery. I find
that he did not address with the attention required of him the specific risks
of an adverse result of the operation itself. The plaintiff was left with the
impression that the operation carried no risks of consequence, other than those
incidental to any surgical procedure. I find further, that as a result of the
defendant’s breach of duty, the plaintiff gave his assent to the performance of
the operation, an assent which I am convinced from the evidence he would not
have given had the defendant’s aforesaid duty not been performed in the
negligent manner which I have described.

For the reasons above stated, I am also of the view that the
defendant is liable in battery.

2. Liability for Battery

In my opinion, these findings do not justify the imposition of
liability for battery. The popularization of the term “informed consent” for
what is, in

[Page 889]

essence, a duty of disclosure of certain risks of surgery or
therapy appears to have had some influence in the retention of battery as a
ground of liability, even in cases where there was express consent to such
treatment and the surgeon or therapist did not go beyond that to which consent
was given. It would be better to abandon the term when it tends to confuse
battery and negligence. Haines J., the trial judge, adopted the distinction
drawn by Morden J., as he then was, in Kelly v. Hazlett[3]
between situations where a failure in the duty of disclosure would support
an action of battery and where such a failure is indicative of negligence
alone. Morden J. said this at pp. 312-13:

It appears to me that it is reasonable to look at the matter
of informed consent, as far as an alleged battery is concerned, from the point
of view of what information was communicated. If the basic nature and character
of the operation performed is substantially that of which the plaintiff was
advised, and then agreed to, then there has not been an unconsented to invasion
of the person of the plaintiff, regardless of any failure to disclose any
collateral risks flowing from the operation. However, such failure, if it can
be shown to have resulted in damage to the patient, and was not justified by
reasonable medical considerations, may properly be subject-matter for a claim
based on negligence.

…

However, it has to be recognized that this test has both its
practical and, perhaps, its policy frailties. In some cases it may be difficult
to distinguish, and separate out, the matter of consequential or collateral
risks from the basic nature and character of the operation or the procedure to
be performed. This may possibly have been the case in Halushka v. University
of Saskatchewan [(1965), 53 D.L.R. (2d) 436]. The more probable the risk
the more it could be said to be an integral feature of the nature and character
of the operation. Further, even if a risk is truly collateral, but still
material, it could be said that its disclosure is so essential to an informed
decision to undergo the operation that lack of such disclosure should vitiate
the consent.

That judge said earlier in his reasons (at p. 310) that. “The
issue of ‘informed’ consent can arise in both battery and negligence cases: with
respect to

[Page 890]

the former a lack of proper information communicated by the
doctor to the patient can vitiate an apparent consent while, with respect to
the latter, failure to see to it that the patient is properly advised can
amount, in certain circumstances, to an act of negligence”.

I find the attempted distinction not only very difficult of
application but also as incompatible with the elements of the cause of action
in battery. The tort is an intentional one, consisting of an unprivileged and
unconsented to invasion of one’s bodily security. True enough, it has some
advantages for a plaintiff over an action of negligence since it does not
require proof of causation and it casts upon the defendant the burden of
proving consent to what was done. Again, it does not require the adducing of
medical evidence, although it seems to me that if battery is to be available
for certain kinds of failure to meet the duty of disclosure there would
necessarily have to be some such evidence brought before the Court as an
element in determining whether there has been such a failure.

The well-known statement of Cardozo J. in Schloendorff v.
Society of New York Hospital[4],
at pp. 129‑30 and at p. 93 respectively, that “Every human being of adult
years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own
body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient’s consent
commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages” cannot be taken beyond
the compass of its words to support an action of battery where there has been
consent to the very surgical procedure carried out upon a patient but there has
been a breach of the duty of disclosure of attendant risks. In my opinion,
actions of battery in respect of surgical or other medical treatment should be
confined to cases where surgery or treatment has been performed or given to
which there has been no consent at all or where, emergency situations aside,
surgery or treatment has been performed or given beyond

[Page 891]

that to which there was consent.

This standard would comprehend cases where there was
misrepresentation of the surgery or treatment for which consent was elicited
and a different surgical procedure or treatment was carried out. See, for
example, Marshall v. Curry[5]
(consent given to operation to cure hernia; doctor removes patient’s
testicle; action in battery); Murray v. McMurchy[6]
(consent given to a caesarian operation; doctor goes on and sterilizes the
patient; doctor liable for trespass to the person); Mulloy v. Hop
Sang[7]
(doctor told to repair hand and not to amputate; performs amputation; held
liable in trespass); Winn v. Alexander and the Soldiers’ Memorial
Hospital[8]
(consent given to caesarian; doctor goes further and sterilizes the
patient); Schweizer v. Central Hospital et al.[9]
(patient consented to operation on his toe; doctor operated on back instead
(spinal fusion); doctor liable for trespass to the person).

In situations where the allegation is that attendant risks which
should have been disclosed were not communicated to the patient and yet the
surgery or other medical treatment carried out was that to which the plaintiff
consented (there being no negligence basis of liability for the recommended
surgery or treatment to deal with the patient’s condition), I do not understand
how it can be said that the consent was vitiated by the failure of disclosure
so as to make the surgery or other treatment an unprivileged, unconsented to
and intentional invasion of the patient’s bodily integrity. I can appreciate
the temptation to say that the genuineness of consent to medical treatment
depends on proper disclosure of the risks which it entails, but in my view,
unless there has been misrepresentation or fraud to secure consent to the

[Page 892]

treatment, a failure to disclose the attendant risks, however
serious, should go to negligence rather than to battery. Although such a
failure relates to an informed choice of submitting to or refusing recommended
and appropriate treatment, it arises as the breach of an anterior duty of due care,
comparable in legal obligation to the duty of due care in carrying out the
particular treatment to which the patient has consented. It is not a test of
the validity of the consent.

3. The Assessment of the Court of Appeal

Brooke J.A., speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal,
noted, quite properly, that “The duty [of disclosure] to the patient is
determined by the court and the evidence of the expert witnesses, if accepted,
is relevant to determining whether or not the defendant has discharged that
duty. To be actionable [in negligence] the defendant’s failure in his duty of
care must cause the plaintiff loss and damage”. He went on to examine the
reasons of Haines J. and made the following observations upon that trial
judge’s determination:

In finding that the plaintiff was left with the impression
that the surgery carried no risk of consequence other than those in any
surgical procedure I think it must be assumed that the learned trial judge has
rejected the defendant’s explanation that the plaintiff was aware of the risk
of a stroke as a risk of the surgery. Of some importance, the learned trial
judge makes no specific finding of credibility and indeed does not disbelieve
the defendant’s evidence that he thought the plaintiff understood the risk.
However, the learned trial judge did not put his judgment simply on the failure
to warn, but also on the failure to take sufficient care to discuss the degree
of risk. He relied upon the evidence of doctors Elgie and Schacter and it is my
respectful view that, having regard for the emphasis which the learned trial
judge places upon the statistical details, he has misunderstood the real
significance of the evidence of these two doctors. Doctors Schacter and Elgie
appear to have taken a similar approach to the question of explaining the risks
of the surgery, but the emphasis is not on statistical detail. Dr. Elgie alone
made reference to statistics in discussing the manner in which he would advise
his patient when seeking a consent to perform this

[Page 893]

operation and in this respect his answer was different from
that of Dr. Schacter.

Brooke J.A. was highly critical of the use of unexplained
statistics which appeared to be directed to the degree of risk involved in the
particular surgery. This is what he said in that respect:

One need only look at the contrast in the evidence of the
statistics quoted by Dr. Hughes and Dr. Elgie to demonstrate the confusion that
could arise from their use. When asked in cross‑examination, Dr. Hughes’
figure as to the incidence of death because of surgery was 4%, which was equal
to Dr. Elgie’s highest figure where he put the range between 2 and 4% and with
respect to the incidence of stroke causing paralysis or transient weakness, Dr.
Hughes put the figure at 10% which was five times Dr. Elgie’s lowest figure and
almost two and one half times his highest figure. Taken cumulatively,
Dr. Hughes’ figure at 14% is more than three times Dr. Elgie’s lowest
estimate and almost twice his highest. They were really very different. The reason
for the difference went unexplained. No one asked the doctors. And yet the
trial judge referred principally in his reasons, and particularly in testing
the defendant’s conduct, to the statistics recounted by Dr. Hughes, which there
was no suggestion the doctor attempted to use. If the difference is based
solely or partly on the personal experience of the surgeons, and there is in
the evidence some reason suggested that this may be so, then perhaps the
explanation lies in the nature of the cases that each has dealt with and that
the chance of survivorship of those undertaken by one was less than the other.
If this is so, there may have been good reason not to mention statistics to the
patient, but rather to simply contrast his position if he undertakes the
surgery with that of not undertaking it and urge him to proceed because of his
youth and strength giving some assurance of survivorship. I do not think the
evidence justifies the statement made by the learned trial judge and I would
hesitate to lay down any such requirements, for in my view statistics can be
very misleading. The manner in which the nature and degree of risk is explained
to a particular patient is better left to the judgment of the doctor in dealing
with the man before him. Its adequacy can be simply tested.

[Page 894]

I think the Ontario Court of Appeal went too far, when dealing
with the standard of disclosure of risks, in saying, as it did in the passage
of its reasons just quoted, that “the manner in which the nature and degree of
risk is explained to a particular patient is better left to the judgment of the
doctor in dealing with the man before him”. Of course, it can be tested by
expert medical evidence but that too is not determinative. The patient may have
expressed certain concerns to the doctor and the latter is obliged to meet them
in a reasonable way. What the doctor knows or should know that the particular
patient deems relevant to a decision whether to undergo prescribed treatment
goes equally to his duty of disclosure as do the material risks recognized as a
matter of required medical knowledge.

It is important to examine this issue in greater detail. The
Ontario Court of Appeal appears to have adopted a professional medical
standard, not only for determining what are the material risks that should be
disclosed but also, and concurrently, for determining whether there has been a
breach of the duty of disclosure. This was also the approach of the trial
judge, notwithstanding that on the facts he found against the defendant. (Indeed,
the trial judge seems also to have overstated the duty of disclosure. The Court
of Appeal, in contrast, seems to have understated it. Generally, the failure to
mention statistics should not affect the duty to inform nor be a factor in
deciding whether the duty has been breached.) To allow expert medical evidence
to determine what risks are material and, hence, should be disclosed and,
correlatively, what risks are not material is to hand over to the medical
profession the entire question of the scope of the duty of disclosure,
including the question whether there has been a breach of that duty. Expert
medical evidence is, of course, relevant to findings as to the risks that
reside in or are a result of recommended surgery or other treatment. It will also
have a bearing on their materiality but this is not a question that is to be
concluded on the basis of the expert medical evidence alone. The issue under
consideration is a different issue from that involved where the question is
whether the doctor carried out his professional activities by

[Page 895]

applicable professional standards. What is under consideration
here is the patient’s right to know what risks are involved in undergoing or
foregoing certain surgery or other treatment.

The materiality of non-disclosure of certain risks to an informed
decision is a matter for the trier of fact, a matter on which there would, in
all likelihood, be medical evidence but also other evidence, including evidence
from the patient or from members of his family. It is, of course, possible that
a particular patient may waive aside any question of risks and be quite
prepared to submit to the surgery or treatment, whatever they be. Such a
situation presents no difficulty. Again, it may be the case that a particular
patient may, because of emotional factors, be unable to cope with facts
relevant to recommended surgery or treatment and the doctor may, in such a
case, be justified in withholding or generalizing information as to which he
would otherwise be required to be more specific.

A useful summary of issues on which medical evidence in
non-disclosure cases remains significant is found in a comment, “New Trends in
Informed Consent?” (1975), 54 Neb. L. Rev. 66, at pp. 90-91, where, after
noting that medical evidence should not control determination of the breach of
the standard of care, it continued, as follows (referring to Canterbury v.
Spence, infra):

Even Canterbury specifically notes that expert
testimony will still be required, in all but the clearest instances, to establish
(1) risks inherent in a given procedure or treatment, (2) the consequences of
leaving the ailment untreated, (3) alternative means of treatment and their
risks, and (4) the cause of the injury suffered by the plaintiff-patient.
Finally, if the defendant-physician claims a privilege, expert testimony is
needed to show the existence of (1) an emergency which would eliminate the need
for obtaining consent, and (2) the impact upon the patient of risk disclosure
where a full disclosure appears medically unwarranted.

[Page 896]

The learned Justice of Appeal also was of the view that the
reference to statistics, and the positing of a requirement that the defendant
should have put before the patient what he said in evidence as to the
percentage likelihood of a stroke or death, resulted in an improper finding on
causation. I quote a portion of his reasons in this connection, as follows:

The statistics would have to be explained to the patient and
then discussed in relation to his position if he did not have the surgery.
Would the view of the learned trial judge have been any different if resort had
been made to Dr. Elgie’s statistics or to the statistics quoted by both
doctors? Does this not simply reveal the confusion that probably would result
to a patient who is attempting to reconcile the doctor’s recommendation to
proceed with an unexplained gross figure of 14% risk?

I think the learned trial judge has failed to appreciate the
approach taken by both of Dr. Elgie and Dr. Schacter, which was to present
a comprehensive statement of the position to the patient.

Brooke J.A. referred to portions of the evidence given by Dr.
Elgie and by Dr. Schacter and summarized it in these given words:

As I understand the evidence of Dr. Elgie it is an
explanation to the patient that he runs a greater risk of death or a stroke in
the present year if he does not have the surgery than he would run if he were
to have it and that the risk would continue in that way. Dr. Schacter’s
evidence is to the same effect. It is my opinion the evidence did not justify
the use of the proposition by which the trial judge decided the plaintiffs case
and determined whether the defendant’s conduct was negligence, and if so, if
the negligence caused the plaintiffs loss and damage.

Judgment in this type of case is difficult because it is
really based on consideration of hindsight.

He proceeded then to consider a line of American cases on
causation, including the leading case of Canterbury v. Spence[10],
certiorari denied[11],
Cobbs v. Grant[12]
and Barnette v. Potenza[13]
and commented on them as follows:

[Page 897]

In actions for negligence our courts have adopted a
subjective test. Referring to the above cases I must not be taken as adopting
or suggesting the adoption of the doctrine of informed consent as it has
developed in some of the courts of the United States of America. The references
made at this point are for the value of the discussion on the question of
proof. The experience above reported should not be ignored as those courts were
driven to this conclusion because justice could not be done between the parties
other than by such an objective approach. It is never too late in the day to
change. I think a safe practice here is to test the plaintiff’s case
objectively before proceeding to consider it subjectively.

Was the defendant’s negligence the cause of the plaintiff’s
loss? If he is able to show that he has suffered loss as a result of the
recommended treatment and he (or at least a reasonable man in his position)
would not have consented if the required disclosure was made, damages may be
awarded. In my respectful view, the learned trial judge really did not deal
with this issue properly.

It was on this ground that he ordered a new trial.

If Canadian case law has so far proceeded on a subjective test of
causation, it is in courts other than this one that such an approach has been
taken: see Koehler et al. v. Cook[14],
at p. 767; Kelly v. Hazlett, supra, at p. 320. The matter is res
integra here. An alternative to the subjective test is an objective one,
that is, what would a reasonable person in the patient’s position have done if
there had been proper disclosure of attendant risks. The case for the objective
standard has been tersely put in the following passage from a comment in
(1973), 48 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 548, at p. 550, entitled “Informed Consent—A Proposed
Standard for Medical Disclosure”:

Since proximate causation exists only if disclosure would
have resulted in the patient’s foregoing the proposed treatment, a standard
must be developed to determine whether the patient would have decided against
the treatment had he been informed of its risks. Two possible standards exist:
whether, if informed, the particular patient would have foregone treatment
(subjec-

[Page 898]

tive view); or whether the average prudent person in
plaintiff’s position, informed of all material risks, would have foregone
treatment (objective view). The objective standard is preferable, since the
subjective standard has a gross defect: it depends on the plaintiff’s testimony
as to his state of mind, thereby exposing the physician to the patient’s
hindsight and bitterness.

However, a vexing problem raised by the objective standard is
whether causation could ever be established if the surgeon has recommended
surgery which is warranted by the patient’s condition. Can it be said that a
reasonable person in the patient’s position, to whom proper disclosure of
attendant risks has been made, would decide against the surgery, that is,
against the surgeon’s recommendation that it be undergone? The objective
standard of what a reasonable person in the patient’s position would do would
seem to put a premium on the surgeon’s assessment of the relative need for the
surgery and on supporting medical evidence of that need. Could it be reasonably
refused? Brook J.A. appeared to be sensitive to this problem by suggesting a
combined objective-subjective test.

I doubt that this will solve the problem. It could hardly be
expected that the patient who is suing would admit that he would have agreed to
have the surgery, even knowing all the accompanying risks. His suit would
indicate that, having suffered serious disablement because of the surgery, he
is convinced that he would not have permitted it if there had been proper
disclosure of the risks, balanced by the risks of refusing the surgery. Yet, to
apply a subjective test to causation would, correlatively, put a premium on
hindsight, even more of a premium than would be put on medical evidence in
assessing causation by an objective standard.

I think it is the safer course on the issue of causation to
consider objectively how far the balance in the risks of surgery or no surgery
is in favour of undergoing surgery. The failure of proper disclosure pro and
con becomes therefore very material. And so too are any special considerations
affecting the particular patient. For exam-

[Page 899]

ple, the patient may have asked specific questions which were
either brushed aside or were not fully answered or were answered wrongly. In
the present case, the anticipation of a full pension would be a special
consideration, and, while it would have to be viewed objectively, it emerges
from the patient’s particular circumstances. So too, other aspects of the
objective standard would have to be geared to what the average prudent person,
the reasonable person in the patient’s particular position, would agree to or
not agree to, if all material and special risks of going ahead with the surgery
or foregoing it were made known to him. Far from making the patient’s own
testimony irrelevant, it is essential to his case that he put his own position
forward.

The adoption of an objective standard does not mean that the
issue of causation is completely in the hands of the surgeon. Merely because
medical evidence establishes the reasonableness of a recommended operation does
not mean that a reasonable person in the patient’s position would necessarily
agree to it, if proper disclosure had been made of the risks attendant upon it,
balanced by those against it. The patient’s particular situation and the degree
to which the risks of surgery or no surgery are balanced would reduce the
force, on an objective appraisal, of the surgeon’s recommendation. Admittedly,
if the risk of foregoing the surgery would be considerably graver to a patient
than the risks attendant upon it, the objective standard would favour
exoneration of the surgeon who has not made the required disclosure. Since
liability rests only in negligence, in a failure to disclose material risks,
the issue of causation would be in the patient’s hands on a subjective test,
and would, if his evidence was accepted, result inevitably In liability unless,
of course, there was a finding that there was no breach of the duty of
disclosure. In my view, therefore, the objective standard is the preferable one
on the issue of causation.

In saying that the test is based on the decision that a
reasonable person in the patient’s position would have made, I should make it
clear that the

[Page 900]

patient’s particular concerns must also be reasonably based; otherwise,
there would be more subjectivity than would be warranted under an objective
test. Thus, for example, fears which are not related to the material risks
which should have been but were not disclosed would not be causative factors.
However, economic considerations could reasonably go to causation where, for
example, the loss of an eye as a result of non-disclosure of a material risk
brings about the loss of a job for which good eyesight is required. In short,
although account must be taken of a patient’s particular position, a position
which will vary with the patient, it must be objectively assessed in terms of
reasonableness.

4. The Evidence

I am driven to look at the evidence by reason of the different
views taken of it at trial and on appeal. Moreover, the view taken by the
majority of the Court of Appeal is indicative more of an exoneration of the
defendant than as supportive of the order made for a new trial. So far as the
duty of disclosure and its alleged breach are concerned, the crucial evidence
is not so much that of Dr. Elgie and Dr. Schacter or that of Dr. Lougheed but,
rather, the evidence of the plaintiff and that of the defendant as it relates
to what the defendant told the plaintiff and what concerns, if any, the
plaintiff communicated to the defendant before the surgery was performed.

The plaintiff began to have severe headaches in the spring of
1969. His wife’s doctor was Dr. Szabo who, like the plaintiff, was of
Hungarian extraction. The plaintiff went to see Dr. Szabo who examined him
and found he had high blood pressure and gave him certain pills to take. There
was no improvement and Dr. Szabo suggested that the plaintiff go into hospital
for a complete checkup. While there, it was discovered that he also had
diabetes. After a stay in hospital he went back to work. However, his headaches
persisted and on Dr. Szabo’s recommendation he went back into hospital in
February, 1970. The plaintiff came under the care not only of Dr. Szabo, but
also of a specialist, Dr. Orr, who had diagnosed the diabetes during the
plaintiff’s previous stay in hospital. He

[Page 901]

underwent more tests and was put on a strict diet and his
headaches abated. His continuing high blood pressure caused anxiety to the
doctors and Dr. Hughes, the defendant, was brought in by Dr. Orr with Dr.
Szabo’s concurrence.

The defendant first saw the plaintiff in hospital on March 6,
1970. The plaintiff’s headaches had come back and, on examining him, Dr. Hughes
said the indications were that there was a blockage in the left arteries at his
neck. On March 10, 1970, an arteriogram was taken and Dr. Hughes verified
that there was a narrowing of the left carotid artery to such an extent as to
permit only about fifteen per cent of the normal blood flow through the artery,
which leads to the brain. Dr. Hughes advised an operation and the plaintiff
signed a consent form a few days before the operation was performed. It had
been postponed for several days to meet the plaintiff’s convenience to enable
him to see his lawyer about his house mortgage.

I reproduce now the plaintiff’s evidence as to what information
Dr. Hughes gave him about the operation prior to its performance. The relevant
questions and answers on the examination in chief begin at p. 117 of volume 1
of the case on appeal:

Q. You told us Dr. Hughes told you he had to do an operation
to cut out the bad part?

A. Yes.

Q. What else at that time did Dr. Hughes say to you and what
did you say to him?

A. Well, the way he was telling me this is something in the
beginning and he also told me about this much he has to cut out of here
(indicating).

Q. You are indicating about three-quarters of an inch.

HIS LORDSHIP: About three-quarters of an inch?

A. I guess so.

Q. As a tool and die maker you would know?

A. This wasn’t a thing you put a measurement on. To give an
idea, I put it like this (indicating).

[Page 902]

MR. HOWIE: What else did Dr. Hughes say to you and what
did you say to him?

A. He said, “The artery is like a rubber hose. You have to
cut it out, pull it together and there is a little operation, and you are a
strong, young, healthy man, and in 10 days you are able to go back to work.”

Q. What did you say?

A. I was thinking, “Only it is about 10 days to go to Easter
and if it is like that I would be able to be with my family at Eastertime” and
I said, “Go ahead and do it”.

Q. Where was this?

A. In the room where I was in hospital.

Q. Dr. Hughes came to your room?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there anyone else in the room?

A. Probably a roommate because there was 2 beds in that
room.

Q. Is that the end of the conversation or was there anything
else?

A. Right there there wasn’t anything else.

Q. You wanted to talk to someone else about it?

A. It was like that. We were talking about it with my
roommate and at the same time his wife was there for a visit and she was asking
me what my problem was and I told her just a headache with bending down that it
starts and she says, “I have the same problem”. She said, “I have the same
problem more than 20 years with that kind of headache you have. They want to operate
on me and I was afraid to go through with it. I didn’t go for the operation.”
She also was telling me in that case there had to be replaced a plastic tube
for the artery. I was thinking about it and maybe I thought I would get in
touch with Dr. Hughes and ask him about it. I was asking for him through the
head nurse and somehow I was able to see Dr. Hughes again.

Q. Did you talk to Dr. Szabo about it at some time?

A. Dr. Szabo was every day there and I was asking him a
question about that and he said, “Look, I don’t know much about it. If I knew
that I would be a specialist myself. You are in good hands with Dr. Hughes and
do whatever he tells you.”

Q. Do you remember any other conversation at that time with
Dr. Szabo about the operation or what was involved or any risks of the
operation?

[Page 903]

A. There wasn’t anything mentioned about any kind of risk.

Q. You have told us you wanted to see Dr. Hughes again to
talk about it?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Dr. Hughes come back to your room?

A. Yes, he did once and he said, “That’s a different case,
because that lady is not a young person like you.” It was far away gone already
with her and mine was just in the beginning. He said, “You don’t have to worry
about that. There is no plastic tube which would have to be replaced in that
cut.”

Q. What discussions did you have about any risks of the
operation?

A. Honestly, I didn’t have any doubt about it. I didn’t even
think there was going to be any risk. Somehow I don’t have anything to do with
doctors and operations. I didn’t even think about it.

Q. Did he talk to you about what would happen if you didn’t
have the operation?

A. Yes, he said, “It is up to you if you want to have it or
not. You can live a few years. You can live about 7 or 10 years or longer. One
of these days once you are going to fall on your nose, and that’s it. If you
are going to do it now in the beginning you are not going to have any problem
later.”

Q. Did Dr. Hughes say anything else about any risks of the
operation?

A. He didn’t mention anything.

At pp. 121 and 124 there are the following questions and answers:

Q. If you had known and if you had been told that there was
risk of having a stroke as a result of this operation, what would your decision
have been about having the operation?

A. May I say something? For one thing I didn’t even know
what a stroke is. Secondly, if I have to choose for a short life and live like
a normal person or life [sic] the rest of it like a cripple I
would have chosen to live a short life and be a normal person. I wouldn’t drag
myself around the way I am doing now.

[Page 904]

Q. Was there any other conversation with Dr. Hughes before
the operation took place on the Wednesday?

A. Honestly I can’t recall anything.

Following the operation, which resulted in the paralysis suffered
by the plaintiff, he saw Dr. Hughes on two occasions, as the following
excerpts from his evidence in chief show:

Q. You say you saw Dr. Hughes after the operation, a week or
so after the operation?

A. First I was asking for him and I was trying to tell my
wife that I wanted to see the doctor who operated on me and she understood and
we were both asking for him. The head nurse came in and said, “He isn’t back
from his holiday and as soon as he is back, we will get in contact with him.”

Q. Did Dr. Hughes eventually come in to see you?

A. Yes, I was in the wheelchair out of the room and I saw
him passing by and I called him and he came there and I said, “Look at me, how
I am,” and he said, “Nothing to worry about. It is all going to come back.” He
looked at my hand and tried to open my fingers. He said, “Try to move it,” and
there was no movement. He said, “Don’t worry, it will all come back.” He was
probably trying to cheer me up.

Q. Did you see Dr. Hughes again?

A. I saw him once much later after they transferred me to
the Shedoke Rehabilitation Centre. This was the first week and after that they
let me home. Someone picked me up and delivered me home. This was a Saturday or
Sunday. I don’t know exactly the date. Sunday night I have to be back at
Shedoke again. I was so desperate I wanted to see Dr. Hughes very much and I
said to my wife, “Take me to his office and I want to speak to him about it.
What is going to happen with me.” I didn’t get back to the hospital. I went to
his office, and without any appointment, and I said, “I have to speak with
him,” [sic] Then I saw him and I asked him how and what and how
come I am lined up like a cripple.

Q. What did Dr. Hughes say?

A. Dr. Hughes said, “This just didn’t work out.” He said,
“I’m sorry,”. [sic] He also put the stethescope [sic] on
and saying there is still not everything all right. He still heard a movement.
He said, “I’m sorry, this didn’t work out,” and I said, “How come it didn’t
work out?” and he said,

[Page 905]

“Look, you’ve been working at Ford Motor Company and many
times you try to do a job and for some reason it just doesn’t work out. A screw
goes the other way in and they have to replace it or do something about it.” I
said, “That’s fine. Let’s do it with me, too. Go all over again and put me on
the table and make an operation and get it done, whatever you missed, whatever
went wrong with your work.” He said, “No, I’m not going to do that. If I am
doing it, you may end up dead. I’m not going to touch you any more.” That’s
what he said.

Q. Did you discuss with him anything about telling you that
this might occur?

A. I said, “You put it to me so simply like there is nothing
to it,” and he said, “Yes, that is what I thought first. There was another
blockage, not just there on your neck, but a small blockage up in your brain
and I couldn’t get to it and that caused the problem,” he said. He said, “I
wouldn’t touch this. I am not able to get to that.” I said, “Why didn’t you
tell me the first time there isn’t this one blockage but another one that you couldn’t
touch?” I really didn’t get an answer for that. My wife was telling him and
asking him questions, too, and her question was, “Why didn’t you tell him about
the risk he would be taking on the operation?” He answered my wife, “I wouldn’t
tell none of my patients the risk because this would scare him, or something
like that.”

I come now to the cross-examination of the plaintiff on the
matter of the information or disclosure given or made to him by Dr. Hughes. The
transcript of evidence, volume 1, beginning at p. 156 is as follows, starting
with a reference to the arteriogram:

Q. He told you that he was going to perform a test that
involved putting some dye into your veins?

A. Yes.

Q. He explained what he was going to do?

A. Yes.

Q. You were content because you felt Dr. Hughes knew what he
was doing to let him go ahead with it?

A. I trust him all the way through.

[Page 906]

Q. A day or so after that time you had the test?

A. Yes.

Q. You had another discussion with Dr. Hughes?

A. Yes.

Q. At that time Dr. Hughes told you that you had a narrowing
in the artery on the left side of your neck?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you understand what that was?

A. In a way I wasn’t too sure about it because this was
something new for me. I was thinking about it and asking him, and also the
patient who was in, something about it. After the doctor goes everyone is
interested in what is going on and what happens. We were talking about it.

Q. When Dr. Hughes told you you had a narrowing in the
artery in your neck, did you understand what he was saying?

A. I understand the artery. I don’t know how this comes in
and what is the cause. I didn’t have the slightest idea, what it is, because
this was something new what I heard from him.

Q. Did he use any medical term or just tell you you had a narrowing?

A. I think he tried to tell me and this is too much for me
to understand.

Q. He tried to and because of the English problem you were
not able to understand?

A. I couldn’t understand.

Q. I take it you were content to take his advice?

A. Certainly.

Q. Did he tell you that the amount of blood that was going
through your artery had diminished or had fallen away and there wasn’t as much
blood going through as should be going through?

A. Yes, and he said on the left side in my brain I have a
plug and that caused all my problems. That is what he told me.

Q. High blood pressure. You didn’t understand, I take it,
exactly what he was getting at?

A. Honestly, I thought only that the blood I am getting in
my brain caused my headache and the dizziness, and everything else.

Q. That is what you thought?

A. Yes.

Q. I take it you didn’t clearly understand?

[Page 907]

A. No, I wasn’t sure about it.

Q. You also had some discussions with Dr. Hughes as to what
he would do to help the blood flow in your neck?

A. That is correct.

Q. I take it from what you told us yesterday that he
suggested there was an operation that he could perform?

A. Yes.

Q. He also suggested to you that your problem might become
worse or more difficult if you waited rather than having the operation done
now?

A. That is right.

Q. Was that all said at the one time after the tests? Did he
go through all of that?

A. This was when he saw all the results of the tests and he
was telling me all that.

Q. I take is that, as you have described, after that time, after
the discussion with Dr. Hughes, you got talking with other patients in the
room?

A. Yes.

Q. You talked to Dr. Hughes again?

A. I asked him to talk it over.

Q. When you talked to him again you had some concern as to
what was involved in the surgery? 

A. Yes.

Q. What did you ask Dr. Hughes.

A. Honestly, the tube for that woman was mentioned to him.

Q. He said he didn’t need to use that?

A. Because it was just in the beginning.

Q. Did he mention another patient across the hall that he
had operated on?

A. A similar older person and he had to do something like
that on him and I don’t know where he had to do it. I don’t think it was the
same case as mine. He has not any doubt about it, mine will go honestly. He
said, “You are young and strong and it is just in the beginning”.

Q. What Dr. Hughes told you was that your problems would be
less if you had the surgery done?

A. Right away.

Q. Than if you waited and he told you what might happen if
you waited?

[Page 908]

A. If I would wait a couple of years more I may be in the
shoes as the other person he was worried about.

Q. What had happened to that other person?

A. Honestly, I never saw him or was talking with that
person. I saw him from a far distance. I never spoke to him about it.

Q. It went further than that, didn’t it. Dr. Hughes told you
you might fall down, that you might pass out, or have a headache?

HIS LORDSHIP: Ask those singly.

MR. CAMPBELL: You told us yesterday that Dr. Hughes had
told you something about what might happen if you waited and you said you might
fall on your nose?

A. Yes, if I let it go on for years, then one of these days
it is going to be so bad that I just going to pass out, fall down, and I would
lay there and I would be dead after that. It is not something tomorrow or next
day or in a month if I let it go on.

Q. At some point in time that is what was going to happen?

A. Yes.

Q. He explained the risk?

A. It is a risk to wait a few more years, for 5 or 7 years.
We were talking about it.

Q. Did you ask him anything else about the operation, as to
how he was going to do it or what was going to be done?

A. Honestly, I didn’t ask him. He was pointing it out where
he had the operation. He was pointing it out with his finger, right there, he
said (indicating).

Q. Did he tell you what he was going to do?

A. He said this is the artery and this is the pluggage and
he has to remove the bad part of the artery. The only thing what I don’t like,
he didn’t tell me a second pluggage was in my brain somewhere. He just talked
about only this one on which he would operate. I said, “Dr. Hughes, why didn’t
you tell me about the other one, too” because he said, “That is something I
couldn’t touch,” and that has caused the problem.

Q. You understood that you had that at the time?

A. I didn’t know before the operation. He was telling me
this only after I was paralyzed.

[Page 909]

Q. He hadn’t told you before the operation that you had
anything in your brain?

A. He didn’t tell me anything about that.

Q. Are you saying you had it there at that time?

A. He told me so. When he was certain after the tests, he
said the pluggage was here and he saw already the other one too, but he didn’t
tell me about it.

Q. How do you know that he saw that at that time?

A. He said it himself in his office after I saw him.

Q. Did he saw [sic] it was there from the
beginning?

A. Yes, it was already there. He saw it on the test when he
called [sic] my brain.

…

Q. When Dr. Hughes was telling you about what he was going
to do in the operation and why he thought you should have an operation, did you
understand everything that he was saying to you?

A. I understand the reason why he wants to do it and I agree
also if he do it in time there may not be any problems later on. I was willing
to go through with it.

Q. Did you have any discussions with Dr. Hughes about the
possibility of being paralyzed?

A. No. That word paralyzed or stroke was never in my mind
and I didn’t know anything about it before I was already done and saw people
with that problem.

Q. Did you know what the word meant?

A. This time I didn’t know.

Q. You don’t know whether it was used by Dr. Hughes or not?

A. I didn’t hear from anybody. Not from Dr. Hughes or Dr.
Szabo, paralyzing and stroke never occurred. No one mentioned it to me.

Q. You didn’t understand what they meant?

A. Even so, I didn’t understand because I don’t have
anything to do with it.

Q. Whatever they said along those lines you would not have
understood?

A. They personally did not mention it to me, even the words
they didn’t mention. They didn’t use words like paralyzing or stroke to me. The
only concern was to get my blood pressure down to normal and

[Page 910]

that is why they got pills and if the pills didn’t help they
would have to find out another way.

…

Q. Did you have any discussions with him about the operation?

A. Not with Dr. Orr.

Q. What about Dr. Szabo?

A. He was the one. I asked him in bold language in mine and
in English and with Dr. Szabo I understand enough English. I said, “If you
don’t know how to pronounce it in Hungarian try to explain it to me in English”.
His answer was, “You are in good hands and if I would know the answer for it I
would be a specialist myself.”

Q. I take it you can’t recall anything else that Dr. Szabo
said?

A. Nothing else.

There is one piece of evidence from the patient’s wife, when
examined in chief, which supports what he himself said in reference to a visit
made to the defendant’s office after the operation. The transcript, volume 2 of
the case, at pp. 314-15 shows the following:

Q. You say you spoke to Dr. Hughes about 2 months after the
operation?

A. Yes.

Q. Whereabouts was that conversation?

A. In his office.

Q. Who was present?

A. Only my husband and me and him. I took my husband.

Q. The three of you?

A. Yes.

Q. Tell me about that conversation?

A. Well, it was a long one. It was mostly like we wanted to
find out what was going on, what is this thing we are into because we had no
idea what we were into. He said that the operation didn’t work out, that he
promised him that he will have everything back in his arm and right side, even
though he won’t be painting or drawing like he used to, and that is very
painful for him. My husband wanted him to do another operation on him to fix
him up and he said he can’t do it because there is another blockage in the back
of the head. He showed it. There is a tiny blockage. I asked him, “Why didn’t
you warn my husband because he

[Page 911]

would rather have died than take the operation which
cripples him” and he said, “Mrs. Reibl, I never tell these things to my
patients.”

Q. Did he say why not?

A. No, he didn’t. Maybe; I don’t know. It was a nightmare.

Q. Do you remember anything else with respect to the
conversation which you had with Dr. Hughes?

A. He said something about my husband’s work; “When you work
you do some mistakes, too, don’t you, which can’t be corrected?” My husband
said, “If I have a screw in wrong I take it out and put it right. You do the
same,” and he said he can’t.

There was no cross-examination on this evidence.

Counsel for the plaintiff completed his case, having called Dr.
Schacter and Dr. Elgie and other witnesses, by reading into the record portions
of the examination for discovery of the defendant. I refer to the transcript of
evidence, volume 2, at pp. 325 et seq.:

…

“Q. All right. Now this lesion you discovered through the
arteriogram would you describe it as asymptomatic?

A. Yes, I would.

Q. What do you mean by asymptomatic?

A. Well, not causing any detectable neurological disfunction
or abnormality.”

…

“Q. And how many have you carried out or performed before
you performed this one on the plaintiff, John Reibl?

A. That is, up to 1970?

Q. Yes.

A. Somewhere around 60 or 70.

Q. And how many of those have been asymptomatic patients?

A. Oh, 4 or 5, I think.

Q. Now of those 60 or 70 that you carried out, what
incidents of stroke have there been?

A. At the time of or during surgery or post-operatively?

Q. During surgery?

[Page 912]

A. Well, it’s hard to tell really whether anything happens
at the time of the actual surgery or whether it’s some phase in the next hour
or two during a recovery period, they’re still under the anaesthetic, and so
on, but I think it would be somewhere 10 to 15 per cent. Of course, this takes
in a long period of time and we were operating originally on patients who had
massive strokes that we learned later not to be operating on, so statistics
generally improve as the years go on.”

…

“Q. The 4 or 5 asymptomatic patients, had any of them
suffered a stroke?

A. Yes.

Q. What number?

A. Just the one, just one.

Q. You’re not including Mr. Reibl in that?

A. No, one before that.

Q. And of the 60 or 70 that you performed how many died from
the surgery?

A. Well, again a lot of these were early. I would say
probably it would be 8 to 9, 8 to 10, I’ll say.

Q. All right. And then was there any medical data or writings
available to you as of March, 1970, to indicate what incidents of risk there
was generally in carrying out this type of surgical procedure?

A. At that time the mortality rate was getting pretty low.
It was less than 4 per cent. The morbidity rate was still around 10 per cent.

Q. By morbidity you mean those in which a stroke occurred?

A. Some complication of operation or immediate problem.”

…

“Q. Well, then, at that time what was your opinion as to the
risk involved in this form of surgery?

A. I felt at that time the, perhaps I can put it this way,
that the risk of a patient becoming paralyzed was greater without the surgery
than it was with surgery and this is actually the way it was presented to the
patient.

Q. Well, leaving out the risk to himself if he did not have
the surgery, what risk did you see was attendant on the surgery itself?

A. Well, the possibility of a stroke.

[Page 913]

Q. And what did you think in terms of percentage that risk
was?

A. In my own mind, and I don’t believe I gave him any specific
figure other than the fact that he was better one way than the other, around
the 10 to 15 per cent.”

Going now, My Lord, to page 28, questions 249 to 252:

“Q. Doctor, we cannot ask you that at the moment. You
finished the operation. When did you next see the patient?

A. It was within about an hour in the intensive care unit.
Again, I keep these people in the intensive care unit for the first night and I
was making some rounds after we finished the operation and then it would be
about 4:30 I think. When I went back to the intensive care unit and he was
starting to come around at that time.

Q. Was there any symptoms then of——

A. Yes, the girls had just finished checking him as a matter
of fact when I went into the intensive care unit and they felt that his grip,
the hand grip on the right side was somewhat weak.

Q. Yes, and what did you do?

A. So I examined him again at that time and his right arm
was weak and I felt that his right leg was showing some minimal weakness at
that time.

Q. He is still unconscious at this point?

A. He was starting to rouse. I wouldn’t say he was actually
conscious, perhaps, but he was certainly starting to make sounds and talk sort
of thing.”

…

“Q. It was apparent then that he suffered a stroke?

A. It appeared that he was actually having one.

Q. When you saw him?

A. He was into a stroke evolution, yes.”

…

“Q. So then, in effect, he had paralysis of the right side?

A. That’s correct.

Q. What’s the medical term for that?

[Page 914]

A. Hemiplegia.”

…

“Q. Did you ever have any further conversation with the
plaintiff Mr. Reibl after your last examination of him while he was in the
hospital in 1970?

A. Yes, he came into my office on May 4th, 1970…

Q. Can you tell me what was said as best as you can recall?

A. Well, he was concerned really at that time that he didn’t
feel that we had told him that this possibility of weakness might happen after
the operation. It seemed to be almost fixed with him.”

…

“Q. Did you make any notes of the conversation this time?

A. I have some notes here. I don’t think there is anything
specifically about what he said but I have some notes about what he did, tool
and die maker. He couldn’t work in Canada as a tool and die maker because of
the language problem and again the other thing that was really quite upsetting
to him was that he had been working at Ford for 8½ years and it required
something like 10 years before he could get on a pension program and this, of
course, bothered him quite a bit. He had been unhappy with the rehabilitation.
He mentioned this. He didn’t think they were doing enough for him at Shedoke
Centre [a rehabilitation centre] and I have a note that he was not encouraged,
meaning more or less depressed. He says he will probably never get back to
Ford.”

…

“Q. Dr. Hughes, the surgery that you performed, did you
consider it in any way an emergency form of surgery; that is, to meet a
condition of emergency that then existed?

A. No.”

The defendant, Dr. Hughes, examined in chief, spoke of the
detection of a bruit, that is, a sound of noise, in the plaintiff’s left
carotid artery as a result of an initial examination. Then followed a reference
to the arteriogram which disclosed a narrowing of the artery, with a consequent
substantial decrease of the flow of blood. His evidence in chief then continued
as follows, beginning at p. 334 of volume 2 of the case on appeal:

[Page 915]

Q. Having visualized that through the process of the
arteriogram, did you have an opinion as to what was the appropriate action to
take?

A. Yes, I felt that even though this narrowing of the artery
was not causing any obvious neurological deficit, or any neurological problems
at that particular time, that he probably should have this removed to prevent a
stroke some time in the future.

Q. In your opinion, and let’s talk about it in terms of
1970, what did the future hold for him if the surgery was not undertaken as
opposed to the risk if it was?

A. I think I can say that at that time we had some definite
evidence that leaving an artery in this condition alone would definitely have
an increased risk of a stroke in the next several years.

Q. What were you able to determine about his vascular system
and his condition in that respect?

A. There was a small plaque higher up in the artery on the
same side. There was another very small one on the right side just at the level
of the division of the main artery.

Q. Did he show any neurological deficits at all?

A. No, he didn’t. I believe there was a brain wave test
taken at the time he was in hospital previously which was within normal limits.

Q. Did you discuss with the plaintiff having the operation?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. The operation being the one which was ultimately
undertaken?

A. That is correct.

Q. An endarterectomy?

A. Yes.

Q. When did you discuss his undergoing the operation and what
did you say to him?

A. I think it was the next day after the arteriogram. At
that time we were doing the angiograms quite often in the early afternoon so
they were still fairly drowsy the rest of the afternoon and you didn’t have a
chance to talk to them about it. So it is the next day you talk to the patient.

Q. This is 6 years ago and you don’t have a note of it?

A. No.

Q. What did you say?

[Page 916]

A. I talked to him about the fact that there was a narrowing
in the artery, that only 10 or 15 per cent of the blood was getting through,
and I felt the chances of preventing a stroke were better by having the
operation than if we left him alone, in which case he might have a stroke
within a few years.

Q. Did you use any statistics at all?

A. I didn’t use any actual figures. I used my knowledge that
there was a trend in these directions.

Q. In that first conversation did he have any questions or
queries at all?

A. No, he didn’t.

Q. Did he give you an answer at that time?

A. I believe he said he wanted to have something done. I
think he was very concerned about his headaches at that time and I feel that he
wanted something done to try to improve everything, not just this narrowing or
stroke problem. He said, “Go ahead and make the arrangements”.

Q. Did you indicate that his headaches were causally
connected at all to the bruit?

A. I indicated to him, and he had asked me about this, and
I’m not sure whether it was that talk or subsequently again, but I did tell him
I didn’t feel the headaches would necessarily be improved. I told him I didn’t
think they would be improved from the operation, as a matter of fact.

Q. Did you have more than one conversation with him on this
subject of what the future held for him and explaining the operation to him?

A. Yes.

Q. How many times did you speak to him?

A. Two or three times after that first talk. Probably two
more times after the first time I talked to him about the operation.

Q. Over what period of time?

A. Over another 4 or 5 days.

Q. If you can sort out the different conversations and when
you said what day or when looking back over this span of time, I ask you
generally what were the contents of all the discussions taken together?

A. At one stage I know Dr. Szabo was with me and we talked
to the patient about this and Dr. Szabo explained to him, as best he could in
Hungarian, which I don’t understand; at any rate, he went

[Page 917]

over the explanation of the operation with the patient and I
think tried to relate my feeling that---

MR. HOWIE: We are in a difficult area and I appreciate
what the doctor is trying to do. If he didn’t understand what Dr. Szabo said I
would prefer to have Dr. Szabo say it:

HIS LORDSHIP: Are you going to call him?

MR. LAIDLAW: I expect we will.

HIS LORDSHIP: Under those circumstances...

MR. LAIDLAW: Let’s stick to what I can do with this
doctor.

HIS LORDSHIP: He is listening to someone speaking in
Hungarian?

A. Yes.

MR. LAIDLAW: First of all, were the mechanics of the
operation ever explained to the plaintiff? Did you ever explain the mechanics?

A. The incision-type of thing?

Q. Even in general terms?

A. It was to remove this plug or blockage of the artery.

Q. And Dr. Szabo was present on one occasion, had you had a
discussion with Dr. Szabo in his presence as to what was going to go on?

A. I talked to Dr. Szabo previously and I don’t know whether
it was coincidence or not, but we happened to see the patient at the same time.

HIS LORDSHIP: Did you explain to the patient in Dr. Szabo’s
presence and Dr. Szabo act as interpreter?

A. That is correct.

MR. LAIDLAW: What did you say to the plaintiff at the
time Szabo was purporting to translate?

A. That we felt in the best interests of the patient the
artery should be opened up, the blood supply restored, and then again the
question came up of, “What are the chances of something happening to me,
paralysis?” I am sure he used that word. I said I just felt the chances of
having a stroke by not operating were better than if we did operate on him.

Q. Did he ask whether he might suffer one, in any event, as
a result of the operation?

A. Yes, that is what he was asking.

Q. What did you tell him?

MR. HOWIE: That is a leading and important question.

[Page 918]

MR. LAIDLAW: What did you tell him?

HIS LORDSHIP: Don’t lead Mr. Laidlaw, please.

MR. LAIDLAW: What did you tell him?

A. I told him again that the chances were still better of
not having a stroke with the operation than they were leaving it alone.

Q. Did he have any other questions or queries at all prior
to the operation concerning it?

A. I don’t remember anything. He seemed to want to really
get on and get this operated on and get straightened around.

The defendant went to see the plaintiff in the recovery room
after the operation and noticed some weakness in the right arm. The patient was
transferred to intensive care and his condition changed for the worse. Dr.
Hughes was called back to see him. The doctor’s evidence was the following:

Q. Was there a difference between his condition that you had
seen in the recovery room?

A. Yes.

Q. The time span was about what?

A. Perhaps another half hour after he was transferred from
recovery room to the intensive care unit, half an hour to three-quarters of an
hour.

Q. What opinion did you hold when you saw him in the
intensive care unit?

A. I felt that he was either having a stroke, and I
couldn’t be sure whether he had flipped off a piece of blood clot, embolism, or
was starting to occlude his carotid artery. The fact that he had weakness of
the right arm suggested to me that it was a small piece of clot that had flipped
up from the suture line area of the operation. Because of that I felt that
there was a fairly good chance we could leave well enough alone and not do
anything at that particular time. When he changed for the worse, in some of the
other vital signs—he was getting a brain swelling at this time—I felt at that
stage we should not re-operate on him because of the very high chance of having
mortality.

Q. From what cause?

A. Just from bleeding in the brain due to the fact that any
area of infarction, whether from an embolus or occlusion of the artery of the
neck, vascular insufficiency, does cause softening of the brain which causes
weakening; the blood vessels are

[Page 919]

weaker, and if the blood flow is restored the extra pressure
will often cause a cerebral haemorrhage.

Dr Hughes said also that within a short time, about fifteen
minutes or so, and on his own observation, the plaintiff changed from being in
a hemiparetic condition to a hemiplegic condition. It would be dangerous he
said to re-operate on such a patient, the mortality rate being from twenty to
sixty per cent. Further evidence in chief touched upon post-operative care
which, as I noted early in these reasons, was not an issue in this Court.

Finally, there is the cross-examination of the defendant, which I
wish to reproduce in its portions relevant to the disclosure of the risks of
having or not having the recommended operation. The matter is considered in
volume 2 of the case on appeal, beginning at p. 361:

Q. I want to go to the issue of risk. First of all, would
you agree with me that in 1970 you were aware of the fact that there were
specific risks attendant upon the surgery that you were recommending to
Mr. Reibl?

A. Yes, there were some risks. They were really quite
minimal actually.

Q. On your examination for discovery that I read in
yesterday, you indicated that it was something less than 4 per cent chance of
mortality and something in the order of 10 per cent with respect to morbidity?

A. Yes, I think it probably was even lower than that.

Q. In 1973 you felt it was what I said; is that correct?

A. On the discovery?

Q. Yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you agree with me that everyone of your patients, and
I do not care the operative procedure you might recommend, is entitled to give
an informed consent; is that fair?

A. Yes.

Q. When we speak of “informed” we mean that the patient
should be sufficiently aware of the risks and of the nature of the surgery in
order to be able to decide to have it or not have it?

A. That is correct.

[Page 920]

Q. Would you agree with me that that is the standard that
every good neurosurgeon should operate under in terms of obtaining or not
obtaining the patient’s consent?

A. Yes.

Q. I want to try and make sure we understand each other.
There are risks to any surgery?

A. That is correct.

Q. When we speak of the ordinary risks of surgery we refer
to things like the surgeon’s knife slipping and causing injury, an anaesthetic
that does not work properly, a failure on the part of the anaesthetist, Any one
of the dozen things that are ordinarily attendant upon surgery?

A. That is correct.

Q. When you get down to specific procedures then apart from,
in effect, letting the patient know that all surgery has some risk, which most
people should understand in any event, when you come down to specific
procedures would you agree with me that you are under an obligation to tell
your patient about specific risks?

A. Yes, it might vary a bit with the patient but generally,
yes.

Q. Why do you say it would vary a bit with the patient?

A. Some patients are certainly very nervous, anxious.

Q. Frightened?

A. Frightened, yes. Others you start to explain the
situation to them and they say, “I don’t want to know anything about it. Let’s
get on and get the job done.”

Q. You have had the experience very often where you have
explained the specific risks attendant upon a particular procedure that you
feel should be done for the patient’s benefit and the patient has refused the
surgery?

A. Yes.

Q. Too nervous or too scared, or whatever it is?

A. Yes.

Q. Even in situations where they have heard people have had
it and are paralyzed back in Italy, out east, or somewhere else?

A. Yes.

Q. In this case it was your desire on behalf of your patient
to help him?

[Page 921]

A. Yes.

Q. Therefore, you were anxious that he should have the
surgery in this case?

A. I felt that he would definitely benefit from it, yes.

Q. I am going to suggest to you that in this case you never
did specifically tell your patient of the specific risks of this surgery?

A. I didn’t even have to because the patient asked me this
himself.

Q. In other words what he said to you was, and correct me if
I am wrong, “Is there any chance of my being paralyzed?” or words to that
effect?

A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. In other words, he raised the issue with you?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you then tell him what his chances were of being
paralyzed immediately or within a day or two as a result of this surgery?

A. No, I did not tell him any specific time after surgery. I
told him that the chances of being paralyzed if he did not have the operation
were greater—the chances of him being paralyzed if he did not have the
operation were greater than if he did have the operation.

Q. You attempted to compare risks of being paralyzed by
having the surgery or not having the surgery?

A. That is correct.

Q. Am I not correct that you told him, going on to deal with
what would happen if he did not have the surgery, you went on to say to him
that he might very well some day, within a few years, have a stroke, or words
to that effect, and fall on his nose?

A. I don’t know I said, “on his nose”, but at least he could
fall down.

Q. Within a few years he could have a stroke if he did not
have this operation and there was a pretty good chance of that occurring?

A. Yes, right.

Q. I suggest to you, however, that what you did not do was
specifically tell your patient that he ran a specific risk of having a stroke
and, in effect, being paralyzed if he had this operation. Do you understand the
distinction?

[Page 922]

A. Yes. I felt that he realized he could have had a stroke
because he asked the question.

Q. Do you think he actually understood what a stroke was?

A. He said, if not “paralyzed”, “weakness”.

Q. Let me take you back to your examination for discovery,
page 14, question 139. If my friend objects to me saying this, perhaps he will
let me know. Earlier on on that page you told the court how you described to
him what the procedure was that you were going to do, the description
physically of what you were going to do:

“Q. Right. Then did he appear to understand what was
involved?

A. Yes, he did and as a matter of fact he brought up the
question of possible complications. This was the first question he asked me,
“What are the chances of having a stroke?””

Did he use those words?

A. Well, if he didn’t use ‘stroke’ he used ‘paralyzed’.

Q. You don’t recall specifically?

A. No, but I do realize he asked a question about the
complications.

Q. You got the impression it would have to do with him being
paralyzed or something of that sort?

A. Yes.

...

“Q. And what did you tell him?

A. I told him again, or for the first time, that the chances
we felt were better, the chances of not—I guess I put it in a negative way. The
chances of not having a stroke were better with surgery than if we left well
enough alone.

Q. So in essence you told him that he would be better off
with surgery than to carry on without it?

A. Yes.”

Is that true?

A. That is true.

Q. Will you agree with me that you did not discuss with him
percentages of risk, whatever else you told him about this particular
procedure, of having a stroke or being paralyzed as a result of the surgery?

[Page 923]

A. I didn’t mention any statistical figures.

Q. What I am concerned about is this: the plaintiff says,
“If I had known and you, Dr. Hughes, had told me, that as a result of this
surgery immediately I could be paralyzed, then I would have made an entirely
different decision. All I believed was that whichever way I went I was then
likely ultimately to have a stroke if I had the surgery.” You heard his
evidence?

A. Yes.

Q. What do you say about that?

A. I don’t think he put any time limit on it either.

Q. He didn’t put any time limit on it. I suggest you didn’t
tell him that he stood the risk in a positive way, that if he had the surgery
there would be the risk of his having a stroke and becoming paralyzed, in
effect, immediately after the surgery?

A. I didn’t say that specifically.

Q. Don’t you think that your patient had the right to know
this specifically in order to give you an informed consent or refuse his consent?

A. Well, I think the fact that I said that we were talking 4
or 5 years, I think, as far as having a stroke without operation, I feel we
were talking about the same interval. I didn’t lay down a day or two or month
or year either way.

Q. Don’t you think that your patient was probably left in
the position in which he thought if he did not have the operation he might very
well, and there was a better chance of him having the stroke within 4 or 5
years than there was if you did the surgery on him?

A. Yes.

Q. What I am suggesting is that he did not understand and
you did not tell him that he stood a specific risk, if he had the surgery, of
being paralyzed as a result of the surgery?

A. Again only in the fact that we discussed the risks of
either having or not having surgery without a time limit on when he might have
something happen post-operatively.

Q. Page 18 of the examination for discovery, question 172:

“Q. Did Mr. Reibl ever ask you whether he might come
out of the operation paralyzed?

[Page 924]

A. In so many words?

Q. Or words to that effect?

A. Well, to some effect yes, he said, ‘What are my chances
of being paralyzed with the operation?’

Q. And did you answer that question?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you say?

A. I told him that the chances of his being paralyzed from
the operation were less than they would be if he did not have the operation.”

[Q.] Is that what you say? Do you agree now that that is
what you told him?

A. Yes, I would say so.

Q. Assuming that is what he said?

A. Yes.

Q. A little lower down:

“This is something I did not understand, Doctor.” There was
actually a discussion of paralysis, was there?

A. Yes.

Q. I took it from what you said earlier that the gist of
your discussion each time was, ‘Look, you run the risk of a stroke if you don’t
have the operation. Therefore, you are better off to have the operation than
not to have it.’?

A. Yes.

Were you asked that question and did you make that answer?

A. At the time of discovery?

Q. Yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Was it true?

A. Yes.

Some of the cross-examination touched upon the question of
re-operating on the plaintiff, and as to this I reproduce a single question and
answer:

Q. In other words, in 1970, there were no circumstances
under which you would consider re‑operating on a patient where you have
done a carotid endarterectomy; is that fair?

A. I think that is fair.

Dr. Hughes later reiterated that because of the “very high
mortality possibilities”, he would not re‑operate.

[Page 925]

5. Breach of Duty of Disclosure: The Findings Below Reviewed

In my opinion, the record of evidence amply justifies the trial
judge’s findings that the plaintiff was told no more or understood no more than
that he would be better off to have the operation than not to have it. This was
not an adequate, not a sufficient disclosure of the risk attendant upon the
operation itself, a risk well appreciated by the defendant in view of his own
experience that of the sixty to seventy such operations that he had previously
performed, eight to ten resulted in the death of the patients. Although the
mortality rate was falling by 1970, the morbidity (the sickness or disease)
rate, according to Dr. Hughes, was still about ten per cent. The trial judge
was also justified in finding that the plaintiff, who was concerned about his
continuing headaches and who was found to be suffering from hypertension, had
the impression that the surgery would alleviate his headaches and hypertension
so that he could carry on with his job. Dr. Hughes made it plain in his
evidence that the surgery would not cure the headaches but did not, as the
trial judge found, make this plain to the plaintiff.

The foregoing findings have a basis in the evidence independent
of any reliance on so-called statistics which was criticized by the majority of
the Court of Appeal. Although Brooke J.A., speaking for the majority, appeared
to discount the trial judge’s determinations because the latter made no
specific finding on credibility, it is patent to me that the trial judge’s
conclusions involved a weighing of the evidence and, hence, a measuring of its
relative worth on the issues that he had to decide. There were inconsistencies
in the defendant’s evidence, as the trial judge noted in his reasons, and it
was for him to reconcile them in arriving at his findings. For example, the defendant
said in chief that he had told the plaintiff of the risk of a stroke during
surgery and then said on cross-examination that the risks of the surgery were
quite minimal. Again, on cross-examination, he said that he did not tell the
patient that there

[Page 926]

was a risk of a stroke as a result of the surgery at any specific
time thereafter, and he returned to an oft repeated statement that the chances
of paralysis were greater without an operation than with it. (This was also the
only reference by Dr. Lougheed, who testified for the defence, as to the risk
involved in submitting to or foregoing the surgery. His evidence was almost
exclusively related to post-operative care and whether a re-operation was
feasible. He said it was not. However, as I noted earlier, post‑operative
care was not an issue in this Court.) Moreover, the defendant placed this risk
as one within a few years and not within any immediate time. Indeed, when asked
in cross-examination whether he told the patient that the surgery carried the
risk of a stroke, he answered, “I didn’t say that specifically”. This was
certainly a case in which a trial judge, here an experienced judge, was in a
better position than an appellate court or this Court to determine what
evidence to accept and what conclusions to draw from it.

In the passages that I quoted above from the reasons of Brooke
J.A., speaking for the majority of the Court of Appeal, there are two
approaches on the crucial issue whether the defendant apprised the plaintiff of
the risk of a stroke from the very operation. In the first quoted passage, the
learned Justice of Appeal appears to have viewed the trial judge’s finding on
this question as a finding that the plaintiff was not made aware of that risk.
This is clearly a correct assessment of the trial judge’s conclusion. However,
Brooke J.A. went on to deal with the case and with the evidence as if there was
a partial albeit not a sufficient disclosure of the particular risk, and he
proceeded from there into an appraisal of the statistics to which the trial
judge referred and found fault in their use. In the second quoted passage from
the reasons of Brooke J.A., wherein he considered the statistics, he ignores
the finding

[Page 927]

of the trial judge that there was no disclosure of the risks
inherent in the surgery itself. In my opinion, there was a failure by the Court
of Appeal to address this point directly. In the light of the defendant’s own
evidence that there was a failure on his part to disclose the risk, even though
the plaintiff himself raised the question of the risks he faced on the
operating table, I do not see how there could be any doubt of a breach in this
respect of the duty of disclosure.

Indeed, the reasons of the Court of Appeal in another passage,
which I have not hitherto quoted, appear to support the trial judge’s finding
that there was no proper disclosure by the defendant of the risk of the surgery
itself. Brooke J.A. said this on the question:

He [the defendant] did not specifically discuss the
questions of death or paralysis as risks of the surgery, his explanation being
that he believed the patient was aware of the risk because of questions that he
asked when the surgery was being discussed. It was his view that no further
detail was necessary.

In this respect then, there would seem to be concurrent findings
of fact against the defendant on a central point in case.

There were a number of relevant considerations informing the
findings of the trial judge, about which there was no dispute. First, there was
no emergency making surgery imperative. There was no noticeable neurological
deficit. The defendant himself placed the risk of a stroke as one off in the
future, four to five years. Any immediate risk would be from the surgery and
not from foregoing it. Moreover, it must have been obvious to the defendant
that the plaintiff had some difficulty with the English language and that he
should, therefore, have made certain that he was understood. Finally, there was
no evidence that the plaintiff was emotionally taut or unable to accept
disclosure of the grave risk to which he would be exposed by submitting to
surgery. I do not see in the reasons of the majority of the Court of Appeal any
evidentiary basis for challenging the findings of the trial judge on the
defendant’s breach of the

[Page 928]

duty of disclosure. Of course, the medical evidence was relevant
to what that duty entailed but, that said, it was for the trier of fact to
determine the scope of the duty and to decide whether there had been a breach
of the duty. As I have already said, the so-called statistical data used by the
trial judge did not affect the grounds upon which he made his critical
findings. The Court of Appeal held, however, that the trial judge did not
examine the issue of causation with the necessary care that this issue
required. He did not ignore it, even if he might have gone into it at greater
length. The question that remains, therefore, is whether this was a sufficient
basis upon which to direct a new trial.

6. Causation

Relevant in this case to the issue whether a reasonable person in
the plaintiff’s position would have declined surgery at the particular time is
the fact that he was within about one and one‑half years of earning
pension benefits if he continued at his job; that there was no neurological
deficit then apparent; that there was no immediate emergency making the surgery
imperative; that there was a grave risk of a stroke or worse during or as a
result of the operation, while the risk of a stroke without it was in the
future, with no precise time fixed or which could be fixed except as a guess of
three or more years ahead. Since, on the trial judge’s finding, the plaintiff
was under the mistaken impression, as a result of the defendant’s breach of the
duty of disclosure, that the surgery would relieve his continuing headaches,
this would in the opinion of a reasonable person in the plaintiffs position,
also weigh against submitting to the surgery at the particular time.

In my opinion, a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position
would, on a balance of probabilities, have opted against the surgery rather
than undergoing it at the particular time.

Conclusion

I would, accordingly, allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the Court of Appeal and restore the

[Page 929]

judgment at trial. The appellant is entitled to costs throughout.

Appeal allowed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Defences—Ignorance of the law—Whether there is a
distinction between mistake of law and ignorance of law—Whether ignorance of
subordinate legislation may be an excuse—Defence of due diligence—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, s. 19—Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.

Act, 1970-71-72 (Can.), c. 38, s. 11(2).

The appellant and his co-accused Hawkins were charged with
trafficking, between January 1, 1976 and August 26, 1976, in a restricted drug, to wit: 3-4 methylenedioxy‑N‑methylamphetamine (hereafter
referred to as “M.D.M.A.”), contrary to s. 42(1)  of the Food and Drugs Act . Molis
and Hawkins had been operating a laboratory where they were manufacturing
M.D.M.A. When they started manufacturing this substance, it was not listed in
Schedule H of the Food and Drugs Act  as a restricted drug. M.D.M.A. was
added to that Schedule by a regulation that was published in the Canada
Gazette, in June 1976. The trial judge directed the jury in such a way as
to limit the period of time during which appellant might have illegally
manufactured M.D.M.A., being from the time the amendment was published to
August 26. However, following a voir dire the trial judge ruled as
inadmissible evidence that purported to establish that appellant and his
partner had been as duly diligent as could be expected in their attempts to
ascertain whether it was legal or not to manufacture M.D.M.A. and that they did
not know until the time of their arrest that M.D.M.A. had become a restricted
drug. The jury found the appellant guilty and the Court of Appeal dismissed the
appeal from the conviction. This appeal and that of Hawkins were argued at the
same time and this Court had already dealt with the admissibility into evidence
of intercepted private conversation (see, supra Hawkins v. The Queen (No.
1), [1980] 2 S.C.R. 353).

The issue now before this Court was predicated on a
distinction argued by appellant between ignorance of the existence of a law and
mistake in its interpretation, the result of said distinction being that s. 19
of the Criminal

[Page 357]

Code, while being a bar to a defence of mistake of law
would not be that of ignorance of law if the accused has exercised due
diligence in the ascertainment of that law’s existence.

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

The trial judge did not err in refusing to submit to the jury
ignorance of the law as a defence, as this defence does not exist.
Section 19  of the Criminal Code  is clear and does not permit a
distinction between mistake of the law and ignorance of the law. As to the
distinction between ignorance of statute and that of subordinate legislation,
s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act expresses clearly the will of
Parliament that s. 19  of the Criminal Code  is a bar to any defence of
ignorance of law, be the offence one created by an “enactment”, as in the case
here. Even if by s. 11 (2) of the Statutory Instruments Act, Parliament
has relaxed somewhat the rigours of s. 19  of the Criminal Code , such
abatement applies only when a regulation was not published in the Canada
Gazette. As to the defence of diligence this Court recognized its existence
for certain offences in R. v. Sault Ste. Marie, that defence is that of
due diligence in relation to the fulfilment of a duty imposed by law and not in
relation to ascertainment of the existence of a prohibition or its
interpretation.

R. v. Maclean (1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 84; R. v. Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, referred to.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario
dismissing an appeal from the appellant’s conviction on a charge of trafficking
in a restricted drug. Appeal dismissed.

A.S. Price, for the appellant.

John A. Scollin, Q.C., and David L. Pomerant, for the
respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—This appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing one Albert Peter Molis’ appeal from conviction in the
General Sessions of the Peace at Toronto, in the Judicial District of York, in
Ontario, on an indictment that he and an alleged accomplice, one Brian
Middleton Hawkins “unlawfully did, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto,
in the Judicial

[Page 358]

District of York and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario,
between the 1st day of January in the year 1976 and the 26th day of August in
the year 1976, both days inclusive, traffic in a Restricted Drug, to wit:
3-4-Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, contrary to Section 42(1)  of the
Food and Drugs Act .” (A.C. at p. 1.)

Brian Middleton Hawkins also appealed in separate proceedings
from his conviction to the Court of Appeal and then to this Court from that
court’s decision dismissing the appeal. Both appeals were argued before us at
the same time; furthermore, at the hearing, each appellant added to his grounds
of appeal those argued by the other. Let it be said right now that the grounds
of appeal raised by Hawkins in his notice of appeal and memorandum which dealt with
the admissibility into evidence of intercepted private conversations were dealt
with sedente curia. Both appellants were told that their appeal had not
succeeded on those grounds and that judgment was reserved in both cases on the
other grounds that had originally been raised by appellant Molis. The latter
are predicated on a distinction argued by appellant between ignorance of the
existence of a law and mistake in its interpretation, the result of said
distinction allegedly being that s. 19  of the Criminal Code , while being
a bar to a defence of mistake of law, would not be to that of ignorance of law
if the accused has exercised due diligence in the ascertainment of that law’s
existence.

In view of my disagreement with such an interpretation of s. 19
of the Code, I find it unnecessary to set out here those facts which
would have been relevant to the issue of due diligence.

Molis and Hawkins attracted the attention of the Toronto R.C.M.P.
drug squad in January 1976. Appellant Molis had been operating since August
1975 a laboratory in partnership with Hawkins through a limited company under
the name of “Organic/Inorganic Research and Development Limited”. This
laboratory was, at least according to appellant and using his words, “basically
to develop a line, test kits for determination of dangerous drugs, to
manufacture a line of cosmetics, and to eventually get into the production of

[Page 359]

a limited quantity of research grade chemicals”. (A.C. 2 at p.
201.) The police became concerned after “It had been ascertained that chemicals
which in combination with others might produce drugs or substances on the
controlled or restricted schedules of the Food and Drugs Act  were being
shipped to” (appellant’s factum, at p. 2) appellant’s company.

A police investigation revealed that appellant and his partner
were manufacturing a chemical substance,
3-4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, conveniently referred to as M.D.M.A.
This substance is related chemically to another substance called M.D.A. which
is a restricted drug listed in Schedule H of the Food and Drugs Act  (R.S.C.
1970, c. F-27 and modifications).

It is of importance to know that when appellant started
manufacturing M.D.M.A. this substance (M.D.M.A.) was not on the list of
restricted drugs, and hence the manufacturing of that substance was perfectly
legal, subject to compliance with other laws or regulations with which we are
not in any way concerned here. Furthermore, it is to be noted that M.D.M.A. was
added to Schedule H and that the required amendment to that schedule was done
by a regulation that was published in the Canada Gazette, in June 1976.
Notwithstanding said amendment, appellant continued producing M.D.M.A. and was
arrested on August 26, near the premises of his company in possession in his
briefcase of M.D.M.A. that was subsequently established as having been
manufactured at his laboratory. The trial judge directed the jury in such a way
as to properly limit the period of time during which appellant might have
illegally manufactured M.D.M.A., being from the time the amendment was
published in June in the Canada Gazette to August 26. Following a voir
dire, the trial judge ruled as inadmissible under the circumstances of the
case evidence that purported to establish that appellant and his partner had
been as duly diligent as could be expected in their attempts to ascertain
whether it was legal or not to

[Page 360]

manufacture M.D.M.A. and that they did not know until the time of
their arrest that M.D.M.A. had become a restricted drug.

This ruling was the result of two findings on the part of the
trial judge. He first found that:

…ignorance of the accused as to the state of the statute and
the regulations and the schedule throughout the period set forth in the
indictment, provides no defence, and that evidence proposed to be introduced to
prove such ignorance and any steps taken by the accused to obtain knowledge of
the law, is inadmissible. (A.C. 2, at p. 227.)

His attention was then drawn to a decision by a county court
judge in Nova Scotia in the case of R. v. Maclean[1],
where it was held that when interpreting s. 19  of the Criminal Code  a
distinction is to be made between statutes and subordinate legislation due to
the fact that the latter are not normally so discoverable or available as the
former. Attorney for appellant drew the judge’s attention to the Maclean case
by asking him for some clarification:

…I take it,” said he, “from my interpretation of what you
have said, that firstly, even assuming the correctness of Maclean, you feel
that the evidence falls short. However, you don’t feel that the decision of
Maclean is correct in law. Have I correctly interpreted Your Honour’s reasons?

The judge then replied

No. I think in some instances the decision and result
reached by Judge O’Hearn may be correct, but I note the exceptions that he did
make at the top of page 101, which I read, that he places certain limitations
upon his reasoning, and I do too.

The passage by O’Hearn, Co. Ct. J., to which the judge was
alluding is as follows:

The significance of this case as well as of the many
exceptions noted in Williams’ work is that Criminal Code , s. 19 , is not
absolute and cannot be applied without reserve to every situation where the
essential mistake is one of law. Apart from the exceptions arising out of specific
mental elements of culpability such as fraud, Williams suggests several other
approaches to exceptions, of which two seem to be pertinent to this case. The
first is the case where the conduct is not

[Page 361]

generally realized to be wrongdoing because people do not
categorize it as immoral, or because knowledge of the applicable law is
generally confined to a small and special circle to which the accused does not
belong. To my mind, it might be objected to the latter category, that if an
accused wishes to indulge in an activity that requires special knowledge
including knowledge of the applicable law, he can fairly be held to be under an
obligation to acquire that knowledge.

His reference to this excerpt makes it clear that the judge then
found, and this is the second of the two findings I referred to previously,
that there are cases where s. 19  of the Criminal Code  is not a bar to a
defence of ignorance of the law, but that under the circumstances of the case
at bar he felt that on account of the appellant having indulged in an activity
requiring special knowledge this defence was not open to him.

The Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissed the appeal saying:

Assuming without deciding that ignorance of a Regulation
which has been duly published in the Canada Gazette, pursuant to the Statutory
Instruments Act, S.C. 1970‑71‑72, c. 38, might in some
circumstances be a defence if all reasonable diligence had been exercised to
ascertain its existence, we are all of the view that the inquiries made by the
appellants in this case, did not meet the required standard of diligence. (A.C.
2, at p. 403.)

…

…In all the circumstances, we are of the view that the trial
judge did not err in refusing to submit to the jury ignorance of law as a
defence. Accordingly, the appeals from conviction are dimissed.

Let me say at once that if the defence exists then its success or
failure is to be determined by the trier of fact, (in this case the jury),
unless the evidence is to be excluded as a result of the application of some evidentiary
exclusionary rule, which is not the case here.

Since I am, in any event, of the opinion that the defence does
not exist, I find it unnecessary to determine whether the Court of Appeal was
right

[Page 362]

in resorting as it did conditionally to s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code  when it found that appellant had in any event not
met “the recognized standard of diligence”; also, it is for that reason that I
agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal that the trial judge did not
err in refusing to submit to the jury ignorance of the law as a defence.

In support of his contention before us that the defence is in
this case available, appellant makes two sets of distinctions:

—The difference between mistake of law and ignorance
of law.

—The difference between ignorance of statute and that of
subordinate legislation.

The latter distinction is said to be relevant in determining
whether an accused has or has not been duly diligent in ascertaining the
existence of legislation by considering the degree of discoverability and of
availability of the law applicable to the case under consideration.

Section 19  of the Criminal Code  reads as follows:

19. Ignorance of the law by a person who commits an offence
is not an excuse for committing that offence.

Appellant argues that when Parliament says ignorance of law, it
in effect means mistake of law, i.e. the wrong interpretation of the
law, and that ignorance of the existence of a relevant penal provision is a
defence if an accused has exercised due diligence in ascertaining the existence
of that provision.

Appellant seeks support for the distinction in the fact that most
reported cases, where s. 19  has operated as a bar to a defence coined as one of
ignorance of law, were in effect situations that amounted to “mistake(s) of
law”.

Whatever may be the merit of such a distinction, and this is said
without pronouncing on its acceptability, Parliament has by the clear and
unequivocal language of s. 19  chosen not to make any distinction between
ignorance of the existence of the law and that as to its meaning, scope or
application. Parliament has also clearly expressed

[Page 363]

the will that s. 19  of the Criminal Code  be a bar to any
such defence, be the offence one created by an “enactment”, (s. 27(2) of the Interpretation
Act R.S.C. 1970 c. I-23) as is the case here.

Indeed s. 27(2) of the Interpretation Act, supra, says:

(2) All the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating
to indictable offences apply to indictable offences created by an enactment,
and all the provisions of the Criminal Code  relating to summary
conviction offences apply to all other offences created by an enactment, except
to the extent that the enactment otherwise provides.

Parliament has however recognized that, when the commission of an
offence is dependent upon a regulation, some consideration should be given to
the fact that regulations are less “discoverable” or “available”. As a result
Parliament has relaxed somewhat the rigours of s. 19  of the Criminal
Code  by enacting s. 11(2) of the Statutory Instruments Act, S.C.
1970‑71‑72, c. 38 which states:

11. (2) No regulation is invalid by reason only that it was
not published in the Canada Gazette, but no person shall be convicted of
an offence consisting of a contravention of any regulation that at the time of
the alleged contravention was not published in the Canada Gazette in
both official languages unless

(a) the regulation was exempted from the
application of subsection (1) pursuant to paragraph (c) of
section 27, or the regulation expressly provides that it shall apply
according to its terms before it is published in the Canada Gazette, and

(b) it is proved that at the date of the
alleged contravention reasonable steps had been taken to bring the purport of
the regulation to the notice of those persons likely to be affected by it.

However such an abatement of the rigours of s. 19  of the Criminal
Code  offers no solace to appellant as his conviction was for the
manufacturing of M.D.M.A. during a period posterior to the publication in the Canada
Gazette of the relevant amendment.

At the hearing before us, appellant further argued that this
Court in the case of R. v. Sault

[Page 364]

Ste.Marie[2]
recognized for certain offences the existence of a defence of due
diligence. The offence in the present case is worded as follows in the Food
and Drugs Act :

42.(1) No person shall traffic in a restricted drug
or any substance represented or held out by him to be a restricted drug.

(2) No person shall have in his possession any restricted
drug for the purpose of trafficking.

(3) Every person who violates subsection (1) or (2) is
guilty of an offence and is liable

(a) upon summary conviction, to imprisonment
for eighteen months; or

(b) upon conviction on indictment, to
imprisonment for ten years. 1968-69, c. 41, s. 10.

It is clear to me that we are dealing here with an offence that
is not to be considered as one of absolute liability and, hence, a defence of
due diligence is available to an accused. But I hasten to add that the defence
of due diligence that was referred to in Sault Ste.Marie is that of due
diligence in relation to the fulfilment of a duty imposed by law and not in
relation to the ascertainment of the existence of a prohibition or its
interpretation.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Conspiracy—Conspiracy to
prevent members of a union from participating in the lawful activities of their
union—Whether the information discloses an offence known to the law—Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 8, 115(1), 128, 159, 381, 382, 387,
423(2)—Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. L-1 s. 110.

Labour law—Right of employees to participate
in the lawful activities of the union of their choice—Members of a union being
prevented from exercising such a right—Whether that conduct is an unlawful
purpose within the meaning of s. 423(2) (a) of the Criminal Code —Canada Labour
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. L-1, ss. 110, 184, 185, 191(1)—Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, s. 423(2)(a).

The appellants have been charged, under s. 423(2) (a)
of the Criminal Code , with conspiracy “to effect an unlawful
purpose”: to prevent members of Seafarers’ International Union from
participating in the lawful activities of their union, in accordance with s.
110(1)  of the Canada Labour Code . Brown J. of the Provincial Court of
Ontario quashed the information on the grounds that (1) it was general and
vague and was lacking in substance falling short of the requirements contained
in s. 510  of the Criminal Code  and (2) it did not allege an offence
known to our criminal law. The Supreme Court of Ontario set aside the order of
Brown J. and made an order in the nature of mandamus directing that the
matter be returned to the Provincial Court for preliminary hearing and the Court of Appeal affirmed that
decision. Hence the appeal to this Court on both grounds dealt with by the Provincial Court and on the further ground
raised before the Supreme Court of Ontario and the Court of Appeal that mandamus
is not available as a remedy in this case.

[Page 494]

Held (Martland
and McIntyre JJ., dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Ritchie,
Dickson, Beetz, Estey and Chouinard JJ.: The first submission of the appellants
that the Labour Code is a complete and exhaustive code by itself and
that s. 110 is merely declaratory and contains no requirement and no
prohibition has little merit. The fact that within a code of labour relations
there is no specific sanction to enforce the rights of employees to participate
in the lawful activities of their union does not sanctify otherwise criminal
conduct. However, the appellants’ second contention, namely that their conduct
does not amount to a conspiracy to effect an unlawful purpose within the
meaning of s. 423(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  is well-founded.
Unlawful purpose in that paragraph means contrary to law, that is prohibited by
federal or provincial legislation. There are no Canadian cases where a charge
of conspiracy was upheld based on conduct not prohibited by legislation. To
prevent members from participating in the lawful activities of their union is
not necessarily unlawful. It is possible to conceive of many situations where
it would not be so. The information is not here related to the means. It is not
laid under s. 423(2) (b), nor under s. 381 , nor under any other
section charging a specific crime. It is laid under s. 423(2) (a)
and as laid it does not set out an offence known to the law of Canada.

Per Martland
and McIntyre JJ., dissenting: While it may be doubtful if any effective
sanction for the enforcement or protection of the rights of employees to
participate in the lawful activities of a trade union appears in the Canada
Labour Code , s. 381  of the Criminal Code  makes it an offence and
therefore an unlawful purpose to use the means therein described to compel a
person to abstain from doing anything he has a lawful right to do. The fact
that Crown counsel did not rely upon s. 381  of the Criminal Code  does
not prevent this Court from considering its effect and finding that the
unlawful purpose alleged in the information falls within the terms of this
section. Secondly, the information meets the requirements of the law and
thirdly, the error made by the trial judge results in a failure on his part to
exercise his jurisdiction and mandamus will lie to compel such exercise.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing an
appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario setting aside the order
of Brown J. of the Provincial Court quashing the information. Appeal allowed and order of the Provincial Court restored, Martland and
McIntyre JJ. dissenting.

Q.C., for the appellants.

John A. Scollin, Q.C., and D.D.G.
Reynolds, for the respondent.

The reasons of Martland and McIntyre JJ. were
delivered by

MCINTYRE J. (dissenting)—The facts
involved in this case are set out in the reasons for judgment of my brother,
Chouinard J., which I have had the advantage of reading. However, I am unable
to reach the same conclusion that he did. I would dismiss the appeal and direct
that the trial of the appellants, on the information set out below, proceed.
The information was in these words:

(1)     
that Roman Adolfe GRALEWICZ, John ROYCE, Roy
Norris WILLIS, Roger DESJARDINS, Richard THOMASSON, Edwin Aldon WILLIAMS,
Hedley HARNUM, Andre BANSEPT, William LISENCHUK, Walter MERCER and George
BALDO, between the 1st day of January 1971 and the 18th day of January 1977 in
the Province of Ontario and elsewhere in the Dominion of Canada, unlawfully did
conspire and agree together, the one with the other and with John Robert
LAZARUS, John PEARSON, Glen Patrick MILLEY, Ian Joseph VICKERS, Lawrence CAREY,
George KEAGAN, Donald Roy SWAIT, Arthur HUNT, Michael DABOUR, John Richard
WOOD, Kenneth Henry McGUIRE, and with another person or persons unknown to
effect an unlawful purpose to wit: to prevent members of the Seafarers’
International Union of Canada from participating in the lawful activities of
their Union,

[Page 496]

in accordance with Section 110(1) of
the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C. 1970 chapter L‑1 as amended, by
committing the following acts, to wit:

1) Threats and assaults upon members of the
said Union,

2) Possession and use of offensive weapons,

3) Defrauding members of the said Union through falsifying expenses,

4) Violations of the articles of the said
Union’s Constitution as they relate to elections, trials and individual rights,

5) Unlawfully preventing the said Union
members from obtaining employment,

thereby committing an offence contrary to
Section 423(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, chapter
C-34.

In this matter, I am of the opinion that the
dismissal of the appellant’s appeal in the Ontario Court of Appeal is
sustainable for the reasons there given. I am also of the opinion that the
appeal should fail for yet another reason.

The information alleges an offence against the
provisions of s. 423(2) (a) of the Criminal Code  which
provides:

(2) Every one who conspires with any one

(a) to effect an unlawful
purpose, or

(b)…

is guilty of an indictable offence…

Section 381  of the Criminal Code  is
set out as follows:

381. (1) Every one who, wrongfully and
without lawful authority, for the purpose of compelling another person to
abstain from doing anything that he has a lawful right to do, or to do anything
that he has a lawful right to abstain from doing,

(a) uses violence or threats
of violence to that person or to his wife or children, or injures his property,

(b) intimidates or attempts
to intimidate that person or a relative of that person by threats that, in
Canada or elsewhere, violence or other injury will be done to or punishment
inflicted upon him or a relative of his, or that the property of any of them
will be damaged,

(c) persistently follows that
person about from place to place,

[Page 497]

(d) hides any tools, clothes
or other property owned or used by that person, or deprives him of them or
hinders him in the use of them,

(e) with one or more other
persons follows that person, in a disorderly manner, on a highway,

(f) besets or watches the
dwelling-house or place where that person resides, works, carries on business
or happens to be, or

(g) blocks or obstructs a
highway, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

(2) A person who attends at or near or
approaches a dwelling-house or place, for the purpose only of obtaining or
communicating information, does not watch or beset within the meaning of this
section.

When this section was referred to in the
argument before this Court, counsel for the Crown, as I understood him, said
that the Crown did not rely on it, that it never had, and that the similarity
between the particulars given in the information, and in s. 381  of the Criminal
Code , was purely coincidental. It was said further that the appellants had
not been charged under that section. It seemed to have been assumed by counsel
that somehow the section was removed from consideration.

The principal question raised in this appeal is
whether the information discloses an offence known to the law. The fact that
Crown counsel considered that a particular section of the Criminal Code 
was not relied upon in drafting the information does not preclude this
Court from considering the effect of the section and finding that the
unlawful purpose, alleged in the information, falls within the terms of s. 381 
of the Criminal Code . While the information, to disclose an offence,
must allege a conspiracy to effect an unlawful purpose, specific reference to a
numbered section of the Criminal Code  is not necessary.

Section 110  of the Canada Labour Code  confers
rights upon employees to join trade unions and participate in their lawful
activities. While it may be doubtful if any effective sanction for the
enforcement or protection of such rights appears in the Canada Labour Code , s.
381  of the Criminal Code  makes it an offence and, therefore, an unlawful
purpose to use the means therein described to compel a person to abstain from
doing anything he

[Page 498]

has a lawful right to do. The information
alleges a conspiracy to prevent members of the Seafarers’ International Union
of Canada from participating in the lawful activities of their union by
committing the acts described in the information, thereby making the use of the
described means a part of the unlawful purpose alleged. Such a conspiracy would
therefore be a conspiracy to effect an unlawful purpose, and would be an
offence within s. 423(2) (a) of the Criminal Code . I am, of
course, far from saying that the Crown would be able to prove its case at
trial, but I am of the view that an offence has been alleged in the information
and the trial should proceed.

To the argument, which could be raised by
counsel for the appellants, that reliance on s. 381  of the Criminal Code  could
take the appellants by surprise and prejudice them in their defence, there is a
short answer. This argument might well have force where a previously
unmentioned issue is raised after the completion of the evidence at a trial and
before judgment, or even where it is produced during a trial when the defence
has already adopted a position without consideration of the effect or influence
such a change in the Crown position might have. However, that does not apply
here where no trial has been commenced, and the appellants would have, from the
outset, abundant notice of the problems they face.

Two other points raised by the appellants
require attention. It was argued that the information, as presented to the
Court, was void for uncertainty because it lacked the fundamental requirements
of specificity of time, place, matter and other essential ingredients, and,
secondly, that there was error on the part of the Court of Appeal in holding
that mandamus was available as a remedy in this case.

Dealing with the first point, in my view, it has
no merit. The information charges a specific conspiracy between stated dates to
effect a precisely stated objective and meets the requirements of the law in
that respect.

[Page 499]

As to the second point, the facts are that
before election and plea, and before any consideration was given to the merits
of the case, the motion to quash was made to the trial judge, and it succeeded.
Where, as here, error is made by a trial judge in these circumstances, which
results in a failure by the trial judge to exercise his jurisdiction, mandamus
will lie to compel such exercise. For this proposition, authority is found
in Kipp v. Attorney General for Ontario[1],
and the authorities referred to therein, including the very helpful judgment of
Grant J. at trial in the Kipp[2] case,
which was specifically approved by Judson J., speaking for the majority of this
Court. I would dismiss the appeal.

The judgment of Ritchie, Dickson, Beetz, Estey,
and Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—Upon motion of the appellants the
following information was quashed by order of Judge Brown of the Provincial
Court (Criminal Division) of the District of York:

That Roman Adolfe Gralewicz, John Royce,
Roy Norris Willis, Roger Desjardins, Richard Thomasson, Edwin Aldon Williams,
Hedley Harnum, Andre Bansept, William Lisenchuk, Walter Mercer, and George
Baldo between the 1st day of January, 1971 and the 18th day of January, 1977,
in the Province of Ontario and elsewhere in the Dominion of Canada, unlawfully
did conspire and agree together, the one with the other and with John Robert
Lazarus, John Pearson, Glen Patrick Milley, Ian Joseph Vickers, Lawrence Carey,
George Keagan, Donald Roy Swait, Arthur Hunt, Michael Dabour, John Richard
Wood, Kenneth Henry McGuire, and with another person or persons unknown to
effect an unlawful purpose, to wit: to prevent members of the Seafarers’ International
Union of Canada from participating in the lawful activities of their Union, in
accordance with Section 110 (1) of the Canada Labour Code R.S.C.
1970 Chapter L-1 as amended, by committing the following acts, to wit:

(1) Threats and assaults upon members of
the said Union;

(2) Possession and use of offensive
weapons;

[Page 500]

 (3) Defrauding members of the said Union
through falsifying expenses;

(4) Violations of the articles of the said
Unions’s Constitution as they relate to elections, trials and individual
rights;

(5) Unlawfully preventing the said Union
members from obtaining employment,

Thereby committing an offence contrary to
Section 423 (2) (a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970
Chapter C-34.

The Supreme Court of Ontario set aside the order
of Judge Brown and made an order in the nature of mandamus directing
“that this matter be returned to the Provincial Court (Criminal Division),
Judicial District of York for a Judge thereof, other than His Honour Judge A.
B. Brown, to proceed with the preliminary inquiry for the trial of the accused
upon the information herein”.

The appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

The grounds raised by the motion to quash are
summarized as follows by Judge Brown:

… One, the information is general, vague
and confusing and is lacking in substance falling short of the requirements
contained in Section 510  of the Criminal Code  of Canada. Two, the information does not
allege an offence known to our criminal law.

On the first ground the judge concluded:

After careful consideration of the
authorities and of the charge before me, and, of course, the careful
submissions of counsel, I accede to the submissions of defence counsel, that
the information is confusing and lacks the fundamental requirements of
specificity in relation to time, place and matter, and that it does not meet
the essential requirements of Section 510  of the Criminal Code . And
I also find that it is beyond redemption by amendment.

Accordingly, I rule that it is a nullity,
and the information is therefore quashed.

The judge nevertheless went on to consider the
second ground and concluded that were he forced to make a decision on this
point, he would lean toward the views expressed by Judge Trainor of

[Page 501]

the County Court of British Columbia in R. v.
Celebrity Enterprises Ltd. et al.[3]:

… which would lead me to say that in my
view it is not an unlawful purpose within Section 423  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada to enter into an agreement to prevent a person from
participating in activities of his Union merely because that right of free
participation is so declared by virtue of the provisions of Section 110  of
the Canada Labour Code .

Considering the two grounds in the reverse
order, Carruthers J. of the Supreme Court of Ontario held that the offence as set
out in s. 423 (2) (a) of the Criminal Code  is contained in the
information and that the information does meet the requirements of s. 510 of
the Code.

The Court of Appeal took the same view. It does
not appear however to have disposed of a further ground of appeal raised before
it, namely that mandamus was not available as a remedy in respect of the
decision of the Provincial Court judge on the sufficiency of the information.

The same grounds were argued by the appellants’
counsel before this Court, expressed as follows: (i) The information does not
set out an offence known to the law of Canada. (ii) The information is a
nullity because it lacks in the fundamental requirements of specificity of
time, place, matter and other essential ingredients. (iii) Mandamus is
not available as a remedy in respect of the decision of the Provincial Court judge on the sufficiency
of the information.

However, counsel for the respondent were invited
by the Court to restrict their argument to the first ground and these reasons
will accordingly deal only with the first ground: if the appellants succeed on
that ground, as I believe they must, there is no need to dispose of the others.

Section 423(2)  of the Criminal Code  reads:

(2) Every one who conspires with any one

(a) to effect an unlawful
purpose, or

(b) to effect a lawful
purpose by unlawful means,

[Page 502]

is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for two years.

In the appellants’ submission an agreement to
prevent anyone from exercising his freedom under s. 110 of the Canada Labour
Code to participate in the lawful activities of his union does not amount
to a conspiracy to effect an unlawful purpose within the meaning of s. 423(2) 
of the Criminal Code .

Section 110(1)  of the Canada Labour Code 
reads as follows:

(1) Every employee is free to join the
trade union of his choice and to participate in its lawful activities.

The first submission advanced on behalf of the
appellants is that:

The Canada Labour Code  is a complete
and exhaustive code provided by the Parliament of Canada for the conduct of
those industrial relations which come under federal jurisdiction. It was not
the intention of Parliament that its provisions should be enforced by resort to
the Criminal Code  or to any other statute since it provides its own
mechanisms for enforcement.

In the appellants’ submission, s. 110 is merely
declaratory and contains no requirement and no prohibition. It does not create
an offence. Various offences are created by ss. 184 and 185 relating to
interference with the freedoms of employees and employers recognized by s. 110
but none in the nature of that alleged in the information. Section 186
enacts a general prohibition to the effect that “no person shall seek by
intimidation or coercion to compel a person to become or refrain from becoming
or to cease to be a member of a trade union”. This deals with membership, not
with participation in the lawful activities of a union.

The only section of the Act under which a
prosecution could be contemplated for preventing members of a union from
participating in the lawful activities of their union would be s. 191(1):

191. (1) Subject to section 190, every
person other than an employer or a trade union who violates or fails to comply
with any provision of this Part other than section 148, 184 or 185 is
guilty of an offence and liable

[Page 503]

on summary conviction to a fine not
exceeding one thousand dollars.

Counsel for the respondent conceded however, and
rightly so in my opinion, that this section could not apply because the
words “violates or fails to comply” imply a prohibition or a requirement and
there are none in s. 110.

I see little merit in the appellants’ first
submission and I can but conclude as suggested by the respondent that “the fact
that within a code of labour relations there is no specific sanction to enforce
the rights of employees to participate in the lawful activities of their union
does not sanctify otherwise criminal conduct”.

The appellants further submit that their conduct
as charged in the information does not constitute an offence under the Criminal
Code . In their submission: 

If a statute does not expressly provide a
penalty then, the only possible offence one can commit with respect to it, is
the one set out in Section 115(1)  of the Criminal Code .

Every one who, without lawful excuse,
contravenes an Act of the Parliament of Canada by wilfully doing anything that
it forbids or by wilfully omitting to do anything that it requires to be done,
is, unless some penalty or punishment is expressly provided by law, guilty of
an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years. 1953-54, c.
51, s. 107.

Section 115(1)  has no application here
since s. 110(1)  of the Canada Labour Code  contains no prohibition and no
requirement.

The only specific offences in the Criminal
Code  related to interference with union membership are those by employers
under s. 382 .

As regards interference with the right of a
person to do something or to abstain from doing something, s. 381  enacts:

381. (1) Every one who, wrongfully and
without lawful authority, for the purpose of compelling another person to
abstain from doing anything that he has a

[Page 504]

lawful right to do, or to do anything that
he has a lawful right to abstain from doing,

(a) uses violence or threats
of violence to that person or to his wife or children, or injures his property,

(b) intimidates or attempts
to intimidate that person or a relative of that person by threats that, in
Canada or elsewhere, violence or other injury will be done to or punishment
inflicted upon him or a relative of his, or that the property of any of them
will be damaged,

(c) persistently follows that person
about from place to place,

(d) hides any tools, clothes
or other property owned or used by that person, or deprives him of them or
hinders him in the use of them,

(e) with one or more other
persons follows that person, in a disorderly manner, on a highway,

(f) besets or watches the
dwelling-house or place where that person resides, works, carries on business
or happens to be, or

(g) blocks or obstructs a
highway, is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

(2) A person who attends at or near or
approaches a dwelling-house or place, for the purpose only of obtaining or
communicating information, does not watch or beset within the meaning of this
section. 1953-54, c. 51, s. 366.

The appellants have not been charged under s.
381 . We were told by counsel that the respondent never relied on this
section and that any similarity between allegations in the information and
s. 381  is purely coincidental.

On the other hand, as recognized by counsel for
the appellants, “it is evident that there may be interference with the rights
of a person to do what he has the right to do other than by the means set out
in s. 381 . However, those other means of interference do not attract criminal
law sanctions unless, of course, they constitute crimes in themselves”.

In this case what the appellants have been
charged with is conspiracy “to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit: to prevent
members of the Seafarer’s International Union of Canada from participating in
the lawful activities of their Union, in

[Page 505]

accordance with s. 110(1)  of the Canada Labour Code ”.

It is therefore necessary to determine whether
preventing members of a union from participating in the lawful activities of
their union is an unlawful purpose within the meaning of s. 423(2)  of the Criminal
Code , or what is the meaning of unlawful purpose.

According to the appellants’ counsel an unlawful
purpose can only be one prohibited by statute either federal or provincial:

In our respectful submission, the law does
not create offences consisting of conspiracies to do acts not themselves
prohibited by law under the guise of a conspiracy to effect an unlawful
purpose. If the act which is the subject of the conspiracy is not prohibited by
statute, it cannot form an unlawful act or purpose as the subject of a
conspiracy.

They rely principally on R. v. Celebrity
Enterprises Ltd. et al. (supra) where Judge Trainor acquitted the accused
of a count of conspiracy “to effect an unlawful purpose, to wit, produce a
public mischief …with intent thereby to corrupt public morals, contrary to the
form of the Statute”.

Analyzing the sections of the Criminal
Code  dealing with public mischief (s. 128 ), mischief (s. 387 ) and
offences tending to corrupt morals (ss. 159  and following) as well as other
sections, Judge Trainor determined that none applied to the case and that
consequently the unlawful purpose charged did not relate to an offence under
the Criminal Code .

It would relate however to an offence at common
law. While no such generalized offence as conspiracy to effect a public
mischief was known to the law (R. v. Withers[4]), a conspiracy to corrupt morals was
indictable (Shaw v. D.P.P.[5]; R. v.
Knuller[6]).

[Page 506]

Judge Trainor was of the opinion that unlawful
purpose does not extend to common law offences and he stated at p. 176:

I cannot accept the Crown’s invitation to
follow Shaw and Knuller and either extend the meaning of unlawful
purpose to include a purpose not authorized by law or to hold that a common law
offence can be an unlawful purpose. In my view our law has developed clearly
and surely to the point that the unlawful purpose in Section 423(2)  must
be one contrary to law. Although the point is not before me I would think this
reasoning applies equally to “unlawful means” in Section 423(2) (b).

By contrary to law I mean prohibited by
Federal or Provincial legislation. Thus would be included all summary
conviction offences under the Criminal Code  and other Federal legislation and
offences created by Provincial legislation.

That decision was upheld by the British Columbia
Court of Appeal[7] where
speaking for the Court Robertson J.A. states at p. 480:

If something that someone does is not
something of which he can be convicted, that something cannot, in my opinion,
be “unlawful” in the sense in which the word is used in s. 423(2) (a).

Leave to appeal to this Court was refused[8].

All the Canadian cases in which conduct was held
capable of being the subject of a criminal conspiracy to effect an unlawful
purpose were based on conduct prohibited by legislation. See Wright,
McDermott & Feeley v. The Queen[9], Re
Thodas[10], R.
v. Chapman and Grange[11], R.
v. Jean Talon Fashion Centre Inc.[12] Counsel
for the respondent recognized that there are no Canadian cases where a charge
of conspiracy was upheld based on conduct not prohibited by legislation.

[Page 507]

The respondent relies however on the following
passage by Fauteux J., as he then was, in Wright, McDermott & Feeley
(supra) at pp. 193 and 194:

While marginal notes in the body of an Act
form no part of the Act, the marginal note appended to s. 408(2) accurately
designates as “Common Law conspiracy” the offence described in this
section which, as defined by Lord Denman in Rex v. Jones, (1832), 4
B. & A. 345, 110 E.R. 485 consists in a combination “either to do an
unlawful act, or a lawful act by unlawful means”. Common Law conspiracy is one
of the few Common Law offences which, upon the 1954 revision of the Criminal
Code , Parliament thought advisable to perpetuate by codification. Martin’s
Criminal Code  1955 ed., p. 35. Hence the law pertaining to this offence, its
elements and the wide embracing import of the term “unlawful purpose”, remains
unchanged.

But all that was decided in that case was that
unlawful purpose extends to a breach of a Provincial statute, in that case The
Ontario
Provincial Police Act. After the above passage,
Fauteux J. continues:

… While the term, as shown in Harrison The
Law of Conspiracy, encompasses more than criminal offences, sufficient it is to
say, for the purpose of this case, that the purpose alleged in the charge, to
wit, the obtention from a constable of information which it is his duty not to
divulge, is an unlawful purpose. In the language of Lord Mansfield, in Rex
v. Bembridge (1783), 3 Doug. K.B. 327 at 332, 99 E.R. 679:

A man accepting an office of trust
concerning the public, especially if attended by profit, is answerable
criminally to the King for misbehaviour in his office.

The fact that the purpose or the breach of
trust contemplated by the conspirators, whether as their ultimate aim or only
as a means to it, be, if carried into effect, punishable either under s. 103  of
the Criminal Code  (vide Rex v. McMorran (1948), 5 C.R. 338 at 345
et seq., O.R. 384, 91 C.C.C. 19, 3 D.L.R. 237) or under s. 60 of the Ontario
Provincial Police Act, adequately manifests the unlawfulness of the purpose
within the meaning of the law attending Common Law conspiracies.

When the Criminal Code  was revised in
1954, s. 8  was introduced:

[Page 508]

8. Notwithstanding anything in this Act or
any other Act no person shall be convicted

(a) of an offence at common
law,

(b) of an offence under an Act of
the Parliament of England, or of Great Britain, or of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, or

(c) of an offence under an Act or
ordinance in force in any province, territory or place before that province,
territory or place became a province of Canada,

but nothing in this section affects
the power, jurisdiction or authority that a court, judge, justice or magistrate
had, immediately before the 1st day of April 1955, to impose punishment for
contempt of court.

It follows that common law conspiracy would have
ceased to be part of Canadian criminal law had it not been retained as a
statutory offence. But to make it a statutory offence does not necessarily mean
that it was embodied with all its implications and uncertainties recognized by
the decisions of the English Courts when no decisions in Canada had ever gone
as far as those of the English Courts. And Fauteux J. in the above cited
passage clearly does not say that.

The Withers case (supra) is
authority to the effect “that it is not open to the courts nowadays either to
create new offences or so to widen existing offences as to make punishable
conduct of a type hitherto not subject to punishment”. The more so in Canada
and Cartwright J., as he then was, speaking for himself and five other members
of this Court, stated in Frey v. Fedoruk et al.[13], at p. 530:

To so hold would, it seems to me, be to
assert the existence of what is referred to in Stephen’s History of the
Criminal Law of England, Volume 2, Page 190, as:

the power which has in some instances
been claimed for the Judges of declaring anything to be an offence which is
injurious to the public, although it may not have been previously regarded as
such.

The writer continues:

this power, if it exists at all, exists
at Common Law.

[Page 509]

In my opinion, this power has not been held
and should not be held to exist in Canada. I think it safer to hold that no one
shall be convicted of a crime unless the offence with which he is charged is
recognized as such in the provisions of the Criminal Code , or can be
established by the authority of some reported case as an offence known to the
law. I think that if any course of conduct is now to be declared criminal,
which has not up to the present time been so regarded, such declaration should
be made by Parliament and not by the Courts.

It is difficult for me to see how the mere
enactment of conspiracy as a statutory offence would have the effect of
extending its scope beyond what it had been held to extend to at common law by
the Canadian courts prior to its becoming a statutory offence while at the same
time Parliament enacted s. 8 to exclude common law offences from the ambit of
the criminal law of Canada. I am therefore of the opinion that in 423(2)(a)
unlawful purpose means contrary to law, that is prohibited by federal or
provincial legislation.

But even assuming that the meaning of unlawful
purpose could be extended as far as it was at English common law prior to the
1977 amendments I do not believe that it would comprise a purpose to prevent
members of a union from participating in the lawful activities of their union.
(The law concerning conspiracy has been modified in England by the Criminal
Law Act 1977, 1977, c. 45, and in brief it now relates to the commission of
an offence, meaning an offence triable in England and Wales.)

In the 19th edition (1966) of Kenny’s Outlines
of Criminal Law to which reference is made in the Withers case (supra),
unlawful purpose as it then stood is described as follows at pp. 428 to
430:

451. The term “unlawful” is here used in a
sense which, unhappily, has never yet been defined with precision. The purposes
which it comprises appear to be of the following species.

(i) Agreements to commit a substantive
crime; e.g. a conspiracy to steal, or even merely to incite someone else to
steal. This extends to all cases where it would be criminal for any of the
conspirators to commit the act agreed upon, even though there be in the gang
other persons in whom it would be no offence to commit it;

[Page 510]

and to all “crimes”, even non-indictable
ones, e.g. nonpayment of poor rates. A conspiracy to obstruct the course of
justice can exist without there being any obstruction of the police (e.g.
to fabricate evidence, or to keep witnesses away from the court). It therefore
differs from a conspiracy to obstruct the police in the execution of
their duty, for this may not be concerned in any way with the course of public
justice, but have as its object, for example, to prevent the police from
maintaining public order or keeping the highway clear.

(ii) Agreements to commit any tort that is
malicious or fraudulent. Some say that agreements to commit any tort, of
whatever kind, are indictable as conspiracies. But the weight of authority
seems to be in favour of limiting the rule to torts of fraud or malice, thus
excluding, for instance, a trespass committed bona fide by persons eager
to assert their supposed right of way.

(iii) Agreements to commit a breach of
contract under circumstances that are peculiarly injurious to the public.

(iv) Agreements to do certain other acts,
which (unlike all those hitherto mentioned) are not breaches of law at all, but
which nevertheless are outrageously immoral or else are, in some way, extremely
injurious to the public. We may quote, as instances, agreements to facilitate
the seduction of a woman; or to run slackly in a race so as to enable a
confederate to win his bets; or to hiss a play unfairly; or to defraud a
shipowner by secretly putting stowaways on board. Similar criminality would
arise in agreements to raise by false reports the price of the Funds or of any
other vendible commodity; or so to carry on trade as to diminish the revenue;
or to persuade a prosecutor not to appear at the trial; or to give false
information to the police; or to indemnify a prisoner’s bail. On the other
hand, it is doubtful whether an agreement to make loud noises for the purpose
of disturbing an invalid neighbour would be indictable as a conspiracy. And a
thrifty combination of poor-law authorities to marry a female pauper to a
pauper of another parish, in order to relieve the ratepayers of the woman’s
parish, is not a conspiracy. Yet some combinations for procurement of marriage
will amount to conspiracy; e.g. taking a young woman of property from the
custody of her relations in order to marry her to one of the conspirators. And
although some combinations “in restraint of trade” may be so far illegal as to
be unen-

[Page 511]

forceable, it is now settled that they do
not necessarily constitute a criminal offence. As to the question whether a
conspiracy formed in England to effect some unlawful purpose abroad would be
indictable here, the House of Lords has laid it down that a conspiracy to
commit a crime abroad is not indictable in this country unless the contemplated
crime is one for which an indictment would lie here, and that a conspiracy to
attain a lawful object by unlawful means, rather than to commit a crime, is not
triable here when the unlawful means and the ultimate object are both outside
the jurisdiction.

(I have omitted the footnotes and the references
thereto.)

Reviewing this extensive list I do not see one
head under which would come the conduct described in the information.

This is understandable because as it appears to
me, to prevent members of a union from participating in the lawful activities
of their union is not necessarily unlawful nor “outrageously immoral”, nor
“extremely injurious to the public”. It is possible to conceive of many
situations where to do that would not be so. This seems to be recognized by the
Court of Appeal when speaking for the Court, Brooke J.A. says:

… The Canada Labour Code  is silent
as to acts by others outside of the employer‑employee relationship which
may interfere with the exercise by the employee of the right of freedom to
participate in lawful activities of the union. This is no doubt in recognition
of the right or freedom of others to perhaps peacefully persuade such employee
as to his participation in the lawful activities of the trade union.

But then Brooke J.A. goes on to say:

… But that is quite a different matter than
acts or an agreement which has the purpose of preventing or depriving an
employee from exercising his right or freedom to participate in the lawful
activities of his union.

The distinction that is drawn here appears to me
to relate to the means rather than to the purpose. The purpose in either case
is the same namely that

[Page 512]

there be no participation by an employee in the
lawful activities of his union. Only the means differ: persuasion in the first
case, intimidation or other unlawful means in the other.

But we are not here concerned with the means.
This information is not laid under s. 423(2) (b), nor under s. 381 , nor
under any other section charging a specific crime. It is laid under
s. 423(2) (a) and, in my opinion, as laid it does not set out an
offence known to the law of Canada.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
of the Court of Appeal and that of the Supreme Court of Ontario, and restore
the order of the Provincial Court quashing the information.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE—We are all of the opinion that
the accused, who was not represented by counsel, was deprived of the right to
make full answer and defence when he was not invited by the trial judge to make
submissions at the close of the evidence on the issue of possession and was
thereupon found guilty of possession of the narcotic. Accordingly, the appeal
must be allowed, the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal set aside and the
conviction quashed, and a new trial is directed.

Appeal allowed, conviction quashed and a new trial
directed.

Appellant was charged with importing a narcotic into Canada,
namely 20 pounds of cannabis (marijuana). The evidence was that the merchandise
was concealed in the false bottom of a dresser arriving from South Ameri­ca,
which appellant asked his mother to store in her home, and it was there that
the police made the seizure. The accused was acquitted by a jury, but the
prosecu­tion appealed from the verdict, alleging that:

(1) the selection of the jury was tainted by irregulari­ties
capable of vitiating the trial and leading to the nullity of the verdict:
first, the judge denied the accused the right to peremptorily challenge a juror
whom the triers had found to be impartial, after previously allowing this right
with respect to another juror in the same situation; the judge also allowed
counsel for the accused to ask a juror questions after the latter had been
sworn;

(2) the trial judge refused to admit in evidence an
""air waybill"" relating to the dresser which con­tained the marijuana
and certificates of analysis to establish that the items seized at the accused's
home, a cigarette butt, a pipe and a green substance, indicated that the
accused was a user of marijuana;

(3) the judge's charge to the jury was insufficient, because
he failed to explain to the jury the

[Page 710]

provisions of the Criminal Code  regarding ""the
parties"" to an offence.

The Court of Appeal did not rule on the consequences
of the first contention, but admitted the merits of the other two, quashed the
verdict of acquittal and ordered a new trial. Hence the appeal to this Court.

Held (Martland, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

Per Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Spence, Dickson,
Estey and Pratte JJ.: The three questions raised must be considered separately:

(1) An examination of the case law and legislation
indicates that the rule and practice which existed in England and in Canada at
the time of the first codifica­tion of the criminal law have not been altered,
and that in the case at bar the trial judge erred when he denied the accused
the right to challenge peremptorily a juror whom the triers had found to be
impartial. While the accused is entitled to ask for the trial and the verdict
to be annulled for such an illegality, the nullity is relative and the
prosecution may not complain about the fact that the accused exercised, or
failed to exercise, one of his rights of challenge, as this right is purely
personal to the accused. The judge undoubtedly erred in putting further
questions to a juror after the latter had been sworn, but there is no
indication that this error had any effect on the verdict of acquittal. The
irregularities which occurred in empanelling the jury are therefore not a basis
for setting aside the verdict of acquittal.

(2) The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge
erred in refusing to admit an ""air waybill"". This docu­ment is
governed by the Carriage by Air Act , which states that it consists of
three original copies. The copy sought to be introduced in the case at bar was
not one of these three originals, but a copy which could not be admitted unless
accompanied by the affidavit prescribed in s. 30(3)  of the Canada Evidence
Act . The admissibili­ty of the items tending to establish that the accused
was a user of marijuana is determined by the relevance of the evidence or the
existence of a connection between the two facts which makes it possible to
infer the existence of one from the existence of the other.

In the case at bar there is no connection between the
fact that the accused is a user of marijuana and the fact that he knew or ought
to have known that the dresser contained a narcotic at the time it was
imported. Mens rea is an essential aspect of the crime attributed to the
accused, and it must be established beyond all reasonable

[Page 711]

doubt. The type of evidence which merely raises
suspicions against the accused is precisely the type of evidence which cannot
be admitted; nor should this evidence be admitted because it may disclose the
interest of the accused in the importation. Proof of the motive for a crime is
generally admitted as circumstantial evidence, but only if it is relevant. In
the case at bar, it cannot be said that the use of marijuana by appellant is in
itself a fact seriously tending to establish motive for the crime of
importation with which he is charged.

(3) Finally, contrary to the opinion of the Court of
Appeal, the judge did not have to explain to the jury the scope of the
provisions of the Criminal Code  regarding the parties to an offence. All
the evidence of the pros­ecution was designed to show that it was appellant who
committed the offence, and the judge had to instruct the jury on the rules of
law raised by the trial as it unfolded.

Per Martland and Pigeon JJ., dissenting: The
absence of notice relied on by the trial judge in refusing to admit the air
waybill was a mere procedural irregularity, since the document was filed at the
preliminary inquiry. So far as the argument that the letter was only a copy is
concerned, the case at bar is a criminal prosecution and the waybill in
question is ""a record made in the usual and ordinary course of
business"" of the air carrier, within the meaning of subs. (1) of s. 30  of
the Canada Evidence Act . The fact that there was no signature on the
document could not in criminal proceedings operate as a bar to the admission of
such evidence. The Court of Appeal also correctly found to be admissible
certificates of analysis and other items which the prosecution sought to introduce
to prove (1) mens rea (2) the accused's interest in the importation. The
two reasons cited are valid. In cases of this kind, the guilty intent
ordinarily cannot be established by direct evidence, and it is therefore
necessary to admit in evidence every bit of circum­stantial evidence, even if
the connection between it and the guilty intent is not conclusive. Provided
that there is some connection, such evidence must be admitted for what it is
worth. The second reason, namely the accused's interest or motive as opposed to
his intent, seems to be conclusive of the admissibility in evidence of anything
tending to show that the accused did use marijuana.

Per Beetz J., dissenting: Of the two
errors attributed to the trial judge by the Court of Appeal, the only one which
he made was in refusing to admit in evidence the air waybill tending to
establish importation. However, as the record contains other evidence of such
importation it should be returned to the Court of Appeal for the weight of this
other evidence to be assessed.

APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal of Quebec,
quashing a verdict of acquittal. Appeal allowed, Martland, Pigeon and Beetz JJ.
dissenting.

The judgment of Laskin C.J. and Ritchie, Spence, Dickson, Estey
and Pratte JJ. was deliv­ered by

PRATTE J.—Appellant is appealing from a unanimous decision of the
Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec (Montgomery, Turgeon and Mayrand
JJ.A.), which quashed the verdict of acquittal returned in his favour and
ordered a new trial on the charge of unlawfully importing a narcotic into
Canada.

The facts are well summarized by Mayrand J.A. in his reasons
(there were two errors of dates which I have corrected):

[TRANSLATION] ... In November 1972, Mrs. Claire Cloutier met
her son, the respondent, who asked her if she could store certain furniture at
her home for his friends, who were then travelling in South America. She
agreed, provided that the furniture was not too large and was not to be stored
for too long. At this time, Mrs. Cloutier was living in quite a large house at
2495 Galt

[Page 713]

Street West, in Sherbrooke, while her son was living in a
rather cramped apartment on MacManamy Street, also in Sherbrooke.

On January 10, 1973, Mrs. Cloutier received a tele­phone
call from Air Canada, announcing the arrival of a package and asking how she
would like it delivered. She asked Air Canada to contact Maislin Transport
Ltd., whom she instructed to deliver this package to her, and she told her son,
the respondent, about it. In the meantime, the RCMP had examined the suspect
package at Dorval airport and found a bag of marijuana, concealed in a cupboard
with a false bottom. The following day Maislin Transport, which had possession
of the package, told Mrs. Cloutier she had to clear it through customs; she
told her son of this, and he asked her to look after it herself, and advanced
her $50 to cover expenses. The package was then delivered to Mrs. Cloutier's
home, and the police placed the house under constant surveillance. On the day
in question, January 12, 1973, the accused went to his mother's home and broke
open the crate in which the furniture was packed. The next day, which was a
Saturday, he called Bérubé, a student who rented a room in Mrs. Cloutier's
house, by telephone and asked him to leave the basement door unlocked overnight
and mention it to no one; the day after, a Sunday, he again asked him to leave
the door unlocked and to close all the adjacent doors, draw the curtains and
say nothing to anyone. Once again, however, no one came to collect the furniture.
Finally giving up, the police entered Mrs. Cloutier's house and seized the
furniture containing the marijuana; they also conducted a search in the accused's
lodging and seized a metric scale, a cigarette butt, pipes, literature on
marijuana and a pot containing a green substance.

Appellant was subsequently charged with having: 

[TRANSLATION] . .. in Montreal, district of Montreal, and in
Sherbrooke, district of St-François, between December 20, 1972 and January 12,
1973, imported into Canada a narcotic, to wit:

20 lbs. of cannabis (marijuana), the whole contrary to s.
5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, Revised Sta­tutes of Canada 1970, c.
N-1, committing thereby an indictable offence as specified in s. 5(2) of the
said Act.

Appellant was tried before a jury, presided over by a judge of the
Court of Queen's Bench for the district of St-François. The jury returned a
verdict of acquittal. The Court of Appeal quashed this verdict; it held that
the judge had erroneously

[Page 714]

denied respondent the right to adduce evidence of certain facts,
and that his charge to the jury was incomplete; Mayrand J.A. was further of the
view that irregularities had occurred in the selection of the jury, but he made
no finding as to the attend­ing consequences.

The questions raised by this appeal concern the correctness of
the procedure followed in selecting the jury, the admissibility of certain
items of evi­dence and the legality of the charge to the jury.

I

First, consideration must be given to whether the selection of
the jury was tainted by irregulari­ties capable of vitiating the trial and
leading to the nullity of the verdict. This is what was submitted by
respondent; as appellant was acquitted, he makes no complaint in this regard.

The first alleged illegality is in respect to the right of an
accused to peremptorily challenge a juror whom the triers have found to be
impartial.

In the case at bar, the judge first acknowledged that the accused
had such a right:

[TRANSLATION] BY THE COURT

Mr. Fournier, I will allow you to peremptorily challenge
this witness. Now, after the question is put to the triers you no longer have a
right to do this, it must be done before the question is put to the triers.

Subsequently, the judge adopted the other point of view and
denied the accused the right to peremptorily challenge another juror who had
been found impartial:

[TRANSLATION] BY MR. ROCH FOURNIER COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED

(Observations of Mr. Fournier after the prospective juror
Gilles Jean, No. forty-two (42), was found to be impartial by the triers.)

Your Lordship, before the juror takes the oath .. .

BY THE COURT

The question was put and the jurors have decided it.

BY MR. ROCH FOURNIER COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED

I would have asked nevertheless, I wanted your Lordship to
make a decision. I would like him to be peremptorily challenged.

[Page 715]

BY THE COURT

No, it's too late. I had told you .. .

BY MR. ROCH FOURNIER COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED 

No, I would like your Lordship to decide it.

Respondent argued that either one or the other of these two
decisions of the trial judge was neces­sarily in error, with the result that
the jury was improperly impanelled and the verdict should be regarded as null.
This submission of respondent is too general. A trial is not necessarily
vitiated by any erroneous decision of a judge; the conse­quences that follow
from an illegality depend on the nature of the rule that is violated and the
importance of the right which such rule is designed to safeguard. Even in the
selection of a jury, not all rules have the same weight (R. v. Battista[1];
Horatio Bottomley[2]; Bussières
v. Regem[3]; R.
v. Stewart[4]); some
are purely procedural, others are designed to protect the personal interests of
one or other of the parties, and others have an even more fundamental
importance in that they seek to ensure the integrity of the sytem [sic] that
establishes, as between the parties, a predetermined state of balance.

The first question to be examined therefore is as to which
decision of the trial judge was in error; that which allowed, or that which
denied, the peremptory challenge? Once the error is identified, its
consequences may be determined.

There is no doubt that under English criminal law, which became
ours pursuant to the Quebec Act of 1774, the accused could challenge
peremp­torily a prospective juror against whom a challenge for cause had been
rejected (Chitty on Criminal Law, 1826, vol. 1, at p. 545; Taschereau, The
Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment

Acts of 1869, 32-33 Vict., for the Dominion of Canada, vol.
2, at p. 204).

It is also generally admitted that this was the situation when
the first Criminal Code  came into effect in 1893 (Taschereau, The
Criminal Code ,

[Page 716]

ed. 1893, under s. 668, at p. 782; Rose v. The Queen[5],
by Rinfret J.A., at p. 592).

The dispute therefore turns essentially on the scope of subss. 8
and 10 of s. 668 of this Code, and the corresponding
provisions of the present Code.

Section 668 of the 1892 Code read as follows:

668. Every one indicted for treason or any offence
punishable with death is entitled to challenge twenty jurors peremptorily.

2. Every one indicted for any offence other than treason, or
an offence punishable with death, for which he may be sentenced to imprisonment
for more than five years, is entitled to challenge twelve jurors peremptorily.

3. Every one indicted for any other offence is entitled to
challenge four jurors peremptorily.

4. Every prosecutor and every accused person is entitled to
any number of challenges on any of the follow­ing grounds; that is to say:

(a.) that any juror's name does not appear in the panel:
Provided that no misnomer or misdescription shall be a ground of challenge if
it appears to the court that the description given in the panel sufficiently
desig­nates the persons referred to; or

(b.) that any juror is not indifferent between the Queen and
the accused; or

(c.) that any juror has been convicted of any offence for
which he was sentenced to death or to any term of imprisonment with hard labour
or exceeding twelve months; or

(d.) that any juror is an alien.

5. No other ground of challenge than those above-mentioned
shall be allowed.

6. If any such challenge is made the court may in its
discretion require the party challenging to put his chal­lenge in writing. The
challenge may be in the form LL in schedule one hereto, or to the like effect.
The other party may deny that the ground of challenge is true.

7. If the ground of challenge is that the juror's names do
not appear in the panel, the issue shall be tried by the court on the voir
dire by the inspection of the panel, and such other evidence as the court
thinks fit to receive.

[Page 717]

8. If the ground of challenge be other than as last
aforesaid the two jurors last sworn, or if no jurors have then been sworn then
two persons present whom the court may appoint for that purpose shall be sworn
to try whether the juror objected to stands indifferent between the Queen and
the accused, or has been convicted, or is an alien, as aforesaid, as the case
may be. If the court or the triers find against the challenge the juror shall
be sworn. If they find for the challenge he shall not be sworn. If after what
the court considers a reasonable time the triers are unable to agree the court
may discharge them from giving a verdict, and may direct other persons to be
sworn in their place.

9. The Crown shall have power to challenge four jurors
peremptorily, and may direct any number of jurors not peremptorily challenged
by the accused to stand by until all the jurors have been called who are
available for the purpose of trying that indictment.

10. The accused may be called upon to declare whether he
challenges any jurors peremptorily or otherwise, before the prosecutor is
called upon to declare whether he requires such juror to stand by, or
challenges him either for cause or peremptorily.

The corresponding provisions of the present

Code are ss. 562, 563, 567, 568 and 569, which read as follows
when the trial began on October

30, 1973:

562. (1) An accused who is charged with an offence
punishable with death is entitled to challenge twenty jurors peremptorily.

(2) An accused who is charged with an offence other than an
offence punishable with death, for which he may be sentenced to imprisonment
for more than five years, is entitled to challenge twelve jurors peremptorily.

(3) An accused who is charged with an offence that is not
referred to in subsection (1) or (2) is entitled to challenge four jurors
peremptorily.

563. (1) The prosecutor is entitled to challenge four jurors
peremptorily, and may direct any number of jurors who are not challenged
peremptorily by the accused to stand by until all the jurors have been called
who are available for the purpose of trying the indictment.

(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the prosecutor may not
direct more than forty-eight jurors to stand by unless the presiding judge for
special cause to be shown, so orders.

[Page 718]

(3) The accused may be called upon to declare whether he
challenges a juror peremptorily or for cause before the prosecutor is called
upon to declare whether he requires the juror to stand by, or challenges him
peremptorily or for cause.

567. (1) A prosecutor or an accused is entitled to any
number of challenges on the ground that

(a) the name of a juror does not appear on the panel, but no
misnomer or misdescription is a ground of challenge where it appears to the
court that the description given on the panel sufficiently designates the
person referred to,

(b) a juror is not indifferent between the Queen and the
accused,

(c) a juror has been convicted of an offence for which he
was sentenced to death or to a term of imprisonment exceeding twelve months,

(d) a juror is an alien, or

(e) a juror is physically unable to perform' properly the
duties of a juror.

(2) No challenge for cause shall be allowed on a ground not
mentioned in subsection (1).

568. (1) Where a challenge is made on a ground mentioned in
section 567, the court may, in its discre­tion, require the party that
challenges to put the chal­lenge in writing.

(2) A challenge may be in Form 37.

(3) A challenge may be denied by the other party to the
proceedings on the ground that it is not true.

569. (1) Where the ground of a challenge is that the name of
a juror does not appear on the panel, the issue shall be tried by the judge on
the voir dire by the inspection of the panel, and such other evidence
that the judge thinks fit to receive.

(2) Where the ground of a challenge is one not mentioned in
subsection (1), the two jurors who were last sworn, or if no jurors have then
been sworn, two persons present whom the court may appoint for the purpose,
shall be sworn to determine whether the ground of challenge is true.

(3) Where the finding, pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) is
that the ground of challenge is not true, the juror shall be sworn, but if the
finding is that the ground of challenge is true, the juror shall not be sworn.

(4) Where, after what the court considers to be a reasonable
time, the two persons who are sworn to determine whether the ground of
challenge is true are

[Page 719]

unable to agree, the court may discharge them from giving a
verdict and may direct two other persons to be sworn to determine whether the
ground of challenge is true.

The proponents of the theory that the accused may not
peremptorily challenge a juror found to be impartial rely, firstly, on the
following provision in subs. 8 of s. 668:

If the court or the triers find against the challenge the
juror shall be sworn.

Subsection 3 of s. 569 of the present Code is to the same
effect:

Where the finding, pursuant to subsection (1) or (2) is that
the ground of challenge is not true, the juror shall be sworn, .. .

In either case, the English text is the same: "" .. . the
juror shall be sworn"". In short, it is argued that the text ""le juré
sera assermenté"", ""le juré est assermenté"" creates an absolute
obligation, and that such obligation to swear the juror denies the right to a
peremptory challenge.

I do not find this reasoning to be well grounded; it does not
take into account the context of the provision to be interpreted; it disregards
the true nature of the right to peremptory challenges; and it leads to the
denial of the right to make such challenges in the very circumstances where it
is most important that this right be available.

A legislative provision should not be interpreted in isolation;
its true meaning cannot be determined without giving consideration to the
object of the statute in which it is contained and to the related provisions
taken as a whole. Otherwise, there is a danger of arriving at an absurd
conclusion.

In Canada Sugar Refining Co. v. Reg.[6],
Lord Davey expressed, at p. 741, the fundamental rule that one provision is
to be interpreted in conjunc­tion with others: ""Every clause of a statute
should be construed with reference to the context and the other clauses of the
Act, so as, so far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole
statute or series of statutes relating to the subject matter.""

[Page 720]

The phrases ""le juré sera assermenté"", ""le juré est
assermenté"" therefore do not necessarily have an absolute meaning; in
attempting to determine the extent of the obligation which they impose,
reference must be had to the nature and purpose of the right which is the
subject-matter of legislative regulation.

According to Blackstone (Commentaries on the Laws of England, Lewis
ed., vol. 4, No. 353, at p. 1738), there were two reasons which justified the
existence of the right to peremptory challenges:

353. Challenges upon any of the foregoing accounts are
styled challenges for cause, which may be without stint in both criminal
and civil trials. But in criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, there is,
in favorem vitae, allowed to the prisoner an arbitrary and capricious
species of challenge to a certain number of jurors, without showing any cause
at all, which is called a peremptory challenge; a provision full of that
tenderness and humanity to prisoners for which our English laws are justly
famous. This is grounded on two reasons. L As every one must be sensible what
sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the
bare looks and gestures of another, and how necessary it is that a prisoner
(when put to defend his life) should have a good opinion of his jury, the want
of which might totally disconcert him, the law wills not that he should be
tried by any one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice, even without
being able to assign a reason for such his dislike. 2. Because, upon challenges
for cause shown, if the reasons assigned prove insufficient to set aside the
juror, perhaps the bare questioning his indifference may sometimes provoke a
resentment, to prevent all ill consequences from which the prisoner is still at
liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.

The very basis of the right to peremptory chal­lenges, therefore,
is not objective but purely sub­jective. The existence of the right does not
rest on facts that have to be proven, but rather on the mere belief by a party
in the existence of a certain state of mind in the juror. The fact that a juror
is objectively impartial does not mean that he is believed to be impartial by
the accused or the prosecution; Parliament, when allowing each party a number
of peremptory challenges, clearly intended that each party have the right to
remove from the jury a number of individuals whom he does not

[Page 721]

believe to be impartial, though he could not provide evidence in
support of such belief. The very nature of the right to peremptory challenges
and the objectives underlying it require that its exercise be entirely
discretionary and not subject to any condition. There is no logical connection
between the challenge for cause and the peremptory chal­lenge, and I do not see
any reason why the unsuc­cessful exercise of the right to challenge for cause
would have an effect on the right to a peremptory challenge. Only a clear
legislative provision could negate the right to a peremptory challenge in
circumstances where, because of its very purpose, such a right should be
available.

Section 569 (subs. 8 of s. 668 of the first Criminal Code ) is clearly
a procedural provision which indicates the manner in which the merits of a
challenge for cause are to be determined. The purpose of this section is not to
regulate the right to peremptory challenges in itself, but rather to regulate
the manner in which a challenge for cause is made: the distinction is not one
to be ignored.

Moreover, the effect of an excessively literal interpretation of
the phrases ""the juror shall be sworn"" (""le juré sera assermenté""
and ""le juré est assermenté"") would necessarily be to deny the
prosecution any right to challenge or require to stand by a juror who had been
unsuccessfully challenged for cause by the accused. If a juror must be sworn
because a challenge for cause has been held to be groundless, no other challenge
would then be possible, whether by the prosecution or by the accused.

The right of the prosecution to challenge a juror and that of
requiring a juror to stand by are independent of the rights conferred on the
accused, and I do not see why the prosecution should be deprived of its rights
because the accused has unsuccessfully challenged a juror for cause. The rights
of challenge enjoyed by the accused are not intended to enable him to select a
jury favourable to his case, but rather to reject jurors who, in his view, do
not have the qualifications necessary for performing this function. I cannot
accept an inter­pretation of the provisions of the Criminal Code  quoted
above that would disrupt the balance clearly

[Page 722]

established by the legislator between the rights of the
accused and those of the prosecution.

In Morin v. The Queen[7], at
pp. 424 et seq., Ritchie C.J. stated:

... If the crown can order a juror to stand aside on a
second perusal of the panel, why may they not do it a third or a fourth time,
in fact indefinitely until a jury was selected to suit the prosecuting officer,

I think, therefore, in this case there was an assump­tion on
the part of the officer of an unlimited right of challenging jurors without
assigning cause. The object of the law certainly is to secure the prisoners a
fair trial. How can this be accomplished if he is deprived of the privilege the
law gives him in the selection of the jury by whom he is to be tried?

In the present instance the objection taken is not raised on a
mere technicality but is that the jury to whom the prisoner shall be given in
charge shall be legally selected, chosen and sworn, and that neither the crown
nor the prisoner shall have any advantage or privilege other than those
conferred by law; but when privileges are conferred by law they shall be
rigidly respected.

And Fournier J. added, at pp. 438 and 439: 

[TRANSLATION] ... It would therefore be unfair and unlawful
to grant it a privilege such as that of a repeated ""stand aside"",
which would have the effect of extinguishing the prisoner's right of challenge,
and in practice leave the Crown the power to form a jury to suit itself or, to
use the English expression, to pack the jury.

Our law does not confer on the accused a right to empanel a favourable
jury, any more than it does on the prosecution.

I therefore concur in the opinion of Schroeder J.A., in the
unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario, R. v. Ward[8],
at p. 156: 

... It is well settled that one section of a statute should
be read in the light of other sections thereof relating to the same or to a
cognate subject-matter, and applying that principle to the interpretation of s.
569(3), the words ""the juror shall be sworn"" surely mean no more

[Page 723]

than that the juror shall be sworn provided that in
exercising their rights under these other specific provi­sions of the Code,
Crown counsel has not directed the juror to stand aside, or has not challenged
him peremp­torily, or counsel for the accused has not made a peremptory
challenge of the particular juror.

Those who argue that a peremptory challenge may not be allowed
when a challenge for cause has been dismissed rely also on subs. 10 of s. 668,
which is now subs. 3 of s. 563.

There is no significant difference between these two provisions;
subs. 10 reads as follows:

10. The accused may be called upon to declare whether he
challenges any jurors peremptorily or otherwise, before the prosecutor is
called upon to declare whether he requires such juror to stand by, or
challenges him either for cause or peremptorily.

Subsection 3 of s. 563 reads as follows:

(3) The accused may be called upon to declare whether he
challenges a juror peremptorily or for cause before the prosecutor is called
upon to declare whether he requires the juror to stand by, or challenges him
peremptorily or for cause.

It was submitted that, in providing that the accused may be
called upon to declare whether he challenges a juror peremptorily or for cause,
Par­liament, through the use of this disjunctive adverb, has indicated that
with respect to any one juror the accused would be entitled to only one of the
two types of challenge, not to both. Such an interpreta­tion totally ignores
the purpose of the subject provision. Subsection 3 of s. 563 of the present Code,
like subs. 10 of s. 668 before it, is designed only to determine the order
in which challenges will be made as between the accused and the prosecution;
the provision does not state that the right of the accused is an alternative
one; it merely says that the prosecution may only be called upon to make its
declaration once the accused has made his own. If the adverb ""or"" in
this provision were really disjunctive, it would follow that the prosecu­tion
could be asked to exercise one or other of its rights of challenge or to
require a juror to stand aside before the accused has exercised all of them,
which would be contrary to the rule of ancient law (Blackstone, Commentaries
on the Laws of England,

[Page 724]

4th ed., 1769, vol. 4, at p. 347; Hawkins' Pleas of the Crown,
vol, 2, at p. 569, c. 43; Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of
England, vol. 1, at p. 303). There is no basis for this interpretation.

I therefore conclude, like Turgeon J.A. in Rose[9],
at pp. 615 and 616, that neither the 1892 Code nor the present Code
has had the effect of altering [TRANSLATION] ""the rule and the
practice which existed in England and in Canada at the time of the first
codification"". It follows from this that the trial judge erred when he
denied the accused the right to challenge peremptorily a juror whom the triers
had found to be impartial.

The consequences of this illegality must now be considered.

The accused, who is erroneously denied a peremptory challenge, is
entitled to ask that the trial and the guilty verdict returned by an irregu­larly
empanelled jury be annulled; it is not neces­sary for him to prove a prejudice;
there is a ""préjudice de droit""; as to this no doubt exists: R. v.
Churton[10],
Henry Williams[11],
R. v. Page[12].

In King v. Edmonds[13], at
p. 473, Abbott C.J. said:

It must further be observed, that the disallowing of a
challenge is a ground not for a new trial, but for what is strictly and
technically a venire de novo. The party complaining thereof applies to the
Court, not for the exercise of the sound and legal discretion of the judges,
but for the benefit of an imperative rule of law, and the improper granting, or
the improper refusing of a chal­lenge, is alike the foundation for a writ of
error.

What is the nature of the nullity which may be pleaded by an
accused who has been erroneously denied a peremptory challenge? Is it a
relative nullity which may only be pleaded by the accused, or an absolute
nullity that is not capable of ratifi­cation and may also be relied on by the
prosecution?

[Page 725]

The rights of peremptory challenge accorded the accused and the
prosecution are personal to each. The rights of the prosecution are independent
of those of the accused: the latter's exercise of his rights of peremptory
challenge are solely a matter for his discretion, subject to no control by the
prosecution and having no effect on the exercise of the latter's rights. The
right to challenge is not a right of selection. In Morin, cited above, Tas­chereau
J. said, at p. 451:

... The right of challenging is given to reject, not to select,
.. .

(See also R. v. Lalonde[14], at
p. 203; R. v. Elliott[15], at
p. 152.)

The prosecution may not complain about the fact that the accused
exercised, or failed to exer­cise, one of his rights of challenge: the
interests of the prosecution are not affected in either case. The reason why
the accused does not exercise a right of challenge matters little; whether it
is the decision of the accused or that of the judge, the situation of the
prosecution is in no way altered: it still retains its rights of challenge and
standby. If a juror is not acceptable to the prosecution, it should not rely on
the accused to challenge him: it must challenge him itself by exercising the
rights conferred on it by law.

In the case at bar, the prosecution did not object to either one
of the two decisions of the trial judge. When the judge denied the accused the
right to peremptorily challenge a juror who had been found impartial, counsel
for the prosecution remained silent; the juror was sworn without his asking him
to stand by or to challenge him, for cause or peremptorily. In total, sixteen
jurors were asked to stand by and none was challenged by the Crown, whether
peremptorily or for cause.

By thus abstaining from making this juror stand by, as it was
entitled to do, the prosecution in fact accepted him. The rights of the Crown
as to the empanelling of the jury were respected in every particular. The
prosecution may not complain that appellant's rights were violated for the
simple

[Page 726]

reason that the rights were purely personal, and moreover the
judge's error with respect to appel­lant was corrected by the verdict of
acquittal. If the accused wished to challenge this juror peremp­torily, this
was because he doubted the latter's impartiality; the verdict of acquittal
proved beyond any doubt that his fears were groundless (see, by analogy, Whelan
v. The Queen[16],
approved in McLean v. The King[17]).

In my opinion, therefore, the prosecution may not plead the
illegality of the decision of the trial judge who denied the accused the right
to peremp­torily challenge a juror after the latter had been found impartial by
the triers.

The prosecution also submitted that the trial was null and the
verdict of acquittal void because the judge allowed counsel for the accused to
ask a juror certain questions after the latter had been sworn.

The second prospective juror was challenged for cause by the
accused; the triers found him impar­tial; he was sworn. After the swearing,
counsel for the accused said the following:

[TRANSLATION] Your Lordship, as I just mentioned in my
colleague's presence in your chambers, I omitted to ask Mr. Fortier a question,
and if the Court gave me permission and my colleague agreed, I would like to be
able to ask Mr. Fortier certain further questions, in the presence of the two
(2) triers who were here earlier.

Counsel for the prosecution left the matter entirely up to the
judge, who observed as follows: 

[TRANSLATION] It is a little unusual, but I do not want to
cause anyone prejudice, and I will, if the two (2) triers are here, I will
allow it. [To the juror Fortier]: there are a couple of questions which Mr.
Fournier wants to ask you, two (2) or three (3) questions. [To the triers]:
there are two (2) or three (3) questions which Mr. Fournier wants to ask Mr.
Fortier. You recall his answers thus far, and you decided he was impartial.
Now, he wants to ask two (2) or three (3) questions.

The record does not indicate what were the questions the
prospective juror was asked. It indicates

[Page 727]

only that once the questions were asked, the triers again found
this juror to be impartial.

The trial judge undoubtedly erred in allowing these further
questions to the juror (R. v. Mah Hung[18]); however,
there is no basis for assuming that this error caused the prosecution any preju­dice,
or might have had some effect on the verdict of acquittal. This is not a valid
ground of complaint.

I therefore conclude that the verdict of acquittal should not be
set aside as a consequence of the irregularities which occurred in empanelling
the jury.

II

Consideration must now be given to the two reasons relied on by
the Court of Appeal to quash the verdict and order a new trial.

The first reason concerns the admissibility of certain exhibits
submitted as evidence by the prosecution.

The trial judge first refused to admit a docu­ment called
""Air Waybill"", relating to the dresser which contained the marijuna [sic]
which appellant was charged with importing. Mayrand J.A., speaking for the
court, said:

[TRANSLATION] ... The air waybill could have estab­lished
the route taken by the incriminating package from Bogota in Colombia to Dorval
in Canada; it could also have proven that its weight at the point of shipment
corresponded to its weight at the point of arrival at Dorval, so that the
entire contents would have had to cross the frontier. This was important
evidence since, in his charge to the jury, the judge reminded them that they
must ask themselves whether the marijuana was put into the package after it had
entered Canada.

The trial judge refused to admit this document (Exhibit P-O-1),
observing:

[TRANSLATION] On the question of the introduction of P-O-1,
I have decided in all the circumstances, including the absence of notice, the
fact that it is a copy, the fact

[Page 728]

that it is definitely incomplete, to ALLOW THE OBJECTION.

The Court of Appeal took the view that this decision was in
error; Mayrand J.A. said only: 

[TRANSLATION] ... In my opinion, the introduction of the air
waybill should have been allowed:

Re Martin and The Queen (1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d)
224 (Ont. High Court).

With respect, I should say at once that Martin[19]
does not seem to apply to the case at bar; the questions it raised
regarding the admissibility of an air waybill were quite different from those
raised in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.

Here, there is no dispute that a waybill is ""a record made
in the usual and ordinary course of business"", the admissibility of which
is governed by s. 30  of the Canada Evidence Act  (R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10).
The only question is whether the relevant provisions of this section were
complied with.

Appellant argued, first, that Exhibit P-O-1 was inadmissible in
evidence because it was not an original but a copy, and the copy was not accom­panied
by the affidavit required by s. 30(3) of the Act.

The air waybill which respondent thus sought to introduce in
evidence is governed by the Carriage by Air Act  (R.S.C. 1970, c. C-14)
and its Schedules. Article 6 of Schedule I reads in part as follows:

(1) The air waybill shall be made out by the consign—or in
three original parts and be handed over with the cargo.

(2) The first part shall be marked ""for the
carrier"", and shall be signed by the consignor. The second part shall be
marked ""for the consignee""; it shall be signed by the consignor and
by the carrier and shall accompany the cargo. The third part shall be signed by
the carrier and handed by him to the consignor after the cargo has been
accepted.

Article 8 of the same Schedule prescribes the nature of the
information which must appear in

[Page 729]

the bill, and Article 11 deals with the evidentiary value of an
air waybill:

Article 11

(1) The air waybill is prima facie evidence of the
conclusion of the contract, of the receipt of the cargo and of the conditions
of carriage.

(2) The statements in the air waybill relating to the
weight, dimensions and packing of the cargo, as well as those relating to the
number of packages, are prima facie evidence of the facts stated; those
relating to the quantity, volume and condition of the cargo do not constitute evidence
against the carrier except so far as they both have been, and are stated in the
air waybill to have been, checked by him in the presence of the consignor, or
relate to the apparent condition of the cargo.

Article 6 indicates that a waybill consists of three original
copies; there may undoubtedly be additional copies (Article 8(n)), but they are
copies which do not per se have the weight which Article 11 attributes
to each of the three originals.

The document which the trial judge refused to allow to be
produced bore on its face the statement:

Copies 1, 2 and 3 of this Air Waybill are originals and have
the same validity.

Right at the bottom of the face of the document, it states:

COPY 4 (DELIVERY RECEIPT)

The back of the document bears the following form, which has been
left blank:

Received in good order and condition at__________on__________

(SIGNATURE OF CONSIGNEE OR HIS AGENT)

It seems clear that Exhibit P-O-1 is not one of the three
original copies of a waybill referred to by Article 6, quoted above; it is a
copy of a waybill which was intended, when duly completed, to be used as an
original delivery receipt.

[Page 730]

In my opinion, therefore, Exhibit P-O-1 could not be admitted in
evidence unless accompanied by the affidavit prescribed in s. 30(3)  of the Canada
Evidence Act . In view of this conclusion, there is no need for me to
express an opinion on the other arguments put forward by appellant against the
introduction of this exhibit.

The trial judge also refused to admit in evidence certain other
exhibits tending to establish that the accused was a user of marijuana.

In a search made of the accused's home before his arrest, the
prosecution seized a number of items: these included, inter alia, a manuscript
in which the accused extolled the virtues of marijua­na, a metric scale, a
cigarette butt made of a green vegetable substance, tweezers and three pipes.

The trial judge allowed all these exhibits to be presented. He
also allowed the prosecution to prove that the cigarette butt and one of the pipes
gave off an odour of cannabis. The uncontradicted evidence disclosed in
addition that these items (metric scale, tweezers and pipes) are of the type
that is ordinarily found in the possession of marijuana users. However, the
trial judge did not allow the introduction of certificates of analysis which
would have established beyond any question that the cigarette butt was made of
marijuana and that the pipes had been used to smoke this drug, traces of which
were also found on the tweezers and the metric scale. The judge also refused to
admit a glass jar containing a green substance, which had been seized at the accused's
home in the aforementioned search, and the certificate of anal­ysis
establishing that this substance was marijua­na.

The general rule as to the admissibility of evi­dence is that it
must be relevant. This principle is stated as follows in Halsbury's Laws of
England, 4th ed. vol. 17, para. 5, at p. 7:

The prime requirement of anything sought to be admit­ted in
evidence is that it is of sufficient relevance. What is relevant (namely what
goes to the proof or disproof of a matter in issue) will be decided by logic
and human experience, and facts may be proved directly or circum­stantially.
But while no matter should be proved which

[Page 731]

is not relevant, some things which are relevant by the
normal tests of logic may not be proved because of exclusionary rules of
evidence. Such matters are inad­missible. Admissible evidence is thus that
which is (1) relevant and (2) not excluded by any rule of law or practice. It
may be that an item of evidence is admis­sible on one ground and inadmissible
on others; if so, it will be admitted. Evidence may also be admissible for one
purpose and not for another.

For one fact to be relevant to another, there must be a
connection or nexus between the two which makes it possible to infer the
existence of one from the existence of the other. One fact is not relevant to
another if it does not have real proba­tive value with respect to the latter
(Cross, On Evidence, 4th ed., at p. 16).

Thus, apart from certain exceptions which are not applicable
here, evidence is not admissible if its only purpose is to prove that the
accused is the type of man who is more likely to commit a crime of the kind
with which he is charged; such evi­dence is viewed as having no real probative
value with regard to the specific crime attributed to the accused: there is no
sufficient logical connection between the one and the other.

In Boyle and Merchant[20], Lord
Reading C.J. said, at p. 193:

There is, as is apparent from a consideration of the
authorities, an essential difference between evidence tending to shew generally
that the accused has a fraudu­lent or dishonest mind, which evidence is not
admissible, and evidence tending to shew that he had a fraudulent or dishonest
mind in the particular transaction, the subject-matter of the charge being then
investigated, which evidence is admissible. It has been laid down that to make
such evidence admissible there must be a nexus or connection between the act
charged and the facts relating to previous or subsequent transactions which it
is sought to give in evidence.

More recently, in Noor Mohamed v. The King[21],
Lord du Parcq wrote, at p. 192:

[Page 732]

There can be little doubt that the manner of Ayesha's death,
even without the evidence as to the death of Gooriah, would arouse suspicion
against the appellant in the mind of a reasonable man. The facts proved as to
the death of Gooriah would certainly tend to deepen that suspicion, and might
well tilt the balance against the accused in the estimation of a jury. It by no
means follows that this evidence ought to be admitted. If an examination of it
shows that it is impressive just because it appears to demonstrate, in the
words of Lord Her­schell in Makin's case ([1918] A.C. 221, 236)
""that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or
character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried"", and
if it is otherwise of no real substance, then it was certainly wrongly admitted.

In R. v. Barbour[22], Duff
C.J., speaking for the majority, at p. 467 expressly approved a passage from
the reasons of Kennedy J. in Bond[23], in
which the latter stated that evidence must always be ""strictly relevant to
the particular charge and have no reference to any conduct of the prisoner
unconnected with such charge"".

Finally, in Boardman v. D.P.P.[24],
Lord Salmon said at pp. 912 and 913:

My Lords, evidence against an accused which tends only to
show that he is a man of bad character with a disposition to commit crimes,
even the crime with which he is charged, is inadmissible and deemed to be
irrele­vant in English law.

…

... The test must be—is the evidence capable of tending to
persuade a reasonable jury of the accused's guilt on some ground other than his
bad character and disposi­tion to commit the sort of crime with which he is
charged?

This rule of relevance applies to all kinds of evidence: it
covers evidence relating to items found in the accused's possession just as
much as written or testimonial evidence. In Thompson v. The King[25],
which involved a charge of gross indecency,

[Page 733]

Lord Sumner said at pp. 235 and 236:

My Lords, if the person who committed the offence had,
either by word or conduct, established any connec­tion between what passed on that
occasion and the photographs themselves, their admissibility, found as they
were so soon afterwards, would present no difficul­ty. If, on the other hand,
there had been nothing to show a propensity in the criminal to the practice of
such acts, such as the making of the appointment, I should have thought that
the photographs were merely objects going to the accused's bad character and
not to his identity with the criminal in the particular case. I certainly do
not think it could be held that, as a matter of course, even in the case of
crimes of this class, the articles found in a man's possession, not as parts of
the transaction which is being inquired into, but at a separate time and place,
could, as such, be put in evidence against him merely because they were such as
criminals possess or use, and in the absence of any circumstance in the crime
tending to show a specific connection between it and the articles in question.
If a man could be convicted of a particular burglary, in which it was clear
that no tools had been used at all, merely because at another place and time
burglar's implements were found on his prem­ises, it is difficult to see what
limit could be put to the admissibility of general evidence of bad character,
and the fact that evidence of articles found on the premises of accused persons
is constantly given without much question, though I doubt not in the vast
majority of cases quite rightly, is really only misleading, unless at the same
time we ask the question what exactly does this purport to prove and by what
probative nexus does it seek to prove it.

The relevance of a fact that is sought to be introduced in
evidence must of course be determined in accordance with the nature of the case
and the various questions at issue.

In the case at bar, what is the relevance of the evidence the
admissibility of which is at issue?

In his reasons Mayrand J.A. observed, first, that the exhibits
should have been admitted [TRANSLA­TION] ""to establish the accused's
guilty intent"".

Mens rea is an essential aspect of the crime
attributed to the accused. The prosecution cannot therefore be content with
proving only the impor­tation of the dresser; this occurred in normal circumstances

[Page 734]

which did not suggest that it contained a foreign substance. The
prosecution also had to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that, to the accused's
knowledge, this dresser contained a nar­cotic when it was imported (Beaver
v. The Queen[26], at
p. 540; R. v. Boyer[27], at
p. 141; R. v. Blondin[28], at
pp. 120, 122 and 123).

To establish this guilty knowledge on the part of the accused,
the prosecution sought to prove that the accused himself used marijuana; this
was why it wished to introduce the items seized at the accused's home; counsel
for the prosecution said at the trial:

[TRANSLATION] What I want to prove, your Lordship, is the
presence in the accused's home of substances, of articles, of notes,
which imply two things: (1) mens rea, (2) the accused's interest in
importing, the interest he may have.

The question to be resolved in the case at bar is whether the
fact that the accused uses marijuana creates a logical inference that he knew
or ought to have known that the dresser contained a narcotic at the time it was
imported. To me there is no connection or nexus between either of these two
facts. The use of marijuana by the accused cer­tainly established that he knew
of this narcotic, that he was in a position to identify it, but it had no
probative value in relation to the guilty knowl­edge which must be proven by
the prosecution. The evidence that the prosecution sought to introduce can have
only one effect: that of raising suspicions against the accused solely for the
reason that a marijuana user is more likely to import the substance illegally
than someone who does not use the narcotic. In my view, this is precisely the
type of evidence which cannot be admitted.

This is a case for the application of the rule in Rance and
Herron[29], at
p. 121, regarding similar fact evidence, which was recently approved in

[Page 735]

Scarrott[30], at
p. 129:

... The gist of what is being said both by Lord Cross and by
Lord Salmon is that evidence is admissible as similar fact evidence if, but
only if, it goes beyond showing a tendency to commit crimes of this kind and is
positively probative in regard to the crime now charged. That, we think, is the
test which we have to apply on the question of the correctness or otherwise of
the admission of the similar fact evidence in this case.

Nor should this evidence be admitted because it may disclose the
interest of the accused in the importation. Proof of the motive for a crime is
generally admitted as circumstantial evidence: in his Textbook of Criminal
Law, Glanville Williams writes at p. 56:

The prosecution may prove a motive for the crime if it helps
them to establish their case, as a matter of circum­stantial evidence; but they
are not legally bound to prove motive, because a ""motiveless"" crime
is still a crime.

However, I think it is clear that evidence as to the accused's
motive cannot be admitted if it is not relevant, that is, if it does not
disclose a sufficient­ly close logical connection between the facts that are to
be proven as a motive and the crime com­mitted. Proof of the accused's motive
cannot be a means of circumventing the application of the rules of evidence
regarding relevance and similar acts.

In Barbour, cited above, Duff C.J. wrote at p. 469:

If you have acts seriously tending, when reasonably viewed,
to establish motive for the commission of a crime, then there can be no doubt
that such evidence is admissible, not merely to prove intent, but to prove the
fact as well. But I think, with the greatest possible respect, it is rather
important that the courts should not slip into a habit of admitting evidence
which, reasonably viewed, cannot tend to prove motive or to explain the acts
charged merely because it discloses some incident in the history of the
relations of the parties.

[Page 736]

In the case at bar, I do not think it can be said that the use of
marijuana by appellant is in itself a fact ""seriously tending, when
reasonably viewed, to establish motive for the commission"" of the crime of
importation with which he is charged.

In support of its decision, the Court of Appeal referred to its
finding in Levac[31]; Mayrand
J.A. observed:

[TRANSLATION] In Levac v. The Queen (C.A.M. 10-000030-73,
judgment dated June 2, 1975), appellant relied as a ground of appeal on the
fact that the trial judge had authorized the introduction of a scale, a pipe
and other items found at the home of the appellant charged with importing the
narcotic. This Court dismissed the appeal. Owen J.A., whose opinion was con­curred
in by his brother judges, said:

""In order to prove the offence charged, the Crown had
to establish in addition to the importation of the cylinders containing
marihuana a guilty knowledge on the part of Levac. A party having no knowledge
of narcotics or of the drug scene might innocently accept $450 from a virtual
stranger in order to clear through customs a shipment from Jamaica of two metal
cylin­ders purportedly coming into this country for the purpose of being
repaired. A person possessing a balance that had been used for weighing
marihuana, a small quantity of marihuana, and a pipe that had been used to
smoke ""resine de cannabis"" and who in explaining his possession
admitted being a user of marihuana would not be as likely to do so innocently.

I agree with the presiding judge that in this particular
case the exhibits and the evidence showing that Levac used marihuana was
relevant to an essential element in the charge against Levac namely the guilty
knowl­edge in connection with actual importation of the cylinders containing
marihuana.""

If this Court held in the aforementioned case that the
evidence was properly admitted, I must conclude in the case at bar that the
same evidence should be admitted.

The very wording of the reasons of Owen J.A. indicated that the
decision in Levac depended on the particular circumstances of the case:
Owen J.A. expressly stated, ""I agree with the presiding Judge that in
this particular case the exhibits and the evidence ... was relevant to an
essential element

[Page 737]

in the charge against Levac, ..."". The deci­sion in Levac
should therefore not be given a general application which it does not
warrant.

The other ground relied on by the Court of Appeal was that the
evidence at issue could also have been used to [TRANSLATION] ""cast doubt
on the hypothesis that he [the accused] was the inno­cent victim of an
importation orchestrated by other persons"".

This second ground does not appear to me to have any more
validity than the first one. The accused called no witnesses in his defence;
nothing in the cross-examination of the prosecution wit­nesses suggests that
the accused intended to argue that he did not know what marijuana was and could
not identify it. This is not a situation where the prosecution may try to rebut
a possible defence; rather, it must try to prove one of the essential elements
of the crime attributed to the accused: guilty knowledge (see Thompson v.
The King[32], per
Lord Sumner, at p. 232; Noor Mohamed v. The King, supra, per Lord du Parcq,
at pp. 191 et seq.).

I therefore conclude that the trial judge properly refused to
admit in evidence the exhibits in question.

III

I now come to the last argument approved by the Court of Appeal,
the insufficiency of the judge's charge to the jury: he allegedly failed to
explain to the jury the scope of paras. (b) and (c) of s. 21  of the Criminal
Code , regarding the parties to an offence.

Following the judge's charge to the jury and in the latter's
absence, counsel for the prosecution suggested that the judge should comment on
s. 21  Cr. C.:

[TRANSLATION]

IN THE ABSENCE OF THE JURORS

BY MR YVON ROBERGE COUNSEL FOR THE CROWN

Your Lordship, if I might respectfully suggest that you
address the jury concerning the parties to an offence, concerning section
twenty-one (21).

[Page 738]

You mentioned the accused was charged with having
imported-if you are persuaded that he did import. Clearly, there is no evidence
that the accused cleared the customs, so I feel it is essential for the jury to
know that a person can be found guilty according to whether he commits the act,
aids someone in committing it, or prevents someone from committing it.

BY THE COURT

I thought of that, but I do not think section twenty-one
(21) enters into this case. Your evidence was presented to show that it was
him, you tried to prove that he imported the thing. Two (2) persons were not
involved.

BY MR YVON ROBERGE COUNSEL FOR THE PROSECU­TION

That is correct .. .

The Court of Appeal was of a different view: Mayrand J.A. said:

[TRANSLATION] With respect, I feel that the suggestion by
counsel for the Crown was apt, and that the explana­tions requested were
necessary to dispel any possible ambiguity.

I do not agree. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that
appellant might have aided anyone in committing the offence with which he is
charged; on the contrary, all the evidence of the prosecution is designed to
show that the narcotic was imported by appellant himself. The trial judge must
instruct the jury on the rules of law raised by the trial as it unfolds before
him; he is not required to make theoretical statements on points of law which
do not arise in the case.

I therefore conclude that the trial judge did not err when he
refused to explain to the jury the scope of paras. (b) and (c) of s. 21(1) Cr.
C.

For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be
allowed, the decision of the Court of Appeal set aside and the verdict of
acquittal returned in favour of appellant restored.

The judgment of Martland and Pigeon JJ. was delivered by

PIGEON J. (dissenting)-I have had the advan­tage of
reading the reasons of Pratte J. I am in full

[Page 739]

agreement on the question of the selection of the jury, but I
differ on the two points upheld by the Court of Appeal and on which, in my
opinion, the latter made no error.

With regard to the air waybill, the trial judge, it seems to me,
was wrong in saying:

[TRANSLATION] On the question of the introduction of P-O-1,
I have decided in all the circumstances, including the absence of notice, the
fact that it is a copy, the fact that it is not quite complete, to SUSTAIN THE
OBJECTION.

So far as the absence of notice is concerned, it should be
noted that the document was filed at the preliminary inquiry. The accused was
therefore perfectly aware of this evidence and, in these circumstances, the
absence of notice was merely a procedural irregularity concerning which the
trial judge had no good reason not to use the discretion conferred on him by
subs. 7 of section 30  of the Canada Evidence Act , from which I find it
conven­ient to quote at once subss. 1, 3, 7 and 1], together with the first
three paragraphs of subs. 12:

30. (1) Where oral evidence in respect of a matter would be
admissible in a legal proceeding, a record made in the usual and ordinary
course of business that contains information in respect of that matter is admis­sible
in evidence under this section in the legal proceed­ing upon production of the
record.

(3) Where it is not possible or reasonably praticable to
produce any record described in subsection (1) or (2), a copy of the record
accompanied by an affidavit setting out the reasons why it is not possible or
reasonably practicable to produce the record and an affidavit of the person who
made the copy setting out the source from which the copy was made and attesting
to its authentici­ty, each affidavit having been sworn before a commis­sioner
or other person authorized to take affidavits, is admissible in evidence under
this section in the same manner as if it were the original of such record.

(7) Unless the court orders otherwise, no record or
affidavit shall be received in evidence under this section unless the party
producing the record or affidavit has, at least seven days before its
production, given notice of his intention to produce it to each other party to
the legal

[Page 740]

proceeding and has, within five days after receiving any
notice in that behalf given by any such party, produced it for inspection by
such party.

(11) The provisions of this section shall be deemed to be in
addition to and not in derogation of

(a) any other provision of this or any other Act of the
Parliament of Canada respecting the admissibility in evidence of any record or the
proof of any matter, or

(b) any existing rule of law under which any record is
admissible in evidence or any matter may be proved.

(12) In this section

""business"" means any business, profession, trade,
call­ing, manufacture or undertaking of any kind carried on in Canada or
elsewhere whether for profit or otherwise, including any activity or operation
carried on or performed in Canada or elsewhere by any government, by any
department, branch, board, com­mission or agency of any government, by any
court or other tribunal or by any other body or authority performing a function
of government;

""copy"", in relation to any record, includes a
print, whether enlarged or not, from photographic film of such record, and
""photographic film"" includes a photographic plate, microphotographic
film or photo-static negative;

""record"" includes the whole or any part of any
book, document, paper, card, tape or other thing on or in which information is
written, recorded, stored or reproduced, and, except for the purposes of subsec­tions
(3) and (4), any copy or transcript received in evidence under this section
pursuant to subsection (3) or (4).

The important question is as to the legal nature of the document
in question. This record is a copy of the air waybill, intended for use as the
delivery receipt for the goods, and to remain in the posses­sion of the air
carrier taking them to their destina­tion. On its face the document bears the
following indications:

[Page 741]

Copies 1, 2 and 3 of this Air Waybill are originals and have
the same validity.

COPY 4 (DELIVERY RECEIPT)

On the rear there is the following formula, which is still blank:

Received in good order and condition at__________on__________
.

(SIGNATURE OF CONSIGNEE OR HIS AGENT)

This document was kept by the air carrier in some kind of binder
and, for this, two perforations were made in it, it is on account of those
perfora­tions that the trial judge said it was not quite complete. This
certainly was not a valid reason for refusing to admit the document. The
exhibit was not a document in the possession of a party to a civil proceeding
and which had been mutilated by that party. It was an exhibit in the possession
of a third party which the Crown required to make its case. Mutilated documents
are every day received in evidence in criminal proceedings for whatever
probative value they may have in the light of the rest of the evidence.

The only question that remains, then, is whether this was really
a copy. In my opinion, such was not the case. This is not a dispute between a
consignee and a carrier. The Crown is not a person claiming rights under an air
waybill; but, in my view, it is only towards such a person that only copies 1,
2 and 3 of the bill are originals. The case at bar is a criminal prosecution
for the illegal importation of drugs, and the question is not whether the
exhibit is the original of the air waybill, but whether it is, within the
meaning of subs. 30(1), ""a record made in the usual and ordinary course of
business that contains information in respect of [a] matter"" (in the
French version a ""chose"") oral evidence of which is admissible.

In order to answer this question reference must be made to the
above quoted definitions of ""busi­ness"", ""copy"" and
""record"". In my view, it appears

[Page 742]

from these definitions that the document clearly is a record made
in the usual course of the air carrier's business, as it is a part of its
register of delivery receipts, consisting of the collection of No. 4 copies of
waybills bound together. It is undoubt­edly the original of this register, not
a reproduction thereof which would be a ""copy"" within the mean­ing of
the definition. In this connection, I should point out that the definition of
""record"" includes any part thereof.

In my opinion, therefore, the Court of Appeal correctly held that
the trial judge had erred in refusing to allow in evidence the delivery receipt
being copy No. 4 of the air waybill. It is true that there is no signature on
this delivery receipt, but in criminal proceedings such a defect cannot operate
as a bar to the admission of such evidence: justice cannot be permitted to be
frustrated by the devices of smugglers.

On the other point I wish to deal with, Mayrand J.A. stated the
reasons for the decision of the Court of Appeal in the following terms:

[TRANSLATION] In my opinion the introduction of a pot
containing a green substance found at respondent's home and of the certificate
of analysis tending to show that the contents were marijuana should have been
authorized, like the introduction of pipes, a scale and literature on
marijuana. The certificate of analysis and the various aforementioned items
found at respondent's home constituted evidence capable of establishing the accused's
guilty intent and casting doubt on the argu­ment that he was the innocent
victim of an importation arranged by other persons.

In Levac v. The Queen (C.A.M. 10-000030-73, a
judgment dated June 2, 1975), appellant relied as a ground of appeal on the
fact that the trial judge had authorized the introduction in evidence of a scale,
a pipe and other items found at the home of the appellant charged with
importing the narcotic. This Court dismissed the appeal. Owen J.A., whose
opinion was con­curred in by his brother judges, said:

""In order to prove the offence charged, the Crown had
to establish in addition to the importation of the cylinders containing
marihuana a guilty knowledge on the part of Levac. A party having no knowledge
of narcotics or of the drug scene might innocently accept $450 from a virtual
stranger in order to clear through customs a shipment from Jamaica of two metal
cylin­ders purportedly coming into this country for the

[Page 743]

purpose of being repaired. A person possessing a balance
that had been used for weighing marihuana, a small quantity of marihuana, and a
pipe that had been used to smoke ""resine de cannabis"" and who in
explaining his possession admitted being a user of marihuana would not be as
likely to do so innocently.I agree with the presiding judge that in this
particular case the exhibits and the evidence showing that Levac used marihuana
was relevant to an essential element in the charge against Levac namely the
guilty knowl­edge in connection with actual importation of the cylinders
containing marihuana.""

In Baker v. The King[33], a
unanimous decision delivered by Duff J., the statement made by Lord Sumner on
the admissibility of evidence in Thompson[34] was
adopted. The rule was there stated as follows in the last quoted sentence (at
p. 102):

There must be something to connect the circumstance tendered
in evidence, not only with the accused, but with his participation in the
crime.

I think it is appropriate to cite some cases in which this rule
appears to have been applied in the same way as the Court of Appeal of Quebec
did in the case at bar.

In R. v. Gaich[35], the
accused was appealing a conviction for fraudulently endorsing and cashing a cheque.
The 7th and 8th grounds of appeal read as follows:

7. The learned Trial Judge erred in admitting evi­dence that
I was, at the time of my arrest, in possession of a number of cheque forms of
certain banks other than the Royal Bank at Burlington, and drawing therefrom
inference of guilt.""

8. The learned Trial Judge erred in admitting evi­dence that
I was, at the time of my arrest, in possession of a list of banks in the City
of Hamilton, and drawing therefrom inference of guilt.""

Mackay J. stated the unanimous opinion, rejecting those grounds,
in the following terms:

... With respect to grounds 7 and 8, the admissibility of
evidence depends upon its character and not upon its weight: McLaren v.
Canadian Central Railway (1884),

[Page 744]

C.R. [14] A.C. 259, 21 C.L.J. 114 at 117 (sub
nom. Canadian Central Railway Co. v. McLaren) (P.C.). If the
particular piece of evidence is reasonably relevant and not obnoxious to any
exclusionary rule, it is admis­sible although its weight may not be very great:
Rogers

v. London and Canadian Loan and Agency Company,

Limited (1908), 18 O.L.R. 8.

An evidentiary fact is admissible if the conclusion
contended for is one which is fairly and reasonably probable. It need not be
the only conclusion possible: see Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed. 1940, sec. 38
(vol. 1, p. 428).

Viscount Reading C.J. said in Rex v. Thompson, [1917]
2 K.B. 630 at 632: ""The general rule is that the evidence tendered must be
relevant to the charge for which the accused is being tried. If the evidence
merely proves, or tends to prove, that the accused is of such evil character or
disposition that he is likely to have commit­ted the offence charged against
him, it is irrelevant and is inadmissible. If it tends to prove that the
accused committed the crime charged against him, it is relevant and admissible,
notwithstanding that incidentally it may also prove, or tend to prove, that the
accused is a person of criminal or immoral character or disposition."" He
referred to Regina v. Ollis, [1900] 2 Q.B. 758 at 781‑782;
Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57, and Rex
v. Ball and Ball, [1911] A.C. 47.

It is, of course, clear that evidence would not neces­sarily
be admissible of everything found in the posses­sion of an accused. In the
words of Viscount Reading in Rex v. Thompson, supra at p. 634: ""For
instance, if a burglarious implement was found upon him, it could not be given
in evidence against him upon a charge of committing acts of gross indecency; it
would have no relevance to the issue, and would merely tend to show that he was
a person of bad character. But upon a trial for burglary the finding of a
burglarious implement upon him would clearly be evidence against him ...""

The Court is of opinion that the array of blank cheques and
a sheet of paper on which was written a list of banks, although perhaps of
little evidentiary value, are admissible as being relevant to the issue. Under
the circumstances the Court cannot see that it was irrele­vant to the issue
that several of such documents neces­sary and essential to such an illegal
enterprise were found on the person and property of the appellant.

[Page 745]

In R. v. Hannam[36], the
principal question before the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia was stated as
follows (at p. 343):

... Evidence was admitted of a paper found in a wallet in
the possession of Michaud, the other accused. This paper contained a list of
business establishments in the Halifax-Dartmouth metropolitan area including
the Shearwater Post Office, MacCulloch's (Halifax) Lim­ited, Canadian Legion
Scotia Branch, Cunard Street, Halifax, a line being drawn through each of these
names.

Evidence was also tendered that premises where these three
organizations conducted their affairs had been victims of breaks-Shearwater
Post Office on March 16, 1963, MacCulloch's (Halifax) Limited on March 14,
1963, and the Canadian Legion on March 16, 1963.

The question is whether this list, although admissible
against Michaud, is admissible against the appellant Hannam.

He contends that its admission resulted in very pre-judicial
material reaching the jury to his detriment.

Having thus formulated the question, cited vari­ous cases
and summarized part of the evidence, Coffin J.A. gave the unanimous opinion in
these words:

This mass of material is evidence that both Hannam and
Michaud were in the vicinity of this Works Department Building in a comparative
brief compass of time in the early morning in question and that they were there
because they were engaged in some common enterprise. Thus there is evidence of
a design which makes the list in question relevant, and admissible.

In R. v. Sims[37], Lord
Goddard C.J.A., said inter alia (at pp. 537 and 538):

... Evidence is not to be excluded merely because it tends
to show the accused to be of a bad disposition, but only if it shows nothing
more. There are many cases where evidence of specific acts or circumstances con­necting
the accused with specific features of the crime has been held admissible, even
though it also tends to show him to be of bad disposition. The most familiar
example is when there is an issue whether the act of the accused was designed
or accidental or done with guilty knowledge, in which case evidence is admissible
of a series of similar acts by the accused on other occasions,

[Page 746]

because a series of acts with the self-same characteris­tics
is unlikely to be produced by accident or inadvert­ence: see Makin v.
Attorney-General South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57, 65. ... A similar distinction
exists in respect of articles found in possession of the accused. If they have
no connexion with the crime except to show that the accused has a bad
disposition, the evidence is not admissible; but if there are any circumstances
in the crime tending to show a specific connexion between it and the articles,
the evidence is admissible; see per Lord Sumner in Thompson v. Rex, [1918]
A.C. 234. Thus, in the case of burglary, evidence is admissible that
house-breaking implements such as might have been used in the crime were found
in the possession of the accused. In the case of abortion, evidence is
admissible that the apparatus of an abortionist such as might have been used in
the crime was found in the possession of the accused. The admissibility does
not, however, depend on the circumstance that the articles might have been used
in the crime. If there is any other specific feature connecting the articles
with the crime, it will suffice.

In George Albert Gillingham[38], the
Court of Criminal Appeal affirmed the following decision of the trial judge
admitting some obscene post-cards as evidence on a charge of gross indecency
(at pp. 143 and 144):

""Evidence of their possession is not admissible, in my
opinion, merely to indicate the fact that [the appellant] had a dirty mind; but
if I can properly come to the conclusion that they are the sort of things which
might well be used by a person who is guilty of such an offence as this, as an
adjunct, some assistance in the commission of that offence, then I think that,
under the doctrine laid down by Darling, J., in the case of Twiss (13 Cr. App.
R. 17; [1918] 2 K.B. 853), they would be admissible here. In my view, those are
things which a man who was guilty of an offence like this might well have about
him, and might well use as an adjunct to assist him in the commission of this
crime. How? By using them to inflame the passions of the person with whom he
intended or designed to commit this crime, or to rouse his own passions for
such a purpose.""

To justify the introduction of the material in question here
Crown counsel said at trial:

[TRANSLATION] What I want to prove, your Lordship, is the
presence in the accused's home of substances, of articles, of notes, which
imply two things: (1) means rea;

[Page 747]

 (2) the accused's interest in importing, the interest he
may have.

In my opinion, the two reasons cited were valid.

It is clear that, in cases of this kind, the guilty intent
ordinarily cannot be established by direct evidence, and it is therefore
necessary to admit in evidence every bit of circumstantial evidence. In the
case at bar, I find a clear connection between the fact that the accused was a
user of a prohibited narcotic and the presence of a quantity of that narcotic
concealed in a piece of furniture that was imported from a country in which
this narcotic is produced. As can be seen from the various cases cited, it is
not necessary for the admission of circumstantial evidence that the connection
be­tween the guilty intent and the evidence in ques­tion be conclusive.
Provided there is some connec­tion, such evidence must be admitted for what it
is worth. Moreover, as this Court has recently held in R. v. Cooper[39],
it is not necessary that circumstan­tial evidence of guilty intent be such
as to exclude any other rational hypothesis.

With regard to the second reason put forward by Crown counsel,
what he called the ""interest"" which the accused had in the
importation, this was clearly what is usually called his motive, as distin­guished
from intent. If the accused really was a marijuana user, his motive in
importing it was obvious: to satisfy his desire. In my opinion this second
reason is conclusive of the admissibility in evidence of anything tending to
show that the accused did use marijuana. In Smith & Hogan's Criminal Law
(4th ed.) I read at p. 64:

As evidence, motive is always relevant. This means
simply that, if the prosecution can prove that D had a motive for committing
the crime, they may do so since the existence of a motive makes it more likely
that D in fact did commit it. Men do not usually act without a motive.

I will refrain from reviewing the case law in support of this
statement because it appears to

[Page 748]

stand unchallenged. In my view, even if this were the only reason
for admitting the evidence in ques­tion, it would suffice to justify the
decision of the Court of Appeal on the point.

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

BEETZ J. (dissenting)-I concur in the reasons of Pratte J.,
except as to the admissibility of evidence of the air waybill: on this point, I
share the view of Pigeon J.

Although the Court of Appeal does not say so in its judgment, I
must assume that it considered whether the verdict would necessarily have been
the same in the event that the trial judge had committed no error (Vézeau v.
The Queen[40]) and
that the Court implicitly concluded that it would not. However, not counting
the irregularities in the selection of the jury, the Court of Appeal attributed
two errors to the trial judge, whereas I am of the opinion that he only made
one: he refused to admit in evidence the air waybill tending to estab­lish that
the twenty pounds of cannabis were imported into Canada. The record contains
other evidence of such importation, in addition to the air waybill. In order to
decide whether the setting aside of the acquittal should be upheld, therefore,
the weight of this other evidence should be assessed. In such circumstances, I
would return the case to the Court of Appeal for it to decide whether there
should be a new trial because the verdict would not necessarily have been the
same in the event that the trial judge had admitted the air waybill in
evidence.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Jury trial—Possession of
weapons—“Dangerous to the public peace”—Judge’s charge to jury—Further charge
in response to question—Judge’s reference to factual situations from decided
cases—Whether charge proper.

Appellant was convicted before a County Court
Judge and jury of three counts of possession of a weapon for a purpose
dangerous to the public peace and one count of possession of restricted weapon
for which no registration certificate had been issued. His subsequent appeal
was dismissed without recorded reasons. A search of appellant’s residence had
disclosed certain weapons viz. a loaded 12 gauge double barrel shotgun
in a closet just outside the master bedroom; a loaded double barrel shotgun in
the garage. That same day a tenant of the Stavroff family in other premises
gave the police two boxes containing ammunition and a pistol. A few days later,
he gave the police another pistol. These articles were said to have been given to
him by the appellant some months earlier to be kept by him. Appellant was
present during the search of his residence and on the discovery of the shotgun
near the bedroom said that he had enemies and needed the gun for his
protection. The police also found dynamite, wires and a blasting cap in the
basement and some large amounts of currency in plastic bags concealed in the
garden. There was other evidence to the effect that the appellant was engaged
in a large way in street money lending (loan sharking) and that he wanted out
of that activity.

After the jury had retired the foreman sent a
question to the judge asking clarification of the phrase ‘dangerous to the
public peace’ with particular reference to its application within the confines
of a person’s home. The judge advised counsel that he proposed to answer the
query by referring to factual situations drawn from decided cases and no
objection was then taken. After the

[Page 412]

judge had dealt with the question the jury
again retired and returned with its verdict a few minutes later.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

It is for the jury alone to find the facts
upon the evidence adduced. The judge has the sole responsibility for the law,
and in making his explanation of the law he may refer to illustrations to
assist the jury but the judge must not in so doing take from the jury the right
to form their own conclusion on fact. The question here was whether the judge’s
response to the jury’s request produced that result. The judge’s charge when
read as a whole was, until the question was raised by the jury, unassailable.
The course adopted as to the answer to that question was however unfortunate.
It would have been wiser to repeat the charge earlier given, or to give a
further charge in general terms explaining his earlier remarks with particular
reference to the question. It does not follow, however, that he made a
reversible error. Each case must be considered on its own facts and
consideration must be given to the influence the words used by the trial judge
had or could have had upon the jury. Here the judge provided illustrations—in
which no error of law appears—of circumstances where the possession of weapons
in a private dwelling place did not preclude a finding of a purpose dangerous
to the public peace. The effect of the charge taken as a whole made it clear
that the case references were merely illustrative.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal
for Ontario dismissing without
recorded reasons an appeal from conviction by County Court Judge and jury on
three counts of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace and one count of possession of a restricted weapon for which no
registration certificate had been issued. Appeal dismissed.

[Page 413]

Allan Mintz, for the appellant.

E.G. Hachborn, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—This is an appeal from the Court of
Appeal for the Province of
Ontario which dismissed without written or recorded reason an appeal from
conviction upon three counts of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous
to the public peace and one count of possession of a restricted weapon for
which no registration certificate had been issued. The convictions were made
after trial before a County Court Judge and jury. Two other counts of similar
nature were dismissed. The four counts upon which convictions were recorded are
reproduced hereunder:

1. LOUIS STAVROFF stands charged that he on
or about the 27th day of March in the year 1975, at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, had in his possession a weapon,
to wit: one Springfield 12
gauge double barrel shotgun, #C2537, for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace, contrary to the Criminal Code .

2. LOUIS STAVROFF stands further charged
that he on or about the 27th day of March in the year 1975, at the Municipality
of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, had in his possession
a weapon, to wit: one Armadeo Rossi S.A. 12 gauge double barrel shotgun,
#T45226, for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to the Criminal
Code .

3. LOUIS STAVROFF stands further charged
that he during the year 1975 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, had in
his possession a weapon, to wit: a 25 calibre Browning semi-automatic pistol,
#447173, for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to the Criminal
Code .

4. LOUIS STAVROFF stands further charged
that he during the year 1975 at the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial
District of York, had in his possession a restricted weapon, to wit: one 25
calibre Browning semi-automatic pistol, #447173, for which he did not have a
registration certificate issued to him, contrary to the Criminal Code .

[Page 414]

Upon a search of the appellant’s residence,
certain weapons were found: a loaded 12 gauge Springfield double barrel shotgun,
in a closet just outside the master bedroom door (count 1); a loaded double
barrel shotgun in the garage suspended from a rafter inside a plywood box with
the barrel pointing towards the street (count 2). On the same day, one
Peterson, a tenant of the Stavroff family in premises other than the Stavroff
residence, gave the police two boxes containing ammunition and a pistol. A few
days later, he gave the police another pistol. He said that these articles had
been given to him by the appellant some months earlier to be kept until their
return was sought. One of the weapons formed the sub-sect matter of counts
3 and 4.

The appellant was present while the search of
his residence was conducted and upon the discovery of the shotgun near the
master bedroom he said to the police officer who was conducting the search “Oh,
well, I’ve got a lot of enemies. I need it for protection”. In addition to
finding the weapon the police found dynamite with some wires and a blasting cap
in the basement of the house and some large amounts of currency in plastic bags
concealed in the garden. There was other evidence to the effect that the
appellant was engaged in a large way in street money lending, frequently
described as loan sharking, and that he wished to get out of that activity. On
the totality of the evidence there can be no doubt that a properly instructed
jury would have been justified in returning a verdict of guilty on the
possession charge.

After the jury had been instructed and had
retired to consider its verdict, the foreman sent a question to the judge. It
was in these words: “The jury requires a clarification of the law relative to
the phrase ‘dangerous to the public peace’ with particular reference to its
application within the confines of a person’s home”. The trial judge informed
counsel in the absence of the jury that he proposed to answer the jury’s
question by referring to factual situations drawn from decided cases.

[Page 415]

The cases he mentioned were R. v. Badenoch[1], R. v. Yaskowitch[2] and Caccamo v. The Queen[3]. Counsel took no objection to that course.
It must be noted, however, that no lengthy discussion of the course to be
adopted by the trial judge occurred and counsel, of course, were not aware of
the precise words which were to be employed by the trial judge in his remarks
to the jury.

The jury was recalled to the court room and the
following occurred as it was recorded in the transcript of the evidence:

QUESTION
BY THE JURY AND HIS HONOUR’S FURTHER CHARGE

—The jury returns to the courtroom at 4:33
p.m.

THE CLERK OF THE COURT: Would the foreman
please rise?

I understand you have a question to ask of
His Honour.

THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Yes, we do. Your
Honour, the jury would like a clarification of the law related to the phrase
“dangerous to the public peace”, with particular reference to its application
within the confines of a person’s home.

THE COURT: I presume you do not wish me to
instruct you again with regard to what items you should be considering in
determining “dangerous to the public peace”. You are, rather, directing my
attention to the fact that these weapons were found in a private home, and you
wish some comment or some assistance on that fact, that they were found in a
private home. Is that correct?

THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: I’d say that we understand
the application of the law as you have explained it.

THE COURT: So that I don’t have to—

THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: We merely asked
with particular emphasis on that point.

THE COURT: Perhaps it would be of
assistance to you if I referred to some factual situations that have occurred
in private homes. That may be of assistance to you.

THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: All right.

THE COURT: In one case there were found to
be billies and hardwood legs from broken chairs, and the persons in possession
of them were convicted of possession for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace, even though they

[Page 416]

were assembled in a private place and these
objects were for a purpose of defence against a contemplated attack.

Then there is another factual situation, which
also happens to be a reported case, where a person was found to have knives in
his possession and was found to possess them for a purpose dangerous to the
public peace, in that during the course of a family argument in a motel unit,
he took two knives out of a drawer and waved them about in a threatening manner
and grabbed one of the female occupants and made a threat. The Court held that
regardless of whether or not this conduct took place inside or outside a
private dwelling, the conviction would be sustained.

Then in another example, also found in a
reported case (a case that was considered by the Supreme Court of Canada), a
person was found to possess a loaded pistol, and it was found in the top of a
wardrobe in his bedroom, in a box, with eight additional rounds of ammunition.
In another part of the bedroom six counterfeit ten-dollar bills were found. A
sum of cash was found in his trouser pocket which amounted to $1700. There was
also other evidence that tended to connect him with an organization which used
or was known to use force.

Now is that of any assistance to you,
ladies and gentlemen?

You may retire; and if I haven’t answered
your question, if you will re-form it, I would be glad to hear it.

—The jury retires from the courtroom at 4:37 p.m.

The jury retired and a few minute later returned
with its verdict. As I have said, they convicted the accused on counts 1 to 4
of the indictment.

No authority is needed for the proposition that
where a judge sits with a jury it is the function of the jury alone to find the
facts and to do so upon the evidence adduced. It is equally clear that the
judge has the sole responsibility for the law and that in making his
explanation of the law he may quite properly refer to illustrations to assist
the jury but he must not in so doing take from the jury the right to form their
own conclusion on matters of fact. The question which arises here is whether
the trial judge’s response to the jury’s request for further assistance
produced that undesired result.

[Page 417]

Before embarking on that inquiry it seems
fitting to observe that a judge’s charge, when scrutinized by an appellate
court, must be read in full and considered in its entirety. I have read the
charge with great care. No complaint was made against that part delivered
before the jury posed its question. Indeed it is my opinion that no complaint
could be sustained. Upon the all important issue of the purpose for which the
weapons were possessed, the trial judge told the jury in precise terms that it
was for them to decide. He told them as well that the possession of weapons for
defensive purposes was a factor for consideration but not by itself decisive.
He also told them that they must consider all the circumstances surrounding the
matter and he made it clear that the possession of a weapon in a person’s home
could be legal and unobjectionable. He then reviewed the evidence touching on
purpose and related it to the law. Near the conclusion of his charge, he
returned to this subject with a short and accurate summary of his earlier
instructions. In my view, if there had been no question raised by the jury, the
charge would have been unassailable.

I turn now to the answer he gave to the jury’s
question. I commence by saying that the course adopted by the trial judge at
this point was unfortunate. It would undoubtedly have been wiser to repeat the
charge that he had earlier given or to give a further charge in general terms
explaining his earlier remarks with particular reference to the question raised
by the jury. It does not follow, however, that he made a reversible error. It
is obvious that the jury was to some extent confused by the Crown’s submission
that they could find a purpose dangerous to the public peace upon evidence
which revealed possession in a private dwelling place or places. The trial
judge could have answered the question simply and correctly by telling the jury
that the fact that the weapons were in a private dwelling was merely one of
many factors to be considered in reaching a conclusion. This he had covered in
his earlier charge. He chose, however, to illustrate the same proposition by
reference to factual situations he found in the cases. In the first two
illustrations he referred to two cases, R. v. Badenoch, supra, and R.
v. Yas-

[Page 418]

kowitch, supra, where
instruments, not always to be regarded as weapons, were held to be so and where
convictions were obtained despite the fact that possession was in a private
place. I cannot read his words from these two examples to mean or to leave the
meaning that as a matter of law the jury was required to regard the weapons in
the case at bar as having been possessed for a purpose dangerous to the public
peace. The two illustrations go no further in my mind than to point out that
possession in a private place does not rule out the existence of a purpose
dangerous to the public peace.

The third example drawn from the case of Caccamo
v. The Queen, supra, is more difficult and it is this illustration which
was strenuously attacked by the appellant’s counsel. Not only, it was argued,
does it refer to the Supreme Court of Canada but, in its reference to the
finding of counterfeit bills and cash and the other evidence tending to show a
connection with an organization which used or was known to use force, it underscored
the evidence of similar nature present in the case at bar to the prejudice of
the appellant. The effect of the reference to the Caccamo case by the
trial judge, it was argued, was to leave the jury with the impression that it
had already been determined in the courts as a matter of law that possession of
weapons in circumstances such as those found in the evidence amounted to proof
of a purpose dangerous to the public peace and that they were left with no
alternative but to convict.

In support of this argument, reliance was placed
upon R. v. St. Pierre[4]. Other
authorities such as R. v. Barr[5] and R.
v. Richards[6] were
cited but the appellant’s argument rests principally upon, and is most strongly
supported in R. v. St. Pierre.

In R. v. St. Pierre, supra, the appellant had admitted cunnilingus and the trial judge in
charging the jury on the offence of gross indecency read to the jury the
headnote from the case of R. v.

[Page 419]

LeFrancois[7], which was a case
where fellatio had been the subject of a gross indecency charge. He then read
from the judgment of Miller, C.J.M., a passage which described the appellant’s
behaviour as “unnatural and depraved” and not within acceptable standards of
behaviour. His dealing with the matter is best illustrated by an excerpt from
the charge to the jury referred to by Dubin J.A. in his judgment in the St. Pierre case at p. 492 which is reproduced hereunder:

It may be of some help to you if I were to
read to you very briefly from a judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal, and
this was not a case of cunnilingus, but one of fellatio, and that is the
putting of a penis in someone’s mouth. There the Court said:

An accused who engages in an act of
fellatio with a female is guilty of the offence of gross indecency whether or
not the female consents to such an act. The conduct as such is so repugnant to
the ordinary standards of morality and decency that is cannot be called
anything other than gross indecency.

They go on: 

The accused’s behaviour was unnatural and
depraved and violated the common standards of conduct accepted by the people or
our land, and it is our view that Canadians are not prepared to condone such
acts as falling within acceptable standards of behaviour.

Members of the jury, that was an expression
of opinion on a fact. You must consider it. It is not controlling. You will
consider all the facts here. What I have said may be of use to you. You will
consider the definition of gross indecency and you will consider all the
circumstances and say whether or not what happened here was a grossly indecent
act.

The jury having heard these words, commenced
deliberation and after several hours returned and asked for assistance on the
law regarding “the gross indecent act”. In recharging the jury, the judge
reread the headnote from the LeFrancois case and added, “that was the
statement of the court having regard to a similar act and you may find that it
is helpful or not”. I am in full agreement with the words of Dubin J.A. who
said,

[Page 420]

speaking for the court, at p. 493, in the St. Pierre case:

With deference to the learned trial judge,
he erred by reading from the headnote of that judgment. In so doing, he could
not have helped but to have left the impression with the jury that a Court has
held, as a matter of law, that the conduct alleged on the part of St. Pierre constituted gross
indecency. The issue here was a question of fact for the jury and yet it was
put to them as if it were a question of law. The jury had been advised that
they must take the law as the learned trial Judge had given it to them, and the
fact that he advised them that they might or might not find this statement
helpful does not, in my view, remedy the misdirection.

The danger of referring to decided cases and
other authorities in order to provide illustrations for the assistance of
juries in deciding issues of fact has been noted frequently by the courts. In R.
v. Barr, supra, Dubin J.A. in obiter said:

Further, in the learned trial Judge’s
charge to the jury on the question of law he dealt with the Poitras v. The
Queen case, supra. For the purpose of illustrating his recital of that case
he interposed the names of the witness in the case at bar with names of the
witnesses in the Poitras v. The Queen case and then instructed the jury
as to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada. With respect to the learned
trial Judge, doing it in this way could only confuse the jury and might leave
them with the impression that the Supreme Court of Canada on facts identical to
the facts in the case at bar had determined that the accused was guilty. With
respect, the trial Judge ought to have instructed the jury as to the law set
down by the Supreme Court of Canada, and then related the issues therein to the
facts of the case at bar. It is only in this way that the jury could properly
apply the facts in the case before them to the law as enunciated by the learned
trial Judge. To leave it in the manner that the learned trial Judge did in this
case might well have had the effect of removing the defense from the jury,
since they could readily conclude that the issues had been resolved for them by
a definitive judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Other examples may be found in R. v.
Richards, supra, and R. v. More[8].

While the adoption of this course by a trial judge
will not always amount to error in law, it is generally to be avoided. The
trial judge faces a

[Page 421]

task of great difficulty in charging a jury. He
must explain the law and he must as well relate the law to the facts. While he
is entitled to comment on and express opinions on the evidence, he must always
keep in mind the separate functions of the judge and jury and avoid any
interference with the jury’s prerogative to find facts. The trial judge is
fully entitled to all the assistance he can find in the decided cases and other
authorities and he is entitled to utilize the language of learned judges and
authors in making his explanations and in answering questions. He must,
however, be at pains to see that he does not leave with the jury the impression
that because a conviction or acquittal resulted in an earlier case on
apparently similar facts they are bound as a matter of law to reach the same
result in the case before them. He must make it clear to the jury that his
explanations are explanations of law and that they must apply that law to the
peculiar facts of the case before them only after finding the facts themselves.
The words of Green-shields J. in Leblanc v. The King[9], at pp. 209-210,. illustrate the position:

In the present case, the trial Judge was
instructing the jury on the law governing the theft of a postal letter. After
explaining the general law of theft, he told the jury that it had been decided
in two cases, that a certain manner of dealing with a postal letter by a
postman was, in law, theft. Taking his charge as a whole, and as stated in his
notes, the trial Judge did nothing more than to say to the jury, “If you find
such and such to be the facts,—and you are masters of the facts—I tell you, in
law, it is theft,” and in support of his instruction in law, he referred to
other cases where the law had been laid down or determined. As was said by a
Chief Justice:—“He, the trial Judge, or the counsel, has the right to use the
words of another as expressive of his own opinion. There is no objection to him
(counsel) even using them as part of his own speech.”

I have no hesitation in saying, that the
Judge charging a jury, in law, has a perfect right to say to them, “Lord Chief
Justice so and so, in a certain case reported, laid down the law on this matter
to be such and such,” and there and then proceed to read to the jury the
holding in law in that other case. Or, in other words, to use them as
expressive of his own opinion.

[Page 422]

The principles above stated are, in my view, not
in dispute. The case must turn on the application of those principles. It is to
a great extent a question of degree, each case must be considered on its own
facts and consideration must be given to the influence the words used by the
trial judge had or could have had upon the jury. In the St. Pierre case, it seems clear to me that the
trial judge’s words were tantamount to a specific statement that the issue had
been settled in the courts and that the conduct of the appellant was therefore,
in law, grossly indecent. The trial judge’s words in the case at bar do not go
so far. They provide illustrations—in which no error in law appears—of
circumstances where the possession of weapons in a private dwelling place did
not preclude a finding of a purpose dangerous to the public peace. The effect
of the charge taken as a whole was, in my opinion, to make it clear that the
case references were merely illustrative of situations involving questions
similar to the one facing the jury. I am unable to read the judge’s words as
meaning or being capable of conveying the meaning complained of by the
appellant. The illustrations given in answer to the jury’s question did not
constitute an entry by the judge into the jury’s peculiar sphere and did not
constitute a direction to them to bring in a particular verdict. This is a case
where the words of Greenshields J. from Leblanc v. The King, supra, at
p. 210, immediately following the words already quoted, are apposite:

In the present case the trial Judge never
told the jury that because another man was convicted by another jury, the
prisoner should be convicted. What he did tell the jury was, that the law as
stated by him, had been so stated and upheld by other Courts.

It is my opinion that the jury was not
misdirected on the law nor misled as to its functions with regard to the
evidence and I would dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ First degree murder ‑‑ Indecent assault against
a young boy ‑‑ Accused killing the child after the indecent assault
‑‑ Whether accused murdered the child ""while committing""
the indecent assault ‑‑ Meaning of the words ""while
committing"" in s. 214(5)(b) of the Criminal Code.

214 of the Criminal Code not creating a separate substantive offence of murder ‑‑
Section 214 classifying for sentencing purposes the offences in ss. 212 and 213
of the Code.

 

                   The
accused murdered a young boy two minutes after indecently assaulting him. The
killing was motivated by fear that the child would tell his mother about the
incident. At trial, the jury found the accused guilty of first degree murder
pursuant to s. 214(5) (b) of the Criminal Code . At the time of the
offence, s. 214(5) (b) provided that ""murder is first degree murder
in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person while
committing an offence under section . . . 156 (indecent assault on a
male)"". The Court of Appeal dismissed the accused's appeal but substituted
a verdict of second degree murder for the jury's verdict of first degree
murder. This appeal is to determine whether the accused murdered the child
""while committing"" the indecent assault.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be allowed.

words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  do not require the murder and
the underlying offence to take place simultaneously. Where the act causing
death and the acts constituting the indecent assault all form part of one
continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction, the death is caused
""while committing"" an offence for the purposes of s. 214(5) . The
offences under s. 214(5)  all involve the illegal domination of people by other
people. Accordingly, it is the continuing illegal domination of the victim
which gives continuity to the sequence of events culminating in the murder and
makes it a single transaction. The murder represents an exploitation of the
position of power created by the underlying crime and knits the two together.
The conviction of first degree murder should be restored.

                   APPEAL
from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal, J.E. 85‑556, dismissing
the accused's appeal but substituting a verdict of second degree murder for the
jury's verdict of first degree murder. Appeal allowed and the conviction of
first degree murder restored.

 

                   Robert
Parrot, for the appellant.

 

                   Jean‑Guy
Gilbert, for the respondent.

 

                   The
judgment of the Court was delivered by

 

 

1.                Wilson J.‑‑Section
214(5)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, as
amended by S.C. 1974‑75‑76, c. 105, which was in force at the time
of the commission of the offence provided that murder is first degree murder
when the death is caused by a person while the person is committing indecent
assault. The respondent, Marc‑André Paré, indecently assaulted and
murdered a seven‑year‑old boy, Steeve Duranleau. The central issue
in this appeal is whether the respondent murdered the child ""while
committing"" the indecent assault.

 

2.                While
sections 213 and 214 were subsequently amended by An Act to amend the
Criminal Code in relation to sexual offences and other offences against the
person and to amend certain other Acts in relation thereto or in consequence
thereof, S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83, c. 125, the amendments are
not germane to the issue on this appeal.

 

1. The
Facts

 

3.                On
July 13, 1982 at about 1:30 in the afternoon the respondent Marc‑André
Paré, then 17 years old, met Steeve Duranleau, a seven‑year‑old
boy. At Paré's suggestion the two went swimming. After about fifteen minutes in
the pool Paré offered to take Duranleau to look at some used cars. The offer
was only a pretence. Paré's real motive was to get Duranleau alone in order to
have sexual relations with him.

 

4.                After
changing, Paré and Duranleau went to a parking lot where they looked at some
used cars. Near the parking lot was a bridge that crossed the St. Charles
River. Paré lured Duranleau under the bridge. Duranleau wanted to leave but
Paré told him not to and held him by the arm. Paré sat there for the next ten
minutes holding Duranleau by the arm. Then Paré told Duranleau to lie on his
back and to keep quiet. Paré pulled Duranleau's shorts down and lowered his own
pants and underwear. He then lay on top of Duranleau and indecently assaulted
him. After ejaculating beside Duranleau's penis, Paré sat up and got dressed.

 

5.                At
this point Duranleau told Paré that he intended to tell his mother about the
incident. Paré told him that he did not want him to tell his mother and that,
if he did, he would kill him. After this exchange of words Paré was certain
that the boy would tell his mother as soon as he could. Paré made Duranleau lie
on his back. He waited for two minutes with his hand on Duranleau's chest. He
then killed Duranleau by strangling him with his hands, hitting him on the head
several times with an oil filter, and strangling him with a shoe‑lace.

 

6.                The
accused was charged as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  That in Québec City, Quebec, on or around
July 13, 1982, he illegally and intentionally killed Steeve Duranleau, thereby
committing murder in the first degree contrary to sections 212‑214(5)‑218
of the Criminal Code .

 

At trial
the accused admitted all the facts outlined above. On December 7, 1982 the
accused was found guilty of first degree murder. The accused's appeal to the
Quebec Court of Appeal was dismissed on April 2, 1985 (per L'Heureux‑Dubé,
Beauregard and LeBel JJ.A.), the court substituting a verdict of second degree
murder for the jury's verdict of first degree murder: J.E. 85‑556. Leave
to appeal was granted to the Crown by this Court (per Beetz, Lamer and
Wilson JJ.) on June 27, 1985, [1985] 1 S.C.R. xii.

 

2. The
Courts Below

 

The
Superior Court

 

7.                In
his charge to the jury Bienvenue J. discussed the meaning of the words
""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  of the Criminal Code . Since
this appeal hinges upon the meaning of these words it is necessary to reproduce
the relevant comments of the trial judge:

 

                   [TRANSLATION]  Then, section 214(2)
and (5)(b) states the following:

 

"". . . is [est assimilé au] first (1st)
degree murder""

 

‑‑I do not think that the word ""assimilé""
presents any problem to you and me, it is a word which simply means ""is
first (1st) degree murder"", okay, it's a first (1st) degree murder, the
following ‑

 

""murder . . . while committing"";

 

‑‑or if you prefer instead of ""while
committing"" [concomitant] I will suggest a number of expressions
that mean the same thing, namely ""committed on the occasion of"",
""committed at the time of"", ""accompanying"" and so on; the
following, ""which occurred at the same time as"": all these words are
synonyms of ""while committing"";

 

and so

 

""murder . . . while committing"", or if you
prefer, ""which was committed on the occasion of the crime specified in s.
156  of the Criminal Code  (indecent assault on male)"".

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   I am sure you realize ‑‑
I do not think it is even necessary to say it ‑‑ I rely on the
intelligence of you all, but in case anyone should someday claim I had not said
it, when you say ""while committing"", it means ""committed at the
same time"", ""on the same occasion""; you realize the Code does
not go so far as to require that at the time I commit an indecent assault with
my right hand I must be committing murder with my left. Is not it so? In this
the Code is logical: when it says ""at the same time"", committed
""on the same occasion"", it means ""in the same circumstances"".

 

The jury
found the accused guilty of first degree murder.

 

The
Court of Appeal for Quebec

 

8.                Beauregard
and LeBel JJ.A. gave separate reasons; L'Heureux‑Dubé J.A. agreed with
both. Beauregard J.A. examined the case law and decided that s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  should be restrictively interpreted. He concluded that ""while
committing"" must be contrasted with ""after having finished
committing"". A murder committed after the accused had committed the
indecent assault was not a first degree murder. Accordingly, when the trial
judge said to the jury that a murder committed ""on the occasion of""
an indecent assault was a first degree murder, he did not invite the jury to
consider the really critical question, namely whether the murder was committed
during the commission of the indecent assault or after the indecent assault was
over.

 

9.                Beauregard
J.A. was of the opinion that a properly directed jury would not have been
convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused murdered his victim while
committing the indecent assault. Consequently, he dismissed the appeal and
substituted a verdict of second degree murder for the verdict of first degree
murder.

 

10.              LeBel
J.A. did not agree with Beauregard J.A.'s conclusion that s. 214(5)  required
the murder and the indecent assault to be absolutely simultaneous. Even if the
section were to be construed restrictively, he stated, it must not be deprived
of all effect. By reading s. 214(5)  in conjunction with s. 213, LeBel J.A.
concluded that the words ""while committing"" demanded a close temporal
connection between the indecent assault and the murder. Moreover, he concluded
that the murder must be an immediate consequence of the first offence for s.
214(5)  to apply. LeBel J.A. found it difficult to conclude that a jury more
completely informed of the nuances of the sections in question would have
necessarily returned the same verdict. The charge given to the jury, he stated,
effectively prevented the jury from directing its attention to the proper
meaning of s. 214(5) . Therefore, despite his reservations about Beauregard
J.A.'s conclusions of law, LeBel J.A. agreed with his disposition of the case.

 

3. The
Issue

 

11.              Counsel
for the appellant submit that the Court of Appeal made two errors in law.
First, it erred in concluding that s. 214(5)  of the Criminal Code 
created a substantive offence of murder. Second, it erred in its interpretation
of the words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5) . I will address both
issues looking first at the general scheme of the murder provisions in the Criminal
Code  and then turning to the interpretation of the particular wording of s.
214(5) .

 

(a) The
General Scheme

 

12.              Counsel
for the appellant submit that the Court of Appeal viewed s. 214(5)  of the Criminal
Code  as creating a substantive offence of murder. I find nothing in the
judgments rendered by the Court of Appeal that suggests that this was the case.
In any event, counsel for the respondent acknowledge that such an approach
would be improper and I agree. Section 214  has a completely different function.

 

13.              The
relevant provisions of the Criminal Code  are as follows:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide
is murder

 

                   (a) where the person who
causes the death of a                 human being

 

(i) means to cause his death, or

 

(ii) means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;

 

                   (b) where a person, meaning to
cause death to a                human being or meaning to cause him bodily harm
       that he knows is likely to cause his death, and              being
reckless whether death ensues or not, by        accident or mistake causes
death to another                human being, notwithstanding that he does not        mean
to cause death or bodily harm to that human       being; or

 

                   (c) where a person, for an
unlawful object, does                 anything that he knows or ought to know
is        likely to cause death, and thereby causes death           to a human
being, notwithstanding that he        desires to effect his object without
causing                   death or bodily harm to any human being.

 

                   213. Culpable homicide
is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while committing or
attempting to commit high treason or treason or an offence mentioned in section
52 (sabotage), 76 (piratical acts), 76.1 (hijacking an aircraft), 132 or
subsection 133(1) or sections 134 to 136 (escape or rescue from prison or
lawful custody), 143 or 145 (rape or attempt to commit rape), 149 or 156
(indecent assault), subsection 246(2) (resisting lawful arrest), 247
(kidnapping and forcible confinement), 302 (robbery), 306 (breaking and
entering) or 389 or 390 (arson), whether or not the person means to cause death
to any human being and whether or not he knows that death is likely to be
caused to any human being, if

 

(a) he means to cause bodily harm for the purpose
                                of

 

(i) facilitating the commission of the offence, or

 

(ii) facilitating his flight after committing or
attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the death ensues from the bodily harm;

 

                   (b) he administers a
stupefying or overpowering                 thing for a purpose mentioned in
paragraph (a),        and the death ensues therefrom;

 

                   (c) he wilfully stops, by any
means, the breath                    of a human being for a purpose mentioned
in        paragraph (a), and the death ensues therefrom;           or

 

                   (d) he uses a weapon or has it
upon his person

 

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to
commit the offence, or

 

(ii) during or at the time of his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

                          and the death ensues as a
consequence.

 

                   214. (1) Murder is
first degree murder or second degree murder.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (5) Irrespective of whether a murder
is planned and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree
murder in respect of a person when the death is caused by that person

 

(a) while committing or attempting to commit an
offence under section 76.1 (hijacking aircraft) or 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement); or

 

(b) while committing an offence under section 144
(rape) or 145 (attempt to commit rape) or while committing or attempting to
commit an offence under section 149 (indecent assault on female) or 156
(indecent assault on male).

 

It is
clear from a reading of these provisions that s. 214 serves a different
function from ss. 212 and 213. Sections 212 and 213 create the substantive
offence of murder. Section 214 is simply concerned with classifying for
sentencing purposes the offences created by ss. 212 and 213. It tells us
whether the murder is first degree or second degree. This view of s. 214 was
expressly adopted by this Court in R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 124 (per
Dickson J. (as he then was) at p. 140) and in Droste v. The Queen,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 208 (per Dickson J. (as he then was) at p. 218). In this
case it is established that the respondent murdered Steeve Duranleau. The issue
is whether s. 214(5) (b) makes the murder first degree.

 

(b) Section
214(5) : ""while committing"":

 

14.              (i)
The Literal Meaning

 

15.              Did
the respondent murder Duranleau while committing an indecent assault? Counsel
for the respondent submit that he did not. The argument here is simple. The
murder occurred, it is submitted, after the indecent assault was complete.
Thus, by a literal reading of s. 214(5)  Paré did not murder Duranleau
""while committing"" an indecent assault.

 

16.              This
argument is a forceful one but by no means decisive. The literal meaning of
words could equally be termed their acontextual meaning. As Professor Dworkin
points out, the literal or acontextual meaning of words is ""the meaning we
would assign them if we had no special information about the context of their
use or the intentions of their author"": see R. Dworkin, Law's Empire
(1986), at p. 17. Thus the words ""while committing"" could have one
meaning when disembodied from the Criminal Code  and another entirely
when read in the context of the scheme and purpose of the legislation. It is
the latter meaning that we must ascertain.

 

17.              A
preliminary problem in ascertaining the contextual meaning of the phrase
""while committing"" arises from a possible inconsistency between the
French and English versions of s. 214(5) . At the time of the offence the French
version of the English words ""while committing"" was ""concomitant"".
In 1983 the word ""concomitant"" was replaced by the phrase
""en commettant"". Is this change in wording in the French
version significant to the interpretation of s. 214(5) ? I think not. I would
agree with Beauregard J.A. of the Quebec Court of Appeal who said
[TRANSLATION]  ""The amendment does not appear to have introduced anything
new. The word `concomitant' meant `while committing' or `en
commettant' "".

 

(ii) The
Case Law

 

18.              I
now turn to cases which throw some light on the meaning of the words
""while committing"". Counsel for the appellant submit that these words
in s. 214(5)  should not be held to require the murder and the underlying
offence to take place simultaneously. They seek to support this contention by
reference to the judicial interpretation of the same words in s. 213.

 

19.              Section
213 transforms culpable homicide into murder where a person causes the death of
a human being ""while committing"" any one of a number of serious
offences, provided that the case falls within one of the four categories listed
in clauses 213(a) to 213(d). The cases have consistently
construed the words ""while committing"" in s. 213 to include cases
where the homicide is committed during flight after commission of the
underlying offence: see R. v. Vaillancourt (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 137
(Ont. C.A.), aff'd [1976] 1 S.C.R. 13; R. v. Stevens (1984), 11 C.C.C.
(3d) 518 (Ont. C.A.) The appellant's argument is that because ""while
committing"" is broadly construed in s. 213 it should also be broadly
construed in s. 214(5) .

 

20.              This
argument, in my view, is not sound. The particular construction placed on the
words ""while committing"" in s. 213 was mandated by the reference to
flight in paras. (a)(ii) and (d)(ii) of that section. As Martin
J.A. noted in Stevens, supra, at p. 540: ""Any other interpretation
[of the words ""while committing""] would deprive paras. (a)(ii)
and (d)(ii) of s. 213 of any meaning and would render them
inoperative . . . ."" Section 214(5) , however, contains
no such references to flight. Thus, no analogy may properly be drawn from
judicial interpretation of the words ""while committing"" in s. 213.
The same words appearing in s. 214(5)  must be interpreted in the particular
context of that section.

 

21.              In
R. v. Gourgon and Knowles (No. 1) (1979), 9 C.R. (3d) 313 (B.C.S.C.)
(appeal allowed on other grounds (1979), 19 C.R. (3d) 272 (B.C.C.A.)), Anderson
J. construed the words very narrowly. He stated at p. 319:

 

                   The words ""while
committing"" in s. 214(5)  relate to the time of the commission of the
offence of ""forcibly confining"" and to no other time.

 

                   I agree that the words ""while
committing"" in s. 214(5)  do not apply to ""flight"", and that
unlike s. 213, the words ""while committing"" do not have to be given
an extended meaning to make sense out of s. 214(5) .

 

It
should be noted, however, that Anderson J.'s comments on the interpretation
issue were obiter since in that case the underlying offence of
confinement was continuing at the very instant the death took place.

 

22.              Further
support for the narrow interpretation is found in two subsequent cases: R.
v. Kjeldsen (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 55 (Alta. C.A.), and R. v. Sargent (1983),
5 C.C.C. (3d) 429 (Sask. C.A.) In the latter case, the victim was killed after
she had been raped by either the appellant or his companion or both. Hall J.A.,
speaking for the Court concluded at p. 436:

 

                   It is manifest that the jury, in
returning a verdict of guilty of first degree murder accepted those portions of
the evidence which were most unfavourable to the appellant. However, in that
event, there is no basis upon which the jury could return the verdict which
they did. If the jury found, on the evidence before them, that a rape had
occurred, it is clear that the death of the deceased did not occur while that
offence was being committed. That is, there was no evidence to support the
finding that the actions which resulted in the death of Lenny Lou Cosgrove were
perpetrated by the appellant (either alone or with Massong) while committing
the offence of rape. On the only evidence before the jury, the murder was
committed after the actual rape. Therefore the provisions of s. 214(5)  do not
apply to establish the offence of first degree murder: see R. v.
Kjeldsen . . . .

 

23.              Kjeldsen
took the same approach. In that case the appellant raped his victim and then
tied her up. A short time later she freed herself and the appellant then killed
her. At trial the appellant was convicted of first degree murder. The Court of
Appeal substituted a conviction of second degree murder. The Court did not
analyze the meaning of the words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  but
appeared to assume that these words required the underlying offence and the
murder to occur simultaneously (p. 85).

 

24.              The
courts, however, have not been unanimous in adopting the narrow interpretation.
In R. v. Stevens, supra, another case of rape and murder, Martin J.A.
held that there was sufficient evidence on which a jury could conclude that the
murder took place during the commission of an indecent assault. He went on,
however, to make some interesting comments on the interpretation of the words
""while committing"" in s. 214(5) . At page 541, he states:

 

                   Thus, it appears clear that where
death is caused after the underlying offence is complete and the act causing
death is committed for the purpose of facilitating the flight of the offender,
the murder is not under ss. 213  and 214(5) (b) first degree murder.

 

                   I do not wish, however, to be taken
as holding that where the act causing death and the acts constituting the rape,
attempted rape, indecent assault or an attempt to commit indecent assault, as
the case may be, all form part of one continuous sequence of events forming a
single transaction, that death would not be caused during the commission of the
offence, even though the underlying offence in s. 213 in a sense could be said
to be then complete.

 

The
suggestion here is that the words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  do
not require an exact coincidence of the murder with the underlying offence.
Rather, they require a close temporal and causative link between the two. Which
of the competing interpretations should be adopted?

 

(iii) Strict
Construction

 

25.              Counsel
for the respondent argue that the doctrine of strict construction of criminal
statutes requires that this Court adopt the interpretation most favourable to
the accused. According to this argument the words ""while committing""
must be narrowly construed so as to elevate murder to first degree only when
the death and the underlying offence occur simultaneously. In order to assess
the validity of this position we must examine the doctrine of strict
construction.

 

26.              The
doctrine is one of ancient lineage. It reached its pinnacle of importance in a
former age when the death penalty attached to a vast array of offences. As
Stephen Kloepfer points out in his article ""The Status of Strict
Construction in Canadian Criminal Law"" (1983), 15 Ottawa L. Rev.
553, at pp. 556‑60, the doctrine was one of many tools employed by the
judiciary to soften the impact of the Draconian penal provisions of the time.
Over the past two centuries criminal law penalties have become far less severe.
Criminal law remains, however, the most dramatic and important incursion that
the state makes into individual liberty. Thus, while the original justification
for the doctrine has been substantially eroded, the seriousness of imposing criminal
penalties of any sort demands that reasonable doubts be resolved in favour of
the accused.

 

27.              This
point was underlined by Dickson J. (as he then was) in Marcotte v. Deputy
Attorney General for Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, at p. 115:

 

It is unnecessary to emphasize the importance of clarity
and certainty when freedom is at stake. No authority is needed for the
proposition that if real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance arise,
in the construction and application of a statute affecting the liberty of a
subject, then that statute should be applied in such a manner as to favour the
person against whom it is sought to be enforced. If one is to be incarcerated,
one should at least know that some Act of Parliament requires it in express
terms, and not, at most, by implication.

 

The
continued vitality of the doctrine is further evidenced by the decisions in R.
v. Goulis (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 347 (Ont. C.A.), and Paul v. The Queen,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 621. The question, therefore, is not whether the doctrine of
strict construction exists but what its implications are for this case.

 

(iv) Applying
the Doctrine

 

28.              As
we have noted above, it is clearly grammatically possible to construe the words
""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  as requiring murder to be classified
as first degree only if it is exactly coincidental with the underlying offence.
This, however, does not end the question. We still have to determine whether
the narrow interpretation of ""while committing"" is a reasonable one,
given the scheme and purpose of the legislation.

 

29.              In
my view, the construction that counsel for the respondent would have us place
on these words is not one that could reasonably be attributed to Parliament.
The first problem with the exactly simultaneous approach flows from the
difficulty in defining the beginning and end of an indecent assault. In this case,
for example, after ejaculation the respondent sat up and put his pants back on.
But for the next two minutes he kept his hand on his victim's chest. Was this
continued contact part of the assault? It does not seem to me that important
issues of criminal law should be allowed to hinge upon this kind of
distinction. An approach that depends on this kind of distinction should be
avoided if possible.

 

30.              A
second difficulty with the exactly simultaneous approach is that it leads to
distinctions that are arbitrary and irrational. In the present case, had the
respondent strangled his victim two minutes earlier than he did, his guilt of
first degree murder would be beyond dispute. The exactly simultaneous approach
would have us conclude that the two minutes he spent contemplating his next
move had the effect of reducing his offence to one of second degree murder.
This would be a strange result. The crime is no less serious in the latter case
than in the former; indeed, if anything, the latter crime is more serious since
it involves some element of deliberation. An interpretation of s. 214(5)  that
runs contrary to common sense is not to be adopted if a reasonable alternative
is available.

 

31.              In
my view, such an interpretation has been provided by Martin J.A. in Stevens,
supra. As noted above, Martin J.A. suggested that ""where the act
causing death and the acts constituting the rape, attempted rape, indecent
assault or an attempt to commit indecent assault, as the case may be, all form
part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction""
the death was caused ""while committing"" an offence for the purposes
of s. 214(5) . This interpretation eliminates the need to draw artificial lines
to separate the commission and the aftermath of an indecent assault. Further,
it eliminates the arbitrariness inherent in the exactly simultaneous approach.
I would, therefore, respectfully adopt Martin J.A.'s single transaction
analysis as the proper construction of s. 214(5) .

 

32.              This
approach, it seems to me, best expresses the policy considerations that
underlie the provision. Section 214, as we have seen, classifies murder as
either first or second degree. All murders are serious crimes. Some murders,
however, are so threatening to the public that Parliament has chosen to impose
exceptional penalties on the perpetrators. One such class of murders is that
found in s. 214(5) , murders done while committing a hijacking, a kidnapping and
forcible confinement, a rape, or an indecent assault. An understanding of why
this class of murder is elevated to murder in the first degree is a helpful
guide to the interpretation of the language.

 

33.              The
Law Reform Commission of Canada addressed this issue in its paper on Homicide
(Working Paper 33, 1984). At page 79, the paper states:

 

. . . there is a lack of rationale in the law.
Subsection 214(5)  provides that, whether planned and deliberate or not, murder
is first degree murder when committed in the course of certain listed offences.
It is curious that the list there given is considerably shorter than that given
in section 213 which makes killing murder if done in the commission of certain
specified offences. Inspection and comparison of the two lists, however, reveal
no organizing principle in either of them and no rationale for the
difference between them.

 

With
respect, I disagree. The offences listed in s. 214(5)  are all offences
involving the unlawful domination of people by other people. Thus an organizing
principle for s. 214(5)  can be found. This principle is that where a murder is
committed by someone already abusing his power by illegally dominating another,
the murder should be treated as an exceptionally serious crime. Parliament has
chosen to treat these murders as murders in the first degree.

 

34.              Refining
then on the concept of the ""single transaction"" referred to by Martin
J.A. in Stevens, supra, it is the continuing illegal domination of the
victim which gives continuity to the sequence of events culminating in the
murder. The murder represents an exploitation of the position of power created
by the underlying crime and makes the entire course of conduct a ""single
transaction"". This approach, in my view, best gives effect to the
philosophy underlying s. 214(5) .

 

35.              (v)
The Charge to the Jury

 

36.              Given
this interpretation of s. 214(5) , was Bienvenue J.'s charge to the jury
acceptable? The trial judge gave a number of definitions of ""while
committing"". I do not think, however, that these definitions would have
confused the jury or included events too remote from the underlying offence.
The words ""while committing"" in s. 214(5)  include conduct which is
part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction with the
underlying offence. The trial judge's instruction to the jury was in line with
this interpretation since it emphasized the need for connection between the two
offences but without demanding that they occurred simultaneously.

 

4. Conclusion

 

37.              The
respondent murdered Steeve Duranleau two minutes after indecently assaulting
him. The killing was motivated by fear that the boy would tell his mother about
the indecent assault. The jury found the respondent guilty of first degree
murder. They were entitled to do so. The murder was temporally and causally
connected to the underlying offence. It formed part of one continuous sequence
of events. It was part of the same transaction.

 

38.              I
would allow the appeal and restore the conviction of first degree murder.

                   Three
years before the proclamation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
appellant was convicted of gross indecency under s. 157  of the Criminal Code ,
found to be a dangerous offender and sentenced to indeterminate detention.
Appellant's appeal from this determination and sentence was dismissed. Gross
indecency was later deleted from the definition of ""serious personal
injury offence"" with the result that conviction under that offence no
longer permits the making of an application under Part XXI of the Code.

 

                   Appellant
queried the lawfulness of his continued detention and commenced the present
proceedings seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum with certiorari
in aid and additionally, or in the alternative, a remedy pursuant to s. 24(1) 
of the Charter . The application was dismissed and the Ontario Court of
Appeal upheld that decision. At issue here, in addition to the ss. 7 , 9 , 11 ,
and 12  Charter  issues considered in R. v. Lyons, is whether the
continued detention of a person, found to be a dangerous offender and sentenced
to indeterminate detention, is valid under the Charter  where the offence
of which he was convicted is no longer one in respect of which indeterminate
detention may be imposed.

 

                   Held (Wilson
J. dissenting in part and Estey J. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and McIntyre, Lamer, Le Dain and La Forest JJ.: The present Part XXI of
the Criminal Code  does not infringe the Charter : R. v. Lyons.

 

                   A
change in the law that deletes the offence of which the appellant was convicted
from the list of offences in respect of which indeterminate detention may be
imposed does not alter the status of a dangerous offender. The detention of a
""dangerous offender"" is not reviewable by writ of habeas corpus
or under ss. 9  or 12  of the Charter , even if the offender ceases to have
the characteristics of dangerousness that formed the basis for his
indeterminate detention. The argument that ""dangerousness"" must be a
continuing element does not properly reflect the nature, purpose or effect of
the Part XXI sentence, is not supported by the plain words of s. 688 of the Code,
and misconceives the nature, purpose and effect of the Parole Board's review
procedure. Continuing detention is not premised on the status of
""dangerousness"" under existing law respecting dangerous offenders. In
sum, the appellant has the same protections as those afforded any other person
who is convicted of an offence and sentenced to a period of incarceration. He
had a right to appeal when the sentence was pronounced and he may apply for
parole at prescribed times. But like any other person who is properly convicted
and sentenced, he must otherwise serve his sentence according to its tenor.

 

                   The
continued detention of the accused under Part XXI imposed following his
conviction for gross indecency under the pre‑existing law does not amount
to cruel and unusual punishment or arbitrary detention.

 

                   Article
15 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, which provides that if the penalty for an offence is reduced after
its commission, the offender is to benefit thereby, does not invalidate the
appellant's sentence. Assuming it could apply to his situation, it must be read
in the light of s. 11 (i) of the Charter .

 

                   Per Wilson
J. (dissenting in part): The accused had no knowledge when he pleaded guilty to
the offences of which he was convicted that the Crown intended and had been
instructed by the Attorney General to make an application under Part XXI of the
Code. The Crown may have been entitled to function in this way when the
Part XXI order was made prior to the coming into force of the Charter ,
but, for the reasons given in Lyons, accused's continued incarceration
pursuant to an order made in these circumstances cannot be justified subsequent
to the coming into force of s. 7  of the Charter . The accused accordingly
is entitled to relief under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

 

                   Per Estey
J. (dissenting): The continued incarceration of the appellant offends his right
under s. 12  of the Charter . The prospect of a person's serving an
indefinite sentence in a penitentiary for an offence no longer attracting such
a term of imprisonment under the Criminal Code  is ""cruel and
unusual"" as this expression has been defined. Parliament itself found this
sentence to be disproportionate when it amended Part XXI and it only remained
for the courts to apply the Charter  as a matter of law to appellant's
present situation.

 

                   Sections
7  and 9  of the Charter  might also be offended but the issues arising
under ss. 7 , 9 , and 12  are so interwoven as to render this appeal an
unsatisfactory base for any extension of the analysis of these rights.

 

                   Since
habeas corpus with certiorari in aid would be an inappropriate
remedy if the time already served by appellant were less than the proper
sentence, a court must turn to s. 24(1)  of the Charter . The matter
should be remitted to the trial judge, notwithstanding the fact that he is now functus,
for an assessment of the appropriate sentence.

                   The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and McIntyre, Lamer, Le Dain and
La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                La Forest J.‑‑This
appeal raises several general issues identical to those addressed in R. v.
Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, regarding whether the dangerous offenders
provisions of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, Part XXI,
ss. 687‑695 as amended, are constitutionally valid having regard to the
rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and 12  of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms . In addition, it raises a number of specific issues regarding
whether a person who was convicted before the commencement of the Charter
of what was then, but is no longer, ""a serious personal injury
offence"" under Part XXI and found to be ""a dangerous offender""
under that Part, and in consequence sentenced to ""detention in a
penitentiary for an indeterminate period in lieu of any other sentence"",
can now have that detention reviewed either by means of a writ of habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid on the ground that he is no longer a
dangerous offender, or under the Charter  on the ground that such detention
constitutes arbitrary detention or imprisonment (s. 9 ) or cruel and unusual
punishment (s. 12 ). The general issues have already been discussed in Lyons.
The present judgment is, therefore, largely confined to the specific issues.

 

Facts
and Procedural History

 

2.                On
June 20, 1979, some three years before the Charter  was proclaimed, the
appellant George Harvey Milne pleaded guilty, before His Honour Judge Denroche
of the British Columbia Provincial Court, to five counts of gross indecency
contrary to s. 157  of the Criminal Code . The offences occurred over a
period of nine months and involved sexual activity with boys between the ages
of thirteen and sixteen. On the same day, the Crown requested and was granted
an adjournment to enable it to bring a dangerous offender application under
Part XXI of the Code. The application was subsequently made before the
same judge on May 29, 1980.

 

3.                At
that time, s. 687 of the Code defined ""serious personal injury
offence"" to include gross indecency. Section 687(b) then read as
follows:

 

                   687. ...

 

(b) an offence mentioned in section
144 (rape) or 145 (attempted rape) or an offence or attempt to commit an
offence mentioned in section 146 (sexual intercourse with a female under
fourteen or between fourteen and sixteen), 149 (indecent assault on a female),
156 (indecent assault on a male) or 157 (gross indecency). [Emphasis
added.]

 

I should
add that, similar to the situation that now exists, for the dangerous offenders
provisions to apply to these sexual offences, it was necessary to establish to
the satisfaction of the court that ""the offender, by his conduct in any
sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for
which he has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses
and a likelihood of his causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons
through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses"" (s. 688(b)).

 

4.                The
judge noted that the appellant had previously been convicted of six property
offences, one bail offence and three indecent assault offences, all against
males. He concluded that the appellant had, by his conduct, shown a failure to
control his sexual impulses, a pattern that was likely to continue in the
future and to cause injury, pain or other evil to other persons. He, therefore,
found the appellant to be a dangerous offender. He was also satisfied that a
sentence of detention for an indeterminate period in lieu of any other sentence
was necessary because of ""how little change has been effected in the
offender's conduct to date, the lack of motivation [to change] exhibited up
until the time of his arrest on the present charges and the only available figures
on recidivism"". The appellant's appeal from this determination and against
sentence to the British Columbia Court of Appeal (Taggart J.A., McFarlane and
Carrothers JJ.A. concurring) was dismissed on March 10, 1982.

 

5.                On
January 4, 1983, s. 687(b) of the Code was amended by S.C. 1980‑81‑82‑83,
c. 125 s. 26. These amendments deleted the offence under s. 157  (gross
indecency) from the definition of ""serious personal injury offence"".
This means that a conviction under s. 157  no longer permits the making of an
application under Part XXI of the Code.

 

6.                On
November 14, 1984 the appellant commenced the present proceedings by way of
originating notice of motion in the Supreme Court of Ontario. He sought a writ
of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum with certiorari in aid and
additionally, or in the alternative, a remedy pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , which had been proclaimed into force
subsequent to the commencement of his sentence. The proceedings were brought
for the purpose of determining the lawfulness of his continuing detention under
the indeterminate sentence. They were instituted in Ontario because the
appellant was at that time incarcerated in Warkworth Institution, a
penitentiary located in that province.

 

7.                On
December 11, 1984, Montgomery J., dismissed the application. He noted, however,
that the appellant was not left without a remedy. ""He may make application
to the National Parole Board and attempt to convince that body that he is no
longer a danger to the community. An accused who is sentenced to a term of
preventive detention having exhausted his appeal remedies ought in my view to
serve his sentence unless the Parole Board on subsequent review after an
appropriate amount of time has been served finds that he is no longer a risk to
the public.""

 

8.                An
appeal from Montgomery J.'s decision was dismissed, with brief written reasons,
by the Ontario Court of Appeal (Dubin, Morden and Grange JJ.A.) on June 10,
1985. In their opinion ""the amendment to the Criminal Code  did not
affect the validity of the detention of the appellant"". On December 10,
1985, leave to appeal to this Court was granted.

 

9.                On
June 23, 1986 constitutional questions were stated by the Chief Justice in the
following form:

 

1. Whether the provisions of Part XXI of the Criminal
Code  of Canada, dealing with an application for finding, and sentencing, an
individual as a dangerous offender, in whole or in part, infringe or deny the
rights guaranteed by ss. 7 , 9 , 11  and/or 12 of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms ?

 

2. If so, then are the provisions of Part XXI of
the Criminal Code , in whole or in part, justified on the basis of s. 1 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and therefore not
inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982 ?

 

It
should be noted that these are identical to the questions stated in the Lyons
appeal.

 

10.              Pursuant
to notice under R. 32(4) of the Supreme Court Rules, the Attorneys
General of Ontario and British Columbia subsequently intervened in the appeal.

 

The
Issues

 

11.              As
already intimated, the issues involved in the constitutional questions stated
by the Chief Justice have already been fully discussed in Lyons where I
concluded that the present Part XXI does not contravene the Charter  rights
referred to, and I find it unnecessary to add anything to the analysis there
made. I shall therefore confine myself to the issues that are specific to this
case.

 

12.              The
appellant's principal argument, which I shall for convenience refer to as the
""continuing status argument"", is deceptively simple and may thus be
stated. Part XXI provides a mechanism for determining whether a person
convicted of a ""serious personal injury offence"" is a ""dangerous
offender"". As a consequence of this determination, a person labelled as
having the ""status"" of a dangerous offender may be sentenced to a
period of indeterminate detention, but only for as long as the offender
continues to evince the characteristics that are comprised in the
""status"" of dangerousness. If he ceases to do so, the basis for his
incarceration vanishes and his detention may be reviewed by means of a writ of habeas
corpus, or under the Charter  on the ground that continuing to detain
him amounts to arbitrary detention or imprisonment (s. 9 ), or cruel and unusual
treatment or punishment (s. 12 ).

 

13.              It
follows, so the argument goes, that when a court is called upon to review the
continued detention of the offender, what is sought is not a review of the
initial determination that the offender was dangerous, but rather a
determination of whether he or she continues to be dangerous. The latter
determination, the argument continues, must be made in light of the current
provisions of Part XXI. In the appellant's case, this means that he can no
longer be said to possess the requisite characteristics of dangerousness
because the crime for which he was convicted, gross indecency, is no longer
included in the definition of ""serious personal injury offence"" (s. 687).
His status has therefore ceased to exist and his continued detention can no
longer be justified. In other words, continuing detention is premised on a
condition or status of dangerousness under existing law and therefore, it is
argued, once that status no longer attaches, the offender must be released. The
review by the Parole Board provided by the legislation is, therefore, not an
adequate or appropriate remedy because the criteria the Board applies do not,
if this argument is accepted, properly address the question whether an
applicant should remain in detention, in that they do not oblige the Board to
consider whether he is ""dangerous"" having regard to the current Code
provisions.

 

14.              So
far as Charter  review is concerned, the argument continues, the Charter 
is not being applied retrospectively. The original pre‑Charter 
labelling and sentencing are not, it is said, being reviewed. Instead the Charter 
review is aimed at determining whether the appellant continues to have the
status of a dangerous offender under existing law.

 

15.              It
is obvious that the main reason the ""continuing status"" argument is
advanced is to forestall a claim that the appellant, in now seeking to have the
legality of his detention reviewed, is endeavouring to have the earlier
decisions of the British Columbia Courts reviewed in light of the 1983 Criminal
Code  amendments and the Charter , both of which came into force long
after the original sentence was pronounced and the appeal process exhausted.

 

16.              In
developing this argument, counsel for the appellant referred to several cases.
One was Mitchell v. Attorney General of Ontario (1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 225
(Ont. H.C.), where the status argument also appears to have been raised. The
facts of that case bear a considerable resemblance to the present. There, the
applicant, after having been convicted of fourteen property offences, was found
in 1970 to be an habitual criminal under the then existing habitual criminal
provisions of the Code and was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence.
In 1977, long after he had unsuccessfully appealed this sentence, the habitual
criminal legislation was repealed and the dangerous offender provisions of the Code
were enacted under which the applicant could not have been declared a dangerous
offender. After the enactment of the Charter , the applicant applied for
a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum with certiorari in aid,
and in the alternative for relief pursuant to s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

 

17.              The
judgment in that case affords support for that portion of the appellant's
argument that suggests that it is the present continuing detention, and not the
original sentence, that is being subjected to review and that so far as Charter 
review is concerned, this does not amount to giving it a retroactive or
retrospective application. Linden J. had this to say at p. 229:

 

The imposition of the sentence of preventive detention
is not being challenged in this application. Rather, the applicant has invited
this court to find that his continued detention pursuant to that
sentence violates his rights to be protected against cruel and unusual treatment
or punishment, and not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. The applicant
relies upon changes to the provisions of Pt. XXI of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, and the enactment of the Charter of Rights  in support of
these allegations. [Emphasis in original.]

 

At page
232, he continued:

 

                   Before passing on to the merits of
the application, it also should be noted that no issue as to the retroactive or
retrospective application of the Charter  arises on the facts of this case. This
application is based upon alleged infringements of the Charter  occurring at the
present time as a result of the continuing incarceration of the applicant. None
of the decisions of the various courts and of the parole board is being
challenged. Nor is the legality of the detention of the applicant prior to the
coming into force of the Charter  under attack.

 

18.              As
I read it, however, the Mitchell case gives the appellant no assistance
regarding that aspect of his argument that suggests that in order for his
detention to be valid, the crime for which he was convicted must still be a
serious personal injury offence that could justify an application under Part
XXI. Rather, as I read the judgment, Linden J. would not have released him on
that ground. His decision rests squarely on his view that if it could be shown
on a subsequent application that the applicant was not a menace to society but
was instead merely a social nuisance, his continued detention would amount to
cruel and unusual punishment and so be invalid as violating s. 12  of the Charter .
On the subsequent application, again before Linden J., the applicant's
continued detention was found to violate s. 12  and his release was ordered even
though he had twice earlier, when released, violated the terms of his parole
and despite the fact that the Parole Board had, even after Linden J.'s earlier
decision, refused to grant him parole.

 

19.              To
fall within the rationale of this case, therefore, the appellant would have to
establish that continued indeterminate detention for gross indecency in
circumstances like those in the present case constitutes cruel and unusual
punishment. Counsel for the appellant did argue the general proposition that
Part XXI was invalid as amounting among other things to cruel and unusual punishment
or arbitrary detention, but that argument fails for the reasons given in Lyons.
He also attempted to underline that the offence committed by the appellant did
not appear to be dangerous in the same sense as those now listed in Part XXI.
However, he at no time argued that, assuming the general validity of Part XXI,
it would amount to cruel and unusual punishment or arbitrary detention to
subject the appellant to indeterminate detention because the offence of which
he was convicted was not sufficiently dangerous to warrant such detention. It
would have been very difficult for him to do so. While there was no violence
involved, and so no element of dangerousness in that sense, the evidence
revealed that the appellant was a very manipulative person who engaged in a
pattern of behaviour in which he befriended young boys and then induced them to
participate in sexual activities by first getting them to drink to excess. The
evidence also revealed that the boys involved in the series of incidents that
led to the charges that resulted in his being declared a dangerous offender had
suffered varying degrees of psychological harm from these encounters. The
effect on one of them, for example, was described as ""very traumatic""
and as having ""affected the boy's development severely"". The
appellant is thus far from being merely a social nuisance like the applicant in
the Mitchell case, but has persisted in behaviour of a kind that could
cause injury, pain or other evil similar to the sexual offences still included
in s. 687(b). In my view, therefore, his continued detention for an
indeterminate period does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or
arbitrary detention.

 

20.              Counsel
for the appellant also relied on the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R.
v. Langevin (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336, as support for his continuing
status argument. In that case, the validity of s. 688 of the Code was
scrutinized by the Court of Appeal in light of the Charter , which had
been proclaimed since the trial judge's decision had been rendered. In
discussing the timing of the appeal, Lacourcière J.A., writing for the court,
noted at p. 352:

 

                   We agree with Mr. Frost's submission
that because the Charter  came into force after the appellant was found to be a
dangerous offender, the sections of the Charter  invoked by the appellant have
no application to the proceedings before Judge Carter and do not reach back and
affect them: R. v. Antoine (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 607 at p. 613, 5 C.C.C.
(3d) 97 at p. 102, 148 D.L.R. (3d) 149 at p. 155.

 

                   However, the time within which an
appeal could be taken was extended by the Associate Chief Justice of Ontario
and the appeal against the indeterminate sentence pursuant to s. 694 of the Code
is properly before us. This sentence, in turn, is based on the finding that
the appellant is a dangerous offender and this status of dangerous offender is
a continuing status necessary for the validity of the sentence and the
consequent detention. I conclude therefore that, on the appeal, the Court
has jurisdiction to determine, as a question of law, whether the sentence,
based on the continuing status, violates any right protected by the Charter .
[Emphasis added.]

 

21.              It
is unclear from the judgment, however, whether the reference to a
""continuing status"" in this passage was intended to have the broad
meaning and consequences which the appellant argues it has in this case, or
whether it was simply used to indicate that the case was still ""in the
system"" (see R. v. Wigman, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 246) as it had not yet
been appealed and therefore could be scrutinized by the Court of Appeal in
light of the Charter . The factual setting of the case and the court's
comments in other parts of the judgment (see for example p. 351) would support
the latter view. I do not, in any event, read this case as authority for the
continuing status argument as that argument was framed by the appellant.

 

22.              However
that may be, I am clearly of the opinion that this argument does not properly
reflect the nature, purpose or effect of the sentence imposed under Part XXI of
the Code. Nor is it supported by the plain wording of s. 688, which does
not on any view support the notion that the sentence is contingent on the
offender continuing to meet the requisites of any subsequent amendments to Part
XXI. The appellant's argument also misconceives the nature, purpose and effect
of the review procedure by the Parole Board mandated by s. 695.1. As I stated
in Lyons at pp. 342‑44:

 

It must be remembered that the offender is being
sentenced indeterminately because at the time of sentencing he was found
to have a certain propensity. The sentence is imposed ""in lieu of any
other sentence"" that might have been imposed and, like any other such
sentence, must be served according to its tenor. The offender is not being
sentenced to a term of imprisonment until he is no longer a dangerous offender.
Indeed, s. 695.1 provides that the circumstances of the offender be reviewed
for the purpose of determining whether parole should be granted and, if
so, on what conditions; it does not provide that the label of dangerous
offender be removed or altered....

 

                   It may be argued that the legislation
could be better tailored. For example, it might have been argued that the
review process should focus solely on whether the offender continued to possess
the characteristics that defined him or her as a proper subject of
indeterminate detention. Indeed, one might say that to ask, as the Parole Board
does, whether the individual has been reformed or rehabilitated, is to pose a
question that ex hypothesi cannot be answered affirmatively, for it was
implicit in the designation of the offender as dangerous that he or she was not
amenable to rehabilitation by usual means. However, this argument must be
rejected for a number of reasons.

 

                   To begin with, the criteria actually
used serve to emphasize the point made earlier in this judgment that
sentencing, even under Part XXI, embodies a complex of penological objectives.
I do not think it can be argued, either as a matter of logic or of common
sense, that by virtue of a decision to sentence an offender according to
considerations based primarily on prevention, other equally valid,
subsisting penal goals cease to be relevant. To reiterate, protecting society
from the dangerous offender never wholly supplants the other legitimate
objectives embodied in a Part XXI sentence.

 

                   Seen in this light it would be
preposterous to require of dangerous offenders only that they demonstrate to
the Parole Board that they have ceased to be ""dangerous"" (in terms
identical to those used in Part XXI), for this would require of them a lesser
showing than is required of other convicts. It seems to me that had s. 695.1
provided for a ""dangerous offender review"", rather than a parole
review, but borrowed the identical criteria employed in the Parole Act,
it would perhaps be more readily apparent that the review provided for does,
indeed, accomplish the requisite tailoring sufficient to sustain the
legislative scheme as a whole. Section 10(1)(a)(iii) requires the Board
to consider whether the release of the inmate would constitute an ""undue
risk"" to society; if the accused continues to be dangerous then, by
definition, this criterion remains unsatisfied. Section 10(1)(a) also
requires that the Board be satisfied that the inmate has derived the maximum
benefit from incarceration and that the inmate's reform and rehabilitation
would be aided by release.

 

                   These criteria seem to me to be no
less pertinent reflections of society's concerns in releasing dangerous
offenders than they are in releasing other offenders. [Emphasis in original.]

 

23.              In
sum, the appellant has the same protections as those afforded any other person
who is convicted of an offence and sentenced to a period of incarceration. He
had a right to appeal when the sentence was pronounced and he may apply for
parole at prescribed times. But like any other person who is properly convicted
and sentenced, he must otherwise serve his sentence according to its tenor.
This is not to say that the appellant is left without a remedy. As noted, he
has the right to be considered for parole every two years. If he can
demonstrate that he satisfies the criteria set out in s. 10(1)(a) of the
Parole Act, he will be paroled. Additionally, he may make an application
under s. 617  of the Criminal Code  for a rehearing or a reference of the
matter to a court of appeal. Accordingly, I am of the view that the appellant
must fail on the continuing status argument.

 

24.              Finally,
counsel for the appellant brought to our attention Art. 15 of the United
Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, G.A. Res.
2200A (XXI), 21 U.N. GAOR, Supp. (No. 16) 52, U.N. Doc. A/6316 (1966), to which
Canada adheres, under which it is provided that if subsequent to the commission
of an offence the penalty is reduced the offender is to benefit thereby.
Counsel concedes that it has not been adopted as part of the law, but he
submits that the Court should use the provision as an aid in interpreting ss. 9 
(arbitrary detention) and 12 (cruel and unusual punishment) of the Charter 
in a way that invalidates at least a penalty of the magnitude of an
indeterminate sentence at a time when that penalty could no longer be imposed.
But even assuming the present situation can be said to fall within the ambit of
the Article in the Covenant (which is by no means clear), it seems to me that
Linden J. in Mitchell, supra, has given a complete answer to this
argument. It is difficult to see how such an approach could be taken in light
of the fact that specific attention was given to this matter in s. 11 (i)
of the Charter , which limits the rights of an accused in this regard to
the benefit of a reduction in sentence made between the time of the commission
of the offence and the time of sentencing.

 

25.              In
light of the conclusions I have arrived at, it becomes unnecessary to consider
respondent's argument against Linden J.'s view in Mitchell, supra,
that the execution or the carrying out of the sentence, as opposed to its original
pronouncement, can be reviewed at any time under the Charter  without
retrospectively applying the latter's provisions to the original pronouncement
(see also R. v. Konechny (1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 233 (B.C.C.A.)) and I
refrain from doing so. Nor is it necessary for me to consider the
jurisdictional issues raised by the respondent.

 

Conclusion

 

26.              I
would dismiss this appeal. I would also, as is the case in Lyons, answer
the first constitutional question in the negative. It is therefore unnecessary
to address the second constitutional question. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

27.              Estey J. (dissenting)‑‑The
issue in this appeal is whether the continued detention of the appellant
violates a right guaranteed to him under the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  to be protected against cruel and unusual punishment (s. 12 ). This
appeal does not raise any issue respecting either the validity or the propriety
of his initial conviction or the imposition of the indeterminate sentence. Nor
does this appeal call into question the process leading up to conviction and
sentence. It is clear therefore that whether the appellant was
""dangerous"" at the time of sentencing under the provisions of the Code
then in force is not the question this Court is now being asked to address.

 

28.              In
my view there is here a violation of s. 12  of the Charter . For the
purposes of this appeal it can be said that the key to s. 12  is that there must
be a requisite degree of proportionality between the offence for which the
accused has been convicted and the sentence imposed by or under the statute.
See R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045.

 

29.              At
the time the appellant was found to be a dangerous offender under Part XXI of
the Criminal Code  it was necessary that the offence for which the
offender had been convicted be a ""serious personal injury offence"".
This was defined in s. 687 :

 

                   687. ...

 

""serious personal injury offence"" means

 

(a) an indictable offence (other than high
treason, treason, first degree murder or second degree murder) involving

 

(i) the use or attempted use of violence against
another person, or

 

(ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the
life or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe
psychological damage upon another person.

 

and for which the offender may be sentenced to
imprisonment for ten years or more, or

 

(b) an offence mentioned in section 144
(rape) or 145 (attempted rape) or an offence or attempt to commit an offence
mentioned in section 146 (sexual intercourse with a female under fourteen or
between fourteen and sixteen), 149 (indecent assault on a female), 156
(indecent assault on a male) or 157 (gross indecency).

 

Milne
was convicted on five counts of gross indecency.

 

30.              The
definition of ""serious personal injury offence"" was amended by S.C.
1980‑81‑82‑83, c. 125, s. 26, and subs. (b) no longer
includes the offence of gross indecency. Thus ""gross indecency"" has
ceased to be punishable by an indeterminate sentence. Put another way, gross indecency
has ceased to be grounds for a finding of constructive
""dangerousness"" under Part XXI of the Code. The offence of
gross indecency remains an indictable offence which carries a maximum
punishment of five years imprisonment (s. 157 ). It is clear therefore that if
Milne were convicted today he would not face the possibility of an
indeterminate sentence because he is no longer ""dangerous"" within the
statutory meaning.

 

31.              The
appellant has been imprisoned in a penitentiary since May 29, 1980. Depending
upon the sentence which would have been imposed for the five counts to which
the appellant pleaded guilty of gross indecency, the appellant has either
served the appropriate sentence or still has some time to serve.

 

32.              The
question now before the Court is whether in these circumstances the appellant
can be kept in prison.

 

33.              This
Court has held in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, that the imposition
of an indeterminate sentence does not per se violate the Charter .
The question in this appeal is quite different: Can there be a violation of the
Charter  when the very basis for the indeterminate detention has lost its
justificatory force when Parliament decided that the offence of gross indecency
is not one for which an indeterminate sentence is any longer appropriate? Under
his present sentence the appellant will continue to be incarcerated for an
indeterminate length of time although the offence for which he has been imprisoned
is one in respect of which Parliament has now ordained a finite sentence.
Whatever the law may have been prior to the Charter  with respect to the
treatment of prisoners serving sentences which have been revised by Parliament
subsequent to the sentencing, the advent of the Charter  has introduced
new standards. Prisoners in the position of the appellant now have rights
including those flowing from ss. 7 , 9  and 12  of the Charter . Section 7 
of the Charter  protects one's right to ""liberty"" and to
""security of the person"" against deprivation ""except in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"". It may be open to
some debate as to whether there existed any principle of fundamental justice
relating to the continued incarceration of a person in the situation of the
appellant, under the common law. Section 35(d) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑23, should be noted in this connection. It
provides:

 

                   35. Where an
enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) affect any offence committed against or
a violation of the provisions of the enactment so repealed, or any penalty,
forfeiture or punishment incurred under the enactment so repealed;

 

If this
provision does indeed purport to cover the events here unfolded, this provision
must be read along with s. 157  and Part XXI of the Criminal Code  in
determining whether this statutory ensemble can support a continued
imprisonment of the appellant. All of these statutory provisions must, if they
bear on the issue at all, give way to the Charter . The decision of this
Court in R. v. Wigman, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 246, does not reach this issue.

 

34.              It
has, however, long been an element of the criminal law of this country that
sentences must be proportionate to the offence committed. Parliament has now
found that the indeterminate sentence is no longer appropriate in respect of
the violation of s. 157  and presumably so because such imprisonment would be
disproportionate, in the view of Parliament, to the offence of gross indecency.
It might be said therefore that the appellant's continued imprisonment would in
these circumstances be a deprivation of liberty otherwise than in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

35.              It
might also be that the continued imprisonment of a person in the circumstances
of the appellant is ""arbitrary"" and hence contrary to s. 9  of the Charter .
Once the indefinite holding of a person convicted of gross indecency is no
longer authorized in the criminal law, such incarceration becomes capricious or
arbitrary and of course if so imposed after the amendment of Part XXI, would be
illegal. Accordingly, the continued incarceration of the appellant may be said
to have become capricious or arbitrary in the ordinary sense of that term as
employed in s. 9 . There can hardly be a rational basis or a justifiable basis
(subject to what is said below concerning the otherwise appropriate sentence
under s. 157 ) for the continued indefinite retention of the appellant. Without
deciding the appropriateness of ss. 7  and 9  under these circumstances, I turn
to the third apparently applicable Charter  provision.

 

36.              In
all the circumstances I would conclude that the continued imprisonment of the
appellant more clearly offends the right of the appellant under s. 12  of the Charter 
which provides:

 

                   12. Everyone has
the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.

 

37.              The
prospect of a person serving an indefinite sentence in a penitentiary for an
offence no longer attracting such a term of imprisonment under the Criminal
Code , must in our ordinary parlance be ""cruel and unusual"" as
this expression has been defined in Smith, supra. The Court is
here not dealing with unreasonable or otherwise offending legislation or even
legislative policy as invasive of a Charter  right. The Court is here
only concerned with the characterization in law of the servitude of the
appellant after the legislative change. It is not necessary to review the
historic background of ""cruel and unusual punishment"" as this has
been undertaken by Lamer J. in Smith, supra. Nor is there any
issue of curial deference to Parliament on issues of policy. Parliament has
already enunciated its policy with reference to the offence of gross indecency.
Unlike the Smith case, supra, the
""disproportionateness"" of the sentence was determined by Parliament
itself when it amended Part XXI. It only remains for the courts to apply the Charter 
as a matter of law to the present condition of the appellant.

 

38.              The
interwoven issues arising under the three Charter  sections mentioned
above render this appeal an unsatisfactory base for the extension of the
analysis of these rights beyond the discussion already undertaken in the Smith
appeal, supra. I conclude that whatever may be the case in respect to
ss. 7  and 9 , the continued imprisonment of the appellant under an indeterminate
sentence is a violation of the appellant's constitutional right under s. 12  of
the Charter .

 

39.              What
then is the appropriate disposition of this appeal?

 

40.              The
appropriate sentence for the appellant under s. 157  independent of the
provisions of Part XXI has never been assessed. The appellant pleaded guilty to
five counts of gross indecency. The maximum sentence under s. 157  is five years.
What the appropriate sentence would be, giving due attention to the principles
of totality and related offences, and other principles of sentencing which may
be appropriate in the circumstances revealed in this record, should be
determined by the trial judge, Denroche Prov. Ct. J. He is now functus
having validly disposed of the conviction and sentence of the appellant under
the law as it then existed.

 

41.              The
remedies here sought are habeas corpus with certiorari in aid or
a remedy under s. 24(1)  of the Charter . Habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid would (even assuming its availability notwithstanding s. 710 of the Code)
be inappropriate should time already served by the appellant be less than the
proper sentence, once determined, under s. 157 , Part XXI aside. In this
situation a court must turn to s. 24(1)  of the Charter . In my view,
""appropriate and just"" remedy in all the unusual circumstances which
have arisen in these proceedings, is a direction that this proceeding be remitted
to Denroche Prov. Ct. J. for the assessment of the appropriate sentence on the
five accounts to which the appellant has pleaded guilty. Should such sentence
be determined to exceed the time already served by the appellant, it shall be
directed that the appellant be retained in prison until such sentence shall
have been served, subject to any rights of the appellant to be released under
any applicable legislation. Should the appropriate sentence be for a period
less than that which the appellant has already served under the sentence
imposed in 1980, it shall be directed that the appellant should be released. 

 

                   The
following are the reasons delivered by

 

42.              Wilson J. (dissenting in
part)‑‑For the reasons I gave in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2
S.C.R. 309, I would allow the appeal, quash the order made under Part XXI of
the Criminal Code  and the sentence of indeterminate detention, and remit
the matter back to the learned trial judge for the imposition of the
appropriate determinate sentence.

 

43.              As
in the case of Lyons the accused had no knowledge at the time he pleaded
guilty to the offences of which he was convicted that the Crown prosecutor
intended, and indeed had already received instructions from the Attorney
General, to make an application under Part XXI of the Code. The Crown
was entitled under the provisions of the Code to function in this
fashion prior to the coming into force of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms , i.e., at the time the Part XXI order was made, but I do not
believe, for the reasons I gave in Lyons, that subsequent to the coming
into force of s. 7  of the Charter  his continued incarceration pursuant
to an order made in these circumstances can be justified. Accordingly, I believe
that he is entitled to relief under s. 24(1)  of the Charter .

            During an armed robbery in
a pool hall, appellant's accomplice shot and killed a client. The accomplice
managed to escape but appellant was arrested and convicted of second degree
murder as a party to the offence pursuant to ss. 21(2)  and 213 (d) of the
Criminal Code . Section 213 (d) provides that ""Culpable
homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while
committing or attempting to commit ... robbery ... whether or not the person
means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows that death
is likely to be caused to any human being, if ... he uses a weapon or has it
upon his person during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit the
offence ... and the death ensues as a consequence."" At his trial before
judge and jury, appellant testified that at the time of the robbery, he was
certain that the gun in possession of the accomplice was not loaded. He stated
that they had agreed to commit the robbery armed only with knives and when, on
the night of the crime, the accomplice arrived with a gun he insisted that it
be unloaded. The accomplice removed three bullets from the gun and gave them to
the appellant. Appellant's glove containing the three bullets was recovered by
the police at the scene of the crime. The Court of Appeal dismissed appellant's
appeal from conviction. In this Court, he challenged the constitutional
validity of s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code . This appeal raises
two constitutional questions: (1) Is section 213(d) of the Code
inconsistent with either ss. 7  or 11 (d) of the Charter  and,
therefore, of no force or effect? (2) If not, is the combination of ss. 21 and
213(d) of the Code inconsistent with either ss. 7  and 11 (d)
of the Charter  and is s. 21  therefore of no force or effect in the case
of a charge under s. 213 (d)?

 

            Held (McIntyre J. dissenting): The appeal
should be allowed and a new trial ordered. The first constitutional question
should be answered in the affirmative. No answer was given to the second
constitutional question.

 

            Per Dickson C.J. and Estey, Lamer and Wilson
JJ.: Prior to the enactment of the Charter , Parliament had full
legislative powers with respect to criminal law, including the determination of
the essential elements of any given crime. But the Charter  has
restricted these powers. Under section 7, if a conviction will result in a
deprivation of the life, liberty or security of the person of the accused, then
Parliament must respect the principles of fundamental justice. One of these
principles is that a minimum mental state is an essential element of an
offence. However, because of the special nature of the stigma attached to a
conviction for murder, the principles of fundamental justice require a mens
rea reflecting the particular nature of that crime. While the current view
of the justices is that such a conviction cannot rest on anything less than
proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight, for the purpose of
this appeal, it is sufficient to say that, as a principle of fundamental
justice, there cannot be a conviction in the absence of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of at least objective foreseeability.

 

            The presumption of
innocence in s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is offended when an accused
may be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt on an essential
element of the offence. Where Parliament substituted proof of a different
element for proof of an essential element, such substitution is
constitutionally valid if, upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the
substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact or a jury
not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the essential
element. Therefore, an accused cannot be found guilty of murder absent proof
beyond a reasonable doubt of at least objective foreseeability, and a murder
provision which allows a conviction in the absence of proof beyond reasonable
doubt of at least that essential element infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of
the Charter .

 

            In the present case, s.
213(d) of the Code is prima facie in violation of ss. 7 
and 11 (d) of the Charter . The mens rea required for s. 213 
consists of the mens rea for the underlying offence and the intent to
commit one of the acts set forth in paras. (a) to (d). Section
213  does not completely exclude the need to prove any objective foreseeability.
Rather, it has substituted for proof beyond a reasonable doubt of objective
foreseeability, if that is the essential element, proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of certain forms of intentional dangerous conduct causing death. But this
substitution is not constitutionally valid because it is still possible that,
notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the matters set forth in
paras. (a) and (d), a jury could reasonably be left in doubt as
to whether the accused ought to have known that death was likely to ensue.

 

            Section 213 (d)
cannot be saved by s. 1  of the Charter . It is clear that Parliament's
objective to deter the use or carrying of a weapon in the commission of certain
offences, because of the increased risk of death, was of sufficient importance
for the purpose of s. 1 . However, the measures adopted were not reasonable and
demonstrably justifiable. While these measures appear to be rationally
connected to the objective, they unduly impair the rights and freedoms in
question. Indeed, it is not necessary to convict of murder persons who did not
intend or foresee the death and who could not even have foreseen the death in
order to deter others from using or carrying weapons. If Parliament wishes to
deter the use or carrying of weapons, it should, as in s. 83 of the Code,
punish the use or carrying of weapons.

 

            Per Beetz and Le Dain JJ.: For the
reasons given by Lamer and La Forest JJ., s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code  does not conform to the principles of fundamental justice entrenched
in the Charter  and cannot be saved under s. 1 . For the reasons given by
Lamer J., s. 213 (d) also violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
and cannot be justified under s. 1 . Given these conclusions, it is not
necessary to decide whether there exists a principle of fundamental justice
that a conviction for murder cannot rest on anything less than proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.

 

            Per La Forest J.: Because of the stigma
attached to a conviction for murder, the principles of fundamental justice
require a mens rea reflecting the particular nature of that crime,
namely one referable to causing death. In addition to the intention to cause
death, this can include a closely related intention such as intention to cause
bodily harm likely to result in death combined with recklessness as to that
result. It is sufficient to say in this case that the mental element required
by s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  is so remote from the intention
specific to murder that a conviction under that paragraph violates fundamental
justice. The provision is so broad that under it a person may be found guilty
of murder even though the death was the result of an accident.

 

            Section 213(d) of
the Code cannot be saved by s. 1  of the Charter . The objective of
discouraging the use of weapons in the commission of crimes can be achieved by
means other than attaching the stigma of a conviction for murder to a person
who has caused death in the circumstances like those described in the
provision.

 

            Per McIntyre J. (dissenting): The two
constitutional questions should be answered in the negative. Parliament has
decided that possession and use of weapons in the course of the commission of
offences is a gravely aggravating factor and has chosen to term a killing
arising in the circumstances described in s. 213 (d) as murder. While it
may be illogical to characterize an unintentional killing as murder, no
principle of fundamental justice is offended because serious criminal conduct,
involving the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the killing of a
human being, is classified as murder and not in some other manner.

 

            In this case, the accused
was properly convicted of murder under the combined effect of ss. 21(2) and
213(d) of the Code. The terms of s. 21(2)  were fully met as there
was evidence of the accused's active participation in the commission of the
robbery, the underlying offence. The section gives expression to a principle of
joint criminal liability long accepted and applied in the criminal law, and
there is no basis upon which one could exempt conduct which attracts criminal
liability, under s. 213 of the Code, from the application of that
principle.

Introduction

 

1                 Vaillancourt was convicted of
second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury in Montréal. He
appealed to the Quebec Court of Appeal, arguing that the judge's charge to the
jury on the combined operation of ss. 213(d) and 21(2) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, was incorrect. His appeal was dismissed
and the conviction was affirmed: (1984), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 75. Before this Court,
he has challenged the constitutional validity of s. 213(d) alone and in
combination with s. 21(2) under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

The Facts

 

2                 For the purposes of this appeal,
the Crown does not contest the following statement of the facts.

 

3                 The appellant and his accomplice
committed an armed robbery in a pool hall. The appellant was armed with a knife
and his accomplice with a gun. During the robbery, the appellant remained near
the front of the hall while the accomplice went to the back. There was a
struggle between the accomplice and a client. A shot was fired and the client
was killed. The accomplice managed to escape and has never been found. The
appellant was arrested at the scene.

 

4                 In the course of his testimony,
the appellant said that he and his accomplice had agreed to commit this robbery
armed only with knives. On the night of the robbery, however, the accomplice
arrived at their meeting place with a gun. The appellant said that he objected
because, on a previous armed robbery, his gun had discharged accidentally, and
he did not want that to happen again. He insisted that the gun be unloaded. The
accomplice removed three bullets from the gun and gave them to the appellant.
The appellant then went to the bathroom and placed the bullets in his glove.
The glove was recovered by the police at the scene of the crime and was found
at trial to contain three bullets. The appellant testified that, at the time of
the robbery, he was certain that the gun was unloaded.

 

Constitutional Questions

 

5                 Before this Court, the following
constitutional questions were formulated:

 

1. Is section 213(d) of the Criminal
Code  inconsistent with the provisions of either s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and, therefore, of no force
or effect?

 

2. If not, is the combination of s. 21 
and s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  inconsistent with the
provisions of either s. 7  or s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and is s. 21  of the Criminal Code  therefore of
no force or effect in the case of a charge under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code ?

 

The Law

 

Narrowing the Issue

 

6                 The appellant has framed his
attack on s. 213(d) of the Code in very wide terms. He has argued
that the principles of fundamental justice require that, before Parliament can
impose any criminal liability for causing a particular result, there must be
some degree of subjective mens rea in respect of that result. This is a
fundamental question with far reaching consequences . If this case were decided
on that basis, doubt would be cast on the constitutional validity of many
provisions throughout our Criminal Code , in particular s. 205(5) (a),
whereby causing death by means of an unlawful act is culpable homicide, and s.
212 (c) whereby objective foreseeability of the likelihood of death is
sufficient for a murder conviction in certain circumstances.

 

7                 However, the appellant was
convicted under s. 213 (d) and the constitutional question is limited to
this provision. In my opinion, the validity of s. 213 (d) can be decided
on somewhat narrower grounds. In addition, the Attorney General of Canada has
seen fit not to intervene to support the constitutionality of s. 213 (d),
which is clearly in jeopardy in this case, though he may have intervened to
support ss. 205(5)(a) and 212(c) and other similar provisions. I
will thus endeavour not to make pronouncements the effect of which will be to
predispose in obiter of other issues more properly dealt with if and
when the constitutionality of the other provisions is in issue. I do, however,
find it virtually impossible to make comments as regards s. 213 (d) that
will not have some effect on the validity of the rest of s. 213  or that will
not reveal to some extent my views as regards s. 212(c). However, the
validity of those sections and of paras. (a) to (c) of s. 213  is
not in issue here and I will attempt to limit my comments to s. 213 (d).

 

8                 The appellant has also
challenged the combined operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213 (d). Given my
decision on the validity of s. 213 (d) and in view of the importance of
s. 21(2) and the absence of the Attorney General of Canada, I do not find it
necessary or advisable to deal with s. 21(2) in this appeal.

 

Analysis of s. 213 (d)

 

Section
213 (d) in the Context of the Murder Provisions

 

9                 It is first necessary to analyze
s. 213 (d) in the context of the other murder provisions in the Code
in order to determine its true nature and scope. Murder is defined as a
culpable homicide committed in the circumstances set out at ss. 212 and 213 of
the Code. There is a very interesting progression through s. 212  to s.
213  with respect to the mental state that must be proven.

 

10               The starting point is s. 212(a)(i),
which provides:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide is murder

 

(a) where the person who
causes the death of a human being

 

(i) means to cause his death,

 

This clearly requires that the accused
have actual subjective foresight of the likelihood of causing the death coupled
with the intention to cause that death. This is the most morally blameworthy
state of mind in our system.

 

11               There is a slight relaxation of
this requirement in s. 212(a)(ii), which provides:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide is murder

 

(a) where
the person who causes the death of a human being

 

                                                                             ...

 

(ii) means to cause him bodily
harm that he knows is likely to cause his death, and is reckless whether death
ensues or not;

 

Here again the accused must have
actual subjective foresight of the likelihood of death. However, the Crown need
no longer prove that he intended to cause the death but only that he was
reckless whether death ensued or not. It should also be noted that s. 212(a)(ii)
is limited to cases where the accused intended to cause bodily harm to the
victim.

 

12               Section 212(c) provides:

 

                   212. Culpable homicide is murder

 

                                                                             ...

 

(c) where a person, for an
unlawful object, does anything that he knows or ought to know is likely to
cause death, and thereby causes death to a human being, notwithstanding that he
desires to effect his object without causing death or bodily harm to any human
being.

 

In part, this is simply a more general
form of recklessness and thus the logical extension of s. 212(a)(ii), in
that it applies when the accused ""does anything that he knows . . .
is likely to cause death"" (emphasis added). However, there is also a
further relaxation of the mental element required for murder in that it is also
murder where the accused ""does anything that he . . . ought to know
is likely to cause death"" (emphasis added). This eliminates the
requirement of actual subjective foresight and replaces it with objective
foreseeability or negligence.

 

13               The final relaxation in the
definition of murder occurs at s. 213 :

 

                   213. Culpable homicide is murder
where a person causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting
to commit high treason or treason or an offence mentioned in section 52
(sabotage), 76 (piratical acts), 76.1 (hijacking an aircraft), 132 or subsection
133(1) or sections 134 to 136 (escape or rescue from prison or lawful custody),
143 or 145 (rape or attempt to commit rape), 149 or 156 (indecent assault),
subsection 246(2) (resisting lawful arrest), 247 (kidnapping and forcible
confinement), 302 (robbery), 306 (breaking and entering) or 389 or 390 (arson),
whether or not the person means to cause death to any human being and whether
or not he knows that death is likely to be caused to any human being, if

 

(a) he means to cause
bodily harm for the purpose of

 

(i) facilitating the commission
of the offence, or

 

(ii) facilitating his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the death ensues from the bodily
harm;

 

(b) he administers a
stupefying or overpowering thing for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a),
and the death ensues therefrom;

 

(c) he wilfully stops, by
any means, the breath of a human being for a purpose mentioned in paragraph (a),
and the death ensues therefrom; or

 

(d) he uses a weapon or
has it upon his person

 

(i) during or at the time he
commits or attempts to commit the offence, or

 

(ii) during or at the time of his
flight after committing or attempting to commit the offence,

 

and the death ensues as a consequence.

 

Under this provision, it is murder if
the accused causes the victim's death while committing or attempting to commit
one of the enumerated offences if he performs one of the acts in paras. (a)
to (d). Proof that the accused performed one of the acts in paras. (a)
to (d) is substituted for proof of any subjective foresight or even
objective foreseeability of the likelihood of death.

 

14               I should add that there appears to
be a further relaxation of the mental state when the accused is a party to the
murder through s. 21(2) of the Code as in this case. However, as I have
said, it is sufficient to deal with s. 213 (d) in order to dispose of
this appeal.

 

The
Historical Development of s. 213 

 

15               Although the concept of felony
murder has a long history at common law, a brief review of the historical
development of s. 213  indicates that its legitimacy is questionable.

 

16               In the early history of English
criminal law, murdrum or murder referred to a secret killing or the
killing of a Dane or, later, a Norman by an Englishman and to the fine levied
on the township where the killing occurred. By the early 14th century, the
fines had been abandoned and murder had come to be the name used to describe
the worst kind of homicide. The expression ""malice aforethought"" was
subsequently adopted to distinguish murder from manslaughter, which denoted all
culpable homicides other than murder. Malice aforethought was not limited to
its natural and obvious sense of premeditation, but would be implied whenever
the killing was intentional or reckless. In these instances, the malice was
present and it is the premeditation which was implied by law.

 

17               Coke took this one step further
and implied both the malice and the premeditation in cases where the death
occurred in the commission of an unlawful act. He wrote in The Third Part of
the Institutes of the Laws of England (London: W. Clarke & Sons, 1817),
at p. 56:

 

                   Unlawfull. If the act be unlawful it is murder.
As if A. meaning to steale a deere in the park of B, shooteth at the deer, and
by the glance of the arrow killeth a boy that is hidden in a bush: this is
murder, for that the act was unlawfull, although A. had no intent to hurt the
boy, nor knew not of him. But if B. the owner of the park had shot at his own
deer, and without any ill intent had killed the boy by the glance of his arrow,
this had been homicide by misadventure, and no felony.

 

                   So if one shoot at
any wild fowle upon a tree, and the arrow killeth any reasonable creature afar
off, without any evill intent in him, this is per infortunium: for it
was not unlawful to shoot at the wilde fowle: but if he had shot at a cock or
hen, or any tame fowle of another mans, and the arrow by mischance had killed a
man, this had been murder, for the act was unlawfull.

 

18               Coke's statement of the unlawful
act murder rule has been much criticized. Stephen demonstrated that Coke's
statement was not supported by the authorities cited (A History of the
Criminal Law of England (1883), vol. 3, at pp. 57‑58). Further, a
recent author has suggested that Coke's statement was just ""a slip of the
quill"" and that Coke intended to say that accidental killing by an
unlawful act was manslaughter (see D. Lanham, ""Felony Murder‑‑Ancient
and Modern"" (1983), 7 Crim. L.J. 90, at pp. 92‑94). Other
17th century writers (Dalton, Countrey Justice (1619), at pp. 225‑26,
and Hale, History of the Pleas of the Crown (1736), vol. 1, at p. 475)
and cases (Sir John Chichester's Case (1647), Aleyn 12, 82 E.R. 888, and
Hull's Case (1664), Kelyng, J. 40) rejected the unlawful act murder rule
as set out by Coke. Despite all of this, Coke's doctrine seems to have been
accepted by the writers and the cases in the 18th century, and their only
contribution was to limit it to killings in the course of felonies (see R.
v. Plummer (1702), Kelyng, J. 109, 84 E.R. 1103, at p. 1107; Hawkins, Pleas
of the Crown (1716), vol. 1, ch. 29, s. 11 ; R. v. Woodburne and Coke
(1722), 16 St. Tr. 53; Foster, Crown Law (1762), at p. 258; East, Pleas
of the Crown (1803), vol. 1, at p. 255). Of course, at that time, both the
underlying felony and the murder were punishable by death, so the definition of
a homicide in the course of a felony as a murder had little practical effect.

 

19               In the 19th century, the felony
murder rule was accepted as part of the common law (see Stephen's Digest of
the Criminal Law (9th ed. 1950), art. 264(c)). However, the rule was
strongly criticized by Stephen, who labelled it ""cruel"" and
""monstrous"" (A History of the Criminal Law of England, supra,
at p. 75).

 

20               Despite the rule's questionable
origins and the subsequent criticisms, s. 175 of the English Draft Code of 1879
included a restricted form of felony murder which was subsequently adopted in
the first Canadian Criminal Code in 1892. Through subsequent amendments,
this provision has been widened and it is now s. 213 . It is more restricted
than the common law rule in that it is limited to deaths occurring in the
commission of certain enumerated offences and it requires that the accused have
committed one of the acts set out in paras. (a) to (d).

 

21               Section 213 and its predecessors
in the Code have long been subject to academic criticism (see J. Willis,
""Case and Comment"" (1951), 29 Can. Bar Rev. 784, at pp. 794‑96;
J. Ll. J. Edwards, ""Constructive Murder in Canadian and English Law""
(1961), 3 Crim. L.Q. 481, at pp. 506‑9; A. Hooper, ""Some
Anomalies and Developments in the Law of Homicide"" (1967), 3 U.B.C. L.
Rev. 55, at pp. 75‑77; P. Burns and R. S. Reid, ""From Felony
Murder to Accomplice Felony Attempted Murder: The Rake's Progress
Compleat?"" (1977), 55 Can. Bar Rev. 75, at pp. 103‑5; G.
Parker, An Introduction to Criminal Law (1977), at pp. 145‑48; D.
Stuart, Canadian Criminal Law (1982), at pp. 222‑25; I. Grant and
A. W. MacKay, ""Constructive Murder and the Charter : In Search of
Principle"" (1987), 25 Alta. L. Rev. 129; cf. A. W. Mewett
and M. Manning, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985), at p. 545). It has also
been subject to judicial criticism. In R. v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R.
124, Dickson J., as he then was, wrote that s. 213  seemed harsh (p. 130). In R.
v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, dealing with the mens rea of
attempted murder, McIntyre J. wrote at pp. 250‑51:

 

                   It was argued, and
it has been suggested in some of the cases and academic writings on the
question, that it is illogical to insist upon a higher degree of mens rea
for attempted murder, while accepting a lower degree amounting to recklessness
for murder. I see no merit in this argument. The intent to kill is the highest
intent in murder and there is no reason in logic why an attempt to murder,
aimed at the completion of the full crime of murder, should have any lesser
intent. If there is any illogic in this matter, it is in the statutory
characterization of unintentional killing as murder. [Emphasis added.]

 

22               Finally, the Law Reform Commission
of Canada criticized s. 213  in Homicide (1984), Working Paper 33, at pp.
47‑51, and excluded the notion of constructive murder from its Draft
Criminal Code (Recodifying Criminal Law (1986), Report 30, cl. 6(3), at
p. 54).

 

Felony
Murder in Other Jurisdictions

 

23               Felony murder is a peculiarly
common law concept which appears to be unknown outside a small circle of common
law jurisdictions, and it has not fared well in those jurisdictions. In the
United Kingdom, where the rule originated, it was abolished by the Homicide
Act, 1957, 5 & 6 Eliz. 2, c. 11 (U.K.) The rule is still quite
widespread in the United States, though it is said to be in decline (R. M.
Perkins and R. N. Boyce, Criminal Law (3rd ed. 1982), at p. 70). The
rule has been abolished by statute or by the courts in several jurisdictions
(see People v. Aaron, 299 N.W.2d 304 (Mich. 1980), State v. Doucette,
470 A.2d 676 (Vt. 1983)), and it has been downgraded to manslaughter in others.
In addition, the courts and the legislatures have limited the scope of the
common law rule by limiting the felonies to which it is applicable, requiring
some degree of mens rea with respect to the death, establishing
affirmative defences or limiting the punishments available. The rule also
exists in New Zealand and certain Australian states but it is narrower and
abolition has been recommended in some jurisdictions.

 

Section 213(d) and the Charter

 

24               This appeal calls into play two
principles of fundamental justice.

 

The
First Principle: The Essential Elements of Certain Crimes and s. 7  of the Charter 

 

25               Prior to the enactment of the Charter ,
Parliament had full legislative power with respect to ""The Criminal
Law"" (Constitution Act, 1867 , s. 91(27) ), including the
determination of the essential elements of any given crime. It could prohibit
any act and impose any penal consequences for infringing the prohibition,
provided only that the prohibition served ""a public purpose which can
support it as being in relation to criminal law"" (Reference re Validity
of s. 5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] S.C.R. 1, at p. 50; appeal to
the Privy Council dismissed, [1951] A.C. 179). Once the legislation was found
to have met this test, the courts had very little power to review the substance
of the legislation. For example, in R. v. Corporation of the City of Sault
Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, Dickson J., as he then was, held that,
when an offence was criminal in the true sense, there was a presumption that
the prosecution must prove the mens rea. However, it was always open to
Parliament expressly to relieve the prosecution of its obligation to prove any
part of the mens rea, as it is said to have done in s. 213 of the Code
with respect to the foreseeability of the death of the victim. It is thus clear
that, prior to the enactment of the Charter , the validity of s. 213 
could not have been successfully challenged.

 

26               However, federal and provincial
legislatures have chosen to restrict through the Charter  this power with
respect to criminal law. Under section 7, if a conviction, given either the
stigma attached to the offence or the available penalties, will result in a
deprivation of the life, liberty or security of the person of the accused, then
Parliament must respect the principles of fundamental justice. It has been
argued that the principles of fundamental justice in s. 7  are only procedural
guarantees. However, in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486,
this Court rejected that argument and used s. 7  to review the substance of the
legislation. As a result, while Parliament retains the power to define the
elements of a crime, the courts now have the jurisdiction and, more important,
the duty, when called upon to do so, to review that definition to ensure that
it is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

27               This Court's decision in Re
B.C. Motor Vehicle Act stands for the proposition that absolute liability
infringes the principles of fundamental justice, such that the combination of
absolute liability and a deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person
is a restriction on one's rights under s. 7 and is prima facie a
violation thereof. In effect, Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act acknowledges
that, whenever the state resorts to the restriction of liberty, such as
imprisonment, to assist in the enforcement of a law, even, as in Re B.C.
Motor Vehicle Act, a mere provincial regulatory offence, there is, as a
principle of fundamental justice, a minimum mental state which is an essential
element of the offence. It thus elevated mens rea from a presumed
element in Sault Ste. Marie, supra, to a constitutionally
required element. Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act did not decide what level of
mens rea was constitutionally required for each type of offence, but
inferentially decided that even for a mere provincial regulatory offence at
least negligence was required, in that at least a defence of due
diligence must always be open to an accused who risks imprisonment upon
conviction. In Sault Ste. Marie, Dickson J. stated at pp. 1309‑10:

 

Where the offence is criminal, the
Crown must establish a mental element, namely, that the accused who committed
the prohibited act did so intentionally or recklessly, with knowledge of the
facts constituting the offence, or with wilful blindness toward them. Mere
negligence is excluded from the concept of the mental element required for
conviction. Within the context of a criminal prosecution a person who fails to
make such enquiries as a reasonable and prudent person would make, or who fails
to know facts he should have known, is innocent in the eyes of the law.

 

It may well be that, as a general
rule, the principles of fundamental justice require proof of a subjective mens
rea with respect to the prohibited act, in order to avoid punishing the
""morally innocent"". It must be remembered, however, that Dickson J.
was dealing with the mens rea to be presumed in the absence of an
express legislative disposition, and not the mens rea to be required in
all legislation providing for a restriction on the accused's life, liberty or
security of the person. In any event, this case involves criminal liability for
the result of an intentional criminal act, and it is arguable that different
considerations should apply to the mental element required with respect to that
result. There are many provisions in the Code requiring only objective
foreseeability of the result or even only a causal link between the act and the
result. As I would prefer not to cast doubt on the validity of such provisions in
this case, I will assume, but only for the purposes of this appeal, that
something less than subjective foresight of the result may, sometimes, suffice
for the imposition of criminal liability for causing that result through
intentional criminal conduct.

 

28               But, whatever the minimum mens
rea for the act or the result may be, there are, though very few in number,
certain crimes where, because of the special nature of the stigma attached to a
conviction therefor or the available penalties, the principles of fundamental
justice require a mens rea reflecting the particular nature of that
crime. Such is theft, where, in my view, a conviction requires proof of some
dishonesty. Murder is another such offence. The punishment for murder is the
most severe in our society and the stigma that attaches to a conviction for
murder is similarly extreme. In addition, murder is distinguished from
manslaughter only by the mental element with respect to the death. It is thus
clear that there must be some special mental element with respect to the death
before a culpable homicide can be treated as a murder. That special mental
element gives rise to the moral blameworthiness which justifies the stigma and
sentence attached to a murder conviction. I am presently of the view that it is
a principle of fundamental justice that a conviction for murder cannot rest on
anything less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.
Given the effect of this view on part of s. 212(c), for the reasons I
have already given for deciding this case more narrowly, I need not and will
not rest my finding that s. 213(d) violates the Charter  on this
view, because s. 213 (d) does not, for reasons I will set out hereinafter,
even meet the lower threshold test of objective foreseeability. I will
therefore, for the sole purpose of this appeal, go no further than say that it
is a principle of fundamental justice that, absent proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of at least objective foreseeability, there surely cannot be a murder
conviction.

 

The
Second Principle: s. 11 (d) and the Burden of Persuasion

 

29               The presumption of innocence in s.
11 (d) of the Charter  requires at least that an accused be
presumed innocent until his guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt: Dubois
v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 350, at p. 357; R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 103, at pp. 120‑21. This means that, before an accused can be
convicted of an offence, the trier of fact must be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt of the existence of all of the essential elements of the offence. These
essential elements include not only those set out by the legislature in the
provision creating the offence but also those required by s. 7  of the Charter .
Any provision creating an offence which allows for the conviction of an accused
notwithstanding the existence of a reasonable doubt on any essential element
infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d).

 

30               Clearly, this will occur where the
provision requires the accused to disprove on a balance of probabilities an
essential element of the offence by requiring that he raise more than just a
reasonable doubt. It is for this reason that this Court struck down the reverse
onus provision in s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1,
in Oakes, supra.

 

31               Sections 7 and 11(d) will
also be infringed where the statutory definition of the offence does not
include an element which is required under s. 7 . As Dickson C.J. wrote for the
majority of the Court in Oakes, supra, at pp. 132‑33:

 

                   In general one
must, I think, conclude that a provision which requires an accused to disprove
on a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an
important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption of
innocence in s. 11 (d). If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a
balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence, it would be
possible for a conviction to occur despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.
This would arise if the accused adduced sufficient evidence to raise a
reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but did not convince the jury on a
balance of probabilities that the presumed fact was untrue. [Emphasis added.]

 

It is clear from this passage that
what offends the presumption of innocence is the fact that an accused may be convicted
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt on an essential element of the
offence, and I do not think that it matters whether this results from the
existence of a reverse onus provision or from the elimination of the need to
prove an essential element. With respect, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal was
thus clearly incorrect when it stated in R. v. Bezanson (1983), 8 C.C.C.
(3d) 493, at p. 508:

 

In my view, there was no attempt by
Parliament to reverse the onus of proof under s. 213 , and s. 11 (d) of
the Charter  has no application. Parliament has not reversed the burden of
proof, it has simply omitted what the appellant argues is an essential element
from the definition of the offence so that no evidence is required at all on
that issue.

 

The omission of an essential element
does bring s. 11 (d) into play.

 

32               Finally, the legislature, rather
than simply eliminating any need to prove the essential element, may substitute
proof of a different element. In my view, this will be constitutionally valid
only if upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of the substituted element it would
be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond reasonable
doubt of the existence of the essential element. If the trier of fact may have
a reasonable doubt as to the essential element notwithstanding proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of the substituted element, then the substitution infringes
ss. 7  and 11 (d).

 

33               Given the first principle I have
enunciated earlier and my assumption for the sole purpose of disposing of this
appeal with respect to objective foreseeability, an accused cannot be found
guilty of murder absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt of that element, and a
murder provision which allows a conviction in the absence of proof beyond
reasonable doubt of at least that essential element infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d).

 

Application
of the Principles to s. 213

 

34               The mens rea required for
s. 213 consists of the mens rea for the underlying offence and the
intent to commit one of the acts set forth in paras. (a) to (d) (Swietlinski
v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 956). Section 213 does not impose on the
accused the burden of disproving objective foreseeability. Further, it does not
completely exclude the need to prove any objective foreseeability. Rather, s.
213 has substituted for proof beyond a reasonable doubt of objective
foreseeability, if that is the essential element, proof beyond a reasonable
doubt of certain forms of intentional dangerous conduct causing death.

 

35               The question is, therefore, can
Parliament make this substitution without violating ss. 7  and 11 (d)? As
I have discussed earlier, if Parliament frames the section so that, upon proof
of the conduct, it would be unreasonable for a jury not to conclude beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused ought to have known that death was likely to
ensue, then I think that Parliament has enacted a crime which is tantamount to
one which has objective foreseeability as an essential element, and, if
objective foreseeability is sufficient, then it would not be in violation of s.
7  or s. 11 (d) in doing so in that way. The acid test of the
constitutionality of s. 213 is this ultimate question: Would it be possible
for a conviction for murder to occur under s. 213 despite the jury having a
reasonable doubt as to whether the accused ought to have known that death was
likely to ensue? If the answer is yes, then the section is prima facie
in violation of ss. 7  and 11 (d). I should add in passing that if the
answer is no, then it would be necessary to decide whether objective
foreseeability is sufficient for a murder conviction. However, because in my
view the answer is yes and because I do not want to pass upon the
constitutionality of s. 212(c) in this case, I will not address that
issue.

 

36               To varying degrees it can be said
that in almost any case a jury satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that an
accused has done one of the prohibited acts described in paras. (a) to (d)
will be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused ought to have
known that death was likely to be caused. But not always. Indeed, as a first
example, drunkenness would under certain circumstances leave the jury in doubt
in that regard. The rule as regards the effect of drunkenness on objective
foreseeability was unanimously laid down by this Court in R. v. Vasil,
[1981] 1 S.C.R. 469, a murder prosecution under s. 212(c). This Court
addressed the issue at some length and then summarized its conclusion as
follows, per Lamer J. at pp. 500‑501:

 

(5) Whilst the test under 212(c)
is objective and the behaviour of the accused is to be measured by that of the
reasonable man, such a test must nevertheless be applied having regard, not to
the knowledge a reasonable man would have had of the surrounding circumstances
that allegedly made the accused's conduct dangerous to life, but to the
knowledge the accused had of those circumstances;

 

(6) As a result, drunkenness,
though not relevant in the determination of what a reasonable man, with the
knowledge the accused had of those circumstances, would have anticipated, is
relevant in the determination of the knowledge which the accused had of those
circumstances.

 

It is clear to me that under s. 213 as
drafted there will be cases where the effect of drunkenness on an accused's
knowledge of the circumstances would leave a jury with a reasonable doubt as to
whether the accused ought to have known of the likelihood of death ensuing,
even though it has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused
actually did one of the acts described under paras. (a) to (d).

 

37               A second example, and this case
amply illustrates the point, is the accused who is brought into s. 213 not as a
principal but through the operation of s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . In
R. v. Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638, this Court had the opportunity to
consider the combined operation of ss. 21(2)  and 213  (s. 202  at the time).
Cartwright C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court, stated at pp. 645‑46.

 

At the risk of repetition, it is my
opinion that on the true construction of s. 202  and s. 21(2)  as applied to the
circumstances of this case it was necessary to support a verdict of guilty
against the respondent that the Crown should establish (i) that it was in fact
a probable consequence of the prosecution of the common purpose of the
respondent and Frank to rob Mrs. Vollet that Frank for the purpose of
facilitating the commission of the robbery would intentionally cause bodily
harm to Mrs. Vollet, (ii) that it was known or ought to have been known to the
respondent that such consequence was probable and (iii) that in fact Mrs.
Vollet's death ensued from the bodily harm. It was not necessary for the
Crown to establish that the respondent knew or ought to have known that it was
probable that Mrs. Vollet's death would ensue. [Emphasis added.]

 

It is clear that an accused can be
convicted of murder under the combined operation of ss. 21(2) and 213 in
circumstances where the death was not objectively foreseeable. As section 21(2)
requires proof of objective foreseeability, the culprit, in my view, must be s.
213.

 

38               These two examples suffice, in my
view, for one to conclude that notwithstanding proof beyond a reasonable doubt
of the matters set forth in paras. (a) to (d) a jury could
reasonably be left in doubt as regards objective foreseeability of the
likelihood that death be caused. In other words, s. 213 will catch an accused
who performs one of the acts in paras. (a) to (d) and thereby
causes a death but who otherwise would have been acquitted of murder because he
did not foresee and could not reasonably have foreseen that death would be
likely to result. For that reason, s. 213 prima facie violates ss. 7  and
11 (d). It is thus not necessary to decide whether objective foreseeability
is sufficient for murder as s. 213 does not even meet that standard. This takes
us to s. 1  for the second phase of the constitutional inquiry.

 

Section 1 

 

39               Finding that s. 213  of the Criminal
Code  infringes ss. 7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  does not end
the inquiry on the constitutional validity of s. 213 . Any or all of paras. (a)
to (d) of s. 213  can still be upheld as a reasonable limit
""demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"" under s. 1 
of the Charter .

 

40               In this case and at this stage of
the inquiry, we need only consider para. (d) of s. 213 . The criteria to
be assessed under s. 1  have been set out by this Court in several cases,
particularly R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, and R.
v. Oakes, supra. First, the objective which the measures are
designed to serve must be ""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding
a constitutionally protected right or freedom"" (Big M Drug Mart, supra,
at p. 352). Through s. 213(d) of the Code, Parliament intended to
deter the use or carrying of a weapon in the commission of certain offences,
because of the increased risk of death. In my view, it is clear that this
objective is sufficiently important.

 

41               In addition, the measures adopted
must be reasonable and demonstrably justified. The measures adopted appear to
be rationally connected to the objective: indiscriminately punishing for murder
all those who cause a death by using or carrying a weapon, whether the death
was intentional or accidental, might well be thought to discourage the use and
the carrying of weapons. I believe, however, that the measures adopted would
unduly impair the rights and freedoms in question (see Big M Drug Mart, supra,
at p. 352). It is not necessary to convict of murder persons who did not intend
or foresee the death and who could not even have foreseen the death in order to
deter others from using or carrying weapons. If Parliament wishes to deter the
use or carrying of weapons, it should punish the use or carrying of weapons. A
good example of this is the minimum imprisonment for using a firearm in the
commission of an indictable offence under s. 83  of the Criminal Code . In
any event, the conviction for manslaughter which would result instead of a
conviction for murder is punishable by, from a day in jail, to confinement for
life in a penitentiary. Very stiff sentences when weapons are involved in the
commission of the crime of manslaughter would sufficiently deter the use or carrying
of weapons in the commission of crimes. But stigmatizing the crime as murder
unnecessarily impairs the Charter  right.

 

42               In my view, therefore, s. 213(d)
of the Code is not saved by s. 1 .

 

Conclusion

 

43               As a result of the foregoing, I
would answer the first constitutional question in the affirmative, as s. 213 (d)
violates both s. 7  and s. 11 (d) of the Charter , and I would
declare s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  to be of no force or
effect. I would, for the reasons which I have given, decline to answer the
second constitutional question. It follows that the appeal must be allowed, the
appellant's conviction for murder set aside, and a new trial ordered.

 

                   The reasons of
Beetz and Le Dain JJ. were delivered by

 

44               Beetz
J.‑‑For the reasons given by Justice Lamer and Justice La
Forest, I agree that s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  does not
conform to the principles of fundamental justice entrenched in the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and cannot be saved under s. 1 . I also agree
with Lamer J. that s. 213(d) of the Code violates s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  and cannot be justified under s. 1  of the Charter .

 

45               Given these conclusions, I do not
find it necessary to decide whether there exists a principle of fundamental
justice that a conviction for murder cannot rest on anything less than proof
beyond a reasonable doubt of subjective foresight.

 

46               I would dispose of the appeal in
the manner proposed by Lamer J. and answer the first constitutional question as
he does. I would also decline to answer the second constitutional question.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

47               McIntyre
J. (dissenting)‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the
reasons for judgment in this appeal prepared by my colleague, Lamer J. I find
myself unable to agree with his disposition of the appeal and, with the
greatest respect for his view on the matter, I would dismiss the appeal and
answer both constitutional questions in the negative.

 

48               My colleague has set out the facts
of the case. They need not be repeated here. It is evident as well from his
reasons that, save for the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , he
is in agreement that the appellant would be properly convicted of murder under
the combined effect of s. 21(2)  and s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code .
He would allow the appeal essentially on the basis that a conviction for murder
which will result in the deprivation of liberty or security of the person of
the accused can only be upheld if, in accordance with the terms of s. 7  of the Charter ,
it is procured in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. While
Parliament has the power to define the elements of a crime, in his view the
courts must now review that definition to insure that it is in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice. These principles would require that
there be no murder conviction without proof of a mens rea of at least
objective foreseeability of death. Such foreseeability is not a necessary
requirement under s. 213(d) of the Code.

 

49               I am not prepared to accept the
proposition that s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  admits of a
conviction for murder without proof of objective foreseeability of death or the
likelihood of death, but in the view I take of this case it is not necessary to
reach a firm conclusion on that point. The Crown sought the conviction of
Vaillancourt on the basis of the interaction of s. 21(2) and s. 213(d)
of the Code. For the Crown to succeed in such a prosecution, it would be
required to prove that the accused and another had formed an intention in
common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein. In
addition, in the circumstances of this case, the Crown would be required to
prove that the appellant knew or ought to have known that his associate was
armed with a pistol and would, if necessary, use it during the commission of
the offence or the attempt to commit the offence, or during his flight after
committing or attempting to commit the offence, and that as a consequence a
death occurred: see R. v. Munro and Munro (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 260 (per
Martin J.A.), at p. 301, and the pre‑Charter  case in this Court in
R. v. Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638.

 

50               It must be recognized at the
outset that Parliament has decided that the possession and use of weapons,
particularly firearms, in the course of the commission of offences is a gravely
aggravating factor. Experience has shown that the presence of firearms leads to
personal injury and loss of life. Parliament has chosen to term a killing
arising in the circumstances described here as ""murder"". In R. v.
Munro and Munro, supra, Martin J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court
of Appeal (Arnup, Martin and Houlden JJ.A.), said this, at p. 293:

 

                   Under the
provisions of s. 213(d) liability for murder attaches if death ensues as
a consequence of the use of the weapon or as a consequence of the possession of
a weapon which he has on his person. Manifestly, s. 213(d) is very
stringent, but it is equally obvious that Parliament intended to create a
stringent basis of liability where death ensued as a consequence of the use or
possession of a weapon which the offender has upon his person during the
commission or attempted commission of certain offences or the offender's flight
after the commission or attempted commission of the offence. It is clear that
Parliament intended to provide a strong deterrent to the carrying of weapons in
the commission of certain crimes because of the high risk to life which
experience has shown attends such conduct.

 

51               The principal complaint in this
case is not that the accused should not have been convicted of a serious crime
deserving of severe punishment, but simply that Parliament should not have
chosen to call that crime ""murder"". No objection could be taken if
Parliament classified the offence as manslaughter or a killing during the
commission of an offence, or in some other manner. As I have observed before
(see R. v. Ancio, [1984] l S.C.R. 225, at p. 251), while it may be
illogical to characterize an unintentional killing as murder, no principle of
fundamental justice is offended only because serious criminal conduct,
involving the commission of a crime of violence resulting in the killing of a
human being, is classified as murder and not in some other manner. As Martin
J.A. said in R. v. Munro and Munro, supra, at p. 301:

 

                   This legislation
has frequently been criticized as being harsh, but that is a matter for
Parliament and not for the courts.

 

I would refer, as well, to the words
found in A. W. Mewett and M. Manning, Criminal Law (2nd ed. 1985), at
pp. 544‑45:

 

                   Section 213 and the
concept of constructive murder have been much criticized and, in fact,
abolished in many jurisdictions. The criticism is that it imposes liability for
murder in situations where death was not intended nor even, in some cases,
foreseen. But murder is a legal concept; it does not have to be defined in
terms of intentional killing, and even under s. 212 the definition is not this
narrow. The policy behind s. 213 is to put the risk of killing a victim during
the course of the commission of certain offences upon the offender to a higher
degree than if it were merely classified as manslaughter. In any case, with the
present distinction between murder punishable by death and murder punishable by
life imprisonment now abolished, much of the criticism loses its force. It was
the thought of someone being executed for a non‑intended homicide that
led to the feeling that the definition of murder should somehow be limited to
the old common law concept of ""murder with malice aforethought"".

 

52               As has been noted, the appellant's
conviction is based on a combination of s. 21(2)  and s. 213 (d) of the Criminal
Code . There was in this case evidence of active participation in the
commission of the robbery, the underlying offence, and the terms of s. 21(2) 
were fully met. It must be accepted that the section gives expression to a
principle of joint criminal liability long accepted and applied in the criminal
law. I am unable to say upon what basis one could exempt conduct which attracts
criminal liability, under s. 213  of the Criminal Code , from the
application of that principle. In R. v. Munro and Munro, supra,
Martin J.A. said, at p. 301:

 

                   Patently,
Parliament has decided that the carrying of weapons during the commission of
certain crimes, such as robbery, so manifestly endangers the lives of others,
that one who joins a common purpose to commit one of the specified offences and
who knows or ought to know that his accomplice has upon his person a weapon
which he will use if needed, must bear the risk if death, in fact, ensues as a
consequence of the use or possession of the weapon during the commission of one
of the specified offences or during the flight of the offender after the
commission or attempted commission of the underlying offence . . .

 

In my view, Martin J.A. has stated the
policy considerations which have motivated Parliament in this connection and I
would not interfere with the Parliamentary decision. I would, therefore,
dismiss the appeal and answer the two constitutional questions in the negative.

 

                   The following are
the reasons delivered by

 

53               La
Forest J.‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the judgment
of Lamer J. and would dispose of the appeal in the manner proposed by him. I am
in agreement with him that because of the stigma attached to a conviction for
murder, the principles of fundamental justice require a mens rea
reflecting the particular nature of that crime, namely one referable to causing
death. In addition to the intention to cause death, this can include a closely
related intention such as intention to cause bodily harm likely to result in
death combined with recklessness as to that result. Whether and how much
further the intention can be extended it is not necessary to explore for the
purposes of this case. It is sufficient to say that the mental element required
by s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  is so remote from the intention
specific to murder (which intention is what gives rise to the stigma attached
to a conviction for that crime) that a conviction under that paragraph violates
fundamental justice. All the provision requires is an intention to commit
another crime and to possess a weapon while carrying out this intention or in
fleeing afterwards. The provision is so broad that under it a person may be
found guilty of murder even though the death was the result of an accident.
This occurred in Rowe v. The King, [1951] S.C.R. 713, and more extreme
examples can easily be imagined. The section is thus not only remote from the mens
rea specific to murder, but even removes its actus reus as
traditionally defined; see I. Grant and A. W. MacKay, ""Constructive Murder
and the Charter : In Search of Principle"" (1987), 25 Alta. L. Rev.
129.

 

54               As my colleague notes, the
objective of discouraging the use of weapons in the commission of crimes can be
achieved by means other than attaching the stigma of a conviction for murder to
a person who has caused death in the circumstances like those described in the
provision.

Death caused by accomplice during break, enter and robbery ‑‑ Proof
of intentional dangerous conduct causing death substituted for proof of mens

                   Criminal
law ‑‑ Constructive murder ‑‑ Fundamental justice ‑‑
Presumption of innocence ‑‑ Death caused by accomplice during
break, enter and robbery ‑‑ Proof of intentional dangerous conduct
causing death substituted for proof of mens rea with respect to death of victim
‑‑ Accused's conviction possible notwithstanding existence of
reasonable doubt on essential element ‑‑ Whether s. 213(d) of the
Criminal Code violates ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.

 

                   Appellant,
his brother and a third person broke into a house with the intention of
committing robbery. The appellant's brother entered the premises armed with an
iron pipe and, surprised by the owner, beat him to death. He pleaded guilty to
second degree murder under s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code . The
appellant was convicted of second degree murder as a party to the offence under
s. 21(2) of the Code. His appeal from conviction on the ground that the
combination of ss. 21(2) and 213(d) of the Code contravened s.
11 (d) of the Charter  was dismissed.

 

                   Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   In
light of R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, s. 213 (d) of
the Criminal Code  is inoperative and the conviction cannot stand.

from a judgment of the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court, Appeal Division

L. MacDougall, for the appellant.

E. Coombs, for the respondent.

 

          The
judgment of Dickson C.J. and Estey, Lamer and Wilson JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                Lamer J.‑‑This
appeal raises a question of law that is decided in the judgment rendered this
day in R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636, namely the
constitutionality of constructive murder as provided by s. 213(d) of the
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34.

 

2.                The
appellant, his elder brother Stephen Laviolette and a third person went to a
parish house with the intention of committing a robbery. Stephen gained
entrance to the house through a ground‑floor window. He asked Brian to
give him an iron pipe that was leaning against the house and Brian did so.
Stephen then opened the front door of the house and the others entered. Finding
nothing on the ground floor, they went upstairs. Awakened by the noise, the
priest emerged from his bedroom and saw Stephen. Stephen beat him to death with
the pipe.

 

3.                Stephen
pleaded guilty to second degree murder. The appellant and the third person were
charged with second degree murder under the combined operation of ss. 21(2) and
213(d) of the Code and were convicted following a joint trial.
The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court in banco set aside their
convictions and ordered the accused to be re‑tried separately. At his
second trial the appellant was again convicted of second degree murder. The
third person was acquitted.

 

4.                The
appellant appealed from this second conviction on the ground, inter alia,
that the combination of ss. 21(2) and 213(d) of the Code
contravened s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
The Prince Edward Island Supreme Court in banco unanimously dismissed
his appeal: (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 106.

 

5.                MacDonald
J., with whom Campbell J. concurred, held that the presumption of innocence is
not affected by ss. 21(2) and 213(d) of the Code, because the
Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt all of the elements required by s.
213(d). With respect to the elements required by s. 213(d), he
stated (at p. 114):

 

By not including in the definition of murder in s. 213(d)
a requirement of mens rea to commit murder, Parliament has not taken
away from an accused the right to be presumed innocent.

 

6.                McQuaid
J., in separate reasons, came to the same solution. He wrote, at p. 110:

 

Neither of those two sections, taken either separately
or in concert, creates a presumption of guilt or violates a presumption of
innocence. They simply say that if persons act in a certain way, with certain
consequences, and an independent and impartial tribunal, i.e., a jury,
finds that they have done so, in accordance with law, i.e., on the
initial assumption of innocence, in a fair and public hearing, i.e., a
trial, then certain sanctions will inevitably follow, i.e., conviction
and sentence. Indeed, it can be truly said that not only does the conjunctive
effect of ss. 213(d) and 21(2) not violate s. 11 (d) of the
Charter , but rather is the practical embodiment of it.

 

7.                With
respect, I do not share these views. For the reasons that I have given this day
in this Court's judgment in Vaillancourt, supra, I am of the view
that s. 213(d) of the Code infringes the rights guaranteed by ss.
7  and 11 (d) of the Charter  and is not a reasonable limit on those
rights, and is thus inoperative. The appellant's conviction pursuant to s. 213 (d)
thus cannot stand.

 

8.                I
would thus allow the appeal, set aside the appellant's conviction and order a
new trial.

We are all of the view that these
appeals should be dismissed.

In agreement with the reasons of
LeBel J.A., we are of the view that the trial judge erred in law in considering
that the judgment Oliver v. The Queen, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 240, had
established binding standards which he had to follow.

Moreover, we are in agreement
with the reasons of Vallerand J.A. when he said: [TRANSLATION] ""The trial
judge based his decision on the existence of a reasonable doubt with regard to
essential facts though, in the course of the trial, he had indicated he was
satisfied by the proof of the same facts and as against the Crown, had
decisively put an end to it.""

The appeals are dismissed.

exception in cases of conspiracy ‑‑ Whether or not judge's
instructions correct.

 

                   Evidence
‑‑ Good character evidence ‑‑ Relevance to decision ‑‑
Whether or not judge's instructions correct.

 

                   The
judge, at the trial of appellant and two others for criminal conspiracy to
raise funds for a political party then in power through their influence with
the government, invited members of the jury panel to claim exemptions from jury
service on grounds which included partiality as between the Crown and the
accused. The claims of the individual claimants were considered in open court
but out of the hearing of the accused and his counsel. Thirty‑six
exemptions were granted from the eighty‑three member panel; the trial
judge indicated that some question existed as to the impartiality of at least
four jurors. The jury, selected from the remaining panel, found the accused
guilty. The Appeal Division dismissed his appeal from conviction.

 

                   The
grounds of appeal raised here were: (1) whether or not the Appeal Division
erred in holding that the trial judge's examination under oath of members of
the jury panel in the absence of the appellant and his counsel did not vitiate
the appellant's trial; (2) whether or not the Appeal Division erred in holding
that the political party was a ""person"" within the meaning of s.
110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code ; (3) whether or not the trial
judge's instructions to the jury referable to the co‑conspirators'
exception to the hearsay rule were correct; (4) whether or not miscarriage of
justice has been occasioned as a result of the trial judge's failure to
instruct the jury as to the use, in law, that could be made of evidence of
appellant's good character.

 

                   Held
(McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson
C.J. and Beetz, Estey, Wilson and La Forest JJ.: Section 577  of the Criminal
Code  should be given an expansive reading; the words ""whole of the
trial"" mean just that. Because of the fundamental importance of the
selection of the jury and because the Criminal Code  gives the accused
the right to participate in the process, the jury selection should be
considered part of the trial for the purposes of s. 577(1) . The exemptions
granted by the trial judge here did not constitute an in‑court extension
of the pre‑trial process contemplated in s. 577(1) .

 

                   In
jury selection, the provincial power for the administration of justice stops
and the federal power over criminal procedure begins when the judge's activity
is not concerned with the assembly of an array of eligible citizens but rather
with the precautions necessary to ensure an impartial jury. The Nova Scotia Juries
Act is consistent with this interpretation of the scope of the provincial
power. The balance of the Criminal Code 's comprehensive scheme, which is
designed to ensure as fair a jury as is possible and to ensure that the parties
and the public at large are convinced of its impartiality, would be upset by an
addition from another source. The province cannot give the judge any power to
make decisions as to partiality and any judge who attempts to participate in
such decisions usurps the function of the jurors established by s. 569(2) .
Usurpation of this sort is so severe an error of law by the judge that it
mandates a new trial, even if no prejudice to the accused can be shown.

 

                   Both
the accused and the public must perceive the proceedings to be fair; both would
have difficulty seeing a private conference between judge and juror after the
charges had been read and a plea entered as an administrative matter that did
not affect the accused's right to a fair trial. The decision should not turn
solely on the technical definition of when the trial began. Even if the excusal
can be seen as a purely administrative act, the public expectation of the
judicial role in these circumstances requires the judge to execute the
administrative task judicially. The judge must allow counsel to participate and
the public to know the reasons for the decision.

 

                   Sections
598, 599 and 600 do not apply here. The import of ss. 598 and 599 is that an
irregularity of form which does not affect the substance of a trial cannot be
used to challenge the result. These sections cannot cure doubts as to the
impartiality of the jury and the appearance of justice. Section 569(2) requires
all questions of partiality to be decided by the two jurors sworn for that
purpose, and accordingly, s. 600 does not authorize the judge to perform this
function.

 

                   All
of the jurors excused on grounds of partiality cannot be assumed to be partial
to the Crown. The grounds of partiality the trial judge used to exclude them
were not known and could only be a matter of speculation. The trial judge's
screening, too, could not be assumed to have helped the accused without
impairing the ability to challenge for cause later. It is quite possible that
jurors partial to the Crown or accused could have slipped through the screening
process.

 

                   Per
McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. (dissenting): The appellant was not present at the
selection of panel members prior to jury selection in that neither he nor his
counsel was permitted to hear the examination.

 

                   The
examination of the panel members claiming exemption was not conducted
""during"" the trial. While anything that occurs in the course of the
courtroom proceedings which could involve the accused's vital interests should
constitute part of the trial, not every step in the long process leading to the
ultimate verdict will be part of the trial for the purposes of s. 577 . The
accused's rights under s. 577  of the Criminal Code  will be violated if
the trial judge examines a juror for partiality in the absence of the accused
after the jury has been empanelled. But, the situation is profoundly different
if the trial judge examines jurors for partiality prior to the jury selection
process under the Code.

 

                   There
are two distinct steps involved in providing a jury to try an individual case.
The first, which involves assembling the jury panel from which individual
juries are to be selected, is governed by provincial law. The accused has no
interest in the process, save the interest of any citizen in the due
administration of the law. The second is governed by ss. 558 to 571 of the Code
and involves the selection from the jury panel of a jury to try a particular
case. The course taken by the trial judge was quite proper for his inquiry of
panel members was part of the first step of the jury process and could not
affect the vital interests of the accused touching on the question of guilt or
innocence.

 

                   The
word ""person"" in s. 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  must
be read in the light of s. 2 of the Code. The Nova Scotia Liberal
Association clearly falls within the meaning of ""society"" found in
that section and accordingly is a person for the purposes of s. 110(1) (d).

 

                   The
evidence directly admissible against each of the three conspirators differed in
some particulars. There was evidence upon which the jury could conclude that a
conspiracy did exist and much of the evidence, as it would apply to each
individual charged, would be hearsay. The hearsay exception was therefore
available to the Crown if the jury, on a consideration of the evidence directly
admissible against each individual, had reached a conclusion as to membership
in the conspiracy in respect of each of the accused. The jury was properly
instructed as to their duties in this respect.

 

                   Evidence
of appellant's good reputation and character was clearly put before the jury
and was emphasized and given fair treatment by the trial judge. While not
directly stated by the trial judge, the jury must have been aware that they
could consider the evidence as relevant to show that the appellant was not
likely to have committed the crime with which he was charged. No miscarriage of
justice occurred with respect to the charge as a whole because of what at best
was a technical non‑direction.

principal issue in this appeal, and the only issue with which I intend to deal

The Jury
Selection

 

3.                       At
the opening of the trial the appellant was arraigned before an assembled jury
panel and entered a plea of not guilty on the charge before the court. The
trial judge then, in the following terms, invited the members of the jury panel
to claim exemptions on grounds which included potential partiality:

 

Members of the jury panel, you've just witnessed the
procedure under which the two accused persons in this case, have been arraigned
and you've heard the charge against them, and you've also heard their pleas of
not guilty to the charge, in each case. Now, we will later this morning, be
proceeding to select a Jury of twelve, who will try this case, which I may say,
is the only case on the docket for which you have been called. It's usual at
this time, however, to invite members of the jury panel to come forward and
claim exemption if there's any circumstance, such as relationship to one of
the accused, or other involvement with the case, that would prevent the
Juror from serving impartially in the case. To that usual call for
exemption claims, there are several matters I must add in this case. The first
is, that there has been in the press and in the broadcast media considerable
publicity about this case and I advise you that if exposure to that
publicity in your opinion, would operate to prevent you from being impartial in
this case, then you should come forward on that ground, as well as others
I've mentioned and claim exemption, and the other matter that I want to bring
to your attention in inviting claims for exemption, is that it's anticipated
that this case will last from four to six weeks and that, in some instances,
may create special hardship and that can be a basis on which you may now claim
exemption. So with those words of explanation I invite persons claiming
exemption in this case, now to come forward. You will be sworn and I will
consider the basis of your claim and deal with it. [Emphasis added.]

 

4.                       The
judge then proceeded to swear the jurors and considered claims for exemption
advanced by members of the jury panel in the courtroom but out of earshot of
all counsel and the accused. Counsel for Senator Barrow made objection to the
procedure in the following terms:

 

I have just one very respectful submission to make to
your Lordship. I realize there may be some very personal claims for exemption
that would be none of my business, and I wouldn't want to listen to it, but
since your Lordship invited the members of the Jury who might feel that they
couldn't be impartial by reason of publicity to claim exemption on that basis,
if some claim for exemptions made on that basis, I am wondering whether, my
Lord, that shouldn't be a claim that we should be able to listen to. I
am in your Lordship's hands as to that. [Emphasis added.]

 

5.                       The
judge advised counsel that he was prepared to note the grounds of exemption but
declined to depart from the procedure adopted. As appears from the judgment of
the Appeal Division, the judge considered claims for exemption on behalf of
members of the jury panel and granted thirty‑six exemptions. The jury
panel had consisted of eighty‑three members. After all exemptions had
been granted, the panel had been reduced to forty‑seven persons. The record
does not state whether any exemptions were refused.

The
Judgment of the Appeal Division

 

6.                       The
decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, reported at
(1984), 65 N.S.R. (2d) 1, referred to s. 577(1)  of the Criminal Code 
which reads:

 

                   577. (1) Subject
to subsection (2), an accused other than a corporation shall be present in
court during the whole of his trial.

 

7.                       The
Appeal Division was satisfied that neither Senator Barrow nor his counsel was
able to hear the examination conducted by the trial judge and, in such
circumstances, Senator Barrow was effectively deprived of his right and duty to
be present. Being present included being able to hear the proceedings. The
Appeal Division then turned to the question of whether Senator Barrow had been
denied the right to be present during his trial. His counsel submitted that the
trial commenced with arraignment and plea; the Crown submitted that at the time
of the examination the jury of twelve had not been empanelled, the appellant
had not been placed in charge of the jury, and the trial had not commenced.

 

8.                       The
Appeal Division referred to several authorities and concluded that (i) a trial
does not commence until after a plea is entered; (ii) the call for exemptions
by the judge took place after plea and would therefore seem to be part of the
trial proceedings, at least for the purposes of s. 577 of the Code;
(iii) it has been the practice in Nova Scotia under s. 4(2) of the Juries
Act, S.N.S. 1969, c. 12, to exercise a wide discretion in granting
exemptions from jury duty, ""at least before arraignment"". (Section
4(2) reads: ""The judge presiding at a session or the Chief Justice may
grant to any person exemption from service as a juror at the whole or part of
that session upon application by or on behalf of the person."")

 

9.                       The
Appeal Division then noted that in this case the trial judge saw fit to examine
the jurors out of earshot of all counsel and the accused and in following that
process he indeed exempted thirty‑six jurors. It said at p. 10:

 

                   If this matter had ended at this
point we would have grave reservations as to the validity of the judge's
actions.

 

The
Appeal Division continued:

 

However, following this procedure defence counsel were
then given the right to challenge all jurors for cause and all remaining jurors
were challenged for cause and underwent a trial by two other jurors to
determine their partiality. Consequently, the defence was given every
opportunity to explore the question of impartiality with each juror. In these
circumstances we cannot see how any possible prejudice could have been suffered
by the appellant accused. Indeed his privileges were emphasized both by the
court and by counsel. The judge eliminated any juror whom he thought had any
semblance of partiality and the appellant accused was able subsequently to
further screen the jury by way of challenge for cause to determine whether or
not the jurors were impartial. In these circumstances and indeed even giving
the liberal construction to the process with respect to s. 577 of the Code
recommended by Dickson J. in R. v. Basarabas, supra, we have come to the
conclusion that the vital interests of the appellant were never jeopardized and
that there was no denial of any fundamental right. In our opinion the practice
followed by the trial judge was eminently fair to the accused person. There was
no error on the part of the trial judge in examining under oath the members of
the jury panel with respect to claims for exemption that would vitiate the
trial.

 

                                                                   III

 

10.                     With
the greatest of respect, I disagree with the reasoning of the Appeal Division
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Like the Appeal Division, I have grave
reservations about the propriety of the procedure followed by the trial judge.
Unlike the Appeal Division, I do not think that the breach of the appellant's
right to be present was cured by the later opportunity afforded the accused,
pursuant to the Criminal Code , to challenge the remaining jurors for
cause. An inquiry of that sort may be appropriate to decide whether, an error
having been made, that error can be cured under s. 613(1) (b)(iii). It is
not relevant to the determination of whether an error has occurred in the first
place. I think there was an error, a breach of s. 577(1) , and for reasons which
I will make clear, I do not think that the error can be cured by s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

 

1.                Section
577 of the Criminal Code

 

11.                     The
appellant submits that s. 577(1)  of the Criminal Code  not only entitles,
but requires, an accused to be ""present"" at his trial for a criminal
offence. The right and duty to be present is fundamental. It is further
submitted that the examination of members of the jury panel under oath was part
of the ""trial"" for the purposes of s. 577(1)  and that the inability
of the accused and his counsel to hear the exchanges between the judge and the
panel members claiming exemption effectively ensured that the accused was not
""present"" for that part of his trial. It is therefore necessary to
consider whether the trial of the accused had begun at the time the judge
examined the jurors.

 

12.                     Basarabas
and Spek v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 730, raised a similar question: when
does a trial before a jury begin for the purposes of s. 573 of the Code?
That section permits a judge to discharge a juror where in the course of a
trial the judge is satisfied that a juror should not, because of illness or
other reasonable cause, continue to act. At the trial of the two appellants in
that case a juror was discharged pursuant to s. 573 after the jury had been
empanelled but before the accused had been put in charge of the jury and before
any evidence had been called. The Crown contended that the juror was discharged
""in the course of"" the trial. The accused said that a jury trial did
not commence at least until the time at which the accused was put in charge of
the jury. This Court held unanimously that (i) the time of commencement of a
jury trial will vary according to the circumstances and the language of the
section of the Criminal Code  being applied; (ii) subject to s. 573 , an
accused in a criminal jury trial is entitled to be tried by twelve jurors and
is entitled to the unanimous verdict of twelve jurors unless and until ""in
the course of a trial"" the judge is satisfied that a juror should not
continue to act; (iii) in so far as s. 573  deprived an accused of his common
law right to the unanimous verdict of twelve persons, it should be narrowly construed;
(iv) the words ""continue to act"" in s. 573  suggested that the jury
had been acting qua jury before the discharge of the juror. In the
result, and in the context of s. 573 of the Code, the Court held that
the weight of authority supported the position that a jury trial commenced when
the accused had been placed in charge of the jury.

 

13.                     In
the course of the Basarabas judgment, however, reference was made to the
section of the Code in issue in the present appeal. After noting that the
time of commencement of a jury trial will vary according to the circumstances
and the language of the section of the Criminal Code  being applied, the
Court continued, at p. 740:

 

Thus, the word ""trial"" in s. 577(1)  which
assures the accused the right to be present ""during the whole of his
trial"" will be liberally construed to afford the accused the right to be
present during the selection of the jury. In like manner, the word
""trial"" in s. 566 which denies the prosecutor the right to direct a
juror to stand by on the trial of an indictment for the publication of a
defamatory libel will be interpreted to embrace the proceedings preceding the
empanelling of the jury. In other sections ""trial"" may have a
different connotation depending upon the section of the Code being
applied.

 

14.                     The
reason for varying starting points is that different sections of the Code
protect different interests. Section 573 allows the judge to remove a juror who
for some reason is unable to continue, but the removal of a juror is a very
serious matter. An accused has the right to be tried by twelve jurors (ss.
560(5) and 572(1)) and every effort must be made to avoid a jury of less than
twelve members. If the jury has heard no evidence, as in Basarabas, then
a juror can be replaced and s. 573 should not be used. ""Trial"" there
refers to the heart of the trial, the presentation of evidence before the trier
of fact. Section 577, however, protects different interests and in my opinion
should be given an expansive reading. The words ""whole of the trial""
mean just that, the whole of the trial.

 

15.                     In
my view the examination of prospective jurors by the trial judge, relating in
part to their impartiality and following arraignment and plea, formed part of
the trial for the purposes of s. 577. This conclusion is supported by several
cases which have emphasized the centrality of an impartial jury to a fair
trial.

 

16.                     In
R. v. Hertrich (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal
refused, [1982] 2 S.C.R. x, one of the questions raised was whether a judge's
examination in chambers of two jurors concerning anonymous phone calls, and
with only counsel present, breached the right of the accused to be present and
thus vitiated the trial. Martin J.A. delivered the judgment of the Court of
Appeal and adverted to the ""fundamental principle"" of the criminal
law that a person charged with an indictable offence is entitled, indeed
required, by s. 577 to be personally present at his trial. For the purpose of
this principle ""trial"" means the entire proceedings, including
sentence. Martin J.A. continued, at p. 527:

 

                   Generally speaking, the trial of an
accused does not commence until after plea: see Giroux v. The King (1917),
29 C.C.C. 258 at p. 268. However, ""trial"" for the purpose of the
principle that an accused is entitled to be present at his trial clearly
includes proceedings which are part of the normal trial process for determining
the guilt or innocence of the accused such as arraignment and plea, the
empanelling of the jury, the reception of evidence (including voir dire
proceedings with respect to the admissibility of evidence), rulings on
evidence, arguments of counsel, addresses of counsel to the jury, the judge's
charge, including requests by the jury for further instructions, the reception
of the verdict and the imposition of sentence if the accused is found guilty.
[Emphasis added.]

 

The
following two passages are also relevant, at p. 537:

 

                   The essential reason the accused is
entitled to be present at his trial is that he may hear the case made out
against him and, having heard it, have the opportunity of answering it: R.
v. Lee Kun (1915), 11 Cr. App. R. 293. The right of the accused to be present
at his trial, however, also gives effect to another principle. Fairness and
openness are fundamental values in our criminal justice system. The presence of
the accused at all stages of his trial affords him the opportunity of acquiring
first‑hand knowledge of the proceedings leading to the eventual result of
the trial. The denial of that opportunity to an accused may well leave him with
a justifiable sense of injustice. Indeed, in my view, an examination of the
Canadian decisions shows that the latter principle is, in fact, the implicit
and overriding principle underlying those decisions.

 

                                                                    ...

 

...the characterization of a proceeding as a part of the
trial in relation to the accused's right to be present at the proceeding would
seem to depend upon whether his exclusion from the proceeding violates his
right to be present so that at all times he may have direct knowledge of
anything that transpires in the course of his trial which could involve his
vital interests.

 

17.                     In
the result the Court of Appeal held that the appellants were entitled to be
present to hear from the jurors' own lips whether they were affected by those
telephone calls and whether the calls prevented them from continuing to
discharge their duties as jurors. This conclusion, Martin J.A. said, is
consistent in principle with the Canadian decisions, the course followed in the
two Australian decisions mentioned by him in the course of his judgment and the
weight of judicial opinion in the United States. Martin J.A. found this
persuasive, although he added at pp. 539‑40 that ""the force of that
[American] opinion is somewhat diminished by the fact that the American courts
frequently apply the `harmless error rule' where the right of a defendant to be
present at all stages of his trial has been infringed. By contrast, s. 577 and
the jurisprudence surrounding it precludes the application of any such rule in
Canada"".

 

18.                     In
Hertrich, Martin J.A. conducted an admirable survey of the American case
law on this subject and concluded that in that country as well the accused has
a right to be present during any examination of a juror as to his or her
impartiality. A distinction is drawn in the United States, however, between
exemptions claimed on grounds of partiality and those claimed on essentially
private grounds of hardship, illness, and the like. In the latter instances,
the examination by the judge has been held to be outside the scope of the trial
(Hertrich, p. 534). Of course, this was precisely the distinction
advanced by the defence counsel at the trial of the instant case. He objected
to the trial judge's course of action only in the case of jurors claiming
exemption on grounds of prejudice.

 

19.                     As
Martin J.A. suggests, the weight of authority both in Canada and in the United
States supports the contention of the appellant that the questioning under oath
of jurors as to their possible partiality is a part of the trial. The appellant
therefore had a right to be present, a right which must include the right to
hear the proceedings.

 

20.                     Martin
J.A. in Hertrich identified two important principles that underlie s.
577. First, the accused is present to hear the case he or she faces and is
thereby able to put forward a defence. Second, the accused sees the entire
process by which he or she is tried and is able to see that the correct
procedure is followed and the trial fair. For Martin J.A., the second principle
was the more important one. I agree with him that this second value is of
enormous importance to the perceived fairness of the Canadian criminal justice
system. The sight of a judge conferring in private with jurors on issues that
go to the partiality of the trier of fact can only prompt cynicism in an
accused. It should be avoided.

 

21.                     The
question of what is included in the trial for purposes of s. 577(1) was also
addressed by this Court in Vézina and Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R.
2. Justice Lamer for the Court held that the right to be present at trial
included the right to be present at an examination of jurors for partiality
after the trial had begun. Adopting the reasoning of Martin J.A. in Hertrich,
Lamer J. held that the test of what should be included in ""trial"" was
not limited to the presentation of the case against the accused and to matters
that directly affected the decision as to guilt or innocence, such as rulings
on the admissibility of evidence. For Lamer J., s. 577(1) is triggered whenever
the ""vital interests"" of the accused are at stake, or as Martin J.A.
put it in Hertrich, when a decision bears on the ""substantive
conduct of the trial."" Any question about the partiality of the jurors individually
or the jury as a whole reflects on the substantive conduct of the trial and
must be dealt with in the presence of the accused. The accused has a right to a
fair trial as well as a right to hear the case and make a defence. Section
577(1) protects both rights. In both Hertrich and Vézina and Côté,
s. 577(1) was infringed when the judge examined jurors for partiality after the
trial began and in the absence of the accused.

 

22.                     The
Crown argues that the trial judge must oversee the jury selection process as
part of the duty to ensure a fair trial. Even if the Nova Scotia Juries Act
does not authorize the process followed here, the Crown suggests that it was
part of the judge's inherent powers under the Criminal Code , continued
by s. 600 . The Crown cites the case of R. v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C.
(2d) 279 (Ont. C.A.); affirmed [1977] 2 S.C.R. 267. Hubbert raised the
question whether a trial judge, when empanelling a jury, might properly ask the
panel as a whole whether any member of the panel has any connection with any of
the parties. The judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal reads, in part, at pp.
292‑93:

 

                   Turning to the practical
consideration of the methods by which the process should be carried out, we
deal first with the kind of obvious partiality dealt with in the English
practice direction. Some trial Judges make a practice of saying to the jury
panel, before the selection process begins, something of this nature:

 

If there is anyone on this panel who is closely
connected with a party to this case or with a witness who is to testify, will
you please stand?

 

(Rarely does anyone respond.) If someone does stand, the
trial Judge asks him to come forward (usually to the jury‑box), and
inquires further as to that person's connection with the case. To take obvious
examples, if the juror is the uncle of the accused, or the wife of a witness,
or the brother of the investigating police officer, he ought not to serve.

 

                   In our view, the trial Judge on his
own should excuse that prospective juror from the case, without more ado. The Criminal
Code  makes no express provision for it, but it does not expressly or
impliedly forbid it either, and in our view it is in the power of the trial Judge
as part of his function of ensuring a fair trial. We think the practice of
excusing jurors of obvious partiality is a desirable one in all cases.

 

The Hubbert
case was appealed to this Court. The appeal was dismissed orally without
calling upon Crown counsel.

 

23.                     In
Hubbert, the Ontario Court of Appeal and this Court approved the common
practice of a trial judge's asking the members of the jury array if any of them
had any obvious connection to the case that would disqualify them. There are
two differences between Hubbert and the case at bar. The first is that
in the procedure recommended by the Ontario Court of Appeal, any member of the
array who responds to the initial question answers any subsequent questions
from the jury box. In other words, the judge's questions and the juror's
responses are heard by everyone in the court, including the accused, and all
will know the reason why the juror thinks he or she is not impartial. There is
a world of difference between this procedure and a whispered conference between
the judge and the potential juror, at the bench. The Hubbert procedure
does not violate the accused's right to be present.

 

24.                     The
second difference is that an initial question by the judge to the jury array is
best seen as a summary procedure to speed up the jury selection, done with the
consent of the parties. This was the view of the majority of the Quebec Court
of Appeal in Guérin v. R., [1984] C.A. 305, 13 C.C.C. (3d) 231. Both
Bisson J.A. (at p. 246) and Jacques J.A. (at pp. 248‑49) make the point
that when counsel agree to initial questions by the judge there is no violation
of the Code procedure. Either side can challenge any juror that the
judge does not exclude and obvious cases are decided quickly on consent. Where
counsel for either side objects to the process, as in this case, the judge
cannot continue with the questions but must leave it to the parties and the
jurors, under the judge's supervision.

 

25.                     The
selection of an impartial jury is crucial to a fair trial. The Criminal Code 
recognizes the importance of the selection process and sets out a detailed
procedure to be followed (ss. 554 ‑573). Both the Crown and the accused
participate in the process, with the right to challenge for cause or
peremptorily and, in the case of the Crown, to stand aside potential jurors
(ss. 562 ‑568). The challenge for cause involves trial of the impartiality
of potential jurors, with examination by either side. The accused, the Crown,
and the public at large all have the right to be sure that the jury is
impartial and the trial fair; on this depends public confidence in the
administration of justice. Because of the fundamental importance of the
selection of the jury and because the Code gives the accused the right
to participate in the process, the jury selection should be considered part of
the trial for the purposes of s. 577(1) .

 

2.                Section
4(2) of the Juries Act

 

26.                     The
issue in this case is complicated, however, by the relationship between the Criminal
Code  and s. 4(2) of the Nova Scotia Juries Act which, as noted
above, states:

 

                   4. ...

 

                   (2) The judge presiding at a
session or the Chief Justice may grant to any person exemption from service as
a juror at the whole or part of that session upon application by or on behalf
of the person.

 

""Session""
is defined in s. 1(m) of the Act as including any convening of the Trial
Division of the Supreme Court for the purpose of one or more civil matters or
one or more criminal matters. It is not readily apparent why the word
""session"" is used rather than the word ""trial"". The record
is silent on the question of whether Burchell J. had convened the Trial Division
of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia and was therefore presiding at a
""session"" as well as at a trial. I do not make anything of the point
as it was not advanced before us.

 

27.                     In
the present case, as I understand its position, the Crown argues that even if
the word ""trial"" in s. 577(1) includes the selection of the jury, the
examination of jurors claiming exemptions is not part of the jury selection
process. It occurs before the commencement of the jury trial and is part of the
pre‑trial process of assembling a jury array of qualified, non‑exempt
jurors. Crown counsel contends that the jury selection process under the Criminal
Code  had not yet begun. The judge was using his authority under s. 4(2) of
the Juries Act to provide an eligible array, after which selection of
the jury would begin under the Code. It is asserted that the exemptions
granted by the trial judge in this case ""merely constituted an in‑court
extension"" of the pre‑trial process contemplated in s. 577(1) . Since
by this argument the trial had not yet begun, s. 577(1)  did not yet apply and
the accused had no right to attend or to participate. Neither did he have a
right under s. 4(2) of the Juries Act to participate in the exemption
process. Once the judge began the jury selection process under the Code
he allowed full participation by counsel for the accused. The Crown thus
concludes that there was no breach of s. 577(1) .

 

28.                     I
am firmly of the view that these submissions cannot be sustained. First, s. 4(2)
of the Juries Act relates specifically to exemption before formal court
proceedings. How can it be said that proceedings in court after arraignment and
after a plea has been entered are not formal court proceedings? Secondly, the
pre‑process exemptions must be intended to allow persons who would suffer
serious inconvenience from serving on any jury during the session to petition
for a discretionary order to allow them to avoid that inconvenience. Some of
the exemptions granted in the present case related not to inconvenience, but to
prejudice. The considerations must surely be different.

 

3.                Constitutional
Considerations

 

29.                     The
Crown's arguments also fail when set against the principles of the division of
powers under the Constitution Act, 1867 , the nature of the power
conferred on the judge by s. 4(2) of the Juries Act, and the jury
selection process in the Code. The Juries Act does not authorize
the judge to screen the panel in secret after charges have been read out and plea
entered. Even if it did, the appearance of justice and the need for a fair
trial suggests that the power could not be exercised in the way the trial judge
did in the case at bar.

 

30.                     It
is undoubtedly the right and the duty of the Nova Scotia Legislature to pass a
law for the gathering of the jury array. Section 92(14)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 , enables the province to legislate for the administration of
justice within the province so long as it does not infringe on matters of
criminal procedure, reserved to the federal government by s. 91(27) . Part of
this provincial power includes the assembly of an array of potential jurors for
the courts of criminal jurisdiction to use in accordance with the Criminal
Code . This power, however, is largely an administrative task, as s. 92(14) 
itself implies. In the case of jury selection, the provincial power for the
administration of justice stops and the federal power over criminal procedure
begins when the judge's activity is not concerned with the assembly of an array
of eligible citizens, but with the precautions necessary to ensure an impartial
jury. The Nova Scotia Juries Act is consistent with this interpretation
of s. 92(14) . The Act as a whole sets out the procedure to assemble the jury
panel by the time court sessions begin. It states who will make up the jury
committee for each municipality, how and when they will go about the task, and
how the judiciary shall supervise it. The emphasis in the Act is to gather as
random a sample of eligible jurors as possible, with no discussion of
partiality. Significantly, s. 4(1) sets out certain categories of people who
cannot serve on a jury because of their occupation. Subsection 4(2) seems to be
a general clause to enable the judge supervising a session to exempt people who
have personal reasons not to serve on a jury yet do not fit into the specific
exemptions. Neither subsection is directly concerned with the partiality of
potential jurors.

 

31.                     This
interpretation of s. 4(2) of the Nova Scotia Juries Act is strengthened
by a survey of the jury acts in the other Canadian jurisdictions. In every
other province and in both territories there is a provision similar to the
disqualification in s. 4(1) of a broad range of people by occupation, notably
those connected with the justice system. No other jurisdiction has a provision
similar to s. 4(2), with its unqualified reference to ""exemptions"".
In every other jurisdiction but Nova Scotia, the legislature provides that
exemptions are available only if the applicants meet certain criteria. These
criteria vary from the laconic ""for a good cause"" in the territories,
to ""hardship"" in some provinces, to more detailed criteria of
hardship, age, religious belief, or similar factors in some provinces. Every
other jurisdiction recognizes that its authority over the jury pool is limited
to eligibility and personal matters unconnected with the criminal case to be
tried. In spite of its apparently broad phrasing, the Nova Scotia provision
should be interpreted as similarly limited, to maintain its constitutional
integrity.

 

32.                     The
Code sets out a detailed process for the selection of an impartial jury.
It gives both parties substantial powers in the process and sets up a mechanism
to try the partiality of a potential juror when challenged for cause. The trier
of partiality is not the judge but a mini‑jury of two potential or
previously selected jurors (s. 569(2)). Overall, it is a comprehensive scheme
designed to ensure as fair a jury as is possible and to ensure that the parties
and the public at large are convinced of its impartiality. Any addition to this
process from another source would upset the balance of the carefully defined
jury selection process. This is especially the case of any attempt to add to
the powers of the judge. Parliament has decided that the issue of partiality is
a question of fact that must be decided by two of the jurors themselves, not by
the judge. The province cannot give the judge any power to make decisions as to
partiality and any judge who attempts to participate in such decisions usurps
the function of the jurors established by s. 569(2). Usurpation of this sort is
so severe an error of law by the judge that it mandates a new trial, even if no
prejudice to the accused can be shown (Guérin v. R., supra). The
judge's role is to supervise trials of partiality, not to decide them.

 

4.                The
Appearance of Justice

 

33.                     The
argument of the Crown in this appeal does not address what may be the most
important aspect of the case, namely, the appearance of justice. Even if the
two‑stage analysis of the empanelling process is a legally accurate
description of the interplay of the Criminal Code  and the Nova Scotia Juries
Act, it leaves out of account the effect of the proceedings in this case as
they would appear to the average citizen: prospective jurors were able to speak
to the judge in private, albeit in open court, and be excused from jury duty
with no reason given. The problem arises because the Nova Scotia Juries Act
gives an administrative duty to the judge: the power to exempt potential jurors
for personal reasons unconnected with the facts of a particular trial. This
administrative duty concerns a particularly sensitive point of a trial and
closely resembles the judicial duty of examining jurors for partiality, a
fundamental part of the duty to provide a fair trial. The average citizen
watching would not likely appreciate the legal categorization of the judge's
power to excuse for personal reasons, and it would be difficult for the
accused, who is particularly sensitive on this point, to see a private
conference between judge and juror after the accused's name was called out, the
charges read and a plea entered, as an administrative matter that did not
affect his right to a fair trial. The decision should not turn solely on the
technical definition of when the trial began. I think that an accused who
appears before a judge in a courtroom with his counsel, hears the charge read,
and pleads to the charge, would think it very strange to be told that his trial
had not begun. He would, I think, find it equally strange that almost half of
those called for jury duty were relieved of that duty after whispered goings on
with the presiding judge.

 

34.                     What
of the public perception? This is a case where the public perception of the
fairness of the proceedings is crucial. A judge sitting in open court embodies
the judicial role in the public mind, a role different from that of the
administrative officer who assembles the array initially. The same act,
excusing a juror for personal reasons, will be seen in a different light when
done by the drafters of the jury list as part of the first stage of assembling
an array of potential jurors and when done by a judge in open court once the
accused is charged and plea entered. Even if the excusal can be seen as a
purely administrative act, the public expectation of the judicial role in these
circumstances requires the judge to execute the administrative task judicially.
The judge must allow counsel to participate and the public to know the reasons
for the decision. Nothing should be done in private in open court.

 

35.                     Again,
a comparison to the statutes of the other jurisdictions is illuminating. In
most of them, a person who wishes to be exempted from the jury list applies to
the official who drew up the list, the sheriff (in New Brunswick, the Jury
Board). If the exemption is refused there is either a right of appeal to a
superior court judge or the person can make a new application to a judge, as
specified by the statute. (In Newfoundland the application is to a provincial
court judge, with appeal from a refusal to a supreme court judge. In Prince
Edward Island the application is directly to the judge at trial.) These
provisions show that other jurisdictions consider exemptions for personal
reasons to be administrative issues for court officials to decide, subject to
the review and supervision of the judiciary. Such review of administrative
decisions normally includes the duty to act judicially, with due regard for the
appearance of justice.

 

5.                Sections
598, 599 and 600

 

36.                     It
was suggested that even if the trial judge erred in his questioning and
exemption of the jurors, that error could be cured by the application of ss.
598 or 599. It was also questioned whether the screening was authorized by s.
600. In my opinion, none of these provisions applies in this case.

 

37.                     Section
598 provides that irregularities in the summons of the jury or in its
membership cannot be used to attack a verdict, while s. 599 states that failure
to follow precisely the rules for jury selection does not warrant setting aside
a verdict reached subsequently. The import of these two provisions is that an
irregularity of form which does not affect the substance of a trial cannot be
used to challenge the result.

 

38.                     The
right to be present is a fundamental right of the accused. Exclusion of the
accused from part of the trial, especially part of the selection of an
impartial jury, is not an irregularity of form. It casts into doubt two of the
most basic aspects of a fair trial, the impartiality of the jury and the
appearance of justice. Sections 598 and 599 do not cure the defect. As the late
MacKinnon A.C.J. held in R. v. Varga (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 281, when
one of the parties is denied a right in the jury selection process given by the
Criminal Code , prejudice can be inferred and these sections are of no
assistance.

 

39.                     There
is another reason why the sections are inapplicable. The Quebec Court of King's
Bench (Appeal Side), held in R. v. Battista (1912), 21 C.C.C. 1, that
the predecessors of the two sections apply to objections to the jury selection
raised for the first time after verdict. The Supreme Court of Canada considered
and approved this decision in R. v. Stewart, [1932] S.C.R. 612, saying
that the situation is entirely different when the objection to the jury
selection is taken at trial. Defence counsel here objected to the judge's
actions from the beginning.

 

40.                     As
for s. 600, it is a provision to carry forward any common law power of the
judge in relation to the jury selection process that is not «...expressly
altered by or is inconsistent with this Act.» Whether or not a judge ever had
the power to examine jurors for partiality need not be decided. The Criminal
Code  has eliminated any power of the judge to decide issues of partiality.
By section 569(2), all questions of partiality are to be decided by the two
jurors sworn for that purpose. Section 600  therefore does not authorize the
judge to perform this function.

 

6.                Section
613(1)(b)(iii)

 

41.                     It
is no doubt true, as the respondent Crown submits, that the accused retained
his right to challenge any prospective juror for cause even after the trial
judge had excluded thirty‑six members of the panel. It is suggested that
this possibility wiped out any prejudicial effect on the judge's secret
questioning. The Appeal Division would appear to have held that view. The
response to this assertion is that, as a matter of authority, this Court has
already held that the denial of the right under s. 577 is
""fundamental"", requiring the setting aside of the conviction. The
curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) are innately inapplicable: Meunier
v. The Queen (1965), 48 C.R. 14, [1966] (Que. Q.B.) 94n, affirmed
[1966] S.C.R. 399. Since the decision in Meunier, it has been the rule
that no breach of the right to be present can be cured by s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
as the absence of the accused deprives the court of all jurisdiction.

 

42.                     In
R. v. Hertrich, supra, at p. 527, Martin J.A. followed Meunier
and the other authorities mentioned in the passage following and concluded that
the curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) were not applicable if the
accused is deprived of his right to be present at his trial in contravention of
s. 577:

 

                   The law is settled that depriving an
accused of his right to be present at his trial in contravention of s. 577 is
the denial of a fundamental right requiring the setting aside of the
conviction, and the curative provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) are
inapplicable: see Meunier v. The Queen (1965), 48 C.R. 14, [1966] Que.
Q.B. 94n; affirmed [1966] S.C.R. 399, 50 C.R. 75; Ginoux v. The Queen
(1971), 15 C.R.N.S. 117; affirmed 16 C.R.N.S. 256n; R. v. Reale
(1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 345, [1973] 3 O.R. 905: affirmed 22 C.C.C. (2d) 571, 58
D.L.R. (3d) 560, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 624 sub nom. A.‑G. Ont. v.
Reale; R. v. Grimba (1980), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 570, 117 D.L.R. (3d) 740,
30 O.R. (2d) 545.

 

43.                     There
was in the instant case a major deviation from the Code procedure for
the selection of the jury, one that eliminated nearly half the jury pool for
reasons unknown to the accused. That is not a minor breach of the accused's
right to be present. It is a breach that casts into doubt the impartiality of
the jury, which in turn reflects on the fairness of the entire trial.

 

44.                     The
rigidity of Meunier has been criticized, notably in Côté v. R.,
[1982] C.A. 419, 3 C.C.C. (3d) 155, and in R. v. Fenton (1984), 11
C.C.C. (3d) 109 (B.C.C.A.) Some doubt was also cast upon the rule in Meunier
in this Court's decision in Vézina and Côté, supra, where Lamer
J. emphasized, at p. 14:

 

As a last comment on the matter I should not want it to
be taken that, when adopting Martin J.A.'s views in Hertrich, the issue
of whether the proviso in s. 613(1)(b)(iii) was available, has been
inferentially reconsidered and the reasoning in Meunier on that point
reaffirmed in this case.

 

But this
comment should not necessarily be read as impugning the decision in Meunier.
On the facts of Vézina and Côté, it was simply unnecessary to decide the
point. Lamer J. left open the possibility that the rule might be reconsidered.
The issue is raised more starkly in the instant case, but I believe that no
grounds are raised that should cause the Court to reverse a decision of long
standing.

 

45.                     Indeed,
I am not convinced that the appellant suffered no prejudice. The Crown would
have this Court assume, first, that all the jurors who were excused on grounds
of partiality were partial to the Crown, and second, that the trial judge's
screening could only have helped the accused without impairing the ability to
challenge for cause later. Neither of these assumptions seems to me to be
correct. First, we simply do not know and can only speculate as to the grounds
of partiality the trial judge used to exclude jurors. It may very well be that
in reducing the panel by over forty percent, the trial judge excluded persons,
perhaps friends of the accused or Liberal party supporters, who might have been
more favourable to the accused than to the Crown. While the accused does not
have the right to a favourable jury, only an impartial one, it is not obvious
that the exclusion was only to the benefit of the accused.

 

46.                     As
for the second assumption, it may be that the trial judge's screening might
actually have hindered the selection of an impartial jury. Suppose a juror
conscientiously told the judge that he or she might not be impartial for some
reason, such as membership in a political party, and the judge decided that the
juror was impartial. The juror's concern about impartiality may then have been
set to rest by the judge's decision so that the juror would not raise the issue
again when challenged for cause. After all, if the judge had so concluded, why
would the juror express any doubt about it when challenged by counsel? The
juror's concern about his or her own impartiality has been set to rest on the
highest authority, that of the judge. If counsel had heard the exchange between
the juror and the judge and thought that the judge was wrong, counsel could
have pursued the issue further. As it was, there was no reason not to accept
the juror's response to the challenge at face value. Thus, jurors partial to
the Crown or the accused may have slipped through the screening process.

 

47.                     The
point of these examples is not that the jury should have included friends of
the accused, or political allies, or partisan opponents. Nor is it to suggest
that political affiliation is automatically cause to challenge in such a case.
The point is that we cannot assume that whatever screening occurred in secret
was beneficial for the accused, or even neutral. These examples show the
fundamental reason why all questions of partiality must be decided in public:
the accused, the Crown, and the public at large have the right to know that the
jury is as impartial as is humanly possible. Such speculation is harmful.

 

                                                                   IV

 

Summary

 

48.                     In
sum, s. 577(1)  of the Criminal Code  requires that the accused be present
at his trial for a criminal offence. The examination of the prospective jurors
by the trial judge, relating in part to their impartiality and following
arraignment and plea, was part of the trial for purposes of s. 577 . It is
important for the accused to see and hear the entire process by which he or she
is tried so that he or she sees that the trial is fair, and s. 4(2) of the Nova
Scotia Juries Act should be construed as relating to exemption of jurors
for reasons of hardship, illness or inconvenience before the commencement of
formal court proceedings. A wider interpretation of s. 4(2) of the Juries
Act, one that permits exemption of jurors after arraignment and plea and on
grounds of possible prejudice, would intrude into federal jurisdiction over
criminal procedure. The public perception of the fairness of the trial process
would be damaged if potential jurors were excluded after private conversations
with the judge. Further, the judge's actions were not authorized by s. 600 of
the Code. Finally, the trial judge's error in this case was of a
fundamental nature and therefore the curative provisions in ss. 598, 599 and
613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code should not be applied.

 

49.                     In
closing, the words of Haines J. in R. v. Elliot, [1973] 3 O.R. 475
(H.C.), are an accurate summary of both the method and the goals of the jury
selection process:

 

Much more in keeping with the realities of the situation
is to allow the accused through his counsel to ask such relevant questions in
open Court as to the partiality and fitness of the juror under the watchful eye
of the Judge who will in the exercise of his discretion protect the interest of
the Crown and the accused as well as the administration of justice. In this
matter the tribunal itself is enhanced in the eyes of the public. Lay triers
have found the juror fair and impartial. Justice is at its highest when its
administration is shared by our citizens.

 

                                                                    V

 

Conclusion

 

50.                     I
would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Appeal Division of the
Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and order a new trial for the appellant. Although
strictly speaking I do not have to decide the other three issues, for the
guidance of the trial judge who re‑tries the case I think it useful to
state that I would agree with McIntyre J.'s opinions on those issues.

 

                   The
reasons of McIntyre and Le Dain JJ. were delivered by

 

51.                     McIntyre J.
(dissenting)‑‑The appellant Barrow was jointly charged with one
MacFadden and one Simpson with an offence under ss. 423(1) (d) and
110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code . The indictment is in these terms:

 

that [they]...unlawfully did...conspire together and
with James G. Simpson and with various officials of the government of the
Province of Nova Scotia and with another person or persons unknown, to demand
or accept for the benefit of themselves or the Nova Scotia Liberal Association
or a member or members thereof or another person or persons, rewards,
advantages or benefits, as consideration for cooperation, assistance, exercise
of influence or an act or omission in connection with the transaction of
business with or any matter of business relating to the Province of Nova Scotia
or any benefit that Her Majesty is authorized or is entitled to bestow,
contrary to Section 423(1) (d) and 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

Simpson
pleaded guilty in the magistrates' court and was fined $75,000. MacFadden and
the appellant elected trial by judge and jury and after a preliminary inquiry
they were committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The
trial commenced on April 5, 1983. The Crown called extensive evidence and when
it closed its case a motion was made by the defence for a directed verdict.
This motion was denied and the appellant and MacFadden elected not to call
evidence. On May 11, 1983, the jury returned a verdict of guilty against both
accused and, on May 12, l983, the trial judge sentenced each man to the payment
of a fine of $25,000.

 

52.                     The
appellant appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Nova
Scotia (the Court of Appeal). MacFadden did not appeal. The Court of Appeal
dismissed the appellant's appeal against conviction in reasons for judgment
delivered September 11, l984 (65 N.S.R. (2d) 1). The appellant was granted
leave to appeal to this Court, pursuant to s. 618(1) (b) of the Criminal
Code .

 

The
Facts

 

53.                     In
1968, the Nova Scotia Liberal Association created a finance committee to raise
funds for the purposes of the party. The Committee was composed of the
appellant, as chairman, and MacFadden and Simpson who acted primarily as
collectors. Two bank accounts were opened by the Committee for the purpose of
receiving financial contributions. The accounts were in the name of Cambridge
Investments and J. G. Simpson, in trust. The signing authorities on the
Cambridge account were Simpson and MacFadden and, on the other, Simpson and his
secretary. Monies collected or received were deposited to these accounts and
then disbursed to several trust funds which had been set up over the years for
the purposes of the Nova Scotia liberal party, to various individuals and the
Nova Scotia Liberal Association. The common trustee of all the trust funds was
the appellant.

 

54.                     According
to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which on this point is not challenged,
the evidence, particularly documentary evidence, showed clearly that the
appellant and his co‑accused were at all times aware of the flow of cash
through both bank accounts. Meticulous accounting records were kept with respect
to the two accounts and none of the monies disbursed from the accounts or the
various trust funds was expended by the appellant or his two co‑accused
for their own use or benefit. The evidence also revealed a close relationship
between the members of the Committee, as well as a close connection between the
committee members and government officials from whom they received information
relating to such matters as the identity of those who were doing business with
the Government of Nova Scotia.

 

55.                     In
October of 1970, the liberal party defeated the then Government of Nova Scotia
in a general election and formed the new government which held power until
1978. During the period from 1970 to 1978, the Committee collected contributions
amounting in total to $3,836,468.13, of which $2,770,773.52 was deposited in
one bank account and $1,065,694.61 in the other. A police investigation
commenced in the autumn of 1978 resulted in the seizure of many documents from
government departments and agencies and also from several wineries,
distilleries and other corporations. The evidence revealed that the
contributions made by liquor and wine companies dealing with the government
were based on a fixed amount per case of products sold to the Government. Other
companies doing business with the government paid a percentage of monies they
received from government work which ranged from three to five per cent.

 

56.                     The
theory of the Crown was that the monies contributed to the Committee were not,
in fact, bona fide political contributions but were payments made by them to
ensure the continuation of their business relationship with the Government. To
secure these contributions, the appellant and his two accused, out of their
desire to support the liberal party in Nova Scotia, agreed among themselves to
""peddle their influence with the Government"" to the various companies
doing business with the Government. The appellant defended on the basis that
his character and reputation refuted the charge against him. It was said that
the whole case for the Crown was an attempt to involve the appellant in conduct
of the co‑accused Simpson in which he was in no way involved. The
appellant did not contend before the Court of Appeal, nor does he in this
Court, that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable or could not be supported
by the evidence. He raised four grounds of appeal before the Court of Appeal
and raised the same grounds in this Court. They are set out hereunder:

 

1. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the learned Trial
Judge's examination under oath of members of the jury panel on April 5, 1983 in
the absence of the appellant (and his counsel) did not vitiate the appellant's
trial.

 

2. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the Nova Scotia
Liberal Association is a ""person"" within the meaning of Section
110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

3. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that the learned Trial
Judge's instructions to the jury, referable to the co‑conspirators'
exception to the hearsay rule were correct.

 

4. It is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
Court of Nova Scotia, Appeal Division, erred in holding that no miscarriage of
justice was occasioned as a result of the learned Trial Judge's failure to
instruct the jury as to the use, in law, that could be made of evidence of
Senator Barrow's good character.

 

I will
address the grounds in that order.

 

Right to
Presence at Trial (s. 577(1) of the Criminal Code )

 

57.                     On
April 5, 1983, the appellant and MacFadden were arraigned before a panel of
jurors and pleaded not guilty. The trial judge, following what he described as
""the ordinary procedure"", then invited members of the panel to claim
exemptions from jury service on grounds which included partiality as between
the Crown and the accused. He said:

 

Members of the Jury Panel, you've just witnessed the
procedure under which the two accused persons in this case, have been arraigned
and you've heard the charge against them, and you've also heard their pleas of
not guilty to the charge, in each case. Now, we will later this morning, be
proceeding to select a Jury of twelve, who will try this case, which I may say,
is the only case on the docket for which you have been called. It's usual at
this time, however, to invite members of the Jury panel to come forward and
claim exemption if there's any circumstance, such as relationship to one of the
accused, or other involvement with the case, that would prevent the Juror from
serving impartially in the case. To that usual call for exemption claims, there
are several matters I must add in this case. The first is, that there has been
in the press and in the broadcast media considerable publicity about this case
and I advise you that if exposure to that publicity in your opinion, would
operate to prevent you from being impartial in this case, then you should come
forward on that ground, as well as the others I've mentioned and claim
exemption, and the other matter that I want to bring to your attention in
inviting claims for exemption, is that it's anticipated that this case will
last from four to six weeks and that, in some instances, may create special
hardship and that can be a basis on which you may now claim exemption. So, with
those words of explanation I invite persons claiming exemption in this case,
now to come forward. You will be sworn and I will consider the basis of your
claim and deal with it.

 

58.                     The
trial judge then swore the individual claimants and considered their claims for
exemption, doing so in the courtroom but out of hearing of the accused or his
counsel. Counsel for the appellant commented on this procedure in response to
an invitation by the trial judge:

 

I have just one very respectful submission to make to
your Lordship. I realize there may be some very personal claims for exemption
that would be none of my business, and I wouldn't want to listen to it, but
since your Lordship invited the members of the Jury who might feel that they
couldn't be impartial by reason of publicity to claim exemption on that basis,
if some claim for exemptions made on that basis, I am wondering whether, my
Lord, that shouldn't be a claim that we should be able to listen to. I am in
your Lordship's hands as to that.

 

The
trial judge replied:

 

I'm prepared Mr. Cooper to note in those instances what
the ground of exemption is, but beyond that, I don't think we should depart
from the ordinary procedure.

 

He
proceeded to hear claims for exemption, still out of hearing of the appellant
and his counsel. In the end, he granted thirty‑six exemptions from
service. No reasons were given for the exemptions of thirty‑two of the
jurors, but the judge gave reasons in respect of the remaining four in these
terms (the jurors' names are omitted):

 

#85 ...is excused on the ground of his association
with the accused persons in this case. It's not necessary ...that you remain
here.

 

#11 ...is excused on the ground of familiarity with
the publicity concerning the case and his relationship to a minister of
government.

 

#34 [is excused as he] served on the Grand Jury
that dealt with this case.

 

#75 ...is excused on the ground that he feels that
he cannot be impartial in his case because of the nature of the case.

 

Jury
selection then began from the remaining panel members. Each one was challenged
for cause. The appropriate procedures for such challenges provided for in the Criminal
Code  were followed and no objection has been made on that ground. As a
result, each juror who was empanelled to try the accused's case had been
challenged for cause according to law and had survived the challenge. On the
basis of these facts, the appellant's first ground is advanced.

 

59.                     The
appellant submits that his right under s. 577  of the Criminal Code  to be
""present in court during the whole of his trial"" was violated when
the trial judge examined jurors for partiality out of hearing of the accused
and his counsel. This submission raises two issues: (1) Was the accused present
during the examination of the panel members claiming exemption? (2) Was the
examination of those claiming exemption conducted ""during"" the trial?
With respect to the first issue, I agree with the Court of Appeal and counsel
for the appellant that the accused was not present when the trial judge
conducted his examination of persons claiming exemption. ""The presence of
the accused means not merely that he must be physically in attendance, but also
that he must be capable of understanding the nature of the proceedings"": R.
v. Lee Kun, [1916] l K.B. 337. Although the appellant was physically
present during the trial judge's examination of the jurors, neither he nor his
counsel was permitted to hear the examination. It is, therefore, clear that the
accused was not ""present"" in any effective sense.

 

60.                     The
second issue is more difficult than the first and depends upon the meaning of
the expression, the ""whole of the trial"", in s. 577 . The word
""trial"" was considered by this Court in Basarabas and Spek v. The
Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 730. In that case, the Court was asked to determine
when a jury trial commences for the purposes of s. 573  of the Criminal Code ,
which provides for the discharge of a juror by the trial judge ""in the
course of a trial"". The trial judge in the case discharged a juror after
the jury had been empanelled and sworn, and pleas of not guilty entered, but
before the accused had been put in the jury's charge and before the Crown was
called upon to present its case. The Court, per Dickson J. (as he
then was) held, at pp. 741‑42, that for the purposes of s. 573  the trial
commences when the accused has been placed in charge of the jury. However
Dickson J. had earlier noted that the meaning of the word trial varies with the
language of the section in question and with the circumstances. He stated, at
p. 740, that:

 

                   First, the time of commencement of a
jury trial will vary according to the circumstances and the language of the
section of the Criminal Code  being applied. Thus, the word
""trial"" in s. 577(1)  which assures the accused the right to be
present ""during the whole of his trial"" will be liberally construed
to afford the accused the right to be present during the selection of the jury.
In like manner, the word ""trial"" in s. 566  which denies the
prosecutor the right to direct a juror to stand by on the trial of an
indictment for the publication of a defamatory libel will be interpreted to embrace
the proceedings preceding the empanelling of the jury. In other sections
""trial"" may have a different connotation depending upon the section
of the Code being applied.

 

The
meaning of the expression ""the whole of the trial"" will therefore
depend upon the language of s. 577 , the principles underlying the section and
the circumstances of the case. A circumstance of particular importance in this
case is the nature of the communications or proceedings from which the accused
was excluded.

 

61.                     The
meaning of ""trial"" in s. 577  of the Criminal Code  and the
principles underlying the section were considered by the Ontario Court of
Appeal in R. v. Hertrich, (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.)
Speaking for a unanimous court, Martin J.A. outlined the general approach to s.
577 , at p. 527:

 

                   Generally speaking, the trial of an
accused does not commence until after plea: see Giroux v. The King
(1917), 29 C.C.C. 258 at p. 268. However, ""trial"" for the purpose of
the principle that an accused is entitled to be present at his trial clearly
includes proceedings which are part of the normal trial process for determining
the guilt or innocence of the accused such as arraignment and plea, the
empanelling of the jury, the reception of evidence (including voir dire
proceedings with respect to the admissibility of evidence), rulings on
evidence, arguments of counsel, addresses of counsel to the jury, the judge's
charge, including requests by the jury for further instructions, the reception
of the verdict and the imposition of sentence if the accused is found guilty.

 

Later,
at p. 537, he added:

 

...the characterization of a proceeding as a part of the
trial in relation to the accused's right to be present at the proceeding would
seem to depend upon whether his exclusion from the proceeding violates his
right to be present so that at all times he may have direct knowledge of
anything that transpires in the course of his trial which could involve his
vital interests. [Emphasis added.]

 

The
general approach developed by the Court of Appeal was expressly adopted by this
Court in Vézina and Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2, at p. 10, in a
case where the trial judge interviewed jurors in his chambers in the absence of
the accused or counsel, but after they had been sworn and had heard evidence.

 

62.                     While
anything that occurs in the course of the courtroom proceedings which could
involve the accused's vital interests should constitute part of the trial, it
is clear that not every step in the long process leading to the ultimate
verdict will be part of the trial for the purposes of s. 577 . As Martin J.A.
stated in Hertrich, supra, at p. 529:

 

                   Manifestly, however, not everything
that occurs during a trial is a part of the trial. Zuber J.A., speaking for
this court, in R. v. Grimba, supra, said at p. 574 C.C.C., p. 744
D.L.R., p. 548 O.R.:

 

The Crown points out, however, that improper exclusion
from the court‑room by itself does not contravene s. 577 . Something must
transpire in the court‑room which can be said to be a part of the trial.
Obviously, if following the exclusion of the appellant for his misconduct, the
Court had recessed for a time and then resumed in his presence, the appellant
could not claim that he was not present during his trial. In Meunier v. The
Queen (1965), 48 C.R. 14, [1966] Que. Q.B. 94n, Casey J. of the
Quebec Court of Appeal put the question as follows at p. 17:

 

                   ""Our problem is whether the
Court proceeded, whether it did anything of a nature to advance the case, in
the absence of the appellant. If it did not appellant's argument must be
rejected; if it did the conviction must be quashed.""

 

                   Subsequent cases have repeated this
question and have used the phrase ""advance the case"": Collin v.
The Queen (1968), 5 C.R.N.S. 201, [1968] Que. Q.B. 340n. I cannot
think that this phrase was intended to be definitive. It is one way of putting
the essential question of whether or not the trial continued and it is of
little consequence whether the continuance embraced the adduction of evidence,
the presentation of argument, rulings on evidentiary points, the address to the
jury, etc.

 

                   I accept the remarks of Zuber J.A.
and would add that during the course of the trial things may occur that,
although in one sense part of the trial, cannot reasonably be considered to be
a part of the trial for the purpose of the present principle, because they
cannot reasonably be said to have a bearing on the substantive conduct of the
trial, or the issue of guilt or innocence.

 

Later,
at p. 539, he added:

 

                   Obviously, as previously indicated,
not every communication between the judge and the jury or a juror that may
occur during the trial is a part of the trial. For example, the mere
communication by the judge to the jury in the absence of the accused of an administrative
decision that he has made, that if the jury were unable to reach a verdict,
they would go to a hotel that night and resume deliberations the next day, is
not a violation of s. 577 : see R. v. Hamilton (1980), 58 C.C.C. (2d)
467. And in the present case, for example, the communication by the deputy
sheriff to the judge of the information with respect to the anonymous telephone
call, and the preliminary in‑chambers conference with counsel to
determine the necessity for an inquiry and the form that it should take clearly
did not constitute part of the trial.

 

Applying
these principles, the issue before us is whether the judge's examination of
members of the jury panel for partiality, prior to selection of the jury to try
the case, constituted part of the trial, in that it involved the accused's
vital interests and could reasonably be said to have a bearing on the
substantive conduct of the trial and the issue of guilt or innocence.

 

63.                     The
courts have consistently held that after the jury has been empanelled an
examination of a juror for partiality by the trial judge in the absence of the
accused violates the accused's rights under s. 577  of the Criminal Code .
In R. v. Côté and Vézina, [1982] C.A. 419, 3 C.C.C. (3d) 155 (hereinafter
cited to C.C.C.), the trial judge received notes from two of the jurors
alleging that two of the other jurors were being or had been influenced by one
of the accused. The trial judge informed the accused and their counsel of these
communications and attempted to obtain their consent to interview privately the
two jurors who had sent the notes. After failing to obtain their consent, he
decided to interview the two jurors before a court reporter but in the absence
of the accused and counsel. Following the interviews, the trial judge was
satisfied that there was no foundation for the allegations and informed counsel
that ""there is no valid reason that the jury cannot, will not, be able to
or should not continue its deliberations in order to arrive at their
verdict"". The trial proceeded and the accused were convicted.

 

64.                     On
appeal, the majority of the Court of Appeal (Owen and Malouf JJ.A.) found that
the interviews violated the accused's rights under s. 577  and ordered a new
trial. Owen J.A. stated in his reasons, at p. 160, that:

 

                   The right to a trial by an impartial
jury is a fundamental one. The accused has the right to be present when the
jury is empanelled and the impartiality of prospective jurors is considered. In
virtue of the same principle, the accused has the right to be present when an
inquiry is conducted to determine whether the impartiality of the jurors has
been affected after they have been sworn in and before the verdict has been
rendered.

 

Malouf
J.A. in separate reasons stated, at p. 188, that:

 

                   The authorities cited in the opinion
of my colleague, Mr. Justice Owen, clearly show that such a proceeding is part
of the trial. The jurors questioned are the very same persons who, together
with the remaining members of the panel, will be called upon to decide the
guilt or innocence of each accused. This is an issue vital to each accused.
Surely, any matter which could influence the members of the jury in the verdict
that they are called upon to render is part of the trial. It is so in this
case.

 

L'Heureux‑Dubé
J.A., in dissent, was of the view that the interviews were a preliminary
investigation for determining the impartiality of the jurors and therefore did
not violate s. 577 .

 

65.                     The
judgment of the Court of Appeal was upheld on appeal to this Court. Lamer J.,
speaking for a unanimous court, stated, at p. 13:

 

                   In this case it is abundantly clear
from the written messages that the partiality of jurors was in issue. L'Heureux‑Dubé
J.A. concluded that this is not so relying in part on what was eventually
reported in the transcripts of the exchange between the judge and the jurors in
chambers. This analysis, in my respectful view, misses the point. For it is
confusing the determination of whether partiality was in issue with the further
determination of the issue of partiality. Finding the jurors impartial does not
mean that their impartiality was not in issue. It merely means that the issue
was determined in favour of their impartiality. The events of this case well
illustrate the need for the issue of partiality to be determined in the
presence of the accused, specifically when one considers that counsel for the
accused argued their motion for a mistrial without knowing what the jurors had
to say as regards the partiality of others, not knowing whether the jurors had
conveyed to their fellow jurors including the suspects, their suspicions, and
not even knowing whether the judge had met with those jurors. I would therefore
dismiss the Crown's appeal.

 

The
accused's presence when jurors are interviewed for partiality was also
considered in Hertrich, supra. The relevant facts in Hertrich
are conveniently set out in the head‑note to 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510, in these
terms, at p. 511:

 

                   The three accused and two others were
tried on a charge of the first degree murder and following a lengthy trial the
three accused were convicted. During the trial it was brought to the trial
judge's attention that two anonymous telephone calls had been received at the
home of one of the jurors and that during one of the calls it was stated that
the accused Sk had killed twice before. This juror had then told another juror
of the anonymous telephone call. The trial judge brought defence counsel into
his chambers and informed him of the information he had received concerning the
jurors. Over objection of some of the counsel the trial judge then conducted an
inquiry in his chambers in the presence of counsel but in the absence of the
accused. Both jurors were examined under oath and indicated that they felt they
could still be true to their oath as jurors. The trial judge then brought the
two jurors into open court and indicated that what had been said in the
anonymous telephone call was not true and he then refused an application by
defence counsel for a mistrial. Proceedings were then resumed with the full
jury where it was explained that one of the jurors had received an anonymous
telephone call, had discussed it with another juror but that there was no
suggestion that the call came from anyone associated with the trial and that
the trial judge was satisfied that the trial could continue. The trial
thereafter resumed.

 

On
appeal, Martin J.A., speaking for the court, held, at p. 539, that:

 

                   Each of the opposing views on this
question can justly lay claim to both pragmatic and intellectual support.
However, in my opinion, after a great deal of careful consideration, the right
of the accused to have direct knowledge of anything that transpires in the
course of his trial which could involve his vital interests tips the scales in
favour of the view that the in‑chambers examination of the jurors was
part of the trial.

 

                   I have, therefore, concluded that the
examination of the jurors on April 6th was a part of the trial for the purpose
of the rule here under consideration. The proceeding involved the vital issue
whether the jurors in question were affected by the anonymous telephone calls
and whether the appellants could receive a fair trial if those jurors continued
to serve on the jury. The appellants were entitled to be present to hear from
the jurors' own lips whether they were affected by those telephone calls and
whether the calls prevented them from continuing to discharge their duties as
jurors.

 

A
similar view was expressed in R. v. Fenton (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 109
(B.C.C.A.) and Frisco v. The Queen, [1971] C.A. 176, 14 C.R.N.S. 194.

 

66.                     It
is therefore clear that the accused's rights, under s. 577  of the Criminal
Code , will be violated if the trial judge examines a juror for partiality
in the absence of the accused after the jury has been empanelled. But, the
situation is profoundly different if the trial judge examines jurors for
partiality prior to the jury selection process under the Code. To
appreciate the significance of this difference, it is useful to outline the
procedures for summoning and selecting juries. There are two distinct steps
involved in providing a jury to try an individual case. The first step involves
assembling the jury panel from which individual juries are to be selected.
According to s. 554 of the Code, this step is governed by provincial
law, which in this case is the Nova Scotia Juries Act, S.N.S. 1969, c.
12, as amended. The second step is governed by ss. 558 to 571 of the Code
and involves the selection from the jury panel of a jury to try a particular
case.

 

67.                     Considering
the initial step in more detail, the Juries Act sets out the criteria
for qualification for and exemption from jury service. It further details the
procedure for assembling jury panels for each jury district in the province.
Under the Act, the Attorney General appoints a jury committee for each jury
district. The proceedings of the committee are to be conducted in secrecy. Each
year, the jury committee randomly selects the names of prospective jurors from
voters lists or, if necessary, from tax rolls and other lists of qualified
persons. In selecting the names of persons, the jury committee reviews each
name to determine whether the person is both qualified to serve and not
exempted from service as a juror. When the list is completed it is certified by
the committee and presented to a judge, who must satisfy himself on information
given by the jury officer that the jurors have been properly selected and the
list properly prepared. If the list is approved by the judge, it becomes the
jury list for the district until a new one is prepared. Whenever a jury is
required, the judge who is to preside at the session of the court or the chief
justice selects at random from the list the number of jurors he thinks
necessary to form a jury panel. The names of the jurors selected for the panel
are made public four to eight days before the stated date for the appearance of
the jury by posting the names in the office of the Prothonotary of the Supreme
Court of the jury district.

 

68.                     It
can be seen at once that this process of drawing up a jury list and assembling
a jury panel for a particular session is designed to create a pool of
disinterested jurors. It is a process in which an individual accused plays no
part and has no right to intervene except ""on the ground of partiality,
fraud or wilful misconduct on the part of the sheriff or his deputies by whom
the panel was returned"" (s. 558 of the Code). The accused has no
interest in the process, save the interest of any citizen in the due
administration of the law.

 

69.                     The
second step in the procedure involves the selection of the jury from the jury
panel. As set out in the Code, the name of each juror on the panel is
written on a card which is placed in a box by the clerk of the court. The clerk
then draws at random one card at a time from the box and calls out the name of
the juror on the card. As each juror is called, counsel for the accused or the
Crown may challenge the juror for cause on a number of specific grounds
enumerated in s. 567, including the ground that ""a juror is not
indifferent between the Queen and the accused"". In addition, counsel for
the accused and the Crown may challenge a fixed number of jurors without cause.
This procedure continues until twelve jurors have been selected. During this
procedure, the accused has a right to be present and to participate in the
process to ensure that the jurors selected are impartial and that his vital
interests are protected.

 

70.                     At
any stage during the first step in assembling the jury panel a judge ""may
grant to any person exemption from service as a juror at the whole or part of
that session upon application by or on behalf of that person"", (s. 4(2) of
the Juries Act). This section (s. 4(2) of the Juries Act) gives
statutory recognition in provincial law to a practice which has been approved
for application in the criminal law by very high authority. In the case of R.
v. Hubbert (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 279, the Ontario Court of Appeal (Gale
C.J.O., Jessup, Arnup, Dubin and Martin JJ.A.) in a per curiam judgment
dealt with questions relating to challenges for cause, empanelling of jurors,
and the position of the trial judge in assuring impartiality of jurors. The
court expressed the view that a fundamental assumption of the jury process, as
carried out in Canadian criminal law, was that jurors would observe and follow
the direction of the trial judge in reaching their verdict and base their
judgment upon the evidence before them and not upon preconceptions on matters
of which they had received knowledge before the trial. At trial, counsel for
the accused had asked that the trial judge address the jury panel and direct
that if any potential juror had any connection with the accused he should
declare himself prior to being sworn. The trial judge refused. The Court of
Appeal, in considering the whole question of challenges for cause under the Criminal
Code  and the question of partiality of jurors, quoted with approval the apt
words of Seaton J.A. in R. v. Makow (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 513, at p.
519, ""an accused is entitled to an indifferent jury not a favourable
one"". Reference was made as well to the English practice direction
(jurors) issued by Lord Widgery C.J. on January 12, [1973] l All E.R. 240, in
these terms:

 

I have to make a practice direction which is made after
consultation with the judges of the Queen's Bench and Family Divisions. A jury
consists of 12 individuals chosen at random from the appropriate panel. A juror
should be excused if he is personally concerned in the facts of the particular
case, or closely connected with a party to the proceedings or with a
prospective witness. He may also be excused at the discretion of the judge on
grounds of personal hardship or conscientious objection to jury service. It is
contrary to established practice for jurors to be excused on more general
grounds such as race, religion, or political beliefs or occupation.

 

On the
general question of partiality in jurors and the position of a trial judge in
these matters, the court said, at pp. 292‑93:

 

                   Turning to the practical
consideration of the methods by which the process should be carried out
[insuring impartiality of jurors] we deal first with the kind of obvious
partiality dealt with in the English practice direction. Some trial Judges make
a practice of saying to the jury panel, before the selection process begins,
something of this nature:

 

If there is anyone on this panel who is closely
connected with a party to this case or with a witness who is to testify, will
you please stand?

 

(Rarely does anyone respond.) If someone does stand, the
trial Judge asks him to come forward (usually to the jury‑box), and
inquires further as to that person's connection with the case. To take obvious
examples, if the juror is the uncle of the accused, or the wife of a witness,
or the brother of the investigating police officer, he ought not to serve.

 

                   In our view, the trial Judge on his
own should excuse that prospective juror from the case, without more ado. The Criminal
Code  makes no express provision for it, but it does not expressly or
impliedly forbid it either, and in our view it is in the power of the trial
Judge as part of his function of ensuring a fair trial. We think the practice
of excusing jurors of obvious partiality is a desirable one in all cases.

 

And, at
pp. 296‑97, he said:

 

                   Finally, there is Mr. Hamilton's
""afterthought"" at the trial, that the trial Judge should inquire
generally of the panel whether any of them had ""any connection with the
accused"". From our earlier observations as to the appropriate procedure,
it follows that in our view it would have been desirable for the trial Judge to
have acceded to this request, and indeed to have ""screened"" the panel
for what we have called obvious cases of partiality. There is not the slightest
suggestion that in fact any juror chosen had any connection whatever with the
accused, and we decline to hold that this ruling vitiated the trial. If it were
otherwise, most of the criminal trials heretofore held in Ontario have been
likewise vitiated.

 

71.                     In
my view, the course taken by the trial judge in the case at bar was quite
proper and well within the scope of the propositions that emerge from Hubbert,
which have been set out above. The only question which could be raised to
distinguish what occurred in the case at bar is that the trial judge conducted
his inquiry in the absence of the accused and his counsel. From the authorities
earlier cited, the question is whether the judge's inquiry of panel members as
to partiality could affect the vital interests of the accused, touching on the
question of guilt or innocence. It is evident from the foregoing review of the Juries
Act that the questioning of the jurors in the courtroom was a part of the
first step of the jury process, that is, the constitution of the jury panel,
and comes within the provisions of the Juries Act. In interviewing the
jurors as he did, the trial judge was exercising powers in relation to the
selection of the panel in accordance with what we were told is normal procedure
and it is also evident that he was exercising a power known and approved in
proceedings under the Criminal Code . This is a step in which the
appellant has no part and, as has been said, no legal right to intervene. As
long as the procedure adopted to constitute the jury panel conforms with the
Act and produces a divers and disinterested group, no vital interest of the
accused is affected. As said by Seaton J.A., supra, an accused person is
entitled at law to have an indifferent rather than a favourable jury. The
process by which the Juries Act provides for the creation of the jury
panel, based on a random choice, from among those members of the community who
are eligible for jury service is designed to achieve that objective. That
process involved a judicial examination of the jury lists and a judicial
discretion to excuse or exempt jurors. Following completion of this process,
the accused is entitled to challenge jurors on a variety of grounds, including
partiality, as provided in the Criminal Code . That is what occurred
here. Each juror who served on the jury was challenged for cause under the Criminal
Code  in the presence of the accused and each one survived the challenge.
The appellant thus obtained‑‑as nearly as the law can provide‑‑that
to which he is entitled, an impartial jury, and participated in those
procedures which affected his vital interests. I would reject this ground of
appeal.

 

Is the
Nova Scotia Liberal Association a Person?

 

72.                     Is
the Nova Scotia Liberal Association a ""person"" within the meaning of
s. 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code ? Section 110(1)(d) of
the Code upon which the indictment in part is based makes it an offence
to offer or agree to accept for himself or another person a reward, advantage
or benefit of any kind as consideration for the exercise of influence. It was
argued that the main recipient of any alleged benefits was the Nova Scotia
Liberal Association, and that the Association is not a ""person""
within the meaning of s. 110(1)(d) of the Code. I am in agreement
with the Court of Appeal that for the purposes of s. 110(1)(d) of the Code
the Nova Scotia Liberal Association is a person. I accept the reasoning of the
Court of Appeal on this point. In my view, the word ""person"" in s.
110(1)(d) of the Code must be read in the light of s. 2  of the Criminal
Code , which provides, in part:

 

                   2. ...

 

""every one"", ""person"",
""owner"", and similar expressions include Her Majesty and public
bodies, bodies corporate, societies, companies and inhabitants of counties, parishes,
municipalities or other districts in relation to the acts and things that they
are capable of doing and owning respectively;

 

The Nova
Scotia Liberal Association clearly falls within the meaning of the word
""society"" in s. 2 . There was evidence that the Nova Scotia Liberal
Association was an active organization, hiring staff, renting premises,
receiving and disbursing funds and carrying on general political activities. To
hold that the Association was not a ""person"" and, therefore, not within
the purview of s. 110(1) (d) of the Criminal Code , would lead to
an absurd result and frustrate the obvious purpose of the enactment. I would
reject this ground of appeal.

 

Conspirator's
Exception to the Hearsay Rule

 

73.                     The
appellant concedes that the charge of the trial judge on the question of the
application of the conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule was generally in
accordance with the decision of this Court in R. v. Carter, [1982] 1
S.C.R. 938. This was also the view of the Court of Appeal which conveniently
summarized in three steps, at p. 486, the approach propounded in Carter:

 

 

 

1. The trier of fact must first be satisfied beyond
                                   reasonable doubt that the alleged conspiracy
in  fact existed.

 

2. If the alleged conspiracy is found to exist then
                                   the trier of fact must review all the
evidence       that is directly admissible against the accused                            and
decide on a balance of probabilities whether        or not he is a member of
the conspiracy.

 

3. If the trier of fact concludes on a balance of                                       probabilities
that the accused is a member of     the conspiracy then he or they must go on
and                         decide whether the Crown has established such        membership
beyond reasonable doubt. In this last       step, only the trier of fact can
apply the  hearsay exception and consider evidence of acts                             and
declarations of co‑conspirators done in        furtherance of the object
of the conspiracy as              evidence against the accused on the issue of
his        guilt.

 

It was
argued for the appellant that while the indictment referred to unnamed
conspirators, the Crown's case was that the only members of the conspiracy were
the appellant and his two co‑accused. Accordingly, in determining beyond
a reasonable doubt on all the evidence whether a conspiracy had existed at the
first stage of their deliberations, the jury must necessarily have determined
on all the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt that either MacFadden or the
appellant, or both, were members of the conspiracy. It was submitted that this
instruction undermined the rationale of the conspirator's exception to the
hearsay rule, in that the jury of necessity determined the guilt of one or both
of the accused ab initio on all the evidence tendered at the trial.

 

74.                     This
argument, in my view, is based upon a misunderstanding and misconstruction of
this Court's decision in Carter. It rests upon the proposition that in
taking the first step in the Carter case the jury would of necessity
have to determine beyond a reasonable doubt the identity of at least two
persons involved in the conspiracy. This, in my view, does not follow. It may
often be true, that in determining beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a
conspiracy one may also determine the identity of some of the members. On some
occasions and in respect of some conspirators it may not be necessary to have
resort to the hearsay exception, but this is not always so. It is entirely
possible, and not uncommon, to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on all
the evidence that a conspiracy for the purposes alleged in the indictment
existed while still being uncertain as to the identity of all the conspirators.
Once this is understood it becomes evident that there is no substance to the
appellant's argument. On this first step what is considered is the existence of
the conspiracy, not individual membership. At this point the hearsay exception
is inapplicable. This is in accordance with the view expressed by Martin J.A.
in R. v. Baron and Wertman (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 525, in reference to
the conspirator's exception to the hearsay rule, where he said, at p. 544:

 

It only comes into play, however, where there is
evidence fit to be considered by the jury that the conspiracy alleged between A
and B exists. It is clear that where the fact in issue to be proved is whether
a conspiracy exists between A and B, A's acts, or declarations implicating B
cannot be used to prove that B was a party to the conspiracy, in the absence of
some other evidence admissible against B to bring him within the conspiracy:
see Savard and Lizotte v. The King (1945), 85 C.C.C. 254 at p. 262,
[1946] 3 D.L.R. 468, [1946] S.C.R. 20 at p. 29.

 

Where,
at this stage, the ""evidence fit to go to a jury"" does not satisfy
the trier of fact according to the criminal standard of proof that the
conspiracy existed, it need go no further for no conspiracy has been shown. The
remaining steps, as outlined in Carter, follow only where the trier of
fact has reached its first determination‑‑that the conspiracy
exists.

 

75.                     Applying
the Carter approach to the case at bar, it must be observed that there
were three conspirators named and that the evidence directly admissible against
each differed in some particulars, particularly in the case of the appellant
who had little if any direct contact with the persons doing business with the
Government while the other two did. There was evidence upon which the jury
could conclude that a conspiracy did exist, and much of the evidence as it
would apply to each individual charged would be hearsay. The hearsay exception
was therefore available to the Crown, if the jury on a consideration of the
evidence directly admissible against each individual had reached, in respect of
each of the accused, a conclusion as to membership in the conspiracy. The jury
was properly instructed as to their duties in this respect and it is evident
that they concluded on both issues, conspiracy and membership, against the
appellant.

 

76.                     In
argument it was suggested that the Carter approach could not apply to an
allegation of a conspiracy between two people. Indeed, this seemed to be at the
root of the argument advanced on this issue. It was formerly considered, where
there were two conspirators only (and no others), that both must be convicted
or both acquitted. This was to avoid an inconsistency in verdicts, to avoid a
finding that A was guilty of conspiring with B but that, on the same occasion,
B was not guilty of conspiring with A. This problem would not, of course, arise
at bar where three accused conspirators were involved but, in any event, in the
present state of our law it could not prevail. The former view has been
authoritatively rejected in the judgment of the majority of this Court in Guimond
v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 960. It is not necessary for me to discuss in
any detail the majority judgment of Ritchie J. in that case in which he
reviewed and distinguished the earlier authorities and made special reference
to Director of Public Prosecutions v. Shannon, [1975] A.C. 717. He said,
at p. 977 [S.C.R.]:

 

                   I think it can be taken, that where
only two persons are charged with conspiracy and they are separately tried
whether or not they are separately indicted, the conviction of one is not
necessarily invalidated by the acquittal of the other.

 

In my
view, these words are equally applicable to a case where the two conspirators
were jointly charged and jointly tried.

 

77.                     In
my view, there is no inconsistency in this position. The apparently
inconsistent verdict does not result from the impossible conclusion that A
conspired with B to commit a given crime and that B did not conspire with A on
the same occasion to commit the same crime, but rather from the fact that there
was evidence admissible against A to establish his guilt but no sufficient
evidence admissible against B to prove his participation. The fact that upon
arrest Mr. A says to the police ""Yes, B and I agreed to murder X""
will not be admissible against B does not deprive it of its evidentiary force
against A.

 

78.                     I
would reject this ground of appeal.

 

Use of
Character Evidence

 

79.                     The
defence of the appellant at trial was that his good name and reputation refuted
the charges. There was a good deal of evidence of the appellant's good
character and reputation before the jury. Great stress was placed upon it by
the defence and there can be no doubt that it was forcefully brought before the
jury. In dealing with this point in his directions to the jury, the trial judge
said:

 

In the case of Senator Barrow, you may take the
following evidence into account at the second stage of your deliberations, and
you will take it into account against the background of the general matters
that I covered at the beginning of my review‑‑what I have described
as background evidence, in other words, of Senator Barrow's association with
Mr. MacFadden and Mr. Simpson in connection with the financial and other
affairs of the Liberal party, and, in the same category, evidence of his
association with party figures, including the fact that he was regarded as a
senior statesman and adviser whose opinion was respected by the Premier and
others. In that same category, you must also take into account the
uncontradicted evidence of many witnesses who testified as to the character and
reputation of Senator Barrow as a man of honesty and integrity and as to his
many unpaid public and charitable endeavours. All of that is background.

 

In
referring to the theory of defence, he also stated:

 

There are differences in detail in the submissions that
were made on behalf of Senator Barrow and those made on behalf of Mr.
MacFadden. The position taken on behalf of Senator Barrow was that his
character and reputation deny the charge against him, that the whole case for
the Crown is an attempt to implicate Senator Barrow in conduct on the part of
Mr. Simpson in which he was not involved, that being indicated by the fact that
none of the liquor representatives knew Senator Barrow. It's argued on his behalf
that no significance can be attached to the finding of some Liquor Commission
documents in his possession since he was not a collector. As to the handling of
funds, Senator Barrow was merely an administrator.

 

80.                     Counsel
for the appellant, in addressing the issue in this Court, acknowledged that in
reviewing the evidence for the jury the trial judge related instances where
witnesses testified to the appellant's good reputation for integrity and
honesty. It was argued, however, that evidence of good character is relevant to
show that the accused was not likely to commit the crime charged (R. v. Khan
(1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 32, at p. 42) and that this had not been made clear to
the jury. It was also argued that the trial judge did not expressly instruct
the jury, as a matter of law, on the use to which they could put such evidence.
This was said to be a non‑direction, particularly because of the
importance of the character evidence to the appellant's case. In dealing with
this issue, the Court of Appeal said, at p. 16:

 

                   Throughout the trial the evidence of
the appellant's good character was emphasized. It was referred to by
appellant's counsel in his address and the trial judge referred to it several
times during his address. The appellant did not testify and accordingly his
credibility as a witness was not in issue. While not directly stated by the
trial judge we are satisfied that the jury must have been aware that they could
consider the evidence as relevant to show that the appellant was not likely to
have committed the crime with which he was charged. Having regard to the charge
as a whole we are unable to say that any miscarriage of justice occurred as a
result of what at best was a technical non‑direction.

 

81.                     It
is my view, from a perusal of the charge to the jury and of several extracts
from the evidence, that the Court of Appeal's comments on this question are
apt. There can be no doubt that evidence of the good reputation and character
of the appellant was clearly put before the jury. It was emphasized and given
fair treatment by the trial judge. I am in full accord on this point with the
Court of Appeal. I would therefore reject this ground and for the reasons given
above, I would dismiss the appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Narcotics ‑‑ Narcotic Control Act ‑‑
Restoration procedure ‑‑ Seizure of monies allegedly connected to
narcotics offence ‑‑ Restoration proceedings not concluded before
applicant’s death ‑‑ Whether or not monies should be restored to
innocent personal representative ‑‑ Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C.
1970, c. N‑1, s. 10.

 

                   The focus of this case was on the ""restoration
hearing"", a procedure established under the Narcotic Control Act,
whereby a person can regain possession of things allegedly related to the
commission of a narcotics offence and seized under s. 10 of the Act. The
original applicant for restoration, Ernest Gombosh, was searched on two
occasions in October, 1979. Several quantities of drugs, drug paraphenalia and
cash were seized in the course of those searches and Mr. Gombosh was
subsequently charged with offences under the Narcotic Control Act. Mr.
Gombosh applied, in December 1979, for restoration of the monies seized. The
hearing was adjourned and Mr. Gombosh died before being prosecuted and before
the restoration hearing process was completed. Letters of administration were
granted to the current applicant‑‑a person innocent of any wrong‑doing‑‑who
pursued the restoration of the seized monies in his capacity as administrator.
A judge of the Provincial Court ordered restoration but this order was quashed
in the Supreme Court of Ontario and the matter remitted to Provincial Court.
The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the decision to quash.








 

                   The two‑part test for restoration in s. 10(6)(a)
required that the magistrate be satisfied that (1) the applicant is
""entitled to possession of the thing seized"", and (2) the thing
seized is not required as evidence. The three crucial questions to this appeal,
then, were: what was meant by s. 10(6)(a) entitlement, on whom was the
burden of proof or disproof, and what was the standard of proof? 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   In order to satisfy a magistrate at a restoration
hearing on the question of entitlement to possession, a claimant must show on
the balance of probabilities that he was in possession of the property at the
time of seizure. To place the onus on the claimant in this way does not offend
established rules of procedure as the claim of entitlement at this stage is
simply the assertion of a civil right. In addition, such evidence is readily
obtainable by most claimants. The generous standing in s. 10(5) leaves it open
to ""any"" other person to rebut the claim to possession.

 

                   While entitlement within the meaning of s. 10(6)(a)
can reasonably be assumed to mean ""lawful entitlement"", the rule of
public policy that a person should not be allowed to profit from his own wrong
doing should only operate where there is turpitude. Where that turpitude is a
criminal wrong, criminality must be demonstrated in accordance with normal
procedures. Section 10(8), which directs forfeiture of things seized which were
""used in any manner"" in connection with a narcotics offence of which
a person has been convicted, codifies the ex turpi causa non oritur actio
rule in the context of narcotics convictions.

 

                   The tainted connection leading to forfeiture under
s. 10(8) must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence
as well as the nature of the proceedings under s. 10 make it inappropriate to
transform a restoration hearing into a trial in which the Crown need only meet
the civil standard of proof in order to establish guilt or taint. The
culpability of the owner of the seized property must have been proven at
antecedent criminal proceedings under the Narcotic Control Act. In the
absence of a specific finding at trial of the requisite ""tainted
connection"", the Crown can prove taint on the reasonable doubt standard at
the restoration hearing. Where there was no antecedent conviction and no basis
for laying a narcotics related charge, proceedings should be initiated under s.
312(1)  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Although s. 10(8) might imply that the ex turpi
rule is excluded by the expressio unius est exclusio alterius
rule from operation under s. 10(6)(a), where the things are connected to
a conviction for a non‑narcotics offence, such an interpretation would
multiply proceedings and offend public perception of the justice system. The expressio
unius rule, therefore, should not prevent a reading of s. 10(6)(a)
entitlement to mean ""lawful entitlement"" in this very limited
context. 

 

                   Where the rule of public policy legitimately
applies, the status of an applicant as the innocent representative of a
convicted but deceased owner would not entitle the applicant to restoration.
However, where no conviction has been entered and where the evidentiary use of
the things has either expired or is non‑existent the magistrate may not
deny restoration to the person entitled to possession.

1.                Wilson
J.‑‑This case raises the issue of the proper interpretation
of s. 10 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. Section
10 allows an officer to seize things which he or she suspects are related to
the commission of a narcotics offence. However, the seizure provisions are not
directly at issue in this appeal. Rather, the focus of the case is on the
procedure called a restoration hearing by means of which a person can regain
possession of the things seized. Section 10(6) sets out a two‑part test
governing restoration. The first part requires the magistrate to be satisfied
that the applicant is ""entitled to possession of the thing seized"".
The second part requires him to be satisfied that the thing seized is not
required as evidence. It is the first part of the test and the nature of the
burden it imposes which must be resolved in order to settle the present appeal.
The meaning of the phrase ""entitled to possession"" must be
ascertained in the context of the peculiar facts of this case, namely that the appellant
is the innocent representative of the allegedly non‑innocent person from
whom the things were seized. The original claimant died before being prosecuted
and before the restoration hearing process was completed.

 

1. The Facts

 

2.                The original applicant for restoration,
Ernest Gombosh, was searched on two occasions in October of 1979. Several
quantities of drugs, drug paraphenalia and cash were seized in the course of
those searches and Mr. Gombosh was subsequently charged with offences under the
Narcotic Control Act. On December 17, 1979 Mr. Gombosh applied for
restoration of the monies seized. The hearing was adjourned. However, on
February 28, 1980 Mr. Gombosh died before being prosecuted and before the
restoration hearing process was completed. Letters of administration were
granted to the current appellant, Eric Fleming. He pursued restoration of the
seized monies in his capacity as administrator of Mr. Gombosh's estate.

 

2. The Legislative Scheme

 

3.                Mr. Gombosh and subsequently the
appellant proceeded under ss. 10(5) and (6) of the Narcotic Control Act.
However, s. 10 deals not only with restoration but also with seizure,
possession by the Minister of things seized, and forfeiture. Thus the
restoration hearing is only one aspect of the larger process. I have set out
the relevant subsections below as they appeared at the time of these
proceedings:

 

                   10. (1) A peace officer may, at any time,

 

(a) without a
warrant enter and search any place other than a dwelling‑house, and under
the authority of a writ of assistance or a warrant issued under this section,
enter and search any dwelling‑house in which he reasonably believes there
is a narcotic by means of or in respect of which an offence under this Act has
been committed;

 

(b) search any
person found in such place; and

 

(c) seize and take
away any narcotic found in such place, any thing in such place in which he
reasonably suspects a narcotic is contained or concealed, or any other thing by
means of or in respect of which he reasonably believes an offence under this
Act has been committed or that may be evidence of the commission of such
an offence.

 

                                                                    ...


 

                   (5)
Where a narcotic or other thing has been seized under subsection (1), any
person may, within two months from the date of such seizure, upon prior
notification having been given to the Crown in the manner prescribed by the
regulations, apply to a magistrate within whose territorial jurisdiction the
seizure was made for an order of restoration under subsection (6).

 

                   (6)
Subject to subsections (8) and (9), where upon the hearing of an application
made under subsection (5) the magistrate is satisfied

 

(a) that the
applicant is entitled to possession of the narcotic or other thing seized, and

 

(b) that the thing
so seized is not or will not be required as evidence in any proceedings in
respect of an offence under this Act,

 

he shall order that the
thing so seized be restored forthwith to the applicant, and where the
magistrate is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to possession of the
thing so seized but is not satisfied as to the matters mentioned in paragraph (b),
he shall order that the thing so seized be restored to the applicant

 

(c) upon the
expiration of four months from the date of the seizure, if no proceedings in
respect of an offence under this Act have been commenced before that time, or

 

(d) upon the final
conclusion of any such proceedings, in any other case.

 

                   (7)
Where no application has been made for the return of any narcotic or other
thing seized under subsection (1) within two months from the date of such
seizure, or an application therefor has been made but upon the hearing thereof
no order of restoration is made, the thing so seized shall be delivered to the
Minister who may make such disposition thereof as he thinks fit.

 

                   (8)
Where a person has been convicted of an offence under section 3, 4 or 5, any
narcotic seized under subsection (1), by means of or in respect of which the
offence was committed, any money so seized that was used for the purchase of
that narcotic and any hypodermic needle, syringe, capping machine or other
apparatus so seized that was used in any manner in connection with the offence
is forfeited to Her Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Minister directs.

 

                   (9)
Where a person has been convicted of an offence under section 4 or 5, the court
may, upon application by counsel for the Crown, order that any conveyance
seized under subsection (1) that has been proved to have been used in any
manner in connection with the offence be forfeited, and upon such order being
made the conveyance is forfeited to Her Majesty and, except as provided in
section 11, shall upon the expiration of thirty days from the date of such
forfeiture be disposed of as the Minister directs. 

 

4.                The broad delineation of the seizure
power in s. 10(1) is of particular importance for the analysis of the legal
issues in this appeal. That section allows an officer without a warrant to
enter and search certain premises and seize things found therein which he
reasonably believes are related to a narcotics offence or may be
evidence of such an offence. Restoration under s. 10(6) is contingent on the
presiding magistrate's being satisfied that the appellant is ""entitled to
possession"" of the thing seized and that it is not required as
evidence. Conversely, where as in the present case there is no evidentiary use
for the property and no conviction has been entered, the Minister's custody
under s. 10(7) of ""things seized"" is legitimate only where
entitlement has not been demonstrated to the presiding magistrate's
satisfaction. Thus, the crucial questions to be answered are what is meant by
entitlement, who has the burden of its proof or disproof, and what is the
standard of proof? Finally, it should be noted that ""disentitlement""
or forfeiture is mandated where the narrow conditions of s. 10(8) are met, i.e.
where seized monies were used for the purchase of a narcotic in respect of
which a person has been convicted of a narcotics offence.

 

3. The Courts Below

 

5.                The decisions in the courts below
reflect different approaches to the nature of the burden on the applicant to
establish entitlement under s. 10(6)(a). Waisberg J. of the Ontario
Provincial Court presided at the restoration hearing. He felt that entitlement
should be narrowly construed since the consequence of failing to meet the test
was to deprive an applicant of ""several rights"". Because of the original
applicant's death there was no possible evidentiary use for the seized monies
in this case. Judge Waisberg observed that if the matter had gone to trial
there might well have been a conviction. Nevertheless, he felt satisfied that
the current appellant was entitled to possession as administrator of the
original applicant's estate. In his view, the suspected connection of the
monies to drug trafficking did not defeat restoration. He made the requested
order.

 

6.                Smith J. [(1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 323]
quashed the Provincial Court Judge's order on the basis of Largie v. R.
(1982), 25 C.R. (3d) 289, a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal which had
been handed down in the interim. In his view, Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. had failed
to take account of the rule of public policy that the courts will not permit a
litigant to benefit from his or her crime. He rejected the appellant's argument
that ""when a claimant accused has died, the purpose behind the rule loses
its legitimacy assuming the absence of any evidence that the representative is
tainted"", and thus ""restoration should be made virtually for the
asking"". Such a result, to Smith J.'s mind, ignored the scheme of the
legislation as defined in Re Aimonetti and The Queen (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d)
164, a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal which was heavily relied on in Largie,
supra. The Ontario Supreme Court in Largie had quashed the trial
judge's restoration order on the basis of the rule of public policy. The
Ontario Court of Appeal upheld that decision without, however, giving express
approval to the reasoning on which it was based. Instead, Houlden J.A. adopted
the approach of the majority in Aimonetti which, by reading s. 10 in its
totality, found that the Minister's right to custody under s. 10(7) is directly
proportionate to the scope of the seizure power in s. 10(1)(c). Thus, in
order to obtain restoration an applicant must disprove the suspected
relationship between the things seized and narcotics offences. Smith J. in the
case at hand combined the public policy rationale with the textual
analysis of Aimonetti in the following passage at p. 327: 

 

                   Perhaps
the matter might be put differently. When applying the public policy rule in
the context of the seizure provisions of the Narcotic Control Act, the
courts have tended to apply the taint to the ""thing"" or the monies
rather than to the applicant. And that view is supported by the wording of the
section.

 

This hybrid version of the two approaches perhaps obscures the
importance of the distinction between them for the purposes of this case.
However, the core of Smith J.'s reasoning is that once one replaces the person‑specific
approach of an analy­sis based on the rule of public policy with the thing‑specific
approach of an analysis based on the statutory text, the innocence of the
person applying for restoration becomes irrelevant.

 

7.                The Ontario Court of Appeal [(1983), 3
C.C.C. (3d) 575] upheld Smith J.'s decision to quash in very short reasons
written by Lacourcière J.A. However, Lacourcière J.A.'s analysis appears to be
a reversion to the public policy rationale so carefully avoided by the
Court of Appeal in Largie. He founds his decision on the view [at pp.
575‑76] that ""the appellant as administrator of the deceased's
estate can be in no better position to claim the restoration of the funds, the
apparent proceeds of the alleged crime, than the alleged deceased
perpetrator"". Implicit in that position is the belief that the person‑specific
public policy rule applies and that the entire case therefore turns on the
peculiar fact that the applicant is an innocent representative of the allegedly
non­innocent original applicant.

 

8.                This divergence in analytic approach in
the decisions below reflects a divergence in jurisprudential treatment of s.
10(6)(a) generally. B. R. Shilton in his article ""Drug Moneys‑‑The
Fruits of Crime?"" 25 C.R. (2d) 294, has identified three conceptually
distinct judicial interpretations of s. 10(6)(a) entitlement. The
parties to this appeal admit of two possible approaches in their written
argument. An examination of the restoration hearing transcript reveals that a
third restrictive interpretation was proposed by the appellant at first
instance and, indeed, was accepted by Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. as being the most
appropriate approach. For convenience I will label the three interpretive
approaches as follows: (1) the simple proof of entitlement approach; (2) the
public policy approach; and (3) the legislative text approach. The unusual fact
of the original applicant's death throws into sharp relief the conceptual
distinction between the latter two approaches. Generally, an applicant is the
person from whom the things in question were originally seized. From that perspective,
the effect of the public policy approach and the legislative text approach is
the same, i.e., an applicant must disprove ""taint"" in order to
show entitlement. However, standing under the Act is quite broad; it allows
""any person"" to apply for restoration. If that person has no
connection to the reasonable suspicion which prompted the seizure in the first
place, the difference between the two approaches, as Lacourcière J.A.'s
decision demonstrates, becomes very important. If the taint attaches to the person,
then the appellant's innocent representative status may be significant. But, if
the taint attaches to the thing seized, as Smith J. concluded, then the
innocent status of the applicant may be irrelevant. It must be remembered,
however, that this dichotomy arises only if one rejects the first approach
which simply requires an applicant to prove entitlement. 

 

9.                It was suggested by counsel for the
respondent that the appellant made a concession in the course of the
restoration hearing which concludes the case against him and obviates the need
to discuss the distinctions between the various approaches. I would
respectfully disagree. At the hearing the appellant's counsel argued that,
since forfeiture could only occur under the conditions set out in s. 10(8), the
first approach, namely simple proof of entitlement, was all that was required
of an applicant in order to succeed on his application. He went on to concede
that, if he was wrong in that and had to prove in addition the absence of
taint, he would be unable to discharge that burden. Accordingly, if the Court
were to find that the rule of public policy operated vis‑à‑vis
innocent representatives of less worthy litigants, this concession would be
fatal to the appellant's case under both the public policy and the legislative
text approaches. The concession would be irrelevant, however, if the Court were
to find, as did Waisberg Prov. Ct. J., that all s. 10(6)(a) requires is
proof of the right to possession. Thus, at the very least the Court must
discuss the merits of the first analytic approach. Then, if that analysis is
rejected, it must go on to discuss the viability of the argument that a claim
by an innocent representative should not be defeated by the taint associated
with the original claimant. If the result is again negative, only then does the
appellant's concession disqualify him from success. However, it would be
difficult to discuss fully the merits of any of the possible approaches to s.
10(6)(a) entitlement without reviewing the divergent lines of
jurisprudence. I propose therefore not to limit my analysis of the section in
the way suggested by respondent's counsel.

 

4. The Jurisprudence

 

10.              Much of the jurisprudence is in the nature
of magistrate or provincial court decisions and is therefore reported only
through incorporation in appellate decisions reviewing by way of certiorari.
In addition, many of the decisions fail to distinguish between the latter two
approaches, viewing them as one and the same or as different versions of each
other. Nevertheless, it is possible to separate out the various strands of
analysis.

 

(a)               The Simple Proof of Entitlement Approach

 

11.              The cases adopting the first approach,
which is a strict approach to the concept of legal entitlement, largely depend
on the argument that forfeiture should only occur under s. 10(8) and that penal
statutes and statutes depriving a person of proprietary rights should be
strictly construed. Implicit in the reasoning is the notion that the reasonable
suspicion which gives rise to a s. 10 search and seizure should not operate as
a finding of guilt unless there is compliance with the normal rules of proof.

 

12.              In Burgess v. The Queen (1975), 18
Cr.L.Q. 254, one of the earliest reported cases, Rice Prov. Ct. J., after
finding that the terms of s. 10(8) could not be met even after conviction,
concluded that the main issue was the evidentiary use of the seized monies. He
thereby assumed that the Minister could not retain the monies under s. 10(7) on
any other basis. This diminished reading of the purpose of the Minister's
custody is confirmed by Rice Prov. Ct. J.'s treatment of s. 10(6)(a) in
the hearing at first instance in Largie, supra. There he held,
according to Houlden J.A., that entitlement in s. l0(6)(a) ""was
used in the legal sense, not in the moral sense and that if the appellant could
show that he was entitled to possession of the money as opposed to any other
person, he was entitled to an order of restoration"": see Largie, supra,
at p. 291. 

 

13.              The same assumption is implicit in Smith
(M.J.) v. The Queen, [1976] 1 F.C. 196, a case which arose out of a civil action
against the Minister to reclaim monies seized in a s. 10 search but for which
no s. 10 application had ever been made. The accused had pleaded guilty to an
offence under the Narcotic Control Act. There was no indication in the
evidence that the monies were related to that offence. Addy J., like Rice Prov.
Ct. J., was of the view that, where there was no evidentiary use for the
property and no forfeiture under s. 10(8), entitlement was simply a question of
who was the most likely owner or had the right to possession. Property rights
were not subject to the applicant's disproof of taint. Quite the contrary; the
Minister's s. 10(7) possessory right was subject to the proprietary rights of
interested persons. He stated at pp. 199‑200:

 

It is obvious that section
10(8), in addition to providing that the Minister may direct the disposition of
money seized, specifically stipulates that any money seized which was used
for the purchase of a narcotic is forfeited to Her Majesty. This is the
only case where any provision is made as to forfeiture of monies and it is
clear from the admitted facts, in the case at bar, that the monies in question
were not so used. Altogether apart from the principle that if a statute
purporting to forfeit a property right must specifically state so, in view of
the specific provisions as to forfeiture in subsection (8), I must conclude
that subsection (7) does not in any way provide for the forfeiture of any
property right or any right to possession since no forfeiture is mentioned in that
subsection. Thus, the discretion of the Minister in that particular subsection
is subject to any property rights of persons interested in the
""thing"" seized.

 

And later at p. 201:

 

                   It
seems quite clear to me that subsections (5) and (7) of section 10 are merely
procedural and custodial. They provide a ready mechanism for a person to obtain
by some re‑application the return of anything which has been seized and
also provide for the custody of same in the event of any application not being
made or in the event of the application being denied. They do not either
explicitly or by necessary implication cause any property right to be
forfeited.

 

                   I might
add that if, in enacting these subsections, the Parliament of Canada did
purport to provide that any money whatsoever, seized in a police raid under the
Narcotic Control Act, including money which is not eventually connected
with the commission of a criminal offence, would be forfeited to the Crown in
the right of Canada in the event of an application not being made for the
return of same within two months, then, these provisions would be ultra
vires as infringing on the property and civil rights jurisdiction of the
provinces. 

 

14.              By employing the language of ultra vires
and of interference with property rights Addy J. articulates the underlying rationale
of the first approach. From this standpoint the scope of entitlement in s.
10(6)(a) is bounded on the one hand by the presumption of innocence and
on the other hand by the presumption of constitutionality. The presumption of
innocence addresses the impropriety in terms of fundamental principles of
criminal law of the imposition of a penalty of forfeiture where there has been
no proof that an offence associated with the goods has been committed. The
presumption of constitutionality addresses the impropriety in terms of
legislative competence of federal legislative interference with property rights
apart from any valid federal objective.

 

15.              The decision of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal in Re Hicks and The Queen (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 91, takes this
same narrow interpretive approach. The case deals with s. 10(9) which is
exclusively concerned with forfeiture of seized conveyances. Subsection 10(6)
is subject to ss. 10(8) and 10(9). At the restoration hearing the Crown argued
that ""subject to"" meant that s. 10(9) should prevail until it was
established that its terms could not be met. The applicant argued that this
restricted s. 10(6) to a very limited operation as the class of things liable
to seizure under s. 10(1)(c) but not liable to forfeiture under ss.
10(8) and 10(9) is almost non‑existent. The majority at the Court of
Appeal quashed the order denying restoration at first instance. Although the
applicant had not disproved taint, it was felt that the requirements of ss.
10(6)(a) and (b) had nevertheless been met. Hall J.A., with whom
three others concurred, found that an order granting restoration is not
necessarily inconsistent with a later order of forfeiture. In the course of his
reasons he stated at p. 95:

 

                   It is
here appropriate to observe that statutes of this nature should be strictly
construed. Deprivation of property as provided in the Narcotic Control Act
is, to say the least, an extraordinary measure; that is not to say it is bad
but rather the remedy of restoration and the ultimate penalty of forfeiture
need to be reviewed in the context of the Act providing for them. Clear terms
are required before depriving a person of his property, either temporarily or
permanently.

 

16.              Both Addy J. and Hall J.A. describe the
principle of strict construction in terms of deprivation of property. However,
such deprivation is not unusual under criminal statutes although, as Addy J.
has pointed out, an attempt by Parliament to expropriate property for a purpose
which is outside federal competence would likely be ultra vires.
Alternatively, the rule can be described in terms of a presumption favouring
strict construction of penal statutes. Indeed, this seems to be the context in
which Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. invoked a restrictive interpretive approach in the
present case. Although he explained that he was doing so because forfeiture
deprives the accused of ""several rights"", he also pointed out that
the Narcotic Control Act is a statute ""involving criminal
prosecution"", that all criminal matters with regard to the original
applicant came to an end with his death, and that there has never been a final
adjudication of guilt or innocence. 

 

17.              The principle of strict construction of
penal statutes, however, is problematic. This Court in R. v. Robinson,
[1951] S.C.R. 522, determined that no such general rule exists in Canadian
criminal law. Admittedly subsequent cases have modified that position. However,
the impropriety of requiring an applicant to disprove taint in a s. 10
restoration hearing does not stem simply from an assertion, dubious since Robinson,
that it is improper to give a large and remedial reading to criminal
provisions. Rather, the impropriety relates to the use of that broad
interpretive approach to undermine the presumption of innocence which
traditionally places the burden of proof on the Crown. Although it is clear
from the case law under the Canadian Bill of Rights that it is open to
Parliament to enact exceptions to the presumption of innocence, s. 2 of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, if nothing else, expressly requires that any such
exceptions be strictly construed. That section reads in part:

 

[Construction of law]

 

                   2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act
of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian
Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of
the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no
law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) deprive a
person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an
independent and impartial tribunal, or of the right to reasonable bail without
just cause; ...

 

Thus the unwillingness to apply the mischief rule to s. 10(6)(a)
which is manifested in the decisions adopting the first analytic approach has a
solid legal foundation in both the Canadian Bill of Rights and common
law principles of criminal justice.

 

18.              The case of Re Collins and The Queen
(1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 377, comes closest to articulating fully the
inconsistency between an enlarged definition of entitlement and fundamental
principles of criminal law. The case concerned a post‑acquittal
restoration hearing at which the trial judge denied restoration. The Quebec
Court of Appeal overturned his decision. Montgomery J.A.'s reasons at p. 378
are brief and to the point:

 

                   The
practical effect of the judgment refusing the order of restoration is to
subject respondent to a heavy fine for an offence of which he has been
acquitted. This is contrary to the principle of autrefois acquit, and I
cannot agree that it was Parliament's intention that s. 10 of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1, should bear such a meaning.

 

This amounts to a statement that forfeiture can and should only take
place under s. 10(8). McCarthy J.A., with whom Jacques J.A. concurred,
acknowledges that s. 10 places the burden of disproof of taint on an applicant
but finds that it is an error of law not to consider the applicant's acquittal
when applying the test of entitlement. He states at pp. 380‑81:

 

In fact, it is only
because the police believed that an offence under the Narcotic Control Act
had been committed that they were able to carry out the seizure (s. 10(1)(c)).
The innocence of the accused with respect to the offence for which he is
charged is settled once and for all (except for appeal, which is not the
present case) by his acquittal. I do not believe that Parliament wished that
the accused be obliged to convince the judge of his innocence, whether the same
judge or another judge, a second time, or to convince him of his innocence with
respect to offences with which he has not even been charged, in order to regain
possession of a thing which had been seized.

 

Again, there is an implicit assumption that forfeiture can only occur
upon a finding of guilt. Unfortunately, McCarthy J.A. does not address the
issue of why in a pre‑trial situation it is not likewise an error of law
to require an applicant to disprove guilt on pain of forfeiture with respect to
offences with which he or she may not be charged, or if charged, of which he or
she may not be convicted. That issue is central to the resolution of the
present appeal. 

 

19.              Finally, in R. v. Molina (1985), 7
O.A.C. 235, the Ontario Court of Appeal refrained from clarifying and
reinforcing its decision in Largie, supra, and from making a
clear pronouncement with regard to onus of proof of ""taint"" in s.
10(6)(a). Vanek Prov.Ct.J. had restored seized monies to an applicant in
spite of finding that the applicant was ""reluctant, unwilling or unable to
provide a satisfactory explanation of the source from which all this money was
generated, and how it came to be accumulated"". Neither Aimonetti, supra,
nor Largie, supra, nor the provisions of the Narcotic Control
Act in Vanek J.'s view justified the conclusion that there is an onus on an
applicant to prove that seized monies were not derived from traffic in drugs.
As the Crown had failed to adduce any evidence on which he could reasonably
conclude that the monies were tainted, he restored them. The Court of Appeal
quashed the trial judge's restoration order. Grange J.A., in oral reasons for
the Court, based his decision on a finding that Vanek J.'s assessment of the
evidence was in error and that the Crown had provided enough evidence on which
one could reasonably conclude that the applicant acquired the seized monies
from drug trafficking. In doing so Grange J.A. not only sidesteps the question
of onus but also gives a very cautious reading to Largie and Aimonetti
as follows at p. 238:

 

                   It
appears clear to us that whatever the onus may be and wherever it may lie, the
application may be refused if the magistrate concludes that the money resulted
from an illegal trade in narcotics. This is precisely what was held in Aimonetti
at p. 172 and approved in Largie at p. 511.

 

(b) The Public Policy Approach

 

20.              The requirement that an applicant disprove
taint because of ""the well known rule of public policy"" is found by
reading ""entitled"" in s. 10(6)(a) as meaning ""lawfully
entitled"". This triggers the application of the maxim ex turpi causa
non oritur actio. Failure to consider this rule of public policy
constitutes the requisite ""error of law"" on the basis of which a
superior court reviewing on certiorari can quash a magistrate's
decision. In order to prove lawful entitlement an applicant is usually called
upon to demonstrate that the monies came from a legitimate source and are
therefore not the profits of crime. It is generally accepted that the rule is
person‑specific, i.e., that what is abhorrent to public perception
is the spectacle of the actual wrongdoer reaping the benefits of his or her wrongdoing
with the compliance, if not the assistance, of the courts. From this standpoint
the appellant's assertion that his status as an innocent representative
undermines the purpose of the rule is crucial to his success in the current
appeal. The cases can be divided into two categories: (1) those in which the
turpitude which triggers the rule consists of a reasonable belief on the part
of the authorities that the monies seized are related to a narcotics offence,
and (2) those in which the suspected taint has been confirmed by the
applicant's own admissions.

 

21.              The cases of Re Regina and Blaney
(1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 395, Hughes J.'s decision in Largie, and Sowrey
v. Minister of National Health and Welfare, [1985] 1 W.W.R. 85 fall into
the first category. In Blaney the parties foreclosed discussion of the
operation of ex turpi causa in this context by admitting that the rule
applied but arguing on an alternative basis. However Grange J. (as he then was)
of the Ontario High Court comments at p. 398:

 

                   I might
have had some doubt that the well recognized principle that the Courts will not
by giving judgment in his favour permit a litigant to profit by his crime
extends to cover situations such as this where the accused seeks to recover
money removed from him under judicial process but certainly the proposition is
arguable and, as I have said, is not disputed before me. 

 

22.              In Largie Hughes J. of the Ontario
Supreme Court quashed Rice Prov. Ct. J.'s restoration order because of his
failure to take account of the rule. The Ontario Court of Appeal upheld that
result but only by applying the legislative text approach set out in Aimonetti.

 

23.              Only in Sowrey does one find a full‑blown
use of the public policy rationale in spite of the lack of turpitude in
the strict sense. In that case an undercover agent had arranged to exchange
sixty‑four pounds of marijuana for some cash and several thousand units
of LSD. The applicant was arrested and a quantity of cash seized before the
transaction occurred. Garfinkel Prov. Ct. J. of the Manitoba Court denied
restoration in a post‑conviction hearing. There was no evidence to
connect the cash to the offences with which the applicant had been convicted at
trial. Hicks, supra, was distinguished on the basis that there
the interest of an innocent finance company in the seized conveyance swung the
balance in favour of restoration. Although Garfinkel Prov. Ct. J. quotes
extensively from Aimonetti, he uses the language of public policy in his
conclusion at p. 95:

 

                   In the
case before me, it is equally contrary to public policy and against the public
interest for a court to grant an order of restoration if to do so would place
in the hands of the applicant money which, on the facts before me, was
associated with an illegal drug transaction and was intended to be used in an
illegal drug transaction. I want to say I am not deciding the issue of
ownership, which could be the subject of civil proceedings.

 

24.              The second category of cases is comprised
of those in which the turpitude which triggers the rule is an actual admission
of guilt. They include Re Regina and Buxton (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 278,
and Minister of National Health and Welfare v. Medd, [1983] 6 W.W.R. 304
(Man. C.A.) In Buxton the applicant admitted that part of the cash
seized came from the sale of cocaine although not from the sale of the cocaine
seized. The trial judge clearly adhered to the first analytic approach as the
following passage quoted at p. 280 illustrates:

 

                   I come
back again to the point that on the admitted facts it is not possible to
determine what amounts came from what source (i.e., legitimate or
illegitimate). Putting the Crown's case in its strongest possible position‑‑that
the amount derived from narcotic sale is to be considered as $1,099 and the
amount derived from the sale of the car at $1 still results in the sum of $1
being forfeited to the Crown completely without any authority to do so. Further
to require the applicant to prove the proportions of the source of the money
when the admitted facts are that the ""mixed fund"" is in
""indeterminate proportions"" places an impossible burden upon him
which again would result in an effective forfeiture without authority in that
the money would be held in perpetuity by the Minister ... .

 

                   In
conclusion then I would hold that although the Kolstad case and public
policy are both some authority that Courts should not, and should not appear
to, countenance returning money to a person who obtained that money from an
illegal activity; nevertheless, whereas here the money is a ""mixed
fund"" in ""indeterminate proportions"" I would hold that the right
to property is paramount in these circumstances. I find that the applicant has
proved on a preponderance of evidence that he is entitled to possession of the
$1,100 concerned, and since subpara. (b) has been complied with in the admitted
facts, and since s. 10(8) does not apply, that the applicant is entitled to an
order restoring the $1,100 to him. 

 

25.              McFadyen J. of the Alberta Queen's Bench
quashed the restoration. In her view it was contrary both to public policy and
to the scheme set out in s. 10 to allow restoration of the proceeds of crime.
She stated at p. 282:

 

                   In my
view, the words in s. 10(6); ""is entitled to possession"" must be read
as lawfully entitled to possession. In this matter the Court had notice that
Buxton obtained some of the money by unlawful means. Buxton is not entitled to
possession of that sum of money. The onus is on Buxton to establish the amount
of money which he was lawfully entitled to possess.

 

26.              In Medd there was likewise an
admission of guilt, although the illegality was not narcotics related. The
applicant in that case was arrested with a suitcase containing narcotics and
cash. At the restoration hearing he testified that the money was unconnected with
drug trafficking and that most of it stemmed from an illegal pyramid scheme in
Alberta. He also admitted that he intended to use the money to purchase
narcotics for re‑sale. The trial judge restored the monies. Even in the
face of the applicant's admission he refused to abandon the simple proof of
entitle­ment approach or to apply the ex turpi rule. Hall J.A. quotes
from the trial judge's reasons at p. 306:

 

                   Applying
this definition of the `strict interpretation' principle, to the Crown's
allegation that the words `entitled to possession' in s. l0(6) means [sic]
""lawful"" possession, I cannot, on grounds of interpretation or public
policy, extend the plain, and ordinary meaning, sought by the Crown. It is
clear in law that, if the language of a criminal statute creates uncertainty,
the person against whom it is being enforced is entitled to the benefit of any
doubt, or to the less harsher of interpretations.

 

The trial judge was of the view that the proper way for the Crown to
proceed would be to charge the applicant under the relevant section of the Criminal
Code  although he admitted that proof would be difficult as the applicant
had invoked the protection of the Canada Evidence Act  [R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10]
in making his admission.

 

27.              Wilson J. quashed the restoration. Unlike
the trial judge he felt that entitlement meant lawful entitlement. The Court of
Appeal upheld his decision. Quoting from the reasons of Hall J.A. at
p. 308:

 

                   In my
view, it is quite unnecessary to consider the scope of the words ""entitled
to possession"". It is sufficient to dispose of the matter by saying that
it would be contrary to public policy and against the public interest for the
Court to lend its process to grant an order of restoration, if to do so would place
in the hands of the applicant money which, by his own admission, was illegally
obtained. Mr. Medd swore that the money was not the fruits of illegal trade in
narcotics but of another illegal activity. He asks for the money back. The
court should not entertain that approach. In rejecting it, the court is not
deciding the issue of ownership, which could be the subject of separate civil
proceedings if Mr. Medd be so advised. 

 

(c) The Legislative Text Approach

 

28.              The third approach also requires an
applicant to disprove taint. However it replaces the narrow focus of the public
policy rationale on the word ""entitlement"" in s. 10(6)(a)
with a careful reading of the entire statutory scheme in s. 10. There are two
consequences of this difference in approach which are significant for the
purposes of the current appeal. First, as mentioned earlier, the taint attaches
to the thing seized rather than to the person applying. Thus the innocence of
the present appellant has no impact on result under this analysis. Secondly,
the turpitude which is traditionally required to trigger the ex turpi
rule has been legislatively replaced by the reasonable belief of the officer
who seized the goods initially that those goods are associated with narcotics
offences.

 

29.              Kopstein Prov. Ct. J.'s decision in R.
v. Tupper (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 529 (Man.), is one of the earliest
expressions of this approach. Although the application failed for non‑compliance
with the technical requirements in s. 10(5), the trial judge nevertheless
considered the merits of the claim and in particular the scope of s. 10(6)(a)
entitlement. He placed great importance on the use of the word
""satisfied"" in that section in terms of the Magistrate's being
satisfied that the applicant was entitled to possession of the goods. In his
view the word meant different things in different contexts. Therefore he
focused on the context of s. 10 in its totality. He wrote at p. 535:

 

                   While
it appears that under s. 10(1)(c) a peace officer may seize anything,
including any money by means of which or in respect of which he reasonably
believes an offence to have been committed under the Narcotic Control Act,
it is only where such seized moneys were used for the purchase of the narcotic
in respect of which an accused was convicted that such moneys are forfeited to
Her Majesty under s‑s. (8). Any other money seized may be restored
pursuant to an application under s‑s. (5). If it had been Parliament's
intention, however, that such money was to be restored merely upon the failure
of the Crown to show that it was used for the purchase of the narcotic which is
the subject of the proceedings, it might simply have enabled or required the
Court to restore such money by reason of that failure to the person, if any,
from whom it was seized. Parliament, however, has made it necessary that an
application be made to a Magistrate and that the Magistrate be satisfied of the
applicant's entitlement to possession.

 

                   Under
s. 10(1)(c), a peace officer may seize anything by means of or in
respect of which ""he reasonably believes"" an offence under the Narcotic
Control Act has been committed. In the circumstances of such a seizure it
appears likely that it was the legislative intent to require a person who seeks
restoration to provide proof of his right to possession. Evidence relating to
the legitimate source of the applicant's acquisition of the moneys, in a case
such as the present case, might well be a relevant consideration. 

 

The thrust of Kopstein Prov. Ct. J.'s analysis is to treat the scope of
s. 10(6)(a) proof of entitlement as a function of the scope of the s.
10(1)(c) seizure power. In other words the fact of a s. 10 seizure is
evidence of taint, and strictly speaking, the Crown need not lead any further
evidence. If the applicant fails to demonstrate the legitimacy of the funds'
source, the fact of seizure becomes conclusive evidence of taint. In Tupper
the Crown actually did call a witness who gave additional circumstantial
evidence of the monies' taint, namely that they were found in a vase along with
two scraps of paper on which figures followed by the abbreviations
""lbs."" and ""oz."" were written.

 

30.              Aimonetti, supra, is the
authority usually cited for the proposition that the scheme of s. 10 requires
an applicant to disprove taint in order to obtain restoration. Again, the Crown
in that case led additional evidence of taint, namely that traces of cannabis
resin were found on some of the seized bills. Huband J.A.'s majority reasons
are very similar to the reasons in Tupper. The following passage, which
was approved by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Largie, sets out the
critical elements of the third analytic approach at pp. 171‑72:

 

                   Looking
at s. 10 in its totality, I think it is clear that the authorities are entitled
to seize cash, beyond that which may be involved in a particular illicit
transaction with respect to which a charge is laid. Money actually used in the
purchase of a narcotic is to be forfeited to Her Majesty at the conclusion of a
trial, under s‑s. (8). The money we are now concerned with falls in a
different category. The scheme of the Act, as I see it, allows police authority
to seize property related to the illicit trade in drugs, possession of which is
then turned over to the Minister unless the applicant is able to make out a
case for restoration. The procedures under s. 10 do not constitute the Minister
or the Crown as owner of the property in question. The Minister becomes entitled
to ""possession"", but it is then open to the accused, or indeed anyone
else, to advance a civil claim for the recovery of the property from the
Minister. In Smith v. The Queen (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 252, 67 D.L.R.
(3d) 177, [1976] 1 F.C. 196, Addy J. of the Federal Court made it clear that s.
10(5) and (7) are ""merely procedural and custodial"", and that
""they do not either explicitly or by necessary implication"" cause any
property right to be forfeited. The right to advance a proprietary claim in
separate civil proceedings is open to anyone.

 

                   Where
the property in question is money, the claim for restoration of possession will
not be allowed if the cash appears to be the fruits of illegal trade in
narcotics. The scheme of the Act is to deny possession of such funds to one
accused and subsequently convicted of participating in illegal trade, (subject
to that person's right to claim ownership in separate civil proceedings). It
would be contrary to the scheme of the Act to allow restoration on the limited
ground that the money could not be identified in a transaction with the
specific narcotic found on the premises. In my opinion, Kopstein Prov. J. had
the jurisdiction to deny the application for restoration in spite of the fact
that the money in question was not directly identified as flowing from a
transaction involving the cannabis resin seized from the premises. So
long as there was evidence upon which he could reasonably conclude that the
money resulted from illegal trade in narcotics, he was entitled to treat such
money as a thing ""in respect of which ... an offence ... has been
committed"", to borrow from the language employed in s. 10(1)(c). 

 

31.              Largie reinforced this position by
reference to s. 312 of the Code which makes it an offence to knowingly
possess the proceeds of crime. Houlden J.A. in that case stated that
restoration should not be granted if the seized money was obtained from the
sale of narcotics thus encouraging the commission of a s. 312(1)  offence. This
glosses over the fact that the elements of a s. 312(1)  offence had not been
proven. Indeed, in Largie it appears that the ""taint"" stemmed
from the simple fact that the money was seized in the course of a s. 10 search.
In the case at hand the respondent makes a similar argument, although in a more
tentative form, by submitting that ""the Court, if it were to order
restoration, could be in the position of placing property in the applicant's
hand which could constitute an offence under s. 312(1)  of the Criminal Code "".

 

32.              In discussing R. v. Molina, supra,
I noted that the Court of Appeal of Ontario seemed to retreat from the position
that the scheme of the Act requires an applicant to make out a case for
restoration by demonstrating the legitimacy of the source of the funds. Rather,
Grange J.A. reduced the cases of Largie and Aimonetti to the
proposition that there must be evidence on which a Magistrate could reasonably
conclude that the monies were tainted. He refrained from a discussion of onus
thus avoiding what is perhaps the most troubling aspect of both the public
policy approach and the analysis based on the total scheme in s. 10.

 

5. Statutory Construction and Section 10(6)(a)

 

33.              The question of what is entailed in s.
10(6)(a) entitlement is largely one of statutory construction. The
jurisdiction of a magistrate under s. 10 must be found within the confines of
the authority and powers described in its provisions. In that sense Huband
J.A.'s method of analysis in Aimonetti which relies on a cohesive view
of the legislative text is persuasive. However, the interpretation which he
proposed, while it is supported by the text, is difficult to reconcile with the
substantive and constitutional limits on statutory construction, and in
particular with the presumption of innocence as it has evolved at common law and
under the Canadian Bill of Rights.

 

34.              The classic formulation of the principle
that a person accused of a criminal offence is innocent until proven guilty is
found in Viscount Sankey's decision in Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions,
[1935] A.C. 462 (H.L.), at pp. 481‑82:

 

Throughout the web of the
English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the
duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have
already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception.
If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt,
created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to
whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the
prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an
acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the
prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of
England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. 

 

35.              The principle is the foundation for a host
of evidentiary rules and determines the otherwise inexplicable boundary between
legal and scientific truth. As Viscount Sankey's pronouncement makes clear, two
fundamental tenets flow from the presumption of innocence: first, that the
burden of proof is upon the Crown and second, that proof is on the high
standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, Viscount Sankey
acknowledged the legitimacy of statutory incursion into the principle and the
jurisprudence of this Court under the Canadian Bill of Rights
acknowledges to some degree the validity of such legislative derogation.
However, Ritchie J.'s majority decision in the leading case of R. v. Appleby,
[1972] S.C.R. 303, maintained that an enactment which reverses the onus of
proof must do so expressly. Indeed, the Canadian Bill of Rights itself,
as discussed earlier, if nothing else requires express words in order ""to
abrogate, abridge or infringe"" any of the rights and freedoms in s. 2.
Accordingly, if legislation permanently dispossessing a person of his or her
property is properly characterized as penal, and in this case I think it is,
then the procedural protections enshrined in the Canadian Bill of Rights
which attend the imposition of penalties by the state should apply.

 

36.              The appellate decisions which favour
imposing a burden of disproof of taint on an applicant offer two rationales
to justify their position. Houlden J.A. in Largie proposes a form of
preventive criminal regulation; Huband J.A. in Aimonetti explains the
denial of restoration under s. 10(6)(a) by maintaining that legal title
is not affected by the restoration proceedings.

 

37.              As discussed earlier, Houlden J.A. in Largie
was of the view that the approach in Aimonetti was strengthened by s.
312(1)  of the Criminal Code . He wrote at p. 293:

 

By virtue of s. 312(1) , it
would be an offence for the appellant to be in possession of money derived from
the sale of narcotics. The court should not, therefore, make an order of
restoration if the money were obtained in this way.

 

While this would perhaps be reasonable if the elements of a s. 312(1) 
offence had been proven, it seems unorthodox to deny restoration on the
possibility that this would lead to the commission of such an offence. Section
312(1)  stipulates that not only must an accused be in possession of tainted
property but he or she must also have knowledge of the taint. In Largie
the applicant led evidence at his hearing to show that the seized monies were
derived from painting and decorating. Rice Prov. Ct. J. took the position that
entitlement could be established without evidence of the source of the cash. No
other evidence of taint or of knowledge of taint is mentioned by Houlden J.A.
apart from the initial seizure. While a law which is specifically aimed at the
prevention of crime was upheld in Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. v. The Queen,
[1956] S.C.R. 303, its operation was contingent on the previous commission of
an offence. The provision in question allowed the court under s. 31 of the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26 as re‑enacted by 1952 (Can.),
c. 39, s. 3, to order, in addition to any other penalty, the prohibition of the
continuation or repetition of the offence of which the person had been
convicted. In the present case not only is there no conviction, but there is no
express legislative grant of authority to the magistrate. Furthermore, the
judicial exercise of such a preventive power in these circumstances undermines
established rules of proof and procedure designed to protect the accused. It is
unnecessary for the purposes of this case to decide whether in fact an explicit
legislative attempt would fall within federal competence over crime prevention.


 

38.              The same observations can be made about
the decisions which employ the public policy approach in the absence of any
proof of turpitude. Again this seems to be an unwarranted exercise of judicial
power in the form of preventive regulation of criminal behaviour contrary to
both the normal operation of the ex turpi rule as well as fundamental
principles of our justice system. In the circumstances it would be more
consistent with considerations of public policy to grant rather than to deny
restoration.

 

39.              The second rationale is much more
persuasive. In the previously quoted passage from Aimonetti, at pp. 171‑72,
Huband J.A. makes reference to Addy J.'s characterization in Smith of
ss. 10(5) and 10(6) as ""merely procedural and custodial"" and as
neither explicitly nor implicitly causing forfeiture. Rather, a denial of
restoration was described by Huband J.A. as simply a denial of possession and
he was at pains to point out that it remained open to an applicant ""to
advance a proprietary claim"" in a separate civil action against the
Minister. Indeed, this was the nature of the action in Smith.

 

40.              However, Huband J.A.'s view of the
restoration hearing process was rejected by Mahoney J. of the Federal Court of
Appeal in R. v. Aimonetti (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 481. When the applicant
in Aimonetti met with failure in the Manitoba Court of Appeal and his
application for leave to appeal that decision to this Court was dismissed, he
instituted a civil action in the trial division of the Federal Court for the
return to him as legal owner of the seized money plus interest. A preliminary
question concerning the Federal Court's jurisdiction and res judicata
was put to the Court of Appeal. Mahoney J. held that the cause of action at the
restoration hearing was the same as the cause of action before the Federal
Court. The applicant's ownership of the property had never been in question as
no s. 10(8) forfeiture had ever taken place. Thus, the issue of possession had
been conclusively determined under ss. 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) in favour of the
Minister. There was no need to distinguish Smith as in that case no
previous restoration hearing had taken place. If Mahoney J. is correct, then
what might otherwise be described as administrative detention of property
subject to an ultimate determination of legal title is in fact a final and
judicial determination of possessory rights. A denial of restoration is
tantamount to a penalty of permanent dispossession.

 

41.              It seems to me that the first analytic
approach, which requires proof only of the right to possession and which does
not require disproof of taint on the part of an applicant, is not only
supported by the text of s. 10 but is also consistent with the interpretive
tenets that flow from the entrenchment of the presumption of innocence in the Canadian
Bill of Rights. Furthermore, the notion that there should be an exact
correlation between the scope of the seizure power in s. 10(1)(c) and
ministerial custody in s. 10(7), while formally pleasing in its symmetry, does
not make functional sense. The considerations which would favour a fairly broad
grant of power to a police officer under a search warrant to the detriment of
the right of an individual to preserve his or her privacy no longer operate at
the point of a restoration hearing. A further detention of property which has
no evidentiary use and which has not been shown to be associated with the
commission of an offence serves no legitimate purpose and would seem to require
much clearer language than that employed in s. 10. 

 

6. Conclusions

 

42.              At the beginning of these reasons I stated
that three crucial questions must be answered in order to settle this appeal:
what is meant by s. 10(6)(a) entitlement, on whom lies the burden of its
proof or disproof, and what is the standard of proof? In light of the foregoing
discussion I would conclude that, generally speaking, the restrictive
interpretation which I have called the simple proof of entitlement approach is
completely consistent with the general principles of criminal justice and with
the actual scheme in s. 10. Many of the decisions which employ this approach,
including that of Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. in the present case, rely either
explicitly or implicitly on the presumption of legal title to the goods which
arises from the fact of possession. The rule is summarized in Halsbury’s
Laws of England, vol. 35, 4th ed., at paragraph 1122 as follows:

 

1122. Possession prima
facie title. The presumption of law is that the
person who has de facto possession also has the property, and accordingly such
possession is protected, whatever its origin, against all who cannot prove a
superior title. This rule applies equally in criminal and civil matters. Thus,
as against a stranger or a wrongdoer, a person in actual or apparent
possession, but without the right to possession, has all the rights and
remedies of a person entitled to and able to prove a present right to
possession.

 

In Canada the presumption has been applied in the cases of McDonald
v. Lane (1882), 7 S.C.R. 462, R. v. Meloche, [1970] 3 O.R. 798 (C.A.),
and R. v. Bagshaw, [1972]) S.C.R. 2. Thus, in order to satisfy a
magistrate at a restoration hearing on the question of entitlement, a claimant
should be prepared to show on the balance of probabilities that he or she was
in possession of the property at the time of seizure. To place the onus on the
claimant in this way does not offend established rules of procedure as the
claim of entitlement at this stage is simply the assertion of a civil right. In
addition, such evidence is readily obtainable by most claimants. The generous
standing in s. 10(5) leaves it open to ""any"" other person to rebut
the claim to possession.

 

43.              While it seems sensible to assume that
entitlement means lawful entitlement, the rule of public policy should only
operate where there is turpitude. Where that turpitude is a criminal wrong,
criminality must be demonstrated in accordance with normal procedures. Section
10(8) which directs forfeiture of things seized which were ""used in any
manner"" in connection with a narcotics offence of which a person has been
convicted, codifies the ex turpi rule in the context of narcotics
convictions. This leaves open two questions. How must the tainted connection be
proven under s. 10(8), and does that section imply that the ex turpi
rule is excluded from operation under s. 10(6)(a) where the things
seized are connected to a conviction for a non‑narcotics offence?

 

44.              The answer to the first question is
subject to the same considerations that apply to the discussion of the burden
imposed on an applicant by s. 10(6)(a) entitlement. Fundamental
principles of criminal justice as well as the nature of the proceedings under
s. 10 make it inappropriate to transform a restoration hearing into a trial in
which the Crown need only meet the civil standard of proof in order to
establish guilt or ""taint"". Thus the culpability of the owner of the
seized property must have been proven at antecedent criminal proceedings under
the Narcotic Control Act. In the absence of a specific finding at trial
of the requisite ""tainted connection"", the Crown may fill the
evidentiary gap by proving taint on the reasonable doubt standard at the
restoration hearing. Where there is no antecedent conviction and no basis for
laying a narcotics related charge, proceedings should be initiated under s.
312(1)  of the Criminal Code . 

 

45.              The second question concerns the situation
in which the Crown places in evidence a prior conviction for a non‑narcotics
offence and the association of the seized property with the commission of that
offence. The interpretive guideline expressio unius est exclusio alterius
suggests that s. 10(8) precludes the operation of the ex turpi rule
here. However, such an interpretation would multiply proceedings as well as
offend public perception of the justice system. Accordingly, I do not think the
expressio unius rule should prevent a reading of s. 10(6)(a)
entitlement to mean ""lawful entitlement"" in this very limited context.
The more fundamental question remains whether the ex turpi rule has been
correctly applied, namely whether the facts of a connection between the
property and the commission of an offence, be it a Code offence or a
narcotics offence, have been properly established. In summary, the public
policy approach is to be faulted only in those cases in which this factual
basis for its operation is lacking. In addition, where the rule of public
policy legitimately applies, the status of an applicant as the innocent
representative of a convicted but deceased owner would not entitle the
applicant to restoration. In general, I agree with the following
characterization of the ex turpi rule by Lord Diplock in Hardy v.
Motor Insurers' Bureau, [1964] 2 All E.R. 742, at pp. 750‑51, and
with his assumption that a successor stands in the shoes of the original
claimant:

 

All that the rule means is
that the courts will not enforce a right which would otherwise be enforceable
if the right arises out of an act committed by the person asserting the right
(or by someone who is regarded in law as his successor) which is regarded by
the court as sufficiently anti‑social to justify the court's refusing to
enforce that right.

 

Whether countervailing considerations apply where, as in that case, the
benefit in question is claimed under an insurance policy, need not be decided
here. 

 

7. Disposition of the Present Appeal

 

46.              Much of the argument in this case centred
on the appellant's status as an innocent representative of the estate in answer
to the allegation of taint associated with the seized monies. There was no
admission of guilt by the appellant, simply an admission that a burden of
disproof of guilt could not be met. In the debate over the effect of the
original applicant's death on the interpretive alternatives, little attention
was paid to the preliminary question of whether in any circumstances a
magistrate under s. 10 may deny restoration of things seized to their proper
owner where no conviction has been entered and where the evidentiary use of the
things has either expired or is non‑existent. It seems to me, for the
reasons given in the preceding discussion, that a negative answer must be given
to that question. While the Crown may defeat entitlement by fulfilling the
terms of s. 10(8) or alternatively, by placing in evidence the necessary facts
to show that entitlement under s. 10(6)(a) would be unlawful, in both those
situations the fact of a previous conviction is a condition precedent. Thus the
appellant's lack of association with the reasonably held belief which prompted
the initial seizure is irrelevant. Indeed, even if it were clear on the
evidence that the appellant was closely involved in Mr. Gombosh's affairs, this
would not be determinative by itself. The Crown has not argued that the monies
seized are related to any ongoing investigation of Mr. Gombosh, the appellant,
or any other person. As Waisberg Prov. Ct. J. pointed out, all criminal
proceedings against Mr. Gombosh were discontinued at his death. Thus, there is
no evidentiary use for the monies and the s. 10(6)(b) branch of the test
for restoration is satisfied. In addition, counsel for the Crown conceded at
the restoration hearing that there was sufficient evidence to show that Mr.
Gombosh was in physical possession of the seized monies. The presumption of
entitlement which operates in that circumstance has not been rebutted. Nor has
the appellant's status as the representative of Mr. Gombosh's estate been
challenged. Accordingly, the s. 10(6)(a) branch of the test for
restoration has also been satisfied.

 

47.              I would allow the appeal, set aside the
orders of Smith J. and of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and reinstate
Waisberg Prov. Ct. J.'s order for the restoration of the property to the
appellant.

                   Appellant faced a charge of robbery and of unlawful
use of a firearm while committing an indictable offence. The preliminary
hearing judge ruled that he had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
there was some positive identification and found that the accused was not
positively identified as the person who committed the crime. There was no
indication that the preliminary inquiry judge addressed his mind to whether the
evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing could convince a reasonable jury of
guilt. The respondent Crown applied to the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba
by way of originating notice of motion for an order of certiorari to
quash the decision of the preliminary hearing judge and to return the matter to
the Provincial Court for processing under s. 475 of the Code. The
application was dismissed but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision on
appeal. The main points in issue were: (1) whether on the Crown's application certiorari
was available to correct errors on the face of the record or whether it was
only available to correct errors of jurisdiction; (2) if certiorari only
applied to errors of jurisdiction, was it a jurisdictional error to apply the
wrong standard of proof in determining whether there was ""sufficient
evidence"" of guilt to commit an accused person for trial; (3) if certiorari
lay to correct the error here, should the remedy be withheld because the Crown
had other remedies available which had not been exhausted.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   It is settled that in a review of a committal for
trial the only ground for action by the reviewing court is lack of
jurisdiction. The same principle applies where certiorari is sought to
review a discharge. A preliminary hearing is not intended to determine
innocence or guilt but only whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant the
accused's standing trial. It is therefore inappropriate to allow supervisory
remedies exercised in proceedings to quash a committal to be expanded to
correct errors of law relating to matters such as admissibility and production.
Errors going to the jurisdiction of the preliminary hearing judge, however, are
different. Superior courts have always exercised their inherent authority to
ensure that the lower courts fully exercise their powers without exceeding
their jurisdiction. Both parties to the preliminary hearing are subject to the
same obligations and enjoy the same rights under the jurisdictional test. 

 

                   Jurisdictional error is committed where
""mandatory provisions"" of the Criminal Code  are not followed,
and in the context of s. 475 , there must be at least some basis in the evidence
proferred for the justice's decision to commit. Where there is some evidence,
it is clearly within the justice's jurisdiction to come to a decision as to
whether the evidence is of sufficient weight to commit. Jurisdictional error is
not committed by an incorrect ruling on admissibility at the preliminary
hearing unless it should affect the right to cross‑examine or to call
witnesses to the extent that natural justice is violated.

 

                   Jurisdictional error was present here. The
preliminary inquiry judge's decision to not commit appellant to trial, because
the evidence did not identify him beyond a reasonable doubt, was acting in
excess of his jurisdiction under the mandate issued by Parliament in s. 475.
The reviewable error did not lie in the adoption of a mistated test, but in the
exercise of a function reserved by Parliament to another forum.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                Estey
J.‑‑This appeal brings before this Court once again the
difficult and long‑discussed question as to when certiorari is
available to quash the decision of a Provincial Court Judge sitting in
preliminary hearing under s. 475  of the Criminal Code. The appellant
faced a charge of robbery and of unlawful use of a firearm while committing an
indictable offence. In disposing of the matter, the learned preliminary hearing
judge said:

 

...I have to be satisfied,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that there has been some positive identification....
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind as to identification and I am not at
liberty to infer from the surrounding circumstances that he was the person
there, so on the question of identification I must hold that the accused was
not positively identified as being the person who committed the offence....

 

This was clearly an error of law. Whether it goes beyond that to
constitute a jurisdictional error is the crux of this appeal. Section 475(1)  of
the Criminal Code  states:

 

                   475. (1) When all the evidence has been taken by the justice he shall,

 

(a) if in his
opinion the evidence is sufficient to put the accused on trial,

 

(i) commit the accused for
trial, or

 

(ii) order the accused,
where it is a corporation, to stand trial in the court having criminal
jurisdiction; or

 

(b) discharge the
accused, if in his opinion upon the whole of the evidence no sufficient case is
made out to put the accused on trial.

 

2.                The test to be employed under this
section is to be found in the judgment of this Court in United States of
America v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067, per Ritchie J. at p.
1080:

 

                   I agree
that the duty imposed upon a ""justice"" under s. 475(1)  is the same as
that which governs a trial judge sitting with a jury in deciding whether the
evidence is ""sufficient"" to justify him in withdrawing the case from
the jury and this is to be determined according to whether or not there is any
evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a
verdict of guilty. The ""justice"" ... is, in my opinion, required to
commit an accused person for trial in any case in which there is admissible
evidence which could, if it were believed, result in a conviction.

 

In this case, there is no indication that Norton Prov. Ct. J. addressed
his mind, as he was required to do, to the question whether the evidence
adduced at the preliminary hearing could convince a reasonable jury of guilt. 

 

3.                The respondent Crown applied to the
Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba by way of originating notice of motion for
an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the preliminary hearing
judge and to return the matter to the Provincial Court for processing under s.
475 of the Code. Wright J., sitting in Chambers, dismissed the
application. His decision was overturned on appeal to the Manitoba Court of
Appeal (O'Sullivan J.A. dissenting).

 

4.                The principal decisions of this Court on
the application of judicial review to proceedings held under s. 475  have been
directed to proceedings wherein the accused has been committed and the
committal has been brought under challenge in judicial review. In those
circumstances, certiorari lies only where the error goes to
jurisdiction, and not in respect of a non‑jurisdictional error of law,
even where the error appears on the face of the record: Patterson v. The
Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 409, Attorney General (Que.) v. Cohen, [1979] 2
S.C.R. 305, Forsythe v. The Queen, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 268, Skogman v.
The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 93. The issue raised in this appeal is whether
the same or some other limitation applies to the review of a discharge in
contrast to a committal of an accused at preliminary hearing. Depending upon
the answer to that question, there may arise the narrower question as to
whether the reasonable doubt test applied by the learned magistrate here
instead of the Shephard test, supra, deprived the Provincial
Court Judge of jurisdiction or was merely an error of law committed within his
jurisdiction, and hence not within the reach of judicial review. We are here
concerned, of course, not with a proceeding which commenced without
jurisdiction but rather with one in which there is an allegation that in the
course of performing its statutory role, the tribunal acted in violation of its
jurisdiction, either by exceeding or by declining to exercise it: see Forsythe,
supra, per Laskin C.J. at pp. 271‑72.

 

5.                At trial, Wright J. held that the error
was jurisdictional, because ""excess or absence of jurisdiction occurs if a
wrong standard of proof is applied that has the effect of causing the judge to
go further than the law permits, or to fail to go as far as the law
permits"". However, he denied certiorari because in his view, the
applicant Crown had other remedies, such as the right to ""start over again
with a new charge, or to indict directly"".

 

6.                In the Manitoba Court of Appeal, Monnin
J.A. (as he then was) held that certiorari lay despite the fact that the
error in this case was merely an error of law not going to jurisdiction. Matas
J.A. concluded that the availability of certiorari to quash the
committal or discharge of an accused at a preliminary inquiry is limited to
cases involving jurisdictional errors. In any case, he agreed with Wright J.
and held that the error in this case was jurisdictional: 

 

                   The
presiding judge at a preliminary hearing is circumscribed by law in how he
approaches his task of determining the sufficiency of evidence. The Sheppard
[sic] test governs the exercise of his discretion. The test ... gives
substance to the bare admonition in s. 475 of the Code requiring the
judge to form an opinion on whether the evidence is sufficient; the test must
form the substratum of the judge's opinion. If a judge applies the Sheppard
[sic] test, he acts within his jurisdiction. The decision, right or
wrong, will stand. A jurisdictional error will arise only if he makes an error
in reliance on a test which is fundamentally wrong. (See Reid and David,
Administrative Law and Practice, 2 ed., at pp. 206‑207, where it is
said that with respect to civil proceedings, jurisdictional error exists when a
tribunal disregards the basic principles on which its enabling legislation is
based.)

 

7.                O'Sullivan J.A. dissented. In his
opinion, certiorari was only available in cases of jurisdictional error,
and the error in this case was not of that sort. Rather, the misdirection as to
the burden of proof was an error ""made in the course of the exercise of a
judicial jurisdiction bestowed on him as a court by Parliament.... He erred in
directing himself as to what was a `sufficient case' but his error does not
mean he failed to comply with the provision of the statute.... He did not ask
the wrong question but answered the right question wrongly.""

 

8.                The points in issue framed by the
appellant number six; however, they clearly resolve themselves into three.
These are:

 

1.                Is certiorari available in these
circumstances to correct errors of law on the face of the record, or is it only
available to correct errors of jurisdiction?

 

2.                If the latter, is it a jurisdictional error to
apply the wrong standard of proof in determining whether there is
""sufficient evidence"" of guilt to commit an accused person for trial?

 

3.                If certiorari lies to correct the error
in this case, should the remedy be withheld because the Crown has other
remedies available which have not been exhausted?

 

9.                The starting point in the analysis of
the position of the preliminary hearing judge is found in the judgment of
Judson J. in Patterson v. The Queen, supra, where he wrote at p.
411:

 

                   I
intend to confine these reasons within the very narrow issues raised by the
case and to repeat what has been emphasized so often that if it is sought to
review a committal for trial, there is only one ground for action by the
reviewing Court and that is lack of jurisdiction.

 

This was a certiorari proceeding in which it was asserted that
the committing judge, by declining to order the production of a statement given
by a Crown witness to the police, had thereby committed an error of law
reviewable by certiorari. Although Spence J. dissented, he agreed that certiorari
would not lie to correct errors ""made by a magistrate in the performance
of his duties"" (p. 419). Judson J.'s statement of the law has been
specifically confirmed in three subsequent decisions of this Court (Cohen,
Forsythe and Skogman, supra) and must be taken as settled. 

 

10.              However, this case is in fact the converse
of those four. Here, certiorari is sought not by the accused to
challenge a committal, but by the Crown. Monnin J.A. (alone of the three judges
in the Court of Appeal) did not believe that, in the absence of a ""very
clear and definite pronouncement from the Supreme Court"", Patterson
and the cases following it should be taken to have excluded all recourse to certiorari
for error of law on the face of the record in the decision of a justice acting
under s. 475 , when review for error of law is in other contexts clearly
available: R. v. Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd., [1922] 2 A.C. 128 (P.C.), R.
v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal. Ex parte Shaw, [1952] 1
K.B. 338 (C.A.), Alberta Board of Industrial Relations v. Stedelbauer
Chevrolet Oldsmobile Ltd., [1969] S.C.R. 137). Those cases were, of course,
all directed to a process in a tribunal other than a preliminary hearing
operating under s. 475 of the Code. The preliminary hearing under review
here is entirely statutory and, so far as this appeal is concerned, is
completely prescribed in s. 475 .

 

11.              It may be said that there is a rationale
in law for drawing a distinction between judicial review of committals and
judicial review of discharges after a preliminary hearing. A primary emphasis
in the cases involving error of law in the committal of an accused has been on
avoiding delay of the trial, which it might be within the power of an accused
to bring about through applications for judicial review for errors of law. The
same consequence does not follow where the Crown seeks an order quashing the
discharge of the accused.

 

12.              However, the reason underlying the court's
restriction of supervisory remedies is equally valid in both cases. It has been
said numerous times that the objective of holding a preliminary inquiry is
merely to determine whether there is enough evidence against the accused to
justify ordering him to stand trial. It is not intended to determine, finally
or otherwise, the accused's guilt or innocence. Therefore, it is inappropriate
to allow the expansion of supervisory remedies designed to correct errors of
law made in the course of preliminary inquiries which relate, for example, to
the admission of evidence, the questioning of witnesses, or the production of
documents. A preliminary hearing ""is not a trial and should not be allowed
to become a trial"" (Patterson, supra, per Judson J.
at p. 412; see also Cohen, supra, per Pigeon J. at p.
309). The questioning of errors of law is therefore as inappropriate in
proceedings to quash a discharge as it is in proceedings to quash a committal.
Errors which go to the preliminary hearing judge's jurisdiction are, however,
different. Superior courts, from the earliest days in our law, have exercised
their inherent authority to enforce compliance with the law by lower tribunals
which must exercise fully without exceeding their statutory jurisdiction. Such
is the position of a preliminary hearing tribunal. 

 

13.              It follows that both parties to the
preliminary hearing process are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the
same rights under the jurisdictional test as applied in Patterson, supra,
to the parent statute as interpreted by Shephard, supra. It must,
therefore, be determined whether the error in this case was jurisdictional.

 

14.              An analogous jurisdictional issue arose
before this Court in Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, where the
Court confined the powers of a judge sitting in a court whose jurisdiction,
specified by statute, is limited to those powers set forth in the statute, that
is the Criminal Code , and no others. The tribunal was there, and is
here, entirely statutory and its activities are measured on judicial review
against the jurisdiction accorded to it by the governing statute. In the
simplest terms, the question in this appeal therefore reduces itself to
whether, as interpreted in Shephard, supra, s. 475  provides an
authorization or mandate only for a test or process directed to determining
that a jury could, upon the evidence presented, convict the accused.

 

15.              The cases, though not conclusively
determining whether the error here is jurisdictional or not, are nevertheless
instructive. Patterson was a case in which the accused had been
committed for trial on a charge of using an instrument with intent to procure a
miscarriage. He argued that it was reviewable error for the committing justice
to refuse production of a statement made by the woman mentioned in the charge
to the police so that defence counsel could use it in cross‑examination.
The majority of this Court disagreed. Spence J. in dissent, and Hall J. who concurred
in the result reached by Spence J. but delivered separate reasons, both held
that a limitation on the accused's right to fully cross‑examine the
witnesses at the preliminary inquiry would amount to a denial of natural
justice, and thus to jurisdictional error. Their disagreement related to their
different conclusions as to whether such a limitation had occurred on the
facts.

 

16.              In the Cohen case, supra,
the application was brought before the magistrate's decision had been reached.
The error alleged in that case was that the magistrate had wrongly sustained
the Crown's objection to questions asked by defence counsel of Crown witnesses.
This Court held that a decision as to the admissibility of evidence, however
erroneous, does not constitute jurisdictional error. See also R. v. Norgren
(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 488 (B.C.C.A.) and Re Nicols and The Queen,
reported with Re Martin, Simard and Desjardins and The Queen (1977), 20
O.R. (2d) 455 (C.A.), in which the refusal by the presiding judge to order the
production of a police notebook for cross‑examination by the accused may
have been an error in law, but was not jurisdictional and hence beyond review.

 

17.              Forsythe, supra, was a
similar case. The accused's application for certiorari was denied where
the Provincial Court Judge had disallowed questions sought to be asked of the
complainant at an in camera hearing pursuant to s. 142  of the Criminal
Code . Laskin C.J. set out a catalogue of some of the types of errors which
might result in a loss of jurisdiction by a justice at a preliminary inquiry.
He said, at pp. 271‑72: 

 

                   In
speaking of lack of jurisdiction, this Court [in Patterson] was not
referring to lack of initial jurisdiction of a judge or magistrate to enter
upon a preliminary inquiry. This is hardly a likelihood. The concern rather was
with the loss of this initial jurisdiction and, in my opinion, the situations
in which there can be a loss of jurisdiction in the course of a preliminary
inquiry are few indeed. However, jurisdiction will be lost by a magistrate who
fails to observe a mandatory provision of the Criminal Code : see Doyle
v. The Queen [[1977] 1 S.C.R. 597]. Canadian law recognizes that a denial
of natural justice goes to jurisdiction: see Alliance des Professeurs
catholiques de Montréal v. Labour Relations Board of Quebec [[1953] 2
S.C.R. 140]. In the case of a preliminary inquiry, I cannot conceive that this
could arise otherwise than by a complete denial to the accused of a right to
call witnesses or of a right to cross‑examine prosecution witnesses. Mere
disallowance of a question or questions on cross‑examination or other
rulings on proffered evidence would not, in my view, amount to a jurisdictional
error. However, the judge or magistrate who presides at a preliminary inquiry
has the obligation to obey the jurisdictional prescriptions of s. 475  of the Criminal
Code .

 

18.              This Court's most recent statement on the
question, Skogman v. The Queen, supra, was also a case in which
the accused applied for certiorari to quash his committal, here because,
as was admitted by the Crown, there was no evidence of an essential element of
the offence. The application was successful. The majority of the Court, held at
pp. 100‑01 that s. 475 ,

 

At
minimum, . . . calls upon the presiding justice to form an
opinion as to whether evidence is ""sufficient"" or whether ""no
sufficient case is made out"" so as to justify a conclusion by the
presiding justice ""to put the accused on trial"" or not to commit the
accused to trial. There is no rule within the statutory framework adopted by
Parliament for arbitrary action by the tribunal.

 

It was therefore concluded, at p. 104:

 

                   The
courts of this country have, since the judgment in Martin [Re Martin,
Simard and Desjardins and The Queen], supra, generally adopted the
rule that a committal of an accused at a preliminary, in the absence of
evidence on an essential ingredient in a charge, is a reviewable jurisdictional
error.... ""No evidence"" on an essential element of the charge against
the accused cannot amount to ""sufficient evidence"" under s. 475 .

 

A number of lower court decisions were to the same effect: Re
Martin, Simard and Desjardins and The Queen, supra, Re Poirier
and The Queen (1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 452, Re Robar and The Queen
(1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 133 (N.S.C.A.)

 

19.              In summary, it is clear enough that no
jurisdictional error is committed where the justice incorrectly rules on the
admissibility of evidence or incorrectly decides that a particular question or
line of questioning cannot be pursued at the preliminary inquiry. This is, of
course, subject to the important condition that rulings in the course of a
preliminary hearing on evidentiary questions as to the extent of limitation on
the basic right to cross‑examine or to call witnesses, may develop into a
violation of natural justice and fall within the condemnation of Forsythe,
supra, and hence be subject to judicial review. See also Re Martin,
Simard and Desjardins and The Queen, supra, at p. 488.
Jurisdictional error is committed where ""mandatory provisions"" of the
Criminal Code  are not followed, and in the context of s. 475 , this means
at least that there must be some basis in the evidence proffered for the
justice's decision to commit. There is no jurisdiction to act
""arbitrarily"". However, where there is some evidence, it is clearly
within the justice's jurisdiction to come to a decision as to whether that
evidence is of sufficient weight to commit. This follows from the statement of
Lord Sumner in Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd., supra, at p. 144: 

 

On certiorari, so far as
the presence or absence of evidence becomes material, the question can at most
be whether any evidence at all was given on the essential point referred to.
Its weight is entirely for the inferior Court....

 

The Nat Bell Liquors, Ltd. appeal, supra, concerned the
attempted judicial review of a conviction by a magistrate on a charge under a
provincial statute from which there was no appeal. The Court was not there
concerned with s. 475 , although some of the evidentiary considerations relating
to judicial review bear the same consequences whether the review is of a
decision of an inferior tribunal or the proceedings under s. 475 .

 

20.              The question therefore remains whether the
preliminary hearing judge, in deciding that because the evidence did not
establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was identified as the person
responsible for the offences charged, he could not commit him for trial, was
acting within his jurisdiction or was acting in excess of his jurisdiction
under s. 475 . The appellant rightly points out that the section does not direct
the judge as to the standard of proof to be applied in determining the
sufficiency of the evidence for committal or for discharge. It might be said,
therefore, that the judge exercised his discretion as to the proof demanded by
the statute. There is certainly no specific direction, as there was in Doyle,
supra, where the statute required that the judge ""shall"" grant
an adjournment in a particular way and subject to particular limitations.

 

21.              In my view the appellant cannot
successfully sustain his submissions. This is not a case where the reviewing
judge merely thinks that the justice was wrong, in the sense that if the
reviewing judge had been sitting at the preliminary inquiry, he would have
reached a different conclusion as to the sufficiency of the evidence. It is a
case in which the real complaint is that the exercise of weighing the evidence
proceeded on an entirely erroneous basis in law, which in turn goes to the
mandate issued by Parliament in s. 475 . That is to say, s. 475 , in the context
in which it is found in the Criminal Code , does not direct the
preliminary hearing judge to determine guilt or innocence. This is clear from
s. 475  viewed alone and would be the case even if Shephard, supra,
which now defines the test or standard of proof that should in law be applied
by a preliminary hearing judge, had never been decided. 

 

22.              There are dicta suggesting that an
error as to the burden or standard of proof applicable under s. 475  of the Criminal
Code  is error of law only, and does not go to jurisdiction: see R. v.
Hubbard, [1976] 3 W.W.R. 152 (B.C.S.C.), Re Mitchell and Maynes and The
Queen (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 344 (Alta. S.C.) (In an entirely different
context, Lowry J. in R. (Hanna) v. Ministry of Health and Local Government,
[1966] N.I. 52 (Q.B.), assumed that error as to the ""kind and standard of
proof"" resting on a party who sought certiorari to review the
decision of a Minister on an appeal from a planning decision was an error of
law only and did not go to jurisdiction.) In my view, Hubbard and Re
Mitchell, supra, are not supportive of the appellant's position in
this case. The preliminary hearings in those cases took place before this Court
in Shephard, supra, had authoritatively interpreted the
parliamentary directive to the judicial officer presiding over a preliminary
hearing. While the tests employed in Hubbard and Re Mitchell
under s. 475  were later rejected in Shephard, in neither of these cases
did the decision‑maker fundamentally misconstrue the nature of the task
in which he was engaged under the section. In both cases, the preliminary
inquiry judge in fact made the determination as to sufficiency of evidence
required of him by s. 475 .

 

23.              In applying the wrong test for
sufficiency, a preliminary inquiry judge does not commit jurisdictional error.
In deciding an issue reserved to another forum, however, he does. That is the
nature of the error in this appeal. Norton Prov. Ct. J.'s adoption of the
reasonable doubt test indicates that he was not, as s. 475  requires, directing
his mind to the question whether the evidence was sufficient to warrant
committing the accused to stand trial. Rather, in effect, he arrogated to
himself the decision of the issue reserved by Parliament to another forum, the
trial court. He engaged in a process designed for determining guilt or
innocence, that is, for acquitting or convicting an accused. In fact, the
formal order, signed by the learned preliminary hearing judge, indicates that
the charges against the accused were ""dismissed"", and not
""discharged"" as required by the section of the Code. A
dismissal is, if made by a court of competent jurisdiction, a final disposition
of the case against an accused sufficient to support the plea of autrefois
acquit: Petersen v. The Queen, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 493, R. v. Riddle,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 380. Norton Prov. Ct. J.'s jurisdiction was defined by the
enabling statute. That jurisdiction was exceeded when, instead of performing
the function assigned to him, he did something quite different. The error in
this proceeding was not that the Provincial Court Judge merely misstated the
test (which would, as was concluded in Hubbard, supra, be an error of
law within jurisdiction) but that he dismissed the information. 

 

24.              I therefore conclude that jurisdictional
error is present in this case and that these proceedings are subject to
judicial review because certiorari, or proceedings in the nature of certiorari,
run equally where the error in jurisdiction results in a discharge or a
committal.

 

25.              I then turn to the final issue, which is
whether certiorari should provide a remedy where the Crown has other
remedies available which have not been exhausted. This matter has been touched
upon by this Court in other cases. In Forsythe, Laskin C.J. wrote that
although certiorari is a discretionary remedy, it would not be denied to
quash a committal for trial because ""there is no other recourse.
Committals for trial are not appealable and can only be challenged by certiorari
or motion to quash"" (at p. 271). Here, it is alleged that there are
alternative remedies, or at least alternative avenues of action: the Crown can
prefer a direct indictment or it can re‑charge the accused and proceed to
a new preliminary inquiry.

 

26.              The discretion to decline to grant certiorari
is most frequently exercised where the alternative remedy consists of a right
to appeal the decision complained of (see Reid and David, Administrative Law
and Practice (2nd ed., 1978), at pp. 369‑72, Harelkin v.
University of Regina, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561). Other alternative remedies have
also been considered to justify a refusal of certiorari (i.e.,
where the statute sets out specific alternatives other than an appeal, or where
there may be a right of action for damages or for a declaration). However,
""[t]he court ought not to refuse certiorari because of alternative
remedies other than appeal unless it is clearly satisfied that those other
remedies are more appropriate"" (De Smith’s Judicial Review of
Administrative Action (4th ed., 1980), at p. 426).

 

27.              There is a possibility, as the appellant
concedes, that if the Crown were to proceed by either of the two routes said to
afford alternative remedies, this may be held to amount to abuse of process.
Further, it must be considered that in this case, the alternatives are not
truly alternative, in the sense that an appeal, for example, is. As Monnin J.A.
pointed out in the Court of Appeal, ""It is not a remedy available to
correct an error to have to start all over again, or to prefer an indictment
with specific consent of the Attorney‑General."" The erroneous
determination continues to stand, and may well hinder the pursuit of the
suggested alternatives. In taking these factors into account, it is not
""clearly"" more appropriate to require the Crown to embark on the
doubtful course of relaying the charges or preferring a direct indictment. As
Matas J.A. pointed out below, these courses of action also may lead to the very
opportunities for delay in bringing the case to trial which the limitations on certiorari
in this context were designed to avoid. The remedy of certiorari should
not, therefore, be denied.

 

28.              For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Power of a court of
appeal ‑‑ Appeal by accused from conviction for manslaughter ‑‑
Court of Appeal ordered new trial on original charge of second‑degree
murder ‑‑ Excess of jurisdiction ‑‑ New trial ordered
by Supreme Court on charge of manslaughter ‑‑ Supreme Court
jurisdiction limited by nature of appeal ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C.

(4), 618(2)(a), 623(1).

 

                   Appellant was charged with second‑degree
murder and convicted by a jury of the included offence of manslaughter. He
appealed this conviction. The Crown chose not to appeal the acquittal for
murder. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal but, instead of acquitting
appellant or ordering a new trial on the charge of manslaughter, the Court
ordered a new trial to be held on the original charge of second‑degree
murder. Appellant appealed from this judgment. This appeal is to determine
whether, as the Crown did not appeal, the Court of Appeal erred in law in
ordering a new trial to be held on the initial charge.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed and a new trial ordered on the charge of manslaughter.

 

                   As the Crown did not appeal the acquittal for
murder, the Court of Appeal committed an error of law in ordering a new trial
on the initial charge. It exceeded its jurisdiction by allowing a result which
only the Crown was entitled to seek under s. 605  of the Criminal Code .

 

                   This Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal.
Section 618(2)(b) of the Code confers on an accused whose
acquittal has been set aside by the Court of Appeal an automatic right of
appeal to the Supreme Court. However, he cannot, under that paragraph, make in
this Court any argument made in the Court of Appeal and ask for an acquittal
here. In the circumstances he can only challenge the setting aside of his
acquittal for murder and ask that the new trial be held on a charge of
manslaughter.

Facts

 

2.                On December 23, 1979, Karine Massicotte,
appellant's young daughter, was found dead in her bed. No autopsy was ordered
and the death was classified as a natural one.

 

3.                In April, 1982, a friend of Guillemette
went to the police and told them that about ten months earlier Guillemette had
told him in confidence that he had killed his child.

 

4.                Officers of the Quebec Provincial Police
interviewed appellant and he agreed to take a lie detector test. On being told
by the police officers that he had ""failed"" the test, Guillemette
made two statements to the police, one in writing and the other verbal, and he
was, in due course, charged with second‑degree murder.

 

Judgments

 

5.                At the conclusion of a trial by judge
and jury, at which only the written statement was admitted in evidence,
appellant was convicted of the included offence of manslaughter. He appealed
this conviction. The Crown chose not to appeal the acquittal for murder.

 

6.                On November 7, 1983, the Quebec Court of
Appeal allowed the accused's appeal from this conviction on the ground that the
trial judge had erred in law in his charge to the jury in mentioning the
possible verdict of manslaughter based on provocation. The Court ordered a new
trial, not on a charge of manslaughter, but on the initial charge of second‑degree
murder. Guillemette is now appealing from this decision.

 

Issue

 

7.                The principal question raised by the
appeal at bar is the following: as the Crown did not appeal, did the Court of
Appeal, when deciding an appeal by the accused against his conviction, err in
ordering a new trial on the original charge of second‑degree murder, when
the jury had returned a verdict of guilty of manslaughter?

 

Law

 

8.                The accused's appeal must succeed as the
Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction to order that a new trial be held on the
charge of murder. 

 

9.                The provisions of the Criminal Code 
applicable in the case at bar are the following:

 

                   603. (1) A person who is convicted by a trial court in proceedings by
indictment may appeal to the court of appeal

 

 (a) against his
conviction

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   605. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose
may appeal to the court of appeal

 

 (a) against a
judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment
on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone,

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (2) For
the purposes of this section a judgment or verdict of acquittal includes an
acquittal in respect of an offence specifically charged where the accused has
on the trial thereof been convicted of an included or other offence.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   613. (1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a
verdict that the appellant is unfit, on account of insanity, to stand his
trial, or against a special verdict of not guilty on account of insanity, the
court of appeal

 

 (a) may allow the
appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

 (i) the verdict should be
set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the
evidence,

 

 (ii) the judgment of the
trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question
of law, or

 

 (iii) on any ground there
was a miscarriage of justice;

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (2)
Where a court of appeal allows an appeal under paragraph (1)(a), it
shall quash the conviction and

 

 (a) direct a
judgment or verdict of acquittal to be entered, or

 

 (b) order a new
trial. 

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (4)
Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may

 

 (a) dismiss the
appeal; or

 

 (b) allow the
appeal, set aside the verdict and

 

 (i) order a new trial, or

 

 (ii) except where the
verdict is that of a court composed of a judge and jury, enter a verdict of
guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should
have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass a sentence that is
warranted in  law.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   618. (1) A person who is convicted of an indictable offence and whose
conviction is affirmed by the court of appeal may appeal to the Supreme Court
of Canada

 

                                                                    ...

 

 (b) on any
question of law, if leave to appeal is granted by the Supreme Court of Canada
within twenty‑one days after the judgment appealed from   is pronounced
or within such extended time as the Supreme Court of Canada or a judge thereof
may, for special reasons, allow.

 

                    (2) A
person

 

 (a) who is
acquitted of an indictable offence other than by reason of the special verdict
of not guilty on account of insanity and whose acquittal is set aside by the
court of appeal, 

 

                                                                    ...

 

may appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada on a question of law.

 

10.              In the case at bar the accused was
acquitted of murder and convicted of manslaughter. In the view of the Court of
Appeal, the trial judge erred in directing the jury on the possibility of
bringing in a verdict of manslaughter. Both the Crown and the accused agree
that, in view of the facts in evidence, the judge was not entitled to direct
the jury on the possibility of returning a verdict of manslaughter based on the
theory of provocation. However, the accused argued that the verdict on the
included offence could have been based on other grounds. The Crown, for its
part, considered that only two verdicts were legally possible: those of guilty
of murder or acquittal. Both parties were concerned about the effect that the
trial judge's error might have had on the outcome. The accused argued that, as
it could not convict him of murder, the jury would have been prepared to acquit
him. The Crown, quite logically, argued the contrary, and said that the jury
which could not acquit the accused in light of the evidence, would have had to
bring in a verdict of murder. Both parties could have appealed, the Crown by an
appeal against the acquittal for murder, the accused by an appeal against the
conviction for manslaughter. Only the accused appealed. This is important. The
acquittal for murder was not challenged by the Crown, and obviously not by the
accused. 

 

11.              At the appeal from his conviction for
manslaughter, the accused could have asked the Court of Appeal to substitute a
verdict of acquittal or to order a new trial to be held on the charge of
manslaughter (s. 613(2)  of the Criminal Code ).

 

12.              The Crown, for its part, could have
appealed this verdict under s. 605  and asked the Court to order a new trial on
the initial charge of second‑degree murder (s. 613(4)(b)(i) of the
Code). As s. 605(2) of the Code treats a conviction for an
included offence as an acquittal for the offence initially charged, for
purposes of determining whether the prosecution has a right of appeal, the
right of the prosecution to ask for a new trial relates to the principal
charge. It took no such action. Relying on the judgment of this Court in R.
v. Wilmot, [1941] S.C.R. 53, the Crown argued that Guillemette had not been
acquitted of murder. In my opinion, it is sufficient to note that that decision
was prior to the addition of the aforementioned s. 605(2)  to the Criminal
Code .

 

13.              In ordering a new trial on the original
charge of second‑degree murder, the Court of Appeal in the same breath set
aside the acquittal implicitly made by the jury on that charge. Where there has
been no appeal by the Crown, to allow this result, which only the Crown was
entitled to seek, constitutes an error of law.

 

14.              The decision of this Court in Rickard
v. The Queen, [1970] S.C.R. 1022, is an application of this principle.
Although that judgment was rendered in connection with a summary conviction,
the fundamental principles on which it was based apply equally to indictable
offences.

 

15.              Rickard, who was charged with criminal
negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle, was convicted following a trial
by a summary convictions court of the lesser and included offence of dangerous
driving. Following a trial de novo held pursuant to s. 720 of the Code
(now s. 748) at the request of the accused, he was convicted of criminal
negligence. Rickard appealed from this conviction on the ground that the judge
at the trial de novo had jurisdiction limited to hearing the appeal
regarding the offence for which the appellant was previously convicted.
Speaking for a majority of this Court, Ritchie J. approved the argument at
p. 1028:

 

It has been held more than
once in this Court, (Dennis v. The Queen, [1958] S.C.R. 473 at 482; The
Queen v. Dennis, [1960] S.C.R. 286 at 289), that the existence of a valid
Notice of Appeal filed and served in accordance with s. 722 is a condition
precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in the Court of Appeal
under s. 727(1) and it follows, in my opinion, that a County Court Judge acting
under the latter section is only authorized and required ""to hear and
determine the appeal by holding a trial de novo"" in respect of the
issues raised in a Notice of Appeal which has been so filed and served. In the
present case the learned County Court Judge purported to register a conviction
against the appellant under s. 221(1) in the absence of any appeal whatever
from the Magistrate's finding that the evidence did not prove that offence. I
do not find it necessary to decide whether an appeal in fact lies by the
informant or the Attorney General from such a finding because I take the view
that the controlling factor in this case is that no such appeal was taken.


 

                                                                    ...

 

                    In my
opinion, the only issue which the County Court Judge was authorized and
required to hear and determine on the holding of a trial de novo in the
present case was the issue of the guilt or innocence of the accused on the
charge of which he was convicted and from which he had appealed.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

16.              At page 1029, Ritchie J. dismissed as
follows the argument made by the Crown that s. 727(1), as it read at the time,
required the holding of a new trial on the initial information:

 

... in my view any
construction of s. 727(1) which would result in a retrial of the charge alleged
in the original information when that charge has been dismissed by the
Magistrate and there is no appeal from his dismissal, would be inconsistent
with the appeal provisions of Part XXIV.

 

17.              In the case at bar, therefore, as there
was no appeal by the Crown, the Court of Appeal of Quebec erred in ordering a
new trial on the initial charge of murder.

 

18.              The Crown challenged the jurisdiction of
this Court to hear this appeal. Appellant came to this Court by leave granted
pursuant to s. 618(1)(b) of the Code, which states that a person
whose conviction at first instance is affirmed by the Court of Appeal may apply
for leave to appeal to this Court. The Crown argued, correctly in my view, that
the accused's conviction for manslaughter was not affirmed by the Court of
Appeal, since the latter ordered a new trial.

 

19.              I am nevertheless of the opinion that the
accused did have an appeal as of right to this Court under s. 618(2)(a)
of the Code, which confers on anyone whose acquittal at first instance
has been set aside by the Court of Appeal an automatic right of appeal to the
Supreme Court. Accordingly, the setting aside by the Court of Appeal of
Guillemette's acquittal on the charge of murder enabled him to appeal to this
Court for a restoration of his acquittal for murder and an order that the new
trial be held on a charge of manslaughter rather than murder. Under s. 618(2)(a),
can appellant also make, in this Court, any other argument made in the Court of
Appeal and ask for an acquittal here?

 

20.              In this regard, appellant alleged that the
Court of Appeal should have reversed the decision by the trial judge to admit
in evidence the written statement made by the accused, in view of the
circumstances in which it was made. The accused maintained that the residual
evidence is too weak to support a guilty verdict (s. 613(1)(a)(i) of the
Code).

 

21.              The accused cannot challenge the verdict
of manslaughter in this Court. The Court of Appeal did not affirm the
conviction and, were it not for the error by the Court of Appeal in setting
aside his acquittal for murder by ordering a new trial on that charge, the
accused would not have been able to appeal to this Court under s. 618. On an
appeal as of right under s. 618(2)(a) of the Code, the accused
can only challenge the setting aside of his acquittal for murder and ask that
the new trial be held on a charge of manslaughter. This Court therefore cannot
rule on the other arguments put forward by the accused in support of an
acquittal. 

 

22.              I think it advisable to add a further
clarification of the limits imposed on this Court by the nature of the appeal
at bar.

 

23.              Though it made no appeal to the Court of
Appeal, the Crown could have appealed in this Court, against the order for a
new trial made by the Quebec Court of Appeal. The Crown could then have asked
this Court to set aside the order and restore the conviction for manslaughter.
However, again it chose not to appeal, this time, before this Court. In
addition to the limitations imposed on us by the nature of the accused's
appeal, the jurisdiction of this Court is also limited by the Crown's decision
not to appeal to the Court of Appeal against the acquittal for murder by the
jury, and further by its decision not to appeal against the order for a new
trial made by the Court of Appeal.

 

24.              Section 623(1) of the Code
provides:

 

                   623. (1) The Supreme Court of Canada may, on an appeal under this Part,
make any order that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule
or order that is necessary to give effect to its judgment.

 

25.              Where there is no appeal by the Crown
asking us to do so, this Court cannot, in place of the Court of Appeal, make
the order which we might feel it should have made, assuming that was our
conclusion, namely dismissing the appeal and substituting a conviction for
manslaughter.

 

26.              For all these reasons it follows, in my
view, that the only question we may consider is whether the new trial ordered
by the Court of Appeal should be on a charge of murder or of manslaughter.

 

27.              For the reasons already given, I consider
that the new trial should be on a charge of manslaughter.

 

28.              I would therefore allow this appeal and
order that the new trial be held on the charge of manslaughter.

 

                   Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Provocation ‑‑
“Ordinary person” standard ‑‑ Whether or not “ordinary person”
means ordinary person of same age and sex as accused ‑‑ Whether
standard correctly and clearly explained in charge to jury ‑‑
Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 215(1), (2).

 

                   Respondent was convicted of second degree murder for
a fatal stabbing. He was sixteen when the incident occurred and testified that
he had reacted to the victim's uninvited homosexual advances. He relied on the
defences of provocation and self‑defence. The Court of Appeal ordered a
new trial because the trial judge failed to charge the jury that the objective
""ordinary person"" standard for the defence of provocation had to take
account of the age and sex of the accused. The central question here was how
the objective test for the provocation defence was to be formulated and the extent
to which characteristics peculiar to the individual accused could be taken into
account.








 

                   Held (Lamer, Wilson and
Le Dain JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, Estey, Chouinard and La Forest JJ.: The trial judge's charge to the
jury as to the ordinary person standard in the defence of provocation was
consistent with the requirements of the Criminal Code  and was correct in
law. It was not necessary to direct the jury that the ordinary person means an
ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused.

 

                   The ordinary or reasonable person has a normal
temperament and level of self‑control and is not exceptionally excitable,
pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness. In terms of other characteristics of
the ordinary person, the ""collective good sense"" of the jury will
lead it to ascribe to the ordinary person any general characteristics relevant
to the provocation in question. Since features such as sex, age, or race, do
not detract from a person's characterization as ordinary, particular
characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an
ordinary person without subverting the logic of the objective test. It would be
impossible to conceptualize a sexless or ageless ordinary person. The central
criterion, however, is the relevance of the particular feature to the
provocation in question. 

 

                   It should be noted that the trial judge in each case
is not bound to tell the members of the jury what specific attributes they are
to ascribe to the ordinary person. In applying their common sense to the
factual determination of the objective test, jury members will quite naturally
and properly ascribe certain characteristics to the ""ordinary
person"".

 

                   The second test of provocation involves an
assessment of what actually occurred in the mind of the accused. The trial
judge must make clear to the jury that its task at this point is to ascertain
whether the accused was in fact acting as a result of provocation. In
this regard, a trial judge may wish to remind jury members that they are
entitled to take into account the accused's mental state and psychological
temperament.

 

                   The trial judge did not err in failing to specify
that the ordinary person, for the purposes of the objective test of provocation,
is deemed to be of the same sex and age as the accused. It is neither wise nor
necessary to make this a mandatory component of all jury charges on
provocation. The judge's charge on the subjective prong of the provocation
defence would not have misled the average juror with respect to the objective
test when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole.

 

                   Per McIntyre J.:
Section 215  of the Criminal Code  established the standard of the
ordinary person as the standard applicable to all persons in determining what
will amount to provocation. This standard means an ordinary person of either
sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed of such powers of
self‑control as everyone is entitled to expect that his fellow citizens
will exercise in today's society. If the allegedly provocative conduct will not
cause this ordinary person to lose ""the power of self‑control"",
there can be no application of the defence. Where the threshold is passed,
however, the act meets the test for provocation and consideration may be given
to the defence. If the accused lost self‑control through that provocation
and if he acted on the sudden before his passion cooled, the defence applies.
The jury applies the subjective test in making this last determination and
considers the individual characteristics of the accused which could affect his
reaction to the insult or wrongful act.

 

                   Per Lamer J. dissenting
in result: When giving content to the ordinary person standard, age is a
relevant consideration when dealing with a young accused person and will be an
important contextual consideration for a jury assessing the reaction of the
ordinary person in those circumstances. It was not mandatory that the judge
instruct the jury that the ordinary person is deemed to be of the same age and
sex as the accused for the objective test of provocation. In some cases,
however, failure to do so would be unfair and constitute reversible error, not
because of a special rule applicable to charges on provocation, but because of
the general rule that the judge's charge be fair.

 

                   The trial judge here erred when he gave instructions
to the jury tantamount to excluding age as a relevant factor when addressing
the ""first leg"" of the provocation test. The jury here must have
understood, from the charge, that the objective test excluded consideration of
age while the subjective test did not and that the accused's age could be
considered at that later stage. 

 

                   Per Wilson J., dissenting:
Subjective character traits cannot be taken into account in measuring an
accused's acts against the objective standard of the ""ordinary
person"" at the first stage of the provocation defence. To do so would
undermine the basic principles of equality and individual responsibility.
However, the accused's physical characteristics and the circumstances in which
he is found can be considered in applying the objective ""ordinary
person"" test if they are relevant in placing the wrongful act or insult in
its proper context for the purpose of assessing its gravity. The jury must be
directed to consider any facts which make the wrongful act or insult
comprehensible to them in the same way that it was comprehended by the accused
and then, having appreciated the factual context in which that wrongful act or
insult took place, measure the accused's response to this insult against the
objective standard of the ordinary person similarly situated and similarly
insulted.

 

                   The legal system, to accurately reflect the view of
children as being in the developmental stages en route to full
functioning capability as adults, must measure their actions against a standard
culminating in that of the ordinary adult. The standard of the ordinary adult,
therefore, must be adjusted to an incremental scale reflecting the reduced
responsibility of the accused resulting from his age.

 

                   Given the objective test of the ""ordinary
person"" similarly situated and similarly insulted, the fact that the
victim of the assault was male and that the assault was homosexual may be
properly considered.

 

                   Per Le Dain J., dissenting:
The youth of the accused was relevant to the consideration by the jury whether
there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive the ordinary person of the power of self‑control. The accused's
age was relevant to the standard of self‑control of the ordinary person
rather than to the gravity of the provocation: Director of Public
Prosecutions v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705. The trial judge's charge to the
jury was calculated to lead the jury to conclude that they should not consider
the age of the accused with reference to whether there had been a wrongful act
or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of
the power of self‑control, but only with reference to whether the accused
acted upon the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his
passion to cool. For this reason the appeal should be dismissed. As to whether
the trial judge was required to say anything concerning the age and sex of the
accused: the sex of the accused and its relevance to the nature and gravity of
the provocation were obvious and did not require any observation from the trial
judge; the relative youth of the accused would also presumably be obvious but
its relevance as a matter of law to the question whether there had been
wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an
ordinary person of the power of self‑control might be less obvious to a
jury and should probably have been drawn to their attention.

conviction by Walsh J. and ordering a new trial. Appeal allowed, Lamer,

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Estey,
Chouinard and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑Gordon James Elmer Hill was charged with
committing first degree murder at the City of Belleville, County of Hastings,
on the person of Verne Pegg, contrary to s. 218(1) of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34. He was found by the jury not guilty of first degree
murder but guilty of second degree murder. He was sentenced to imprisonment for
life without eligibility for parole until ten years of his sentence had been
served.

 

2.                Hill appealed his conviction to the
Court of Appeal of Ontario. He raised many grounds of appeal, but the Court of
Appeal called upon the Crown with respect to one ground only, relating to the
charge on the issue of provocation. The ground of appeal was that the trial
judge failed to instruct the jury properly as to the ""ordinary
person"" in s. 215(2)  of the Criminal Code . Section 215 of the Code
reads in part:

 

                   215. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to
manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   (2) A
wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive
an ordinary person of the power of self‑control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

3.                These two subsections, given their plain
meaning, produce three sequential questions for answer by the tribunal:

 

1. Would an ordinary
person be deprived of self‑control by the act or insult?

 

2. Did the accused in fact
act in response to those ""provocative"" acts; in short was he or she
provoked by them whether or not an ordinary person would have been?

 

3. Was the accused's
response sudden and before there was time for his or her passion to cool?

 

At this stage it is important to recall the presence of subs. (3) of s.
215  which provides:

 

                   (3) For
the purposes of this section the questions

 

(a) whether a
particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and

 

(b) whether the
accused was deprived of the power of self‑control by the provocation that
he alleges he received,

 

are questions of fact.... 

 

4.                In the answering of these successive
questions, the first or ""ordinary person"" test is clearly determined
by objective standards. The second de facto test as to the loss of self‑control
by the accused is determined, like any other question of fact as revealed by
the evidence, from the surrounding facts. The third test as to whether the
response was sudden and before passions cooled is again a question of fact.

 

5.                At the time of the killing, Hill was a
male, sixteen years of age. The narrow question in this appeal is whether the
trial judge erred in law in failing to instruct the jury that if they found a
wrongful act or insult they should consider whether it was sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person ""of the age and sex of the appellant"" of
his power of self‑control. Was it incumbent in law on the trial judge to
add that gloss to the section? That is the issue.

 

                                                                     I

 

The Facts

 

6.                At trial both parties agreed that it was
the acts of Hill which caused the death of Pegg but dis­agreed otherwise. The
position of the Crown at trial was that Hill and Pegg were homosexual lovers
and that Hill had decided to murder Pegg after a falling out between them. The
Crown argued that Hill deliberately struck Pegg in the head while Pegg lay in
bed. This did not kill Pegg who immediately ran from the bedroom into the
bathroom to try and stop the flow of blood from his head. Realizing he had been
unsuccessful, Hill took two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.

 

7.                Hill's version of the events was very
different. He admitted to causing the death of Pegg but put forward two
defences: self‑defence and provocation. Hill testified that he had known
Pegg for about a year through the latter's involvement with the ""Big
Brothers"" organization. Hill stated that on the night in question he had
been the subject of unexpected and unwelcome homosexual advances by Pegg while
asleep on the couch in Pegg's apartment. Pegg pursued Hill to the bathroom and
grabbed him, at which time Hill picked up a nearby hatchet and swung it at Pegg
in an attempt to scare him. The hatchet struck Pegg in the head. Hill then ran
from the apartment but returned shortly afterward. Upon re‑entering the
apartment, he was confronted by Pegg who threatened to kill him. At this point,
Hill obtained two knives from the kitchen and stabbed Pegg to death.

 

8.                Hill was arrested, after a car chase
with the police, at the wheel of a Pontiac automobile owned by Pegg. At the
scene of arrest Hill denied knowing Pegg, but later he made a statement to the
police which was substantially similar to his oral testimony at trial.

 

                                                                    II

 

The Charge

 

9.                The trial judge instructed the jury on
the defence of provocation in the following terms:

 

                   The
Criminal Code  provides that culpable homicide that would otherwise be murder
shall be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the
heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   Under
the Code, a wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient
to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control is
provocation, if the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool.

 

The foregoing paragraphs are simply a recital of the Code. The
judge continued: 

 

                   Provocation
may come from actual words or a series of each or a combination of both, and it
must be looked at in the light of all the surrounding circumstances.

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

After reviewing the evidence in support of the defence of provocation
the judge continued:

 

                   You
will consider that evidence and you will decide whether the words and acts were
sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

                   The
acts were rubbing the accused's legs and chest, grabbing him by the shoulder
and spinning him around, and later Pegg grabbing his right wrist before the
second stab. The words were, ""I am going to kill you, you little
bastard"".

 

                   If you
find that they were, you will then secondly consider whether the accused acted
on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool.
In deciding this question you are not restricted to the standard of the
ordinary person. You will take into account the mental, the emotional, the
physical characteristics and the age of this accused.

 

                   The
incidents or the words upon which the provocation is based must be
contemporaneous words or closely related to the tragedy. The killing must take
place immediately after the acts or words constituting the provocation or so
soon thereafter that the accused's passion had no time to cool.

 

                   You
will also ask yourselves was the provocation such that it would have led a
person with the mental and physical condition and the age of the accused to
respond in this way. 

 

10.              At trial, counsel for Hill objected to the
instruction of the trial judge as to the objective requirement of the defence
of provocation, submitting that the ""ordinary person"" referred to in
s. 215(2)  ought to have been defined as an ordinary person of the age and sex
of the accused. Counsel submitted that the objective requirement would be
satisfied if the judge were to recharge the jury by defining ""ordinary
person"" as an ""ordinary person in the circumstances of the
accused"". The judge refused to recharge the jury in those terms.

 

                                                                   III

 

The Court of Appeal

 

11.              In oral reasons Brooke J.A. (Martin and
Morden JJ.A. concurring) noted that counsel for the defence, relying on Director
of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705 (H.L.), submitted that
the judge should have instructed the jury to consider whether the wrongful act
or insult was sufficient to deprive an ""ordinary person"" of the age
and sex of the accused of his power of self‑control. The Court of Appeal
held that because the trial judge declined to do so he erred. In reaching this
conclusion, Brooke J.A. stated:

 

The age and sex of the
appellant are not ""peculiar characteristics"" excluded from
consideration of the ""ordinary person"" in the objective test in s.
215(2)  (see Fauteux J. (as he then was) in Wright v. The Queen, [1969] 3
C.C.C. 258 at 264‑5 discussing Bedder v. D.P.P., [1954] 2 All E.R.
801).

 

He also added:

 

In our respectful opinion,
there is nothing in that judgment which precludes charging the jury as the
defence requested. As the matter was left to the jury, the age of the appellant
was only a consideration if and when the jury turned to the question of whether
the wrongful act or insult deprived him of his power of self‑control. The
effect of the charge was that an ordinary person did not include a 16 year old
or youth and may well have established as the standard an ordinary person more
experienced and mature than the ordinary 16 year old or youth. If this is so,
the jury may have rejected the defence judging the objective test on that
basis.

 

12.              In the result, the Court of Appeal held
that the judge was in error and there may well have been misdirection which
seriously prejudiced Hill and so the conviction could not stand. The appeal was
allowed, the conviction set aside and a new trial on the charge of second
degree murder ordered. 

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Issue

 

13.              The issue in this appeal is whether the
Ontario Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the trial judge erred in
law with respect to the elements of the objective test relevant to the defence
of provocation in failing to direct the jury that the ""ordinary
person"" within the meaning of that term in s. 215(2)  of the Criminal
Code  was an ""ordinary person of the same age and sex as the
accused"".

 

                                                                    V

 

The Defence of Provocation

 

14.              The defence of provocation appears to have
first developed in the early 1800's. Tindal C.J. in R. v. Hayward
(1833), 6 C. & P. 157, at p. 158, told the jury that the defence of
provocation was derived from the law's ""compassion to human
infirmity"". It acknowledged that all human beings are subject to
uncontrollable outbursts of passion and anger which may lead them to do violent
acts. In such instances, the law would lessen the severity of criminal
liability.

 

15.              Nevertheless, not all acts done in the
heat of passion were to be subject to the doctrine of provocation. By the
middle of the nineteenth century, it became clear that the provoking act had to
be sufficient to excite an ordinary or reasonable person under the circumstances.
As Keating J. stated in R. v. Welsh (1869), 11 Cox C.C. 336, at p. 338:

 

The law is, that there
must exist such an amount of provocation as would be excited by the
circumstances in the mind of a reasonable man, and so as to lead the jury to
ascribe the act to the influence of that passion.

 

16.              The Criminal Code  codified this
approach to provocation by including under s. 215  three general requirements
for the defence of provocation. First, the provoking wrongful act or insult
must be of such a nature that it would deprive an ordinary person of the power
of self‑control. That is the initial threshold which must be surmounted.
Secondly, the accused must actually have been provoked. As I have earlier
indicated, these two elements are often referred to as the objective and
subjective tests of provocation respectively. Thirdly, the accused must have
acted on the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his or her
passion to cool.

 

(a)               The Objective Test of Provocation and the
Ordinary Person Standard

 

17.              In considering the precise meaning and
application of the ordinary person standard or objective test, it is important
to identify its underlying rationale. Lord Simon of Glaisdale has
perhaps stated it most succinctly when he suggested in Camplin, at p.
726, that ""the reason for importing into this branch of the law the
concept of the reasonable man [was] ... to avoid the injustice of a man being
entitled to rely on his exceptional excitability or pugnacity or ill‑temper
or on his drunkenness"". 

 

18.              If there were no objective test to the
defence of provocation, anomalous results could occur. A well‑tempered,
reasonable person would not be entitled to benefit from the provocation defence
and would be guilty of culpable homicide amounting to murder, while an ill‑tempered
or exceptionally excitable person would find his or her culpability mitigated
by provocation and would be guilty only of manslaughter. It is society's
concern that reasonable and non‑violent behaviour be encouraged that
prompts the law to endorse the objective standard. The criminal law is
concerned among other things with fixing standards for human behaviour. We seek
to encourage conduct that complies with certain societal standards of
reasonableness and responsibility. In doing this, the law quite logically
employs the objective standard of the reasonable person.

 

19.              With this general purpose in mind, we must
ascertain the meaning of the ordinary person standard. What are the
characteristics of the ""ordinary person""? To what extent should the
attributes and circumstances of the accused be ascribed to the ordinary person?
To answer these questions, it is helpful to review the English and Canadian
jurisprudence. Since Canadian courts have relied heavily on English
developments, I shall begin with the English cases.

 

(i)                English Law of Provocation and the Ordinary
Person Standard

 

20.              In R. v. Lesbini (1914), 11 Cr.
App. R. 7, the English Court of Criminal Appeal refused to take into account
the mental deficiency of the accused in assessing the availability of the
provocation defence. It confirmed the threshold objective test for provocation
whereby there must be sufficient provocation to excite a reasonable person. A
reasonable or ordinary person was not one with mental deficiencies. In Mancini
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1942] A.C. 1, the House of Lords
endorsed the Lesbini case and further elaborated the objective test of
provocation. Viscount Simon stated, at p. 9:

 

The test to be applied is
that of the effect of the provocation on a reasonable man, as was laid down by
the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Lesbini so that an
unusually excitable or pugnacious individual is not entitled to rely on
provocation which would not have led an ordinary person to act as he did.

 

The ordinary or reasonable person, therefore, was one of normal
temperament and average mental capacity. 

 

21.              In 1954, the House of Lords was faced with
the question of whether, in applying the objective test of provocation, it
should take into account certain physical characteristics of the accused. In Bedder
v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1119, a sexually
impotent man killed a prostitute after she taunted him about his physical
condition. The House of Lords had to determine whether, in applying the
objective test of provocation, the sexual impotence of the accused should be
taken into account. The test would then have been whether an ordinary person,
who was sexually impotent, would have been provoked. The Court rejected this
approach and held that the peculiar physical characteristics of the accused
were not to be ascribed to the ordinary person for the purposes of the
objective test.

 

22.              Despite the House of Lords' conclusion
that the physical characteristics of the accused were irrelevant to the
determination of whether a reasonable person would have been provoked, it
appears that the Court was primarily concerned with the difficulty of
distinguishing ""temperament"" from ""physical defects"". As
Lord Simonds L.C. stated, at p. 1121:

 

It appeared to that court,
as it appears to me, that ""no distinction is to be made in the case of a
person who, though it may not be a matter of temperament, is physically
impotent, is conscious of that impotence, and therefore mentally liable to be
more excited unduly if he is `twitted' or attacked on the subject of that
particular infirmity"". The court thereupon approved and reiterated the
proposition that the question for the jury was whether on the facts ... from
the evidence the provocation was in fact enough to lead a reasonable person to
do what the accused did.

 

23.              The Bedder approach to the ordinary
person standard is no longer the law in England. In Camplin, the House
of Lords expressly rejected the narrow objective test articulated in Bedder.
The Camplin case involved a youth of fifteen years of age who maintained
that he had been provoked by a homosexual assault. The House of Lords
unanimously concluded that the ordinary person, for the purposes of the
objective test of provocation, was to be an ordinary person of the same age and
sex as the accused. It should be noted that in Camplin, the trial judge
had specifically directed the jury to take age and sex into account and the
appeal sought to establish that this was wrong. In the present case, there was
no such instruction. 

 

24.              In justifying its shift away from the Bedder
approach, the House of Lords relied in part on legislative changes in the law
of provocation introduced after the Bedder opinion. Specifically, in
1957, s. 3 of the Homicide Act, 1957 (U.K.), 5 & 6 Eliz. 2, c. 11,
was passed; it provides:

 

                   3. Where on a charge of murder there is evidence on which the jury can
find that the person charged was provoked (whether by things done or by things
said or by both together) to lose his self‑control, the question whether
the provocation was enough to make a reasonable man do as he did shall be left
to be determined by the jury; and in determining that question the jury shall
take into account everything both done and said according to the effect which,
in their opinion, it would have on a reasonable man.

 

The phrase, ""the jury shall take into account everything"" was
interpreted to allow a consideration of relevant characteristics in connection
with the objective test.

 

25.              Lord Diplock clarified the underlying rationale
for expanding the notion of the ordinary person when he wrote, at p. 717:

 

To taunt a person because
of his race, his physical infirmities or some shameful incident in his past may
well be considered by the jury to be more offensive to the person addressed,
however equable his temperament, if the facts on which the taunt is founded are
true than it would be if they were not.

 

On a similar note, Lord Morris of Borth‑y‑Gest held, at p.
721:

 

If the accused is of
particular colour or particular ethnic origin and things are said which to him
are grossly insulting it would be utterly unreal if the jury had to consider
whether the words would have provoked a man of a different colour or ethnic
origin‑‑or to consider how such a man would have acted or reacted.

 

26.              Taking these considerations into account,
Lord Simon of Glaisdale formulated the objective test as follows, at p. 727:

 

                   I think
that the standard of self‑control which the law requires before
provocation is held to reduce murder to manslaughter is still that of the
reasonable person...; but that, in determining whether a person of reasonable
self‑control would lose it in the circumstances, the entire factual situation,
which includes the characteristics of the accused, must be considered. 

 

27.              One conceptual difficulty was acknowledged
by Lord Diplock. He recognized that ""in strict logic there is a transition
between treating age as a characteristic that may be taken into account in
assessing the gravity of the provocation addressed to the accused and treating
it as a characteristic to be taken into account in determining what is the
degree of self‑control to be expected of the ordinary person"" (p.
717). In most cases, it is appropriate to assume that the level of self‑control
or degree of reasonableness is the same regardless of certain physical
differences. Age, however, in Lord Diplock's view posed a more difficult
problem. He resolved this problem with respect to age by appealing to the
acknowledged importance of the law's compassion to human infirmity. On a more
general level, he rejected the solution of separating out the inquiry into two
phases as overly complicated for the jury.

 

(ii) Canadian Case Law

 

28.              The Supreme Court of Canada has also had
occasion to provide guidance on the ordinary person standard for provocation.
In Taylor v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 462, a case in which the accused
was drunk at the time of his alleged provocation, Kerwin J., as he then was,
made clear that for the purposes of the objective test of provocation, the
""criterion is the effect on the ordinary person.... the jury is not
entitled to take into consideration any alleged drunkenness on the part of the
accused"" (p. 471).

 

29.              This Court again rejected a consideration
of the drunkenness of the accused in connection with the objective test in Salamon
v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 404. Fauteux J., as he then was, endorsed the
trial judge's instruction to the jury not to consider ""the character,
background, temperament or condition of the accused"" in relation to the
objective test of provocation. Similarly, Cartwright J., as he then was
(dissenting on another issue) wrote, at p. 415, that the trial judge correctly
""made it plain that on this [objective] branch of the inquiry no account
should be taken of the idiosyncracies of the appellant and that the standard
was that of an ordinary person"".

 

30.              Finally, in Wright v. The Queen,
[1969] S.C.R. 335, a son was charged with the shooting death of his father. The
evidence suggested that there had been some difficulties in their relationship.
The father was said to have been a bad tempered and violent man who had
mistreated his son on a number of occasions. The accused had not seen his
father for a period of about five years until a few days prior to the fatal
incident. On the evening of the shooting, the accused had spent most of the day
drinking with his friends. In considering the objective test of provocation,
the Court rejected the relevance of the quality of the accused's relationship
with his father, the mentality of the accused or his possible drunkenness.
Fauteux J. quoted, at p. 340, the words of Lord Simonds L.C. in Bedder,
that the purpose of the objective test is ""to invite the jury to consider
the act of the accused by reference to a certain standard or norm of conduct
and with this object the ‘reasonable’ or the ‘average’ or the ‘normal’ man is
invoked"". The Court went on to state, at p. 340: 

 

While the character,
background, temperament, idiosyncracies, or the drunkenness of the accused are
matters to be considered in the second branch of the enquiry, they are excluded
from consideration in the first branch. A contrary view would denude of any
sense the objective test.

 

31.              Appellate courts at the provincial level
have also considered the nature of the ordinary person standard of provocation.
In R. v. Clark (1974), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (Alta. C.A.), the ""morbid
jealousy and slight mental degeneration"" suffered by the accused was held
not to be relevant to the objective test. According to Clement J.A., at p. 16:

 

                   In the
first branch of the inquiry, the objective test, which in essence has to be
determined as a standard of comparison is the reaction that might be expected
from ordinary human nature to the wrongful act, or to the alleged insult in the
present case.

 

32.              In R. v. Parnerkar (1971), 5 C.C.C.
(2d) 11, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal held that the cultural and religious
background of the accused was not relevant to the determination of the
objective test. The accused, born in India, was alleged to have been provoked
by, inter alia, the deceased's statement ""I am not going to marry
you because you are a black man"". The Court's ruling seems to narrow
unduly the conception of the ordinary person and rigidly prohibit a
consideration of the physical characteristics of the accused along the lines of
the Bedder case. I should note that Par­nerkar was affirmed by
this Court on appeal: see [1974] S.C.R. 449; however, this particular question
was not addressed.

 

33.              In more recent decisions, appellate courts
at the provincial level appear to be moving towards the Camplin
approach. The Ontario Court of Appeal's decision in the present appeal, R.
v. Hill (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 394, and R. v. Daniels (1983), 7
C.C.C. (3d) 542 (N.W.T.C.A.), reflect this trend. In the Daniels case,
Laycraft J.A. held that in instructing the jury on the objective test of
provocation, the trial judge should tell the jury to take into account all of
the external events putting pressure on the accused. He stated at p. 554:

 

                   The
purpose of the objective test prescribed by s. 215  is to consider the actions
of the accused in a specific case against the standard of the ordinary person.
Hypothetically, the ordinary person is subjected to the same external pressures
of insult by acts or words as was the accused. Only if those pressures would
cause an ordinary person to lose self‑control does the next question
arise whether the accused did, in fact, lose self‑control. In my view, the
objective test lacks validity if the reaction of the hypothetical ordinary
person is not tested against all of the events which put pressure on the
accused.

 

(iii)               The Appropriate Content of the Ordinary
Person Standard

 

34.              What lessons are to be drawn from this
review of the case law? I think it is clear that there is widespread agreement
that the ordinary or reasonable person has a normal temperament and level of
self‑control. It follows that the ordinary person is not exceptionally
excitable, pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness. 

 

35.              In terms of other characteristics of the
ordinary person, it seems to me that the ""collective good sense"" of
the jury will naturally lead it to ascribe to the ordinary person any general
characteristics relevant to the provocation in question. For example, if the
provocation is a racial slur, the jury will think of an ordinary person with
the racial background that forms the substance of the insult. To this extent,
particular characteristics will be ascribed to the ordinary person. Indeed, it
would be impossible to conceptualize a sexless or ageless ordinary person.
Features such as sex, age, or race, do not detract from a person's
characterization as ordinary. Thus particular characteristics that are not
peculiar or idiosyncratic can be ascribed to an ordinary person without
subverting the logic of the objective test of provocation. As Lord Diplock
wrote in Camplin at pp. 716‑17:

 

...the ""reasonable
man"" has never been confined to the adult male. It means an ordinary
person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed
of such powers of self‑control as everyone is entitled to expect that his
fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today.

 

36.              It is important to note that, in some
instances, certain characteristics will be irrelevant. For example, the race of
a person will be irrelevant if the provocation involves an insult regarding a
physical disability. Similarly, the sex of an accused will be irrelevant if the
provocation relates to a racial insult. Thus the central criterion is the
relevance of the particular feature to the provocation in question. With this
in mind, I think it is fair to conclude that age will be a relevant
consideration when we are dealing with a young accused person. For a jury to
assess what an ordinary person would have done if subjected to the same
circumstances as the accused, the young age of an accused will be an important
contextual consideration.

 

37.              I should also add that my conclusion that
certain attributes can be ascribed to the ordinary person is not meant to
suggest that a trial judge must in each case tell the jury what specific
attributes it is to ascribe to the ordinary person. The point I wish to
emphasize is simply that in applying their common sense to the factual
determination of the objective test, jury members will quite naturally and
properly ascribe certain characteristics to the ""ordinary person"". 

 

(b)               The Subjective Test and Actual Provocation

 

38.              Once a jury has established that the
provocation in question was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the
power of self‑control, it must still determine whether the accused was so
deprived. It may well be that an ordinary person would have been provoked, but
in fact the accused was not. This second test of provocation is called
subjective because it involves an assessment of what actually occurred in the
mind of the accused. At this stage, the jury must also consider whether the
accused reacted to the provocation on the sudden and before there was time for
his passion to cool.

 

39.              In instructing the jury with respect to
the subjective test of provocation, the trial judge must make clear to the jury
that its task at this point is to ascertain whether the accused was in fact
acting as a result of provocation. In this regard, a trial judge may wish to
remind the jury members that, in determining whether an accused was actually
provoked, they are entitled to take into account his or her mental state and
psychological temperament.

 

                                                                   VI

 

The Validity of the Trial Judge's Charge

 

40.              To apply this statement of the law to the
present appeal, we must return to the actual words of the trial judge. When
instructing the jury on the objective test of provocation, he began by stating:

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

He later added:

 

                   You
will consider that evidence and you will decide whether the words and acts were
sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

In my view, this part of the charge was well‑stated and correct
in law. The trial judge did not err in failing to specify that the ordinary
person, for the purposes of the objective test of provocation, is to be deemed
to be of the same age and sex as the accused. Although this type of instruction
may be helpful in clarifying the application of the ordinary person standard, I
do not think it wise or necessary to make this a mandatory component of all
jury charges on provocation. Whenever possible, we should retain simplicity in
charges to the jury and have confidence that the words of the Criminal Code 
will provide sufficient guidance to the jury. Indeed, in this area of the law,
I take heed of the words of Lord Goddard C.J. in R. v. McCarthy, [1954]
2 Q.B. 105, at p. 112: 

 

No court has ever given,
nor do we think ever can give, a definition of what constitutes a reasonable or
average man. That must be left to the collective good sense of the jury.

 

41.              It has been suggested that the instruction
of the trial judge on the subjective prong of the provocation defence had the
effect of misleading the jury on the appropriate content of the ordinary person
standard. The charge stated:

 

... you will then secondly
consider whether the accused acted on the provocation on the sudden before
there was time for his passion to cool. In deciding this question you are not
restricted to the standard of the ordinary person. You will take into account
the mental, the emotional, the physical characteristics and the age of this
accused.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   You
will also ask yourselves was the provocation such that it would have led a
person with the mental and physical condition and the age of the accused to
respond in this way.

 

In my opinion, these words would not have misled the average juror with
respect to the objective test, particularly when viewed in the context of the
charge as a whole.

 

42.              I have the greatest of confidence in the
level of intelligence and plain common sense of the average Canadian jury
sitting on a criminal case. Juries are perfectly capable of sizing the matter
up. In my experience as a trial judge I cannot recall a single instance in
which a jury returned to the courtroom to ask for further instructions on the
provocation portion of a murder charge. A jury frequently seeks further
guidance on the distinction between first degree murder, second degree murder
and manslaughter, but rarely, if ever, on provocation. It seems to be common
ground that the trial judge would not have been in error if he had simply read
s. 215 of the Code and left it at that, without embellishment. I am
loathe to complicate the task of the trial judge, in cases such as the case at
bar, by requiring him or her as a matter of law to point out to the members of
the jury that in applying the objective test they must conceptualize an
""ordinary person"" who is male and young. The accused is before them.
He is male and young. I cannot conceive of a Canadian jury conjuring up the
concept of an ""ordinary person"" who would be either female or
elderly, or banishing from their minds the possibility that an ""ordinary
person"" might be both young and male. I do not think anything said by the
judge in the case at bar would have lead the jury to such an absurdity.

 

                                                                   VII

 

Conclusion

 

43.              I find that the trial judge's charge to
the jury on the ordinary person standard in the defence of provocation was
consistent with the requirements of the Criminal Code  and correct in
law. It was not necessary to direct the jury that the ordinary person means an
ordinary person of the same age and sex as the accused. I would, therefore,
allow the appeal and restore the conviction. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

44.              McIntyre
J.‑‑I have read the reasons for judgment of the Chief
Justice. I agree with his result and generally with his reasons. I wish only to
add a brief comment of my own.

 

45.              Section 215  of the Criminal Code 
provides for a defence of provocation, which will allow, if it is successful,
the reduction of what would be murder to the lesser crime of manslaughter.
Subsection (1) provides for the defence. Subsection (2) defines the nature of
the act or insult which will be sufficient to amount to provocation. It does
not deal with the nature or with any of the individual characteristics of the
person seeking to rely on the defence. It establishes a standard to apply to
all persons in determining what will amount to provocation, the standard of the
ordinary person. The concept of the ordinary person or the reasonable man is
well‑known in the law. Many definitions have been formulated. A fitting
one may be found in the words of Lord Diplock in the Camplin case [[1978]
A.C. 705 (H.L.), at pp. 716‑17], cited by the Chief Justice, in these
terms:

 

...the ""reasonable
man"" has never been confined to the adult male. It means an ordinary
person of either sex, not exceptionally excitable or pugnacious, but possessed
of such powers of self‑control as everyone is entitled to expect that his
fellow citizens will exercise in society as it is today.

 

If the conduct alleged to have been provocative will not cause this
ordinary person to lose ""the power of self‑control"", then there
can be no application of the defence. However, where that threshold is passed,
the act meets the test for provocation and consideration may be given to the
defence. If it is found that the accused was deprived of the power of self‑control
by the provocation and that he acted upon it on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool, the defence will apply. In making that last
determination the jury may apply what has been called the subjective test, the
individual characteristics of the accused which could affect his reaction to
the wrongful act or insult, such as race, colour, religion, sex and
drunkenness, and other subjective factors affecting his reaction may be
considered. This proposition has the support of binding authority in this
country: see Taylor v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 462; Salamon v. The
Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 404; and Wright v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R.
335, where it was said, at p. 340:

 

While the character,
background, temperament, idiosyncracies, or the drunkenness of the accused are
matters to be considered in the second branch of the enquiry, they are excluded
from consideration in the first branch. A contrary view would denude of any sense
the objective test.

 

46.              The reason that the two tests, objective
and subjective, are separated in this defence is clear. The law fixes a
standard for all which must be met before reliance may be placed on the
provocation defence. Everyone, whatever his or her idiosyncracies, is expected
to observe that standard. It is not every insult or injury that will be
sufficient to relieve a person from what would otherwise be murder. The
""ordinary person"" standard is adopted to fix the degree of self‑control
and restraint expected of all in society. The law, however, does recognize
frailty when the threshold test is passed and a person is provided beyond the
level of tolerance of the ordinary person. Then the individual characteristics
of the accused may be considered and, where the other terms of s. 215  of the Criminal
Code  are met, the defence will apply.

 

47.              As I have said, I would allow the appeal. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

48.              Lamer
J. (dissenting in result)‑‑I agree with the Chief
Justice's exposition of the law in its entirety. As regards age, I therefore
agree that, when giving content to the ordinary person standard, as said by the
Chief Justice, ""age will be a relevant consideration when we are dealing
with a young accused person"", and that, ""For a jury to assess what an
ordinary person would have done if subjected to the same circumstances as the
accused, the young age of an accused will be an important contextual
consideration"".

 

49.              I am also of his view that it is not
mandatory that the judge instruct the jury ""that the ordinary person, for
the purposes of the objective test of provocation, is to be deemed to be of the
same age and sex as the accused"". But I should like to add that there
will, in my view, be cases where failure to do so, given the particular
circumstances of the case, would be unfair and constitute reversible error; but
not because of a special rule applicable to charges on provocation, but rather
under the general rule that the judge's charge to the jury must always be fair.

 

50.              Such is not the case here and the trial
judge did not err in failing to give such an instruction. But he erred, in my
respectful view, when he gave instructions to the jury tantamount to excluding
age as a relevant factor in their consideration of the ""first leg"" of
the provocation test. In his charge, he instructed the jury on the law of
provocation as follows.

 

51.              When commenting on the first phase of the
test, the objective test, he said:

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

And, after referring to the facts of the case relevant to this first
determination, he went on to say:

 

                   You
will consider that evidence and you will decide whether the words and acts were
sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

And then, turning to the second phase, the subjective test, he said to
them:

 

                   If you
find that they were, you will then secondly consider whether the accused acted
on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool.
In deciding this question your are not restricted to the standard of
the ordinary person. You will take into account the mental, the emotional,
the physical characteristics and the age of this accused.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

And finally:

 

                   You
will also ask yourselves was the provocation such that it would have led a
person with the mental and physical condition and the age of the accused
to respond in this way.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

52.              Sharing the Chief Justice's confidence in
the level of intelligence and plain common sense of the average Canadian juror,
I cannot but conclude that, in all likelihood, the jury understood that the
objective test excluded consideration of age, while the subjective test no
longer restricted them and that they could, indeed should, at that latter stage
then consider the accused's age. It is on this narrow ground, the effect of the
trial judge's instructions upon the jury, that I disagree with the Chief Justice.

 

53.              The appeal should be dismissed and the
Court of Appeal's order for a new trial should stand. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

54.              Wilson
J. (dissenting)‑‑This case requires a consideration
of the defence of provocation under s. 215 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970,
c. C‑34. The relevant portions of the section read as follows:

 

                   215. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to
manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion
caused by sudden provocation.

 

                   (2) A
wrongful act or insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive
an ordinary person of the power of self‑control is provocation for the
purposes of this section if the accused acted upon it on the sudden and before
there was time for his passion to cool.

 

The specific question the Court must address is whether the objective
standard of the ""ordinary person"" upon which the defence is premised
can take into account personal attributes of the accused such as his age and
sex.

 

1. The Facts

 

55.              The facts of the case are in some dispute,
different versions having been presented at trial by the Crown and the defence.
However, it would appear that the respondent, a sixteen‑year old youth,
was acquainted with the deceased, Verne Pegg, through Pegg's having acted as a
volunteer ""big brother"" to the respondent and his younger brother.
Pegg, who was thirty‑two years of age at the time of his death, had
befriended the respondent and the two had engaged in numerous social activities
together over a period of about a year.

 

56.              In the early morning of December 7, 1979 a
police officer was dispatched to Pegg's residence in Belleville, Ontario, where
he found Pegg's body lying in a pool of blood on the living room floor. Next to
the body were two blood‑stained steak knives which had apparently been
used to inflict several laceration and puncture wounds on the chest of the
deceased. On the floor in the bedroom the police discovered a hatchet covered
with the deceased's blood. It would appear that this hatchet had been used to
inflict a deep gash on the right side of the deceased's head. The walls and
floor of the bedroom and living room were splattered with blood, as were also
the sheets on the deceased's bed. 

 

57.              The discovery was made several hours after
the respondent had been arrested on Highway 401 while driving down the centre
of the highway in Pegg's automobile. A search of the vehicle turned up a number
of credit cards and other identification in Pegg's name. The respondent denied
knowing the deceased at first but eventually made a statement to the police
indicating that he had killed Pegg in the early morning hours after Pegg had
made uninvited sexual advances toward him.

 

58.              The theory presented by the Crown at trial
was that the respondent and Pegg were homosexual lovers and that Pegg's death
resulted from a violent quarrel between the two the previous night. The
respondent, however, testified in his own defence and presented a very
different picture. He stated that he had visited Pegg's apartment the previous
evening and had fallen asleep on Pegg's sofa. He was awakened at approximately
1:00 a.m. by Pegg's uninvited caressing of his chest and legs. It was the
respondent's contention that he was so shocked and enraged at Pegg's actions
that he unthinkingly grabbed a hatchet which was lying with some camping
equipment and swung it at Pegg striking him on the head. As Pegg staggered away
the respondent fled the apartment clad only in his underwear.

 

59.              Within minutes, according to the
respondent's testimony, he returned to the apartment to see if Pegg was all
right. On entering the apartment he saw Pegg standing with the telephone in his
hand. Pegg said he was going to kill him. The respondent thereupon grabbed two
knives from the kitchen counter and as the deceased slowly advanced towards him
stabbed him twice in the chest. The respondent could not recall stabbing Pegg a
third time, but he testified that between the first and second blows Pegg
struggled upright and, half sitting, threatened his life again. After the
stabbing the respondent took Pegg's keys and wallet from the bedroom, dressed
himself and fled the scene in Pegg's car. He testified that he was in a state
of shock while driving the car down the centre of Highway 401, haunted by the
terrifying spectre of Pegg's face as he advanced towards him in the apartment. 

 

2. The Courts Below

 

60.              The respondent was tried on a charge of
murder in the Supreme Court of Ontario before Walsh J. and a jury. The defences
of self‑defence and provocation were relied upon. The respondent was
convicted of the lesser offence of second degree murder.

 

61.              On the issue of provocation Walsh J.
charged the jury in the usual way, indicating that in the first part of their
analysis they must be satisfied that the respondent's act met the test of an
objective standard of behaviour which could be expected from an ""ordinary
person"" and that, if they were so satisfied, they could then go on to
consider as a subjective matter whether the respondent was in fact provoked and
in fact acted on the provocation before there was time for his passion to cool.
In instructing the jury as to the meaning of ""ordinary person"" in s.
215(2)  of the Criminal Code  Walsh J. stated:

 

                   First,
the actual words must be such as would deprive an ordinary person of self‑control.
In considering this part of the Defence you are not to consider the particular
mental make‑up of the accused; rather the standard is that of the
ordinary person. You will ask yourselves would the words or acts in this case
have caused an ordinary person to lose his self‑control.

 

And later he said:

 

                   If you
find that they were, you will then secondly consider whether the accused acted
on the provocation on the sudden before there was time for his passion to cool.
In deciding this question you are not restricted to the standard of the
ordinary person. You will take into account the mental, the emotional, the
physical characteristics and the age of this accused.

 

62.              Counsel for the respondent challenged this
formulation of the first part of the defence of provocation on the basis that
it did not make clear to the jury that the ""ordinary person"" whose
reaction they were to consider was an ordinary person of the same age and sex
as the accused. Brooke J.A., in brief oral reasons on behalf of a unanimous
court, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial. In his view, the failure of
the trial judge to charge the jury that the objective ""ordinary
person"" standard must take account of the age and sex of the accused was
misdirection. As the matter was left to the jury by the trial judge, the
respondent's age and sex could only be considered in the second stage of the
provocation defence after it had already been determined that the ordinary
person might have had a more mature and controlled reaction than the
respondent. This was seriously prejudicial to the defence and the conviction
could not be allowed to stand. 

 

3. The Objective Test

 

63.              The central question posed in this appeal
is how the objective test for the provocation defence is to be formulated and
the extent to which characteristics peculiar to the individual accused can be
taken into account. Section 215(2) of the Code provides merely that the
incident giving rise to the provocation must be ""of such a nature as to be
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control....""
This rather cryptic statutory language requires interpretation in order to
achieve the presumed purpose of the legislature in requiring the accused's
conduct to be measured against that of the ""ordinary person"". What is
the rationale underlying the objective test?

 

64.              Like the ""reasonable man""
standard in tort law, the reference to the ""ordinary person"" in s.
215(2)  embodies the notion that acts falling below the applicable standard are
considered wrongful whether or not the individual defendant (or accused) had
the capacity to meet the standard. Thus, in the classic negligence case of Vaughan
v. Menlove (1837), 3 Bing. N.C. 468 (C.P.), it was held that a defendant's
innate stupidity cannot be put forward as a tort defence since he owes his
neighbour a duty to take reasonable care regardless of his personal capacity
for reasonableness. Similarly in the context of criminal culpability, it was
held in the leading case of R. v. Lesbini (1914), 11 Cr. App. R. 7
(C.A.), that the mental deficiency of the accused cannot be taken into account
in analyzing the defence of provocation since, short of insanity, the law
imposes full responsibility for intentional injurious acts except in those
provocative situations where the ordinary person would not have acted any
differently.

 

65.              Stupidity, of course, is not the only
subjective character trait which cannot be taken into account in measuring the
accused's acts against the objective standard of behaviour. Almost the entire
spectrum of personality traits has been considered and rejected by English and
Canadian courts as factors pertinent to the provocation defence. Thus, in Salamon
v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 404, it was determined that the temperament of
the accused and his peculiar psychological make‑up are not relevant to
the question whether he has met the objective standard required of every
person. Similarly, the fact that the accused was unusually excitable or prone
to emotional outburts was disallowed as a factor which the jury could consider
in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1942] A.C. 1 (H.L.) And
a tendency toward fits of rage brought on by drunkenness was excluded as an
ingredient making up the standard of behav­iour of the ""ordinary
person"" in Wright v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 335. As Laycraft J.A.
has recently indicated in R. v. Daniels (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 542
(N.W.T.C.A.), at p. 551, such varying mental and emotional capacities or
personality traits, if attributed to the ""ordinary person"" and taken
into account by the jury in the first stage of the analysis of the provocation
defence, would ""denude the test of objectivity"". 

 

66.              The objective standard, therefore, may be
said to exist in order to ensure that in the evaluation of the provocation
defence there is no fluctuating standard of self‑control against which
accuseds are measured. The governing principles are those of equality and
individual responsibility, so that all persons are held to the same standard
notwithstanding their distinctive personality traits and varying capacities to
achieve the standard. The success of a provocation defence rests on
establishing the accused's act as one which any ordinary person might have done
in the circumstances and not upon eliciting the court's compassion for an
accused whose act was unjustified but who could not control himself in the way
expected of an ordinary person. It is evident that any deviation from this
objective standard against which an accused's level of self‑control is
measured necessarily introduces an element of inequality in the way in which
the actions of different persons are evaluated and must therefore be avoided if
the underlying principle that all persons are equally responsible for their
actions is to be maintained.

 

67.              A more difficult problem arises when the
question is whether the physical attributes of the accused can be considered
and incorporated into the objective standard. This has been a somewhat
vexatious question on which the English and Canadian authorities are divided.
In Bedder v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1954] 1 W.L.R. 1119
(H.L.), it was held that purely physical peculiarities of the accused could not
be taken into account by the jury in applying the objective test to the
accused's behaviour. The accused in that case was a sexually impotent man who
was jeered at by a prostitute when he was unable to have sexual intercourse
with her. The House of Lords reasoned that sexual impotency was not an ailment
suffered by the ""ordinary person"" and that as such it could not be
considered in any objective assessment of the accused's reaction to the
victim's taunt. A similar line of reasoning was pursued by Culliton C.J.S. in R.
v. Parnerkar (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 11 (Sask. C.A.), and affirmed by Fauteux
C.J. in Parnerkar v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 449. In that case the
ethnic background of the accused was rejected as a factor that could be taken
into account in the objective stage of the provocation defence. The accused was
a black man who was subjected to a racial slur by a woman with whom he had a
long standing relationship and whom he desired to marry. Culliton C.J.S.
indicated (at p. 27) that although the derogatory use of the word
""black"" might have particular significance to the accused due to his
ethnic affiliation, it cannot be said that such an expression was one that
would deprive an ""ordinary person"" of the power of self‑control.


 

68.              These cases may be contrasted with the
decision of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Camplin,
[1978] A.C. 705, in which the age of the accused was held to be a factor that
could be taken into consideration. As in the case at bar, the accused Camplin
was a male youth who had been victimized by a homosexual assault. He was
subsequently laughed at by his assailant, at which point he lost his power of self‑control
and unleashed a mortal blow with a chapati pan. Lord Diplock indicated that the
age of the accused could be taken into account by the jury by attributing this
characteristic to the ""ordinary person"". In doing so, he expressly
indicated, at p. 717, that age could be considered by the jury for two distinct
purposes, namely (1) for the purpose of ""assessing the gravity of the
provocation addressed to the accused"" and (2) for the purpose of
""determining what is the degree of self‑control to be expected of
the ordinary person with whom the accused's conduct is to be compared"". In
other words, Camplin would allow a particular physical attribute such as
the accused's age to be taken into account for the purpose of evaluating the
gravity of the provocation. It would also allow particular mental attributes or
personality traits such as the accused's immaturity to be taken into account
for the purpose of determining the standard of self‑control against which
his conduct is to be measured. The former holding undermines the Bedder
and Parnerkar line of cases, whereas the latter reasoning tends to
undermine the objectivity of the ""ordinary person"" standard as
expressed in Lesbini, Salamon and Wright.

 

69.              The problem with the Bedder and Parnerkar
line of cases, as I see it, is that they seem to assume that provocative
insults occur in a vacuum and that therefore no facts pertinent to the
individual accused need be taken into account in assessing the reaction to an
insult. This, however, does not conform to reality since an insulting remark or
gesture has to be placed in context before the extent of its provocativeness
can be realistically assessed. As Lord Diplock expressed it in Camplin, supra,
at p. 717:

 

To taunt a person because
of his race, his physical infirmities or some shameful incident in his past may
well be considered by the jury to be more offensive to the person addressed,
however equable his temperament, if the facts on which the taunt is founded are
true than it would be if they were not. It would stultify much of the
mitigation of the previous harshness of the common law in ruling out verbal
provocation as capable of reducing murder to manslaughter if the jury could not
take into consideration all those factors which in their opinion would affect
the gravity of taunts or insults when applied to the person whom they are
addressed.

 

A racial insult directed at a member of the slandered group will
clearly sting much more than it would if directed at the ""ordinary
person"" who is not a member of the group. In Daniels, supra,
for example, where the accused was a woman who stabbed her husband's mistress
during a verbal altercation, the jury obviously must take into account the
factual context to the extent of recognizing that the accused's marriage had
been broken up by the victim even though, following the reasoning in Bedder
and Parnerkar, one could say that the ""ordinary person"" was
not married to Mr. Daniels and would therefore not be similarly affected by a
verbal slight from his mistress. 

 

70.              It seems apparent that certain attributes
of the accused and his or her circumstances must be taken into account, be they
features of the accused's life, elements of his culture or physical features to
which the particular insult was addressed. This use of the accused's attributes
does not, in my view, undermine the objective standard because it is done
purely for the purpose of putting the insult into context and assessing its
gravity. A certain type of jeer or derisive remark may mean something to a
teenager and be meaningless to an adult. The insult to the accused in Parnerkar
would only be perceived as an insult by a jury cognizant of the accused's race.
The objective standard and its underlying principles of equality and individual
responsibility are not, in my opinion, undermined when such factors are taken
into account only for the purpose of putting the provocative insult into
context.

 

71.              By way of contrast, it would certainly
undermine the principle of equality if the jury in Par­nerkar were
instructed to evaluate the accused in accordance with a standard of behaviour
peculiar to his race. Whereas it is permissible to take into account factors
such as the ethnic identity, language or physical infirmity of an accused for
the purpose of giving the insult context, it would violate the principle of
equality to assert that the reaction of a person of a certain ethnic or
linguistic group to an insulting remark must be measured against a different
standard from that applicable to others. Likewise, it would undermine the
principle of individual responsibility if the jury in Bedder were
instructed to fashion a special standard of behaviour against which to measure
the actions of a person with his particular physical disability. Thus, impotent
men are not excused for having a lower provocation threshold than that expected
of ""ordinary"" people but rather are measured against the standard of
an ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted. The objective
standard applies to mental states rather than to attributes which simply go to
placing the insult in its proper context. Accordingly, the most appropriate
formulation of the objective standard in the first stage of the provocation
defence is that of the ordinary person similarly situated and similarly
insulted. The jury must be instructed to put themselves, as the embodiment of
the ordinary person, in the accused's shoes to the extent that they perceive
themselves as confronted with a remark that has the same insulting effect on
them as the actual remark had on the accused. 

 

72.              This formulation, it will be noted,
represents a modified version of the Camplin rule. As indicated earlier,
Lord Diplock allowed the age of the accused to be incorporated as an attribute
of the ""ordinary person"" not only for the purpose of giving the
insult context but also for the purpose of establishing the standard of self‑control
against which the youthful defendant should be measured. He specifically
formulated this exception to the objective standard as an excuse premised on
the sympathy which the courts must show for an accused who cannot meet the
requisite standard of self‑control when the usual objective standard is
applied. In Lord Diplock's reknowned phraseology (at p. 717): ""But to
require old heads upon young shoulders is inconsistent with the law's
compassion to human infirmity...."" It is evident that this reasoning
cannot be stated as a universally applicable principle since the special
treatment accorded an accused who for some reason evokes the court's compassion
necessarily embodies a violation of the underlying principles of equality and
individual responsibility.

 

73.              The respondent in the case at bar urges
that the jury be permitted to take account of both his age and sex in assessing
his reaction to the deceased's unwanted sexual advances. The question to be
addressed, therefore, is whether these are physical factors going to the
context of the insult or factors going to the accused's subjective mental
state.

 

(a) Age

 

74.              I believe the respondent is arguing that
his age is directly related to his mental state in that his response to the
offensive sexual advances was that of an immature person. Thus, in effect, he
is stating that sixteen year olds cannot be held to the same level of self‑control
as can the ""ordinary person"" who is several years older. He is asking
that youthful accused persons be treated unequally and not be held responsible
for their actions in the same way as older accused persons. Is there any reason
in policy or principle to except age from the foregoing analysis and permit the
youth of an accused to govern the standard of self‑control expected of
him or her? 

 

75.              The policy of the law seems to be somewhat
equivocal on this question. Age is identified as a prohibited ground of
discrimination in s. 15  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
evidencing that in some fundamental sense persons of all ages enjoy the same
legal rights and have assumed the same legal responsibilities in society. On
the other hand, the legal system has traditionally differentiated between
children and adults to the extent that children may be denied the right to
vote, to drink alcoholic beverages, etc. Indeed, this Court has held that the
right to equality before the law in the Canadian Bill of Rights is not
violated by different penalties for criminal offences being imposed on youthful
offenders from those imposed on their adult counterparts: R. v. Burnshine,
[1975] 1 S.C.R. 693. This position may be contrasted with the interpretation
given to equality rights in R. v. Drybones, [1970] S.C.R. 282, where it
was held that such differentiations are impermissible as between different
ethnic groups.

 

76.              This legal recognition of only partial
rights and responsibilities invested in children is usually found in
legislation and can often be attributed to policy considerations designed to
ensure the protection of young people from their own actions and the actions of
others or to protect others from the actions of young people. Such statutory
measures as the prohibition of underage drinking, child labour laws establishing
minimum ages for full‑time employment, and licensing requirements
restricting the operation of motor vehicles to persons over a certain age may
be said to fit into this category. In addition, however, one finds indications
in the law that the attribution of only partial rights to children goes beyond
the legislative policy of the day and represents a principle upon which a great
deal of common law thinking has been based. For example, from very early times
the common law has deemed children as lacking the capacity to contract: Wittingham
v. Hill (1619), Cro. Jac. 494; 79 E.R. 421. Similarly, the standard of care
in negligence has been adjusted so that a child will not be measured against
the same objective standard as an adult: McEllistrum v. Etches, [1956]
S.C.R. 787. Thus, in a variety of different contexts, the law has recognized a
general incapacity in children to act in a fully rational and responsible
manner and has accordingly refrained from the rigorous application to them of
the principles of equality and individual responsibility applied to adults. 

 

77.              Concern over the legal responsibility of
children for their actions has to some extent been addressed by Parliament in
the Young Offenders Act, 1980‑81‑82‑83, (Can.), c.
110. Persons under certain specified ages who are charged with criminal
offences are removed from the usual adjudicative process and dealt with in
specially devised forums. The statute is silent, however, on how children are
to be treated who do not fall within its provisions for special procedures.
Specifically, it does not address the concern the law has always had over
holding young people, who for many purposes are not equal to adults in their
legal rights and responsibilities, to a standard of behaviour which embodies
this precise notion of equality of responsibility. Thus, the fact that some
children are by virtue of this legislation completely removed from the ordinary
processes of criminal justice does not answer the question how the actions of
young people who do come before the ordinary criminal courts are to be
evaluated.

 

78.              In my opinion, if the legal system is to
reflect accurately the view of children as being in the developmental stages en
route to full functioning capacity as adults, the standard against which
children's actions are measured must be such as can logically culminate in the
objective standard of the ordinary person upon their arrival at full adulthood.
In negligence law, for example, whereas an extremely young infant assumes
almost no legal liability for his or her actions (Walmsley v. Humenick, [1954]
2 D.L.R. 232 (B.C.S.C.)), older children are expected to conform to the
standard appropriate for ordinary children of the same age: see Fleming, The
Law of Torts (6th ed. 1983), pp. 107‑08. Accordingly, it has been
determined that the standard of care applicable to children is only partially
objective in that it must be adjusted incrementally in accordance with the age
of the child in question: McHale v. Watson (1966), 115 C.L.R. 199 (Aust.
H.C.) At some point, of course, there must be a cut‑off so that the fully
objective standard of the ordinary person can operate. Until this point is
reached it stands to reason that the reduced legal standard of responsibility
to which children are held is reflected in the semi‑objective standard of
the ordinary thirteen year old, fourteen year old, etc.

 

79.              Applying this reasoning to the case at
bar, the standard of the ordinary person applicable to adults raising the
provocation defence must be adjusted to an incremental scale reflecting the
reduced responsibility of the young accused. The measure of self‑control
properly applicable to the respondent, therefore, is that of the ordinary
sixteen year old. This is not, however, conceptually premised on what Lord
Diplock refers to as the law's ""compassion for human infirmity"" since
such compassion, in my view, finds its proper place only in the sentencing
process. Rather, the incorporation of the accused's age into the objective
""ordinary person"" standard is an attempt to reflect the extent of the
legal rights and responsibilities of children in the legal system. The law
treats all persons as equal members of society and holds them responsible on an
equal basis for their actions except to the extent that they are in a
developmental stage en route to achieving full adulthood and full legal rights
and duties. This process of maturation into fully responsible actors in the
legal system is reflected in the incrementally adjusted measure of legal
responsibility accorded to the actions of youthful accuseds. 

 

(b) Sex

 

80.              The submission based on the sex of the
accused is somewhat different. It is not argued that persons of different sex
should be held to different standards of self‑control. This would clearly
be unacceptable. The submission rather is that the sex of the accused may be
considered for the purpose of putting the wrongful act or insult into context
and, as Lord Diplock expressed it in Camplin, ""assessing the
gravity of the provocation addressed to the accused"". It seems to me that
if the objective test is, as I have concluded, the ""ordinary person""
similarly situated and similarly insulted, then the fact that the victim of the
sexual assault, the accused, is a male and that the attack is a homosexual one
may properly be considered.

 

4. Conclusions

 

81.              (1) In general, particular characteristics
of the individual accused and the circumstances in which the accused is found can
be taken into account in applying the objective ""ordinary person""
test at the first stage of the provocation defence only for the purpose of
placing the wrongful act or insult in its proper context with a view to
assessing its gravity. The underlying principles of equality and individual
responsibility cannot be undermined by importing the accused's subjective level
of self­control into the ""ordinary person"" test set out in s. 215(2) 
of the Criminal Code . The jury must be directed to consider any facts which
make the wrongful act or insult comprehensible to them in the same way as it
was comprehended by the accused and then, having appreciated the factual
context in which the wrongful act or insult took place, must measure the
accused's response to this insult against the objective standard of the
ordinary person similarly situated and similarly insulted.

 

82.              (2) The Ontario Court of Appeal was
correct in identifying the young age of the respondent as a special factor
which can be incorporated into the ""ordinary person"" standard. This
reduction in the standard against which young accused persons are measured
merely reflects the fact that the law does not attribute to individuals in the
developmental stage of their youth the same degree of responsibility as is
attributed to fully adult actors. This developmental process is properly
embodied in an incrementally adjusted formulation of the ""ordinary
person"" test in accordance with the age of the accused. In this way the
basic principles of equality and individual responsibility are embodied in the
test to an extent commensurate with the age and capacities of the accused.

 

83.              (3) The Court of Appeal was also correct
in holding that the sex of the respondent could be considered on the objective
test, not because different standards of self‑control are attributable to
the two sexes, but in order to put the wrongful act or insult into context for
purposes of assessing its gravity. In assessing the reaction of the ordinary
person to a sexual assault it is the ordinary person who is a male subjected to
a homosexual assault which must be considered.

 

84.              In summary, the appropriate formulation of
the objective standard against which the respondent's reaction to the wrongful
act must be measured in this case is the standard of the ordinary sixteen year
old male subjected to a homosexual assault. The jury may well, on the basis of
the judge's charge and having regard to the existing state of the jurisprudence
in Canada, have rejected the respondent's defence because they measured his
conduct against a higher standard. I agree with the Court of Appeal that in
these circumstances the conviction cannot be allowed to stand.

 

85.              I would dismiss the appeal. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

86.              Le
Dain J. (dissenting)‑‑I would dismiss the appeal on
the ground that the youth of the accused was relevant to the consideration by
the jury whether there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to
be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control
and that the trial judge's charge to the jury was calculated to lead the jury
to conclude that they should not consider the age of the accused with reference
to this requirement of s. 215(2)  of the Criminal Code  but only with reference
to the requirement that the accused acted upon the provocation on the sudden
and before there was time for his passion to cool.

 

87.              In my opinion the age of the accused is
relevant in a case such as this to the standard of self‑control of the
ordinary person rather than to the gravity of the provocation. With respect,
this appears to me to have been the view of Lord Diplock in Director of
Public Prosecutions v. Camplin, [1978] A.C. 705. I think this appears
clearly from Lord Diplock's use of the words ""power of self‑control""
and ""standard of self‑control"" in association with the age of
the accused on pp. 717‑18, and particularly from what he said on p. 718
should be the judge's direction to the jury: ""He should then explain to
them that the reasonable man referred to in the question is a person having the
power of self‑control to be expected of an ordinary person of the sex and
age of the accused, but in other respects sharing such of the accused's
characteristics as they think would affect the gravity of the provocation to
him..."". I am content, with great respect, to accept the rationale
or justification suggested by Lord Diplock for regarding the youth of an
accused as relevant to the standard of self‑control of the ordinary
person.

 

88.              I agree, however, with Wilson J. that sex
is not relevant to the standard of self­control of the ordinary person, but it
was obviously relevant in this case to the nature and gravity of the
provocation claimed by the accused. 

 

89.              My colleagues have quoted the relevant
passages in the trial judge's charge to the jury. The critical words for
purposes of the issue in the appeal are those which appear in the direction
with reference to the requirement that the accused must have acted upon the
provocation on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool.
After telling the jury that they must first decide whether the words and acts
""were sufficient to cause an ordinary person to lose his self‑control"",
the trial judge said: ""If you find that they were, you will then secondly
consider whether the accused acted on the provocation on the sudden before
there was time for his passion to cool. In deciding this question you are not
restricted to the standard of the ordinary person. You will take into account
the mental, the emotional, the physical characteristics and the age of this
accused."" With great respect for what the Chief Justice has said with
reference to the common sense of the average jury, I have been unable to avoid
the conclusion that it was a clear implication of this direction that the age of
the accused should not be taken into consideration in deciding whether there
had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be sufficient to
deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control. The further
reference to age in a later passage of the charge (which, because of what
preceded it, must be regarded as also related to the requirement that the
accused must have acted upon the provocation on the sudden and before there was
time for his passion to cool), could only serve to reinforce this impression,
or at the very least to leave the jury with some confusion as to the relevance
of age. This in my opinion is sufficient for the disposition of the appeal. It
is one thing to consider whether the trial judge was required to make any
reference to the relevance of the age of the accused in his charge to the jury;
it is another thing to consider whether the reference which he did in fact make
was misleading.

 

90.              As to what, if anything, the trial judge
was required to say concerning the age and sex of the accused, I am inclined on
the whole to agree with the Chief Justice, with some reservation concerning the
question of age. The sex of the accused and its relevance to the gravity of the
provocation claimed were, of course, obvious and did not require any
observation from the trial judge. The relative youth of the accused would also
presumably be obvious, but its relevance as a matter of law to the question
whether there had been a wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be
sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self‑control
might be less obvious to a jury and should probably have been drawn to their
attention.

 

91.              For these reasons I would dismiss the
appeal.

                   Ciment Québec Inc. obtained from the Provincial Bank
the financing needed to carry on its operation. To thank a Mr. Doyon, the Bank
employee who handled the matter, the president of the company decided to pay
him $3,000 annually for three years. The payments were made through respondent,
a lawyer and son‑in‑law of Doyon, who made up fictitious bills for
fees to the company. Respondent cashed the cheques issued by the company,
deducted a certain amount for income tax purposes and handed the remainder of
the money over to his father‑in‑law. Respondent was charged with
fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, forgery and uttering forged documents and
was acquitted on all the charges by a judge of the Court of Sessions of the
Peace. The appeal by the Crown on the three counts of uttering forged documents
was dismissed.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   Even assuming the bills prepared by respondent are
forged documents within the meaning of s. 326  of the Criminal Code ,
respondent did nothing beyond preparing or conspiring to utter them. Nothing in
the evidence showed that he uttered or dealt with the fictitious bills as
genuine documents. Acts in preparation for uttering do not constitute acts of
uttering.

J.‑‑Jean Valois was charged in Quebec City with a total of
twelve counts, namely, conspiracy to commit fraud, fraud, forgery and uttering
forged documents on the basis of the facts related below. He was acquitted of
all these charges by Lanctôt J. of the Court of Sessions of the Peace. The
Crown appealed the acquittal on only three of the counts, the three counts of
uttering forged documents. Though these three counts referred to three
transactions which occurred on different dates, the charges were essentially
the same, namely

 

[TRANSLATION]  ... knowing
that a document was forged, namely a bill for $3,000 ... addressed to Ciment
Québec Inc., did unlawfully use it as if it were genuine, thereby committing an

Facts

 

2.                Bisson J.A., writing the reasons of the
Court of Appeal, summarized the facts as follows at pp. 168‑69:

 

                    [TRANSLATION] 
Ciment Québec Inc. experienced financial difficulties between 1965 and 1969 as
a result of the lack of working capital of one of its subsidiaries.

 

                    Ciment
Québec Inc. was dealing with the Provincial Bank, and Grégoire Doyon was one of
the latter's managers.

 

                    Grégoire
Doyon took an interest in their file and obtained financing from his bank which
put Ciment Québec back on its feet.

 

                    Gustave
Papillon, the president, directing mind and holder of the vast majority of
shares in Ciment Québec Inc., appreciated Doyon's help and decided to reward
him by paying him $3,000 a year for three years.

 

                    However,
it was preferable not to make the payments directly to Doyon by Ciment Québec,
and it was agreed that they would be made through the respondent, a young
lawyer admitted to the Bar in November 1975, and the son‑in‑law of
Doyon, who made up fictitious bills for fees to Ciment Québec.

 

                    Thus,
$3,000 was paid in each of the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.

 

                    As
respondent had to pay tax on this income, after cashing the cheques he kept
part to cover the additional tax he would have to pay and handed the remainder
over to his father‑in‑law.

 

                    Grégoire
Doyon of course received less than $9,000 as a result of these deductions, a
fact to which, noted the judge, no one raised any objection.

 

                    The
judge made another observation. The payments made to Grégoire Doyon were
legitimate and caused no prejudice to Ciment Québec. In addition, the three
participants were aware of the purpose of the lawyer's bills, and therefore no
one was misled into believing that they were genuine documents.

 

3.                Sections 324(1)  and 326(1)  of the Criminal
Code  are the applicable provisions in the case at bar:

 

                   324. (1) Every one commits forgery who makes a false document, knowing it
to be false, with intent

 

 (a) that it should
in any way be used or acted upon as genuine, to the prejudice of any one
whether within Canada or not, or

 

 (b) that some
person should be induced, by the belief that it is genuine, to do or to refrain
from doing anything, whether within Canada or not.

 

                   326. (1) Every one who, knowing that a document is forged,

 

(a) uses, deals
with, or acts upon it, or

 

(b) causes or
attempts to cause any person to use, deal with, or act upon it,

 

as if the document were
genuine, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for
fourteen years.

 

Judgments

 

4.                The judgment of the Court of Appeal
dealt primarily with the question of whether, to be a forgery within the
meaning of s. 326 of the Code, a document must meet the substantive
requirements of s. 324(1) of the Code, or whether it need only be a
false document in the literal meaning of the word. The essence of the Court of
Appeal's judgment is to be found in the following passage from the reasons of
Bisson J.A., at p. 172:

 

                    [TRANSLATION] 
Appellant wanted us to interpret s. 326  as if it simply read ""false
document"" rather than ""forged document"".

 

                    I
cannot agree with appellant's proposition that simply because a document is
false it constitutes a forged document within the meaning of s. 326 .

 

                    For
the bills to be regarded as forged documents within the meaning of s. 326 , the
evidence must establish all the essential components of s. 324.

 

                    Thus,
although these were false documents which respondent knew to be
false, and which he intended to be acted upon as genuine, there was no proof of
an intention to cause prejudice.

 

                    In the
case at bar, since one of the essential components, namely the
""forged"" document as defined in s. 324 was absent, respondent was
properly acquitted.

 

5.                At trial Lanctôt J., after reviewing R.
v. Keshane (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 542 (Sask. C.A.) and R. v. Paquette
(1977), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 57 (Que. C.A.), rev'd [1979] 2 S.C.R. 168, regarding the
connection between ss. 324  and 326 , said:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
Despite the interest aroused by these two judgments, it is of very little
importance in the case at bar that the false bill has to be regarded as a false
document in the dictionary sense. We in fact know that it was not made to cause
prejudice. It was a false document nevertheless, and the accused was charged
with using it as if it were genuine.

 

                    But
what was the ultimate use of it?

 

                    It is
more realistic to think that this false bill was never used as if it were
genuine. On the contrary, it was used as if it were false. The three parties
principally involved in the matter deliberately decided to have it prepared and
used it as if it were false, not as if it were genuine. In this regard CIMENT
QUEBEC, a body corporate, acted through its representative Papillon.

 

                    Even
if by some stretch of the imagination it were to be regarded as having been
used as genuine, the fact remains that no one was injured by the deception.
Using a forgery as if it were an original assumes someone on whom the deception
is to be practised. There has to be a target. Who were the targets in this
case? ‑‑ the banking authorities? ‑‑ hardly, since with
respect to them the use of the false bill was latent. There was no evidence
that they ever saw the bill. The false bill was never seen by the Revenue
Department either, though the latter benefited from it.

 

                    While
it is true that there is nothing in s. 326  which expressly states that use of a
false document must cause prejudice to someone, the fact remains that someone,
even if not prejudiced, must be a witness to the deception, and it would be an
absurdity for such a witness to be one of the perpetrators of the forgery.

 

                    For
all these reasons, the Court finds that the accused did not make use of the
forgery, and he should be acquitted on all the counts relating to this charge.

 

6.                In my view Lanctôt J. was correct.
Though in different terms, he based his decision to acquit Valois on the counts
of uttering forged documents on the fact that, if indeed the bills were forged
within the meaning of s. 326 , the accused did nothing beyond preparing or
conspiring to utter them, and that there was nothing in the evidence to show
that he began uttering them or that he dealt with or acted upon them as genuine
documents in relation to anyone else.

 

7.                Indeed, the making of forged documents
by Valois (assuming for purposes of argument that these documents were in fact
forged), the fact of putting Mr. Papillon of Ciment Québec into possession, the
cashing and giving the money by the accused to his father‑in‑law in
the manner indicated, certainly all constitute substantive components of a conspiracy
to utter forged documents and to commit the offences on which the other charges
against the accused were based. However, in relation to the crime of uttering
or attempted uttering, these were only acts in preparation for uttering, and in
no way constitute acts of uttering or even incipient uttering. The accused, his
father‑in‑law and Papillon set up all that was necessary to use
these fictitious bills for fees as if they were genuine, if and when that
proved to be necessary. They did not have to do so; at least, the evidence did
not establish that they did. The acquittal by Lanctôt J. is therefore correct
and the appeal should be dismissed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Gaming and betting ‑‑
Charge of keeping a common gaming house ‑‑ Offence not proven ‑‑
Element of wagering absent ‑‑ Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
ss. 179(1), 185, 188(1)(b).

 

                   Appellants were charged with keeping a common gaming
house, contrary to s. 185  of the Criminal Code , after the police
observed on several occasions customers playing scalaforti, an Italian
card game, on the appellants' business premises. The score sheets seized seemed
to indicate that the players bet $10 a game but the trial judge found
otherwise. It was customary, however, for the loser of each game to buy a round
of refreshments. Appellants supplied the players with cards and score sheets
and made their profits from the sale of refreshments. The appellants were
convicted and their appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   Although the Criminal Code  is silent on this
aspect of the offence, wagering is an essential element of gaming. The
prosecution must prove, in addition to the four elements listed in the
definition of a common gaming house in s. 179(1) , that the participants had the
chance of both winning and losing money or money's‑worth. These possible
outcomes must be a result, direct or indirect, of wagering or hazarding a stake
prior to or during the game. In the present case, the element of wagering was
not established as the trial judge found, as a question of fact, that no money
had changed hands among the players. The custom by which the loser of the card
game purchased refreshments for the other participants does not constitute
staking as defined by the common law.

Appeal (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 458, dismissing appellants' appeal from their
convictions for keeping a common gaming house. Appeal allowed.

and Isak Grushka, for the appellants.

 

                   Michael N. Bernstein,
for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                Lamer
J.‑‑The two appellants were convicted by an Ontario
Provincial Court judge in the district of York of keeping a common gaming house
contrary to s. 185  of the Criminal Code . Their appeal to the Ontario
Court of Appeal was dismissed and they were granted leave to appeal at large to
this Court.

 

2.                This case requires an analysis of s.
179(1) of the Code where ""game"" and ""common gaming
house"" are defined and raises the issue whether the exemption of s.
188(1)(b) of the Code can apply to a charge of keeping a common
gaming house.

 

3.                Sections 179  and 185  read as follows:

 

                   179. (1)...

 

""common gaming
house"" means a place that is

 

(a) kept for gain
to which persons resort for the purpose of playing games, or

 

(b) kept or used
for the purpose of playing games

 

(i) in which a bank is
kept by one or more but not all of the players,

 

(ii) in which all or any
portion of the bets on or proceeds from a game is paid, directly or indirectly,
to the keeper of the place,

 

(iii) in which, directly
or indirectly, a fee is charged to or paid by the players for the privilege of
playing or participating in a game or using gaming equipment, or

 

(iv) in which the chances
of winning are not equally favourable to all persons who play the game,
including the person, if any, who conducts the game;

 

""game"" means a
game of chance or mixed chance and skill;

 

                   185. (1) Every one who keeps a common gaming house or common betting house
is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

 

                   (2)
Every one who

 

(a) is found,
without lawful excuse, in a common gaming house or common betting house, or

 

(b) as owner,
landlord, lessor, tenant, occupier or agent, knowingly permits a place to be
let or used for the purposes of a common gaming house or common betting house, 

 

is guilty of an offence
punishable on summary conviction.

 

At the time of the charge s. 188(1)(a) to (c) stated
that:

 

                   188. (1) Sections 185  and 186  do not apply to

 

(a) any person or
association by reason of his or their becoming the custodian or depository of
any money, property or valuable thing staked, to be paid to

 

(i) the winner of a lawful
race, sport, game or exercise,

 

(ii) the owner of a horse
engaged in a lawful race, or

 

(iii) the winner of any
bets between not more than ten individuals;

 

(b) a private bet
between individuals not engaged in any way in the business of betting;

 

(c) bets made or
records of bets made through the agency of a pari‑mutuel system only as
hereinafter in this section provided, upon the race course of an association
during the actual progress of a race meeting conducted by an association upon
running, trotting or pacing horse races being run thereon and if the provisions
of this section and any regulations made thereunder are complied with.

 

The Facts

 

4.                The appellants are husband and wife and
they conduct a business known as ""Corrado Billiards"" in Toronto. On
the business premises there are several pool tables, pinball machines, a
counter at which coffee, soft drinks, candy and cigarettes are sold, and four
tables with sets of chairs at which customers can sit. There are two signs on
the wall which read ""No Gambling"".

 

5.                From November 4, 1980 to January 16,
1981 the premises were frequented by Constable Salvatore LoStracco of the
Metropolitan Toronto Police Force who, on numerous occasions, observed men
seated at the tables playing an Italian card game known as scalaforti.
He further observed score sheets on the table where the game was being played
and witnessed the appellants providing their customers with playing cards and
score sheets. Constable LoStracco testified that scalaforti is a game
that can be played for money or merely for amusement. After analysing the score
sheets, he was of the opinion, but could not confirm the fact, that the players
were betting $10 a game with a $2 penalty levied against any player who went
over a set number of points.

 

6.                On January 16, 1981 Constable LoStracco,
along with others from the Metropolitan Toronto Police Force, entered the
premises with a search warrant and seized decks of cards and score sheets from
each of the four tables. The appellants were arrested and charged with keeping
a common gaming house and a common betting house contrary to ss. 185  and 186  of
the Criminal Code . 

 

The Judgments

 

Provincial Court

 

7.                Parker J. found that there was no
betting taking place on the premises and as such, he acquitted the accused on
the count of keeping a common betting house. The Crown did not appeal this
verdict. The trial judge also found that although no money had changed hands
among the players, the card games described included elements of both chance
and skill; and that the premises on which these games were played were kept by
the accused for gain in the sense that they profited from the sale of
refreshments to the players. He concluded that once the element of chance is
found, gaming is proved; and that the accused as keepers of the premises were
therefore guilty of keeping a common gaming house.

 

Ontario Court of Appeal

 

8.                The accused appealed their convictions
for keeping a common gaming house. Martin J.A., in a unanimous judgment, found
that both accused kept the place for gain: (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 458. Unlike
the trial judge, he said that the elements of skill and chance were not
sufficient to constitute the offence of gaming. According to Martin J.A., wagering
is an essential element of gaming and there must be proof that money or money's‑worth
was exchanged among the players in order to sustain a conviction. In support of
this proposition Martin J.A. referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario in R. v. Irwin (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 212, where Goodman J.A.,
speaking for Martin and Cory JJ.A., stated at p. 225:

 

It is not sufficient for
the prosecution to prove only the elements required by the plain and literal
meaning of the words of ss. 179(1)  and 185(1)  of the Criminal Code  in
order to obtain a conviction under s. 185(1) , in the absence of proof of facts
bringing into play the conclusive presumption provided for by s. 180(2) . The
prosecution must also prove that the participants in the game or operators of
the game have a chance of both winning and losing money or money's‑worth
by participating in a game of chance or mixed chance and skill.

 

9.                Martin J.A. went on to say that the
practice by which the loser would purchase refreshments for the others
constituted such an exchange and, therefore, the element of wagering on the
game of chance and skill was established. He stated, at p. 465: 

 

                   It is
clear, however, from the evidence of the appellant Corrado Di Pietro that it
was the custom for the loser of the game to pay for the drinks and scores were
kept for determining who was the loser. Thus, the participants in the game had
a chance of winning and losing money or money's‑worth, which suffices to
supply the necessary element of gaming. The minimal nature of the stakes, no
doubt, goes to the seriousness of the offence, but all the elements of the
offence were present.

 

He indicated that it did not matter that there was no evidence that the
appellants charged a fee for the use of the cards or the tables. He pointed to
s. 180(1)(b) of the Code which provides that, in the absence of
evidence to the contrary, the fact that a place is found to be equipped with
gaming equipment is proof that the place is a common gaming house. When coupled
with the fact that the cards and score sheets provided by the appellants were
in fact used for gaming, this evidence was held to be sufficient to uphold the
conviction and Martin J.A. dismissed the appeal.

 

Issue

 

10.              In their factum before this Court the
appellants stated that the issue on appeal was whether the courts below had
erred in law in failing to apply the exemption in s. 188(1)(b) of the Code
on the facts as found in this case. Notwithstanding this statement, they also
argued that the finding by the trial judge that gaming took place was in error.
After a review of the relevant caselaw on gaming, the appellants argued that
staking is an essential element of gaming and they claimed that the facts of
the case at bar did not indicate that the players were at risk of winning or
losing money or money's‑worth. Furthermore, even if they were, the amount
wagered, the price of a cup of coffee, was too unsubstantial to constitute a
real stake:

 

                   In the
case at bar the practice was for the loser to pay for the winner's or winners'
coffee. There would be at least one winner and one loser, and depending upon
the score in the game and the rules agreed upon by the players, there could be
one winner and three losers or possibly one loser and three winners.

 

                   Does
the agreement between the players that the loser was to treat the winner or
winners constitute the place a common gaming house? In any event the proprietor
of the establishment will sell only four coffees no matter who pays for the
coffee. Is it incumbent upon the vendors of the coffees to inquire of the
purchaser as to the nature of the agreement between the players where one
player proposes to treat the other players? Were the players at risk of losing
in the sense they were obliged to hazard a stake on their part? Are the coffees
a stake or a prize in the game? If the answer is ""yes"" that the
coffees are a stake or prize it is submitted that it is not a `valuable thing'
and that the possibility of winning a free coffee `was too unsubstantial in
nature to constitute a real stake or prize' and that following R. v. Wilkes,
supra, and R. v. Zippilli (1980), 54 CCC (2d) 481, the premises
in question were not a common gaming house. 

 

It was not until after they raised these important questions that the
appellants commenced their argument with regard to the application of the
exemption found in s. 188(1)(b) of the Code:

 

But even if this
Honourable Court were to decide that the coffee was a real stake and to follow
the reasons of Mr. Justice Martin in Di Pietro that the minimal nature
of the stakes, no doubt, goes to the seriousness of the offence, but all the
elements of the offence were present, it would still be left with the exemption
in s. 188(1) (b) of the Criminal Code .

 

11.              I would allow this appeal on the
preliminary issue raised by the appellants, namely that no gaming occurred at
Corrado Billiards. While Martin J.A. was, in my respectful view, correct in
stating that a necessary element of the offence of gaming was the chance that
the participants could stand to win or lose money or money's‑worth, I
cannot agree with his characterization of the custom by which the loser pays
for the drinks as meeting that requirement.

 

12.              As this case can be disposed of without a
discussion of the applicability of s. 188(1)(b) of the Code, I
will not advance a concluded opinion on that issue. The courts below did not
address it and without the benefit of their reasoning I would prefer to leave
the resolution of this issue for another day. At the hearing in this Court,
both parties argued their case on the assumption that the ""private
bet"" exemption found in s. 188(1)(b) of the Code does apply
to a charge of keeping a common gaming house, their disagreement being as
regards the success of its application to the facts of the case at bar.

 

13.              The Court subsequently invited counsel to
address in writing the issue whether the exemption of s. 188(1) (b)
applied to a charge of keeping a common gaming house and whether a wager by a
participant in a game is a bet, as that term is meant in s. 188(1) (b).
In written submissions both parties answered in the affirmative. Because of
this request by the Court, I feel that, as a matter of courtesy, I should give
some indication as to why I welcome another ground upon which I can dispose of
this appeal. Indeed, despite the Crown's concession, the criteria advanced by
the Crown for the exemption to succeed are such that the exemption could never
have any practical application to a gaming house. After an extensive review of
the legislative history of the gaming laws and of the exemption, one might
seriously question whether Parliament ever intended the exemption to apply to a
charge of keeping a common gaming house. 

 

14.              Furthermore, in order for the private bet
exemption to apply, the wagers by the players would have to be considered as
bets. This would blur the distinction between a betting and a gaming house.
While I cannot visualize the exemption ever inuring to the benefit of an
alleged keeper of a gaming house, I am concerned that, accepting that a wager
by a participant in a game is a bet, as that term is meant in the definition of
a betting house, would result in the further incrimination of gaming houses
which are otherwise lawful. For example, while the mere keeping of a place for the
purpose of playing games does not constitute the offence of keeping a common
gaming house without proof of one of the additional elements found in subparas.
(i) to (iv) of the definition of a gaming house, such behaviour would nearly
always be punishable as keeping a common betting house! For these and other
reasons I need not set out here, I think it preferable that this Court not make
any definite pronouncement in the case as regards the availability of the
exemption of s. 188(1) (b) to a charge of keeping a gaming house, nor as
to whether a wager by a participant in a game is a bet. Now to address the
other issue.

 

15.              Section 185(1) of the Code makes it
an offence to keep a common gaming house. According to the definition of a common
gaming house found in s. 179(1) , the constituent elements of the offence, are:

 

1.                keeping a place;

 

2.                for gain;

 

3.                resorted to by persons for the purpose of
playing games;

 

4.                which games are games of chance or mixed chance
and skill.

 

The first two elements of the offence are present as the appellants
admitted that they are the proprietors of Corrado Billiards and that they
profit from this undertaking. In assessing whether or not games were being
played on the premises, in other words, whether the third and fourth criteria
of the offence have been met, I agree with Goodman J.A. in his judgment in R.
v. Irwin, supra, where he stated, at pp. 218‑19, that: 

 

                   There
is ... a substantial body of Canadian and English judicial authority to the
effect that, in addition to the [four] elements listed above, the prosecution
must establish that `gaming' took place in the sense of `wagering' on the part
of the participants in a game either between the players themselves or the
players and the person conducting or operating the game so that the
participants in or operator of the game may win or lose money or money's‑worth
depending on the outcome of the game of chance or mixed chance and skill.

 

16.              Although the Criminal Code  is
silent as to the necessity of wagering on the outcome of the game by the
players thereof in order to establish that gaming did take place, it has long
been recognized by the common law that this is an essential element of gaming.
As the early English statutes did not contain definitions of ""gaming""
and ""common gaming house"" the courts defined ""gaming"" as
""playing a game for stakes hazarded by the players"" (Eddy &
Loewe, The New Law of Betting and Gaming (2nd ed. 1964)). For example,
in R. v. Ashton (1852), 1 E. & B. 286, Lord Camp‑
bell C.J., with whom Coleridge, Wightman and Erle JJ. concurred,
stated at p. 289:

 

The object of the statute
was to prevent the contracting of bad habits by the practice of games, where
money was staked, in public‑houses: if money were staked, that would
be gaming; and then there might be a lawful conviction for allowing gaming
in the house.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

In 1903, in the case of Lockwood v. Cooper, [1903] 2 K.B. 428,
Lord Alverstone C.J., speaking for Wills and Channell JJ., stated, at p. 431:

 

To amount to gaming the
game played must involve the element of wagering‑‑that is to say,
each of the players must have a chance of losing as well as of winning. To hold
otherwise would be an unjustifiable straining of the Act.

 

That decision was referred to with approval by the English Court of
Appeal in Ellesmere (Earl) v. Wallace, [1929] 2 Ch. 1, where the Master
of the Rolls, Lord Hanworth, stated at p. 28, that:

 

...the interpretation to
be given to `gaming' must be one that involves wagering or betting.

 

In 1930, in R. v. Wilkes (1930), 55 C.C.C. 1, the Ontario Court
of Appeal followed the English courts and acknowledged that wagering was a
necessary element of the offence of gaming.

 

17.              The decision in Wilkes involved the
interpretation of s. 226 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, whose
definition of a common gaming house is substantially the same as the present
definition found in s. 179(1) of the Code. As stated by Goodman J.A. at
p. 221 of the report of his judgment in R. v. Irwin, supra, the Wilkes
decision ""was clearly based on common law principles applicable to the
meaning of the words `gaming' and `common gaming houses' "". 

 

18.              When Wilkes was adopted by this Court
in Roberts v. The King, [1931] S.C.R. 417, it became evident that in
Canada, as in the United Kingdom, the element of wagering constituted part of
the offence of gaming notwithstanding the silence of the Criminal Code 
as regards this element.

 

19.              In 1960, the Parliament of the United
Kingdom codified the common law definition of gaming in its enactment of s.
28(1) of the Betting and Gaming Act, 1960 (U.K.), c. 60. That provision
stated that:

 

‘gaming’ means the playing
of a game of chance for winnings in money or money's‑worth.

 

20.              The case of McCollom v. Wrightson,
[1968] A.C. 522, dealt with that statutory provision, renumbered as s. 55(1) in
the statute of 1963. The House of Lords, in a unanimous decision, was of the
view that the codification did not alter the existing common law. Lord Hodson,
speaking for the rest of the Law Lords said at p. 528:

 

                   I am in
entire agreement with the Lord Chief Justice and with Widgery and Waller JJ.,
the other members of the Divisional Court, that the introduction of the word
`winnings' first in the Act of 1960 and then in the Act of 1963 has done
nothing directly or by inference to alter the law as it previously existed,
namely that `gaming' only takes place where there is the chance not only of
winning but of losing; in other words where some stake has been hazarded.

 

21.              Thus the McCollom case, even though
dealing with the U.K. statute, is still a relevant reference for us in Canada.

 

22.              The facts in that case are analogous to
those in the case at bar, at least when one takes the facts as found by the
trial judge as regards the absence of wagering of money at Corrado Billiards.
The accused in McCollom advertised in local newspapers that there would
be free games of bingo on Sundays. On three separate occasions members of the
public did actually play bingo on the premises. No charge was made for cards;
no stakes were hazarded by the participants; the distribution of the cards was
not related to the purchase of drink, and the prizes were provided by
management. 

 

23.              In the McCollom decision, the only
issue that needed to be decided was whether the participants were gaming.

 

24.              Lord Hodson, with whom Lords Reid, Morris
of Borth‑Y‑Gest, Pearce and Upjohn agreed, found that there was no
gaming. As there were no stakes being hazarded it was found that the
participants did not have a chance of winning or losing money or money's‑worth.
Lord Hodson said, at pp. 528‑29:

 

...in no sense can it
properly be said here that by buying drinks or in some other way those who
attended the parties purchased anything so as to be indirectly putting up any
stake in connection with the bingo playing. By being attracted to the hotel no
doubt they were induced to buy drinks but in no sense were they contributing to
the prizes even if they bought drinks before play began. Moreover, there was,
as Widgery J. pointed out, an express finding by the justices in the case
stated that the distribution of tickets in the alleged gaming was not dependent
upon or in any way related to the purchase of drink or anything else.

 

And then, in conclusion, at p. 529, he said:

 

                   It
would be necessary in order to make an indirect benefit to the donor of a prize
equivalent to a stake in the game that a contribution should be made or
proffered before gaming begins. After the prize is won, money spent, which
finds its way into the pockets of the donor of the prize, does not
automatically become equivalent to a stake.

 

25.              Goodman J.A., in R. v. Irwin, supra,
cites McCollom at length and then states, at pp. 224‑25 that:

 

                   It is
significant that the accused in the McCollom case was acquitted
notwithstanding the fact that it was clear that the players were playing a game
of chance for winnings in money or money's‑worth in accordance with the
plain wording of the definition of ‘gaming’ contained in s. 55(1) of the Act of
1963. The decision rests on the basis that the players were not at risk of
losing in the sense that they were not obliged to hazard any stake on their
part. In my view, the fact that the definition of ‘game’ in s. 179(1)  of
the Criminal Code  does not include the modifying words ‘for winnings in
money or money's‑worth’ does not render inapplicable the decision of the
House of Lords in McCollom to the offence of keeping a common gaming
house as set forth in the provision of the Criminal Code . It seems clear
its decision would have been the same even if those words had not been included
in s. 55(1) .

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

26.              I agree with Goodman J.A. that the McCollom
decision and the previous common law authorities should aid in interpreting s.
179(1) of the Code. The prosecution must prove, as an element of the
offence of gaming, that the participants had the chance of both winning and
losing money or money's‑worth. These possible outcomes must be a result,
direct or indirect, of wagering or hazarding a stake prior to or during the
game. 

 

27.              I now turn to the facts of the case at
hand.

 

28.              Given Judge Parker's findings of fact that
no wagering took place at Corrado Billiards, the only fact upon which a finding
of gaming can rest is Di Pietro's admission that it was customary for the
loser to pay for the drinks. Martin J.A. was of the opinion that that custom
was sufficient to fulfil the requirements laid down by Goodman J.A. in R. v.
Irwin, supra, of having a chance to win money or money's‑worth.

 

29.              The custom at Corrado Billiards for the
loser of the games of scalaforti to purchase drinks at the end of the
evening for the other participants of the games would not, in my view, be
sufficient to constitute staking as defined by the common law. The trial judge
found, as a question of fact, that no money changed hands among the players.
They were not ""putting up a stake"" on the outcome of the game, but
had merely, in a sense, found a convenient way for taking turns at who would
purchase drinks which they would normally consume as part of the evening's
amusement. The winners were not eligible to win any sort of prize, as the cups
of coffee that were being consumed on the premises as part of the evening's
entertainment would not qualify as such. The fact that someone else might pay
for the coffee was not, in my respectful view, an indication that the
participants were winning money or money's‑worth. People did not go to
the Di Pietro's to win drinks but to play cards. Playing cards was not a means
to an end, winning money or money's‑worth, but an end in itself. The
whole evening of playing cards was more in the nature of amusement than in the
nature of betting and gaming as defined by the common law and by the Criminal
Code . I would therefore allow the appeal and enter an acquittal.

version of the judgment delivered by 

 

1.                The Court‑‑
After a trial before a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace sitting
without a jury, appellant was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to
eighteen years in prison. His appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, but
not unanimously: one of the three judges would have acquitted him. Of the two
judges in the majority, who considered that his appeal should be dismissed, one
rendered his judgment as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Like my brother Montgomery J.A., I am of
the view that appellant had a fair trial. The jury did not believe him.

 

                    I would therefore dismiss the
appeal.

 

2.                Did
the judge think this was a trial by jury? Or, realizing that the trier of fact
was a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, did he simply make an error
in describing the trier of fact?

 

3.                The
accused raised this as one of the arguments in support of his appeal to this
Court.

 

4.                We
are all of the view that it is in the interests of the proper administration of
justice that this Court allow the appeal and direct that the appeal of the
accused be heard de novo by the Court of Appeal.

 

5.                In
view of this conclusion, it would be inappropriate for us to rule on the other
arguments made by the accused in this Court. 

 

                   Appeal
allowed and appeal de novo directed.

on appeal from the court of appeal for ontario

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Arrest without warrant ‑‑
Spatial limits ‑‑ Private home ‑‑ Extent of police
power to effect arrest without warrant in private home ‑‑ Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s. 450(1)(a).

 

                   A transit inspector saw two youths in a shopping
centre parking lot opening the driver's door of a truck and trying the doors of
cars. He called the police, gave them a description, and advised that they had
entered an apartment building. Two young men fitting the description were seen
by a constable through an apartment window. The constable stood at the doorway
of the apartment and subsequently tried to effect an arrest inside the
apartment in relation to an attempted car theft. An altercation occurred giving
rise to a charge of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty
contrary to s. 246(1)  of the Criminal Code . Respondent was acquitted, on
a directed verdict subsequently upheld by a majority of the Ontario Court of
Appeal because the arrest was found to be unlawful. At issue was whether a
peace officer, acting pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code ,
can lawfully arrest a person on private premises.








 

                   Held (La Forest J.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson JJ.: If the criteria of s. 450(1)  of the Criminal
Code  and the standards enunciated in Eccles v. Bourque are met, a
police officer can make an arrest on private premises without a warrant in the
execution of his duty for the purposes of s. 450(1) (a). 

 

                   Section 450(1)  of the Criminal Code  does not
alter the common law principles with respect to spatial limits on arrest
without a warrant and the silence of the Code requires that the common
law apply. Eccles v. Bourque was not a case restricted to situations
where a warrant, albeit unendorsed, existed, but rather dealt with the power of
the police to arrest without warrant in private premises. The present case
falls to be decided by application of Eccles v. Bourque, just as Eccles
v. Bourque, on the view of the Court at that time, fell within the four
corners of the old common law authorities. The policy underlying the cases,
both older and more recent, is clear and compelling: there should be no place
which gives an offender sanctuary from arrest. Although the Criminal Code 
provides for warrants for the search of things, it does not provide for
the search of persons. Absent the power of police to arrest on private
premises, a criminal offender might therefore find complete and permanent
protection from the law in a private home.

 

                   Parliament took for granted the common law power of
forcible entry to effect an arrest. While the courts can decline to confer new
common law powers intruding on civil liberties‑‑and this Court has
been cautious in conferring those powers‑‑it is quite another thing
for the Court to abrogate powers recognized by the courts, particularly when
those powers descend from entrenched authorities of the 17th century.

 

                   The right of entry to search for an offender is not
unrestricted. This Court held in Eccles v. Bourque that entry could only
be made against the will of a householder if: (1) there were reasonable and
probable grounds for the belief that the person sought was within the premises,
and (2) if proper announcement was made prior to entry. Proper announcement
would ordinarily entail the police giving (i) notice of presence, (ii) notice
of authority by identifying themselves as police officers, and (iii) notice of
purpose by stating lawful reasons for entry. These requirements minimize the
invasiveness of arrest in a dwelling and permit the offender to maintain his
dignity and privacy by walking to the doorway and surrendering himself.

 

                   There is good reason to stand by the common law
authorities in lieu of adopting a new rule requiring the police to obtain an
arrest warrant in order to make an arrest in residential premises. If a police
officer is forced to obtain an arrest warrant before entering a residence, he
will first have to attempt to obtain the name of the offender from the
neighbours. In many cases the neighbours will be unable to supply this
information. Even if he obtains the offender's name, the police officer will
then have to seek a justice of the peace to execute a warrant. Valuable time‑‑and
probably the offender‑‑will be lost. 

 

                   The specific concerns relating to arrests within a dwelling
are met as fully as they can be, without unduly impinging an effective crime
control, by the special requirements imposed on peace officers who must make
arrests in a house or apartment.

 

                   An affirmative answer to all of the following
questions means the arrest is lawful:

 

(1)               Is
the offence in question indictable?

 

(2)               Has
the person who is the subject of arrest committed the offence or does the peace
officer believe on reasonable and probable grounds that that person has
committed or is about to commit the offence in question?

 

(3)               Are
there reasonable and probable grounds for belief that the person sought is
within the premises?

 

(4)               Was
proper announcement made before entry?

 

                   This case arose before the Charter was in
effect. Furthermore, no determination was made on the nature and scope of the
spatial limits of arrest without warrant under any section or subsection other
than s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey and
McIntyre JJ.: The ancient principle in Semayne's Case, ""That the
house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his
defence against injury and violence, as for his repose"", must yield to the
legitimate requirements of law enforcement. Eccles v. Bourque
established that a peace officer has authority at common law to enter private
premises to effect an arrest without warrant pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code . The Court required that the peace officer must have
reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an indictable offence has been
or is about to be committed and that the person sought is on the private
premises, and must make a proper announcement of his presence and purpose
before entering.

 

                   Per Le Dain J.: The
authority of a police officer to enter private premises without the consent of
the occupant in order to effect an arrest without warrant was affirmed, with
the conditions on which it may be exercised, in Eccles v. Bourque and there
are sound reasons for adhering to that decision. Notwithstanding concurrence
with Dickson C.J., the distinction drawn by him with reference to the judgments
of the majority in Wiretap Reference, Lyons v. The Queen and Dedman
v. The Queen, was not necessarily subscribed to. 

 

                   Per La Forest J., dissenting:
The principle that a man's home is his castle along with the demonstrably
justifiable exceptions developed under the old common law have constituted an
excellent balance between the security and privacy of the individual and the
needs of law enforcement since their enunciation in Semayne's Case. If
Parliament finds it necessary to adjust the balance, it can do so. It is in a
far better position to provide for the precise balance than the courts.

 

                   At common law, the better view has been until
recently that entry into private dwellings without a warrant was not permitted
to effect an arrest apart from hot pursuit and some narrow exceptions to
prevent the commission of an offence. Although the police power was extended to
include going on private property, other than dwellings, in the exercise of
their duty to preserve the peace and to conduct investigations into crimes, no
significant change in the common law right of a policeman to enter a home took
place until Eccles v. Bourque.

 

                   Eccles v. Bourque
constituted an extension of the law by ignoring some of the requirements for
the arrest of a person against whom a warrant has been issued. But these in the
context may have been looked upon by the Court as technical omissions. Eccles
v. Bourque simply gave a restricted power to police officers to enter a
person's home when they reasonably believe a person for whom a warrant of
arrest has been issued is there. It should not be broadly interpreted so as to
authorize entry into a dwelling whenever the police believe on reasonable
grounds that a person has committed an offence and that he is in that dwelling.
They should obtain a warrant to permit them to do so.

 

                   Apart from flagrant abuses, the courts cannot exercise
much control over police discretion to arrest. So far as arrests in public
places are concerned, the police' job of maintaining the peace and enforcing
the criminal law is difficult enough without fearing about being regularly
""second guessed"" about every mistake of judgment. Apart from the
compelling exceptions allowed by the common law, it is not reasonable for a
policeman to be permitted to enter a private home without consent unless he has
a warrant authorizing him to do so. Invasion of a person's home, in
circumstances like these, is too high a price to pay to prevent the possible
escape of some criminals, especially for non‑violent crimes. 

 

                   Allowing arrest without warrant on private premises
has serious disadvantages: not only is the owner's security and privacy
invaded, violence can result. Again notwithstanding reasonable and probable
belief on the part of police that an offence has occurred, no offence may have
been committed at all. Since it is essential for police to have the support of
the community, it would be unwise to place them in a situation where they are
called upon to breach the sanctity of the home in such circumstances. Moreover,
the grant of such a vague discretion is more likely to be used against the
economically or socially disadvantaged.

 

                   The grant of wide, vague and virtually
uncontrollable discretion to the police here would create a greater danger to
the sanctity of the home than the danger that criminals would otherwise escape.
It would amount to giving the police an almost unfettered discretion to break
into a home by day or night whenever they seriously suspect an indictable
offence has been committed and that the perpetrator is there. It is highly
unlikely that a house would become a permanent sanctuary for a criminal because
of the want of search warrants for persons, as opposed to things. Parliament,
however, can provide for search warrants for people if it thinks this
desirable. Finally, good police work can easily overcome resultant problems in
most cases. It is doubtful that law enforcement has suffered because the police
have not been authorized, the narrow common law exceptions apart, to enter a
private home. On the other hand, on the basis of limited experience with
entries into homes without warrant, mistakes are inevitable.

 

                   The police need the clearest possible rules in
situations like the present. The current rule is clear: absent well recognized
and widely supported exceptions, the police may not enter private homes. Their
authority ends at the door.

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Chouinard, Lamer
and Wilson JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑This is an appeal from the Court of Appeal of
Ontario which dismissed an appeal from a directed verdict at trial. The issue
is whether a peace officer, acting pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code , can lawfully arrest a person on private premises.

 

Facts

 

2.                Paul Landry was charged with assaulting
a peace officer engaged in the execution of his duty, contrary to s. 246(1)  of
the Criminal Code . The following summary of the facts is based on the
testimony of the witnesses. No findings of fact were made at trial as the trial
judge directed a verdict of acquittal.

 

3.                On the evening of April 20, 1980 a
public transit inspector observed two youths opening the driver's side of a
parked truck and then trying to open car doors in a parking lot at the back of
a shopping centre. He called the police on his radio. When the police arrived
he gave them descriptions of the youths and advised them that he had seen the
youths enter an apartment building. One of the police officers, Constable
Handy, went to the front of the apartment building.

 

4.                Constable Handy testified that as he
approached the front door of the apartment building, he looked through the
window of the basement apartment and saw two male persons who matched the description
given to him by the transit inspector. He entered the building and walked down
the stairs to the basement apartment. According to his testimony, the door to
the apartment was open. The testimony of Landry and MacLaren (the second youth)
differs from that of Constable Handy on this point. Landry testified that the
door was closed and the officer knocked on it. Similarly, MacLaren testified
that the officer knocked on the door and the door was answered by Landry. It is
clear from the testimony of all three parties that Constable Handy stood in the
doorway of the apartment and asked Landry if he lived there. Constable Handy
testified that Landry replied in an offensive manner. 

 

5.                Constable Handy was in uniform at the
time. He testified that he told the two youths they were under arrest for
investigation of attempted auto theft. MacLaren testified that, initially,
Constable Handy said only ""you are under arrest"" and did not state
why until asked by MacLaren. Landry then indicated he did not want to go to the
police station and both youths stated they had not done anything. Constable
Handy walked into the room and stood quite close to them. When MacLaren took
some steps toward the open door, Constable Handy took physical control of him
by holding the sleeve of his jacket. Landry repeated several times that he was
not going anywhere, so Constable Handy grabbed him with the other hand. An
altercation ensued which gave rise to the present charge.

Judgments

 

(a) Trial

 

6.                Following the hearing of the evidence
and legal argument, the County Court judge ruled that an arrest without a
warrant in the home of the accused was unlawful, except in circumstances of hot
pursuit. Accordingly, he instructed the jury to return a verdict of not guilty,
and concluded:

 

...I have come to the
conclusion, based on the existing law, that when officer Handy entered the
home, the apartment, without permission and without a warrant, he was not in
the execution of his duty. He was exceeding his powers. He was exceeding his
right and therefore the accused had a right to resist and that, as you can see,
removes all necessity of making findings of fact as to who did what, who
started, what kind of force was used and so on.

 

                   The
plain fact of the matter is that the arrest was not lawful. It is not say that
the officer acted wrongly in a general sense, but in the legal sense, if he did
not have a warrant the arrest was not a lawful arrest and I must direct you
that it was unlawful and if it was unlawful the accused was not committing an
offence when he resisted.

 

Landry was accordingly acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace
officer in the execution of his duty.

 

(b) Court of Appeal

 

7.                The Crown appealed the decision of the
County Court and the appeal was dismissed by a majority in the Ontario Court of
Appeal. Houlden J.A., with Thorson J.A. concurring, found that, though s.
450(1)(a) of the Criminel Code empowers a peace officer to arrest
without warrant a person whom he believes, on reasonable and probable grounds,
has committed an indictable offence, there are certain spatial limits on this
power, imposed by common law and preserved by s. 7 of the Criminel Code.
According to the majority, there is no common law authority to render lawful an
arrest by a police officer without a warrant on private premises when the
officer enters the premises without permission. In the present case, Constable
Handy entered the premises without permission or even acquiescence. He was,
therefore, not in the execution of his duty. 

 

8.                Jessup J.A. would have allowed the
appeal. He found that at common law a citizen could deny entry to his home to a
peace officer without warrant and use any requisite force in doing so. If
Constable Handy was a trespasser, he would have been acting unlawfully at the
time of the arrest and, thus, could not be said to be in the execution of his
duty. On the facts, however, Jessup J.A. found that Constable Handy was not a
trespasser, but that he entered the apartment as a licensee. Though the assault
by Landry may have amounted to a retraction of the licence, by the time of the
assault the officer was in the execution of his duty.

 

                                                                   III

 

The Law

 

(a) Criminal Code 

 

9.                The power of a peace officer to arrest
without a warrant for an indictable offence is found in s. 450(1)  of the Criminal
Code :

 

                   450. (1) A peace officer may arrest without warrant 

 

(a) a person who
has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable and probable grounds,
he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence,

 

(b) a person whom
he finds committing a criminal offence, or

 

(c) a person for
whose arrest he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that a warrant
is in force within the territorial jurisdiction in which the person is found.

 

The Ontario Court of Appeal was unanimous in finding that it would have
been open to a jury to conclude that Constable Handy had reasonable and
probable grounds to believe Landry and MacLaren had committed the indictable
offence of attempted theft for the purpose of s. 450(1) (a).

 

10.              What must be determined, however, is
whether, assuming that Constable Handy had reasonable and probable grounds,
there were any spatial limits on his power to arrest. Section 450(1) (a)
is silent on the matter of whether an arrest without a warrant is lawful on
private premises, and there are no other provisions which provide express
statutory authority on this matter. 

 

11.              I agree with Jessup J.A. in the Court of
Appeal that s. 450(1)  should not be taken to alter the common law principles
with respect to spatial limits on arrest without a warrant and that the silence
of the Code on this matter requires that we turn to the common law for
direction. As the Court stated in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R.
739, at p. 742, ""If they [the police constables] were authorized by law to
commit a trespass, the authority for it must be found in the common law for
there is nothing in the Criminal Code "".

 

(b) Eccles v. Bourque and Recent Related Cases

 

12.              Eccles v. Bourque though a civil
case, dealt with the powers of arrest without a warrant on private premises.
The case arose out of a claim by the appellant against three constables on the
Vancouver Police Force for damages for trespass. The constables had entered the
Vancouver apartment of Mr. Eccles in order to apprehend one Edmund Cheese, for
whom there were three outstanding Montreal warrants of arrest. These warrants
had not been endorsed in the Province of British Columbia. Furthermore, they
were not search warrants and, therefore, they did not provide a right to enter
premises. Cheese was not found in the apartment and the trial judge concluded
that either he had not been there, or he had successfully escaped just prior to
the arrival of the police officers. The trial judge awarded $300 damages and
costs. The judgment was reversed by a majority (Robertson and Taggart JJ.A.,
with Nemetz J.A. [as he then was] dissenting) of the Court of Appeal of British
Columbia.

 

13.              This Court was unanimous in dismissing the
appeal. Since the Montreal warrants had not been endorsed in the province of
British Columbia, pursuant to s. 461  of the Criminal Code , s. 450(1) (a)
was applied. The Court held that, had Cheese been found and arrested, the
requirements of s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  would have been
met (at pp. 741‑42):

 

There were reasonable and
probable grounds for believing that Cheese had committed a criminal offence and
had the respondents found him in the apartment or elsewhere there is no doubt
they would have been authorized by s. 450(1) (a) to arrest him.

 

Section 450(1) (a) did not, however, provide any guidance on the
question of whether a peace officer was justified in committing a trespass in
order to make an arrest, and that was the issue which had to be resolved. It
was thus necessary to turn to the principles of the common law. 

 

14.              The Court summarized the relevant
principles of the common law at pp. 742‑43:

 

For these principles, we
go back to vintage common law, to 1604, and Semayne’s Case, in which the
principle, so firmly entrenched in our jurisprudence, that every man's house is
his castle, was expressed in these words: ""That the house of every one is
to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and
violence, as for his repose ..."". That, then, is the basic principle, as
important today as in Biblical times (Deuteronomy 24:10) or in the 17th
century. But there are occasions when the interest of a private individual in
the security of his house must yield to the public interest, when the public at
large has an interest in the process to be executed. The criminal is not immune
from arrest in his own home nor in the home of one of his friends. So it is
that in Semayne's Case a limitation was put on the ""castle""
concept and the Court resolved that:

 

                   In all
cases when the King is party, the Sheriff (if the doors be not open) may break
the party's house, either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K.'s
process, if otherwise he cannot enter. But before he breaks it, he ought to
signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors ...

 

See also, a century later,
to the same effect, Hale, Pleas of the Crown (1736), 582; Foster, Crown
Law (1762), 320. Thus it will be seen that the broad basic principle of
sanctity of the home is subject to the exception that upon proper demand the
officials of the King may break down doors to arrest.

 

15.              The Court made it clear that the right of
entry in search of an offender was not unrestricted. Entry could be made
against the will of the householder only if (i) there were reasonable and
probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises
and (ii) proper announcement is made prior to entry (at p. 744). With respect
to the latter of these, the Court said (at p. 747):

 

The traditional demand was
""Open in the name of the King"". In the ordinary case police officers,
before forcing entry, should give (i) notice of presence by knocking or ringing
the doorbell, (ii) notice of authority, by identifying themselves as law
enforcement officers and (iii) notice of purpose, by stating a lawful reason
for entry. Minimally they should request admission and have admission denied
although it is recognized there will be occasions on which, for example, to
save someone within the premises from death or injury or to prevent destruction
of evidence or if in hot pursuit notice may not be required.

 

On the facts of Eccles, the requirements were met and the appeal
was dismissed.

 

16.              In Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1
S.C.R. 2, the principles of Eccles were discussed. The appellant was
charged with attempted murder and attempting to cause bodily harm. He had
committed the alleged offences in response to what he deemed to be a wrongful
intrusion onto his property by police officers. The police officers had a
warrant to seize firearms issued under s. 105(1)  of the Criminal Code .
Ritchie J. at p. 9, speaking for the Court, found that ""the authority to
seize specified in that warrant [did not] carry with it the right to enter and
search"", and that ""it would ... be dangerous indeed to hold that the
private rights of the individual to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property
are to be subject to invasion by police officers whenever they can be said to be
acting in the furtherance of the enforcement of any section of the Criminal
Code  although they are not armed with express authority to justify their
action."" 

 

17.              Eccles v. Bourque was distinguished
on the ground that it related only to arrest and not to seizure of goods on
private premises. Ritchie J. said (at pp. 8‑9):

 

The common law principle
has been firmly engrafted in our law since Semayne’s case in 1604 where
it was said ""That the house of everyone is to him as his castle and
fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence, as for his
repose ..."". This famous dictum was cited by my brother Dickson in the
case of Eccles v. Bourque in which he made an extensive review of many
of the relevant authorities. He was there dealing with a case of police
officers entering private property for the purpose of effecting an arrest and
in so doing he made reference to the limitation of the extent of the general
application of Semayne’s case at p. 743 saying:

 

But there are occasions
when the interest of a private individual in the security of his house must
yield to the public interest, when the public at large has an interest in the
process to be executed. The criminal is not immune from arrest in his
own home nor in the home of one of his friends.

 

And later on the same page
he observed:

 

Thus it will be seen that
the broad basic principle of sanctity of the home is subject to the exception
that upon proper demand the officials of the King may break down doors to
arrest.

 

The italics in the last
two quotations are my own.

 

                   This
makes it clear that Mr. Justice Dickson was limiting his remarks to occasions
when the house of the individual is entered against his will by police officers
in search of a fugitive from justice whose arrest they consider to be
justified.

 

18.              Both Ritchie J.'s judgment in Colet
and my judgment in Eccles v. Bourque refer to the exception to the
principle of the sanctity of the home which was approved by this Court in Eccles
v. Bourque as a general limitation which permits the police to enter
forcibly a dwelling‑house in order to effect an arrest. There is no
suggestion whatsoever in either Eccles v. Bourque or Colet that
the power of forcible entry is limited to occasions when a warrant has been
issued. On the contrary, both the facts and the reasoning in Eccles v.
Bourque demonstrate that the case was not treated as a case of arrest with
a warrant. Although there were warrants outstanding for Cheese, the warrants were
not endorsed in British Columbia and were therefore of no legal effect in that
province. The existence of the warrants was thus relevant for one purpose only:
it afforded evidence of the reasonable and probable grounds for the police
officer's belief that Cheese had committed an indictable offence. The Court
expressly referred to s. 450(1) (a) as the source of authority to arrest
Cheese and at no time suggested that s. 450(1) (c) offered any
assistance. The existence of the warrants was not perceived by the Court to be
relevant to the scope of the common law police power of forcible entry to
effect an arrest. 

 

19.              The Court in Eccles v. Bourque did
not consider its decision in that case to be an extension, but rather an
application, of the old common law power first described in an authoritative
manner in Semayne’s Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a, 77 E.R. 194. It is
plain from the excerpt from Eccles v. Bourque at pp. 742‑43,
quoted above, that the Court was simply reaffirming common law principles of
some considerable antiquity. The plain language in Semayne’s Case
authorizes the sheriff, in all cases when the King is a party, ""to break
the party's house ... to arrest him"", if the doors be not open. If this
authority were restricted by the judges to occasions of arrest with a warrant,
one would have expected Lord Coke to have said so in his report of the case. He
did not; this lends support to the view that Semayne’s Case conferred a
power of forcible entry incidental to arrests in general and not just to
arrests with a warrant.

 

20.              The policy underlying the cases, older and
more recent, on this issue, is clear and compelling: there should be no place
which gives an offender sanctuary from arrest. While the Criminal Code 
empowers a justice to issue a warrant, on proper grounds being shown,
authorizing a search for things, there is no power to issue a warrant to
search for a person. If the police did not possess the power to arrest
on private premises, then a criminal offender might find complete and permanent
protection from the law in his or her own home or the home of another.

 

21.              This compelling policy consideration
suggests that Parliament took for granted the common law power of forcible
entry to effect an arrest as originally articulated in Semayne’s Case
and reaffirmed in Eccles v. Bourque. It is one thing for the courts to
decline to confer new common law powers which intrude on civil liberties; it is
another thing altogether to abrogate powers which have already been recognized
by the courts, particularly when, as in the present case, those powers descend
from entrenched authorities of the seventeenth century. This Court has
exhibited a cautious approach to the conferral on the police of new common law
powers or implied statutory powers, although there has been something less than
unanimity amongst the members of the Court on this point: Colet, supra;
the Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697; Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633; and Dedman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2. The
present case is markedly different, however, since it falls to be decided by
application of Eccles v. Bourque, just as Eccles v. Bourque, on
the view of the Court at that time, fell within the four corners of the old
common law authorities. 

 

22.              There is, moreover, good reason to stand
by these authorities in lieu of adopting a new rule requiring the police to
obtain an arrest warrant in order to make an arrest in residential premises.
Crime is often committed adjacent to residential premises. When a police
officer witnesses a crime or appears on the scene shortly thereafter, his
ability to apprehend the offender should not be capable of being foiled by an
offender ducking into a nearby house or apartment building. Our society is more
urban, more mobile, and more anonymous than ever before. If a police officer is
forced to obtain an arrest warrant before entering a residence, he will have to
attempt to obtain the name of the offender from the neighbours. In many cases
the offender may have slipped into someone else's dwelling and the neighbours
will be unable to supply this information. In other cases the offender may
indeed have taken refuge in his own dwelling, but the neighbours may not know
him. Even if the police officer is fortunate enough to obtain the offender's
name, he will have to seek a justice of the peace to execute an arrest warrant.
Valuable time‑‑and probably the offender‑‑will be lost
because, when the police officer finally returns with his warrant, the offender
will have sought refuge elsewhere.

 

23.              These serious limitations against
effective police work and public protection must be balanced against the
intrusiveness of arresting a person in a house or apartment. This intrusiveness
is carefully delineated and restricted by the requirement of reasonable and
probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises,
and the requirements of notice of presence, notice of authority and notice of
purpose. These requirements minimize the invasiveness of arrest in a dwelling
and permit the offender to maintain his dignity and privacy by walking to the
doorway and surrendering himself.

 

24.              The risks associated with arresting on
reasonable and probable grounds, namely, that an innocent person may be
arrested, devolve from the power of arrest itself and not from the place where
the suspect is arrested. Similarly, the risk of increased resistance which is
associated with warrantless arrests derives from the power of arrest without a
warrant and not from the location of the arrest. The specific concerns relating
to arrests within a dwelling are met as fully as they can be, without unduly
impinging on effective crime control, by the special requirements imposed on
peace officers who must make arrests in a house or apartment. 

 

25.              I am unable, in any event, to fathom how a
warrant for arrest can be perceived as a solution to the question of police
authority to trespass incidental to arrest. The warrant is a judicial
authorization to arrest and contains no express power of trespass. The justice
of the peace must be given evidence as to the reasonable and probable grounds
for making an arrest, but hears no evidence as to the likelihood or otherwise
that the offender can be found at any particular location. There is no good
reason, therefore, why the presence or absence of a warrant of arrest should
have any bearing on the right to make an arrest in one particular place or
another.

 

(c) Recent Cases in the House of Lords

 

26.              The respondent has cited two recent House
of Lords cases in support of the proposition that s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  should not be interpreted to allow arrest on private premises. In Morris
v. Beardmore, [1980] 2 All E.R. 753 (H.L.), the accused was charged under
the Road Traffic Act 1972, 1972 (U.K.), c. 20, which provides that where
a person fails to comply with a request for a sample of breath, the constable
may arrest him without a warrant. Following an accident involving the accused,
uniformed police officers arrived at his house and were admitted by the
accused's son. The accused refused to come down from his bedroom to be
interviewed by the officers, and refused to provide a specimen of his breath
when the officers went up to his bedroom. The House of Lords found that the
officers were trespassers and that, in the absence of express provision in the Road
Traffic Act 1972, Parliament did not intend to authorize tortious conduct.
Accordingly, though the Act authorized the making of an arrest without a
warrant, it did not authorize such an arrest on private premises.

 

27.              The decision in Morris v. Beardmore
was confirmed in Finnigan v. Sandiford, [1981] 2 All E.R. 267 (H.L.),
where it was again stated that the Road Traffic Act 1972 did not
authorize police officers to enter private premises, without the permission of
the occupier, for the purpose of effecting an arrest. 

 

28.              The two House of Lords cases do not,
however, provide support for the position advanced by the respondent. The
United Kingdom is in a markedly different position than Canada with respect to
the question of arrest without a warrant on private premises. In the United
Kingdom, the power to make such an arrest is provided by statute. Section 2 of
the Criminal Law Act 1967, 1967 (U.K.), c. 58 provides that:

 

                   2.‑‑...

 

                   (4)
Where a constable, with reasonable cause, suspects that an arrestable offence
has been committed, he may arrest without warrant anyone whom he, with
reasonable cause, suspects to be guilty of the offence.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   (6) For
the purpose of arresting a person under any power conferred by this section a
constable may enter (if need be, by force) and search any place where that
person is or where the constable, with reasonable cause, suspects him to be.

 

29.              It was the explicit statutory demarcation
of the scope of arrest powers on private premises which prevented the House of
Lords from interpreting the Road Traffic Act 1972 as implying a power to
arrest on private premises. The Parliament of the United Kingdom in s. 2 of the
Criminal Law Act 1967 clearly stated that arrest without a warrant could
take place on private premises with respect to ""arrestable offences"".
It followed that arrest without a warrant for offences which were not
""arrestable offences"" for the purpose of the Act could not take place
on private premises.

 

30.              In Lord Diplock's words (Morris v.
Beardmore at p. 757):

 

...if Parliament intends
to authorise the doing of an act which would constitute a tort actionable at
the suit of the person to whom the act is done, this requires express provision
in the statute, as is exemplified by s 2(6) of the Criminal Law Act 1967....

 

Similarly, in Finnigan v. Sandiford, Lord Keith of Kinkel stated
(at p. 270):

 

                   It may
confidently be stated as a matter of general principle that the mere conferment
by statute of a power to arrest without warrant in given circumstances does not
carry with it any power to enter private premises without the permission of the
occupier, forcibly or otherwise. Section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 creates
a category of `arrestable offence' in respect of which the power of arrest
without warrant may be exercised.... The proper inference, in my opinion, is
that, where Parliament considers it appropriate that a power of arrest without
warrant should be reinforced by a power to enter private premises, it is in the
habit of saying so specifically, and that the omission of any such specific
power is deliberate. It would rarely, if ever, be possible to conclude that the
power had been conferred by implication.

 

31.              In both Morris v. Beardmore and Finnigan
v. Sandiford the cautious attitude towards the question of arrest powers on
private premises without a warrant is compelled by the existence of clear
statutory regulation of the matter. In the United Kingdom, Parliament has dealt
with the issue and the House of Lords has refrained from going beyond what is
the clear intent of Parliament.

 

32.              In Canada, on the other hand, Parliament
has remained silent on the question of whether a police officer can arrest
without a warrant on private premises. It is for this reason that we must
interpret the text of s. 450(1) (a) with regard to the principles of the
common law; accordingly Morris v. Beardmore and Finnigan v. Sandiford
do not provide support for the respondent's position.

 

                                                                   IV

 

Conclusion

 

33.              A peace officer making an arrest on
private premises without a warrant is in the execution of his or her duty for
the purposes of s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  if the criteria
of that section and the standards enunciated in Eccles v. Bourque has
been satisfied. The proper questions to be asked are:

 

1.                Is the offence in question indictable?

 

2. Has the person who
is the subject of arrest committed the offence in question or does the peace
officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believe he or she has committed or
is about to commit the offence in question?

 

3. Are there
reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within
the premises?

 

4.                Was proper announcement made before entry?

 

An affirmative answer to all of these questions will mean that the
arrest is lawful.

 

34.              Both Eccles v. Bourque and the
present case are concerned with the scope and nature of the spatial limits with
respect to the power of arrest under s. 450(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code . I refrain from making any determination on the nature and scope of
the spatial limits of arrest without a warrant under any of the other sections
or subsections of the Code.

 

35.              I should also like to note that this case
arose before the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  came into
effect. 

 

36.              In the present case the trial judge and
the Court of Appeal erred in finding that an arrest pursuant to s. 450(1) (a)
would not be lawful if on private premises in any circumstances other than hot
pursuit.

 

37.              Accordingly, this appeal is allowed on the
point of law and a new trial is ordered.

38.              Estey
J.‑‑This appeal raises once again the question of the right
of the citizen to insist on the inviolability of his home from invasion in the
name of law enforcement. The facts are set forth fully in the judgment of the
Chief Justice; the issue arises because of the respondent's assault of a police
officer who entered an apartment in order to arrest the respondent without
warrant. The principles governing this appeal are contained in recent decisions
of this Court; Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, Wiretap
Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 697, and Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 633. In all these decisions, this Court has acknowledged that the
ancient principle, ""That the house of every one is to him as his castle
and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and violence, as for his
repose"" (Semayne’s Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a, 77 E.R. 194), must
yield to the legitimate requirements of law enforcement. In Lyons, supra,
the majority wrote (at p. 657): 

 

The invasion here is of
privacy and this concerns both the personal aspects and the property aspects of
privacy. The inviolable nature of the private dwelling is a basic part of our
free society. This concept has long been a bulwark against tyranny of the state
be it organized as an absolute monarchy or as a democratic state under a
constitutional monarch. Indeed for three hundred years the concept that a
person's home is his castle has been the defence of the citizen in an endless
variety of challenges brought against him in the name of the state. Semayne
has been the shrine of his or her privacy. The concept recognizes an internal
security but also an external dependence. The home is not a castle in
isolation; it is a castle in a community and draws its support and security of
existence from the community. The law has long recognized many compromises and
outright intrusions on the literal sense of this concept: for example, the
right of the community to search on proper authorization; the right of pursuit;
the right of eminent domain; the right of the community in applying zoning
restrictions and safety standards; the compulsory participation in community
established health facilities including sewer and water systems; and many more.
Most of these intrusions carry inspection rights of varying modes and degrees.
As Dickson J. (as he then was) put it in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 739, at p. 743:

 

...there are occasions
when the interest of a private individual in the security of his house must
yield to the public interest, when the public at large has an interest in the
process to be executed.

 

39.              Eccles v. Bourque, supra,
establishes that a peace officer has authority at common law to enter private
premises to effect an arrest without warrant pursuant to s. 450(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code  if he has reasonable and probable grounds to believe
that an indictable offence has been committed or is about to be committed, and
if two further criteria are met. First, the peace officer must have reasonable
and probable grounds to believe that the person sought is on the private
premises, and secondly, he must make a proper announcement of his presence and
purpose before entering. The disposition of this appeal is governed by those
criteria, and I would accordingly agree with the Chief Justice that the appeal
should be allowed. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

40.              Le
Dain J.‑‑I agree with the Chief Justice that the authority
of a police officer to enter private premises without the consent of the
occupant in order to effect an arrest without warrant was affirmed, with the
conditions on which it may be exercised, in Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2
S.C.R. 739, and that there are sound reasons of policy for adhering to that
decision. I do not wish, however, to be understood as necessarily subscribing
to the distinction which the Chief Justice draws with reference to the
judgments of the majority of the Court in Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 697, Lyons v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, and Dedman v.
The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 2. I agree that the appeal should be allowed and
a new trial ordered.

A Man's Home is His Castle

 

42.              The sanctity of the home is deeply rooted
in our traditions. It serves to protect the security of the person and
individual privacy. The same thought was expressed as early as 1604 in the
language of the day in the first proposition of the celebrated Semayne’s
Case (1604), 5 Co. Rep. 91 a, at p. 91 b, 77 E.R. 194, at p. 195 as
follows:

 

                   1. That
the house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his
defence against injury and violence, as for his repose....

 

Qualifications

 

43.              The judges in Semayne’s Case, of
course, realized that the principle that a man's home is his castle must be
subjected to certain limitations to secure the proper administration of
justice. Though it was a civil case, it discusses the limitations then
recognized by the common law in both civil and criminal matters. That
discussion makes clear that an arrest could be made by breaking into a house if
the arrestor was armed with a warrant, or again if he was in hot pursuit of an
offender. But some have argued that the third proposition in the case goes
further. So far as relevant, it reads as follows (5 Co. Rep. 91 b, 77 E.R.
195):

 

                   3. In
all cases when the King is party, the sheriff (if the doors be not open) may
break the party's house, either to arrest him, or to do other execution of the
K.'s process, if otherwise he cannot enter. But before he breaks it, he ought
to signify the cause of his coming, and to make request to open doors....

 

44.              There is some ambiguity in the first
sentence of this proposition which has led some to read it as permitting the
""breaking"" of a party's house even without a warrant. I do not,
however, think this interpretation does justice to the latter part of that
sentence. It should be remembered that in Semayne's Case, a legal
process had been issued. What is more, the sentence we are considering, after
mentioning arrest, immediately speaks of other execution of the King's
process, the ordinary meaning of which is a writ or other judicial order; see Black’s
Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), p. 1085; Jowitt’s Dictionary of English
Law, vol. 2 (2nd ed. 1977), at pp. 1438‑39. These two facts strongly
imply that the writer had in mind an arrest pursuant to process, in that
situation a warrant. A similar view has recently been expressed by Stevens J.,
giving the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States in Payton v.
New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980), at p. 593, as follows:

 

The context strongly
implies, however, that the court was describing the extent of authority in
executing the King's writ. This reading is confirmed by the phrase ""either
to arrest him, or to do other execution of the K.'s process"" and by
the further point that notice was necessary because the owner may ""not
know of the process.""

 

45.              Nor should the passage be read without
regard to the character of Coke's Reports or of the man who compiled
them. Plucknett in his A Concise History of the Common Law (5th ed.
1956), at p. 282 tells us that Coke's Reports were not like modern
reports containing verbatim accounts of what the judges had said but rather,
that along with his Institutes, they were used by Coke to set forth his
view of restatement of the law. Plucknett says this at p. 281: 

 

A case in Coke's Reports,
therefore, is an uncertain mingling of genuine report, commentary, criticism,
elementary instruction, and recondite legal history. The whole is dominated by
Coke's personality, and derives its authority from him.

 

That being so, it is useful to examine what Coke has said elsewhere to
determine the real meaning of the equivocal statement in the third proposition
in Semayne's Case. Now Coke in his Fourth Institute went so far
as to say that justices of the peace had no power to issue a warrant that would
permit the arrest of a man in his own house until he had been indicted; see
Coke, The Fourth Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England (London:
1817), pp. 176‑77. If in Coke's view a justice could not issue such a
warrant on the basis of real and probable cause, it follows that he would not
have countenanced a constable's breaking into a house without a warrant. The
majority judges in Payton v. New York, supra, at pp. 594‑95,
and seemingly the minority too (see p. 611), were of this view.

 

46.              If I am correct in my view that Semayne’s
Case is no authority for the proposition that a man can be arrested in his
own home without a warrant, (apart from hot pursuit and other narrow exceptions
to prevent the commission of an offence to be mentioned later), it follows that
the comments there made about informing the person sought to be arrested and
requesting entry were confined to arrest with a warrant.

 

47.              What speaks even more eloquently is the
silence of the law reports on the issue. For over two hundred years after Semayne’s
Case, there was not a single reported case holding that a constable may
enter a man's house to arrest him without a warrant on the basis of reasonable
and probable cause. Given the stout opposition Englishmen have traditionally
displayed in the face of even marginal intrusions by state authority, it seems
unlikely that the police purported to act on the basis of such power in those
years. Stevens J. in Payton v. New York, supra, at pp. 596‑98,
had this to say on the matter:

 

The zealous and frequent
repetition of the adage that a ""man's house is his castle,"" made it
abundantly clear that both in England and in the Colonies ""the freedom of
one's house"" was one of the most vital elements of English liberty. 

 

                   Thus,
our study of the relevant common law does not provide the same guidance that
was present in Watson. Whereas the rule concerning the validity of an
arrest in a public place was supported by cases directly in point and by the
unanimous views of the commentators, we have found no direct authority
supporting forcible entries into a home to make a routine arrest and the weight
of the scholarly opinion is somewhat to the contrary. Indeed, the absence of
any 17th‑ or 18th‑ century English cases directly in point,
together with the unequivocal endorsement of the tenet that ""a man's home
is his castle,"" strongly suggests that the prevailing practice was not to
make such arrests except in hot pursuit or when authorized by a warrant.

 

48.              There were, it is true, respected
commentators, some relying on an early Yearbook case, who took a different
view. As to this it is sufficient to cite Stevens J.'s view in Payton v. New
York, supra, at pp. 593‑97, which I make mine:

 

                   The
common‑law commentators disagreed sharply on the subject. Three distinct
views were expressed. Lord Coke, widely recognized by the American colonists
""as the greatest authority of his time on the laws of England,""
clearly viewed a warrantless entry for the purpose of arrest to be illegal.
Burn, Foster, and Hawkins agreed, as did East and Russell, though the latter
two qualified their opinions by stating that if an entry to arrest was made
without a warrant, the officer was perhaps immune from liability for the trespass
if the suspect was actually guilty. Blackstone, Chitty, and Stephen took the
opposite view, that entry to arrest without a warrant was legal, though Stephen
relied on Blackstone who, along with Chitty, in turn relied exclusively on
Hale. But Hale's view was not quite so unequivocally expressed. Further, Hale
appears to rely solely on a statement in an early Yearbook, quoted in Burdett
v. Abbot, 14 East 1, 155, 104 Eng. Rep. 501, 560 (K. B. 1811):

 

"" ‘that for felony,
or suspicion of felony, a man may break open the house to take the felon; for
it is for the commonweal to take them.’ "" 

 

Considering the diversity
of views just described, however, it is clear that the statement was never
deemed authoritative. Indeed, in Burdett, the statement was described as
an ""extrajudicial opinion.""

 

49.              The only case since Semayne’s Case
I have found in favour of the view that a policeman may without consent or a
warrant enter into a dwelling and arrest a person there solely on the basis
that he reasonably believes the person has committed an offence is Davis v.
Russell (1829), 5 Bing. 355, 130 E.R. 1098. There the plaintiff sued a
constable for false imprisonment. The constable had entered the plaintiff's
lodgings and taken her out of bed at night to prison. He had no warrant but was
acting on the information given by an informant to the effect that the
plaintiff had robbed the informant. Though the principal question appears to
have been whether the constable had reasonable cause, Best C.J., who gave the
major judgment, certainly made it clear (5 Bing. 365, 130 E.R. 1102) that,
""We cannot uphold the notion that a constable is not permitted to go into
a house at night to apprehend a person suspected.""

 

50.              The case, however, is not one calculated
to encourage granting the police power to enter into private dwellings without
a warrant. As it turned out the informant had lied to the constable. The
court's recognition of this fact, however, afforded cold comfort to the plaintiff,
described in the report as a respectable inhabitant of Cheltenham. The
constable was held to have had reasonable grounds for what he did and her
action against him consequently failed.

 

51.              The treatment accorded this case is interesting.
I have not found a single reference to it in any English criminal law text. Nor
is it to be found in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th ed., where in vol.
11, paragraph 122, the common law is set forth in this fashion:

 

A constable has no general
right of entry into private property for the purpose of obtaining evidence,
questioning persons or effecting an arrest; every invasion of private property,
however slight, is a trespass, and no person has the right to enter property
except by consent or strictly in accordance with some lawful authorisation. A
constable is in this regard in no better position than any member of the public
and is not entitled to enter premises merely because he suspects that something
is amiss even though a reasonable householder might not object to his doing so
if the entry were bona fide and no damage was caused. A constable may, however,
enter premises to prevent a breach of the peace, and probably to prevent the
commission of any offence which he believes to be imminent or likely to be
committed.

 

Davis v. Russell did appear in Halsbury’s
Laws of England, 3rd ed., vol. 10, paragraph 636f where it is
relegated to a footnote to support the proposition that a policeman, unlike a
private person, may arrest on reasonable suspicion of felony. It is not cited,
nor is the proposition it supports stated, in the part of that volume dealing
with entry on private property to effect arrest (paragraph 647). I would gather
the authors of that learned work did not think the case should be followed on
that point. Certainly they knew it existed.

 

52.              Halsbury’s account is in accord
with more recent interpretations of the common law. Thus even in Thomas v.
Sawkins, [1935] 2 K.B. 249 (Div. Ct.), itself strongly criticized (see, inter
alia, A. L. Goodhart (1936), 6 Camb. L.J. 22) for extending the law
to permit entry by police onto private premises other than a dwelling in cases
where they apprehend a breach of the peace, Avory J. at p. 256, carefully
distinguished that case from those where a breach of the peace was not
involved; the latter in his view requires express statutory authority to
empower the police to enter.

 

53.              How fully this view of the common law is
accepted in England today is evident from the concession in the recent case of Swales
v. Cox, [1981] 1 All E.R. 1115 (Q.B. Div.), regarding the limits of the
power of the police to enter private premises. Donaldson L.J., speaking for himself
and Hodgson L.J., thus put it, at p. 1118:

 

...there was power of
entry into premises at common law and, if necessary, power to break doors to do
so in four cases, but in four cases only, that is to say by a constable or a
citizen in order to prevent murder, by a constable or a citizen if a felony had
in fact been committed and the felon had been followed to a house, by a
constable or a citizen if a felony was about to be committed, and would be
committed, unless prevented, and by a constable following an offender running
away from an affray. In any other circumstances there was no power to enter
premises without a warrant, and, even in these four cases where there was power
not only to enter but to break in in order to do so, it was an essential precondition
that there should have been a demand and refusal by the occupier to allow entry
before the doors could be broken.

 

54.              Until recently, then, the better view, as
it seems to me, was that at common law entry into private dwellings without a
warrant was not permitted to effect an arrest apart from the instances I have
mentioned. Both in Canada and in England, however, there had been some
extensions to the right of constables to go on private property, other than
dwellings, in the exercise of their duty to preserve the peace and to conduct
investigations into crimes; see Thomas v. Sawkins, supra; R.
v. Stenning, [1970] S.C.R. 631.

 

55.              But no significant change in the common
law right of a policeman to enter into a home took place until Eccles v.
Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739, to which I now turn.

 

The Recent Decisions

 

56.              Eccles v. Bourque was decided at a
time when the law in countries with traditions similar to our own was being modified
to accord greater police powers. In the United Kingdom, the Criminal Law Act
1967 significantly extended the powers of police officers to enter private
premises. In the United States, too, a footnote to Payton v. New York, supra,
p. 598, n. 46, tells us, no less than twenty‑three states,
including New York, had enacted statutes authorizing police entry into
dwellings without a warrant. I might note, however, that the New York statutes
were recently declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United
States in Payton v. New York, supra, which held that under the
Constitution of that country entry into a private dwelling for the purpose of
arresting a person can only be effected by virtue of a warrant or in exigent
circumstances. As I will explain, however, I do not think Eccles v. Bourque
went as far as these statutory provisions.

 

57.              Eccles v. Bourque was a claim in
trespass. The circumstances there were thus described by Dickson J. (now
C.J.C.) at p. 741: 

 

The claim of the
appellant, Mr. Eccles, is against the respondents, three constables on the
Vancouver Police Force, for damages for trespass alleged to have been committed
when the police officers entered the apartment occupied by Mr. Eccles in the
City of Vancouver at about 4:00 p.m. on August 12, 1971. The constables were in
plain clothes but were armed. The purpose of the entry was to apprehend one
Edmund Cheese, also known as Billy Deans, for whom there were three outstanding
Montreal warrants. Cheese was not found in the apartment. The trial judge,
Wootton J., concluded he had not been there or had successfully made his
escape, by climbing to the roof of the building from one of the two balconies
adjoining the apartment, at the moment of or immediately after the police
officers entered. Mr. Eccles was successful at trial. Mr. Justice Wootton
awarded him $300 damages and costs. The Court of Appeal for British Columbia by
a majority (Robertson and Taggart JJ.A., with Nemetz J.A. dissenting) reversed.
Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

This Court dismissed the appeal, holding the constables' entry to be
justified.

 

58.              It must be observed that in that case
there were warrants for the arrest of the fugitive, a point that is repeatedly
made throughout the case. It is set forth at the very beginning of the judgment
in the statement of the facts already given. It is reiterated at p. 743, where
after stating the principle in Semayne’s Case that a man's house is his
castle, the qualifications to that principle are stated in the following words:

 

But there are occasions
when the interest of a private individual in the security of his house must
yield to the public interest, when the public at large has an interest in the
process to be executed. The criminal is not immune from arrest in his own
home nor in the home of one of his friends.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Again, at p. 745, the folowing passage appears:

 

If the police officer has
reasonable and probable cause to believe that the person named in the
warrant for arrest is in the home of a stranger he has the right, after
proper demand, to enter the home forcibly, to search and to arrest. In the
present case there can be no doubt the police officers believed and in my view
had reasonable and probable grounds for believing that Cheese, or Deans as he
was known to Mr. Eccles, was in the Eccles apartment.

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

59.              This constant repetition of the existence
of a warrant indicates the importance of this fact to the coram that decided
the case. As I read it, then, the manner in which Eccles v. Bourque
really differs from other cases of entry on the basis of a warrant is that the
attempted arrest occurred in British Columbia but the warrants had been issued
in Montreal and were not endorsed for use in British Columbia as required by
the Criminal Code . As well, the warrants were not in the possession of
the constables when the entry was made.

 

60.              The case, therefore, undoubtely
constituted an extension of the law by ignoring some of the requirements for
the arrest of a person against whom a warrant has been issued. But these in the
context may have been looked upon by the court as technical omissions. It
anticipated in a sense the recent recommendation of the Law Reform Commission
of Canada that there should be Canada‑wide warrants; see Arrest,
Working Paper 41, p. 118, Recommendation 20. There was no question raised in
that case that an offence had been committed or that warrants has been issued.
The real question, as the last cited passage seems to denote, was whether there
were reasonable and probable grounds for believing the fugitive was in Mr.
Eccles' house.

 

61.              Justification for overlooking some of the
technical requirements of the Code may be found in the fact that, as the
judgement states on several occasions, the person sought was a fugitive.
Fugitives from justice are frequently treated differently from other offenders.
The most obvious example is arrest on hot pursuit. Reference may also be made
to extradition law where, in addition to the relaxation of rules required by
statutes regarding the form of evidence, the courts have frequently stated that
the technical rules of criminal law should apply only in a limited sense. This
approach has been followed in various areas seriously affecting the liberty of
the subject, including the more ready refusal to grant bail, among others. 

 

62.              Two Canadian Courts of Appeal have
understood the application of Eccles v. Bourque to be limited to arrest
by warrant. The majority of the Court of Appeal of Ontario obviously did so in
the present case. And in R. v. Custer, [1984] 4 W.W.R. 133, at p. 142,
Bayda C.J., giving the unanimous opinion of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, had
this to say:

 

                   It is
plain that the case does not fall within the common law exception applied by
the Supreme Court of Canada in Eccles, the ratio decidendi of which I
understand to be this: if a police officer has reasonable and probable cause to
believe that the person named in a warrant for arrest is in the home of a
stranger, the officer has the right, after proper demand, to enter the home
forcibly, to search and to arrest.

 

63.              I agree with the members of these courts
that Eccles v. Bourque simply gives a restricted power to police
officers to enter a person's home when they reasonably believe a person for
whom a warrant of arrest has been issued is there. I do not think it should be
broadly interpreted so as to authorize entry into a dwelling whenever the
police believe on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an offence and
that he is in that dwelling. Several cases decided in this Court underline that
the principle that a man's home is his castle remains solidly imbedded in the
law; see Colet v. The Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 2; Lyons v. The Queen,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 633, esp. at p. 657; Wiretap Reference, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
697, esp. at pp. 707‑09. And, as I will attempt to demonstrate, if the
broad view of Eccles v. Bourque is taken, that principle is fatally
weakened.

 

64.              Of the cases just mentioned, only Colet
needs attention here. It highlights the importance we attach to the integrity
of the home in this country. There police officers were authorized by warrant
to seize certain weapons in the possession of Colet who had made it known that
he would forcefully resist entry by city employees to ""clean up"" his
property, including the destruction of a rudimentary shelter he called his
home. Armed with the warrant, the police attempted to enter his home but they
were met with strong resistance, which culminated in Colet's being charged with
five counts, including attempted murder and intending to cause bodily harm.
Colet was, however, acquitted. The Court, inspired by the principle in Semayne's
Case, interpreted the relevant provisions of the Code restrictively
to hold that the authorization to seize did not include the right to enter and
search Colet's home even though it was obvious from the facts that the firearms
sought were known to be there. 

 

65.              The case was not, of course, dealing with
precisely the same subject‑matter as Eccles v. Bourque but (if one
adopts a broad view of Eccles) one must agree with the comment of the
Law Reform Commission in Arrest, supra, at p. 114:

 

While the court was
dealing with very different factual situations and was applying different
sources of law in each case, allowing them to be distinguished for these
reasons, the approaches to the problem of the power of police forcibly to enter
private premises to carry out duties are based on widely diverging premises,
methods and values.

 

Indeed, as it further noted at p. 116:

 

Entry to effect an arrest
has potentially geater repercussions for the liberty of the individual than
does entry for the purposes of searching for evidence of offences, and it is
difficult to see how the protections surrounding the former should be less
stringent than those for the latter as is presently the case.

 

66.              The underlying values in the two judgments
become reconcilable and more coherent if one adopts the view of Eccles v.
Bourque I have advanced in the present case.

 

67.              The Colet case itself contains
statements that may conceivably be interpreted as supportive of a broad as well
as a restrictive view of Eccles. Thus the following passage at the top
of p. 9 may possibly be looked upon as supporting a broad approach:

 

                   This
makes it clear that Mr. Justice Dickson was limiting his remarks to occasions
when the house of the individual is entered against his will by police officers
in search of a fugitive from justice whose arrest they consider to be
justified.

 

But even here, it should be observed, Ritchie J. confined his remarks
to a fugitive from justice. And later on the same page, he adds the following
passage that denotes the restrictive attitude towards entry into a person's
home that prevailed in that case:

 

All sections of the Criminal
Code  are presumably enacted ""in the public interest"" and it would
in my view be dangerous indeed to hold that the private rights of the
individual to the exclusive enjoyment of his own property are to be subject to
invasion by police officers whenever they can be said to be acting in the
furtherance of the enforcement of any section of the Criminal Code 
although they are not armed with express authority to justify their action.

 

68.              That approach is, of course, relevant
here, given the vagueness of the Criminal Code  regarding the spatial
limits of the power to arrest. 

 

Policy Considerations

 

69.              As has been seen the common law sets a
high value on the security and privacy of the home. The situations where it
permitted entry by police without the consent of the owner or occupier were all
demonstrably compelling. For example, entry to prevent murder is obviously
justified. So too is entry on hot pursuit. Apart from the obvious practicality
of that approach, in the case of hot pursuit the police officer is himself
cognizant of the facts justifying entry; he acts on the basis of personal
knowledge. Obviously, too, entry on the basis of a warrant is essential to a
properly functioning system of criminal justice. The state must in the end have
power to prevent criminals from eluding justice by retreating to a private
home.

 

70.              The latter reasoning can, of course, be
used to support the thesis that a police officer may enter, break into and stay
in a private home uninvited and without warrant on the basis of reasonable and
probable cause. But it fails to consider the advantage of a warrant which
interposes a judicial officer‑‑a person not professionally
interested in law enforcement and not directly involved in the particular issue‑‑into
the process. The scrutiny exercised by the judicial officer may not be
extensive, but the mere fact that a police officer must attempt to persuade a
third party that he has a reasonable and probable cause to effect entry into a
private dwelling requires some reflection on the necessity of breaching such a
fundamental tenet of our society as the sanctity of the home.The warrant also
announces in a symbolic way, one traditionally recognized by the public, that
it is the state that authorizes entry under law. In Eccles v. Bourque, a
warrant for the fugitive had been issued even though it may not have met the
endorsement requirements of the Code.

 

71.              From the Eccles case, we are asked
to take a further step and hold that when a police officer has reasonable and
probable cause to believe a person has committed an indictable offence, he may
enter into a private home, apparently at any time of day or night, if he also
has reasonable and probable cause to believe a suspect is there. 

 

72.              Let me first say something about the
vagueness of the proposed test of ""reasonable and probable cause"" and
the consequential danger of giving the police power to enter into a private
dwelling on that basis. The expression, no doubt, comprises something more than
mere surmise, but determining with any useful measure of precision what it
means beyond that poses rather intractable problems both for the police and the
courts. If the principle in Eccles v. Bourque is to be extended to permit
forcible entry into private homes, for the purpose of making arrests simply on
the basis that a police officer has reasonable and probable cause, then as the
Law Reform Commission put it in its working paper on Arrest, supra,
at p. 115, it would allow him a ""wide latitude based on vague, sometimes
contradictory statements which provide police with few guidelines, individuals
with few definable rights, and courts with little means of control""; see
also John Manley's comment on Eccles v. Bourque in (1975), 7 Ottawa
L. Rev. 649, at p. 656. I have found nothing in the cases or in learned
commentaries that gives much assistance in giving more precision to the
concept, the situations being so various. Because of the vagueness of the
discretion it gives a police officer, that discretion is virtually
uncontrollable. Small wonder, then, that the Law Reform Commission recommended
the statutory reaffirmation of the traditional position.

 

73.              I shall attempt to underline the inherent
difficulties of the situation by reference to the facts of this case. The
police had no personal knowledge of the alleged crime. They received a phone
call from a public transit officer who had seen two youths enter a parked jeep,
one of whom the informant alleged was drunk. He later reported he saw them
walking through a parking lot, trying to open car doors. He parked his car,
called the police on his car radio and then saw the youths enter an apartment
building nearby. On arrival, the police found the jeep had backed down a hill
and was standing against a retaining wall with the lights on. 

 

74.              On the basis of this, how can a court at
third hand do anything but hold that there were reasonable and probable grounds
to believe the youths may have committed attempted theft? How can one second‑guess
the policemen on such matters, for example, as the reliability and credibility
of the informant? Informants can be unreliable; indeed as Davis v. Russell,
supra, shows, they can be relating false tales for their own purposes.

 

75.              Apart from flagrant cases, I seriously
doubt that the courts can exercise any effective control over the exercise of
police discretion in such cases. So far as arrests in public places are
concerned, I do not quarrel with the existence of this discretion. The police's
job of maintaining the peace and enforcing the criminal law is difficult enough
without fearing being regularly ""second‑guessed"" about every
mistake of judgment in such circumstances. But if I agree that a police officer
should be able on evidence such as existed here to arrest a suspect in a public
place, I do not think it reasonable that he should be permitted to enter a
private home without consent unless he has a warrant permitting him to do so.
Invasion of a person's home, in circumstances like these, is too high a price
to pay to prevent the possible escape of some criminals, especially for non‑violent
crimes like the one alleged in the present case. Not only would such a practice
invade the owner's security and privacy; it would often lead to violence as the
facts of this case attest. This can, in my view, be even more likely where the
owner of the home is not the suspected offender. All the more so if, as
happened in Eccles v. Bourque, the police are not in uniform.

 

76.              The danger is not lessened by the fact
that despite reasonable and probable belief on the part of the police that an
offence has been committed, there may not have been any offence committed at all,
a matter that may, if his home is broken into, make the homeowner all the more
irate. That police intrusion may occur when no offence has in fact been
committed is evident from Davis v. Russell, supra. Indeed, in the
present case it is far from clear that the accused had committed attempted
theft. The account by the two youths under oath that they were walking home
from an entertainment establishment and went into the jeep out of curiosity
while walking home is not implausible. They were quite close to home. They were
seventeen or eighteen, they had been drinking and, they said, they had never
seen a jeep like the one in question and wanted to see what it looked like.
They denied having attempted to open cars in the parking lot and said they were
merely walking between them through the parking lot. It is interesting that
they were never charged with the alleged attempted theft for which entry was
made into the apartment. 

 

77.              What of the identification of the accused
and the place where they were going? The informant had advised the police that
the accused had walked into an apartment building nearby, but did not identify
the apartment. One of the police, Constable Handy, testified that as he
approached the front door of the building, he saw two individuals matching the
description of the two youths in a basement apartment. And what was that
description? According to the informant, the persons concerned were about
eighteen, one was dark and was noticeably drunk (though the police testified
that this was not so), one wore a denim jacket and the other a dark one (the
police said it was red). I have no doubt from this that the police officer
could have reasonable grounds for believing that the youths were the suspects
and, as it turned out he was right. But with that description, the chances of a
mistake are not inconsiderable.

 

78.              Those chances are too great for one to
support the rule of law argued for in this case. From the vantage of a court,
which is supposed to exercise control over police discretion, the
identification is extremely vague. The number of youths who could answer that
description must be very high. Only those present at the time can really make
an assessment. Control by the courts under those circumstances, therefore,
becomes very limited.

 

79.              I draw no comfort from the fact that the
proposed extension of Eccles v. Bourque could be limited to indictable
offences. As anyone familiar with the criminal justice system knows, even
serious indictable offences can arise out of fact situations that are not
really that serious. So far as the crime alleged here, which is non‑violent,
the Code itself (s. 450(2)(a)) attempts to discourage arrest
without warrant by enjoining police officers not to do so unless the public
interest otherwise requires it. I might also add that a number of crimes can be
prosecuted by indictment or on summary conviction at the option of the
prosecutor. The choice could be made with a view to making a previous entry
into a private dwelling legal.

 

80.              Another type of problem has been suggested
by Professor Alan Grant in a comment on ""The Supreme Court of Canada and
the Police: 1970‑76"" (1978), 20 Crim. Law Q. 152, at p. 163.
If the decision is given a broad meaning, he states: 

 

...then it may herald an
end to the police ever seeking search warrants, for example, to look for stolen
property. There can be few cases where there are reasonable and probable
grounds to believe that stolen property is being kept at premises which will
not at the same time be capable of supporting a belief that someone on the
premises is reasonably and probably believed to be committing the offence of
being in possession of stolen property (Code ss. 312 and 313) for which there
will be a power of arrest under Cr. Code s. 450(1).

 

81.              The truth is that to extend the rule in Eccles
to a case like the present would amount to giving the police an almost
unfettered discretion to break into a home by day or night whenever they
seriously suspect an indictable offence has been committed and that the
perpetrator is there.

 

82.              But, it may be countered, the alternative
is that a house may become a permanent sanctuary for a criminal, since there
are no search warrants for persons as opposed to things. There are several
answers to this. To begin with, I doubt if there would be many cases where a
person would remain indefinitely in a house, thereby creating a prison of his
own making. And if there is need to have search warrants for persons, the
answer is simple: Parliament can provide for it as several commentators have suggested;
see, for example, Grant, supra, p. 164. Finally, good police work can
easily overcome the problems in most cases. In the present case, for example,
one of the youths was at home. It would not have required very sophisticated
police work to locate the other the next day, and their identification as the
persons who committed the alleged attempted theft could not have been more
unreliable than it is at present. Such an approach would obviate the temptation
that a suspected person and others may have to resist when disturbed at home;
the not unlikely violent consequences that can ensue would thus be avoided.

 

83.              In truth, though, there is a fallacy in
approaching the matter on the basis of a single case. Even if one concedes that
some suspects may escape owing to the principle that a man's home is his
castle, this has to be weighed against the danger of giving up a well‑known
and long recognized right devised for the protection of individual security and
privacy against state power. The wide, vague, and virtually uncontrollable
discretion one would be giving police officers creates a greater danger to the
sanctity of the home than the danger that criminals would otherwise escape. For
my part, I share the skepticism of the Supreme Court of the United States in Payton
v. New York, supra, at p. 602 that law enforcement has suffered
because the police have been unable to enter a home to effect arrest apart from
the narrow common law exceptions. No evidence to establish this point was forthcoming
in the Payton case, although it has long been the practice of the
Supreme Court of the United States to consider evidence of this nature. 

 

84.              On the other hand, on the basis of the
limited experience we have had with entries into homes without warrant, we know
that errors are inevitable. In Davis v. Russell, we saw, no crime had
been committed. That may well be so in the present case. Only in Eccles v.
Bourque can we be certain a crime had been committed before entry, but then
there was a warrant in that case. We daily permit accused who are almost
certainly guilty to go free in the interest of ensuring that no innocent person
shall be punished. The procedure argued for would inevitably result in some
people who are certainly innocent bearing the burden of a rule which it has yet
to be demonstrated would achieve any measurable improvement in law enforcement.

 

85.              I do not think we would be assisting the
police in the difficult task they are faced with by increasing their rights of
entry into private homes in the manner contended for here. We would be giving
them a very vague rule for action. In situations like this, they need the
clearest possible rules. At present the rule is clear. Absent well recognized
and widely supported exceptions, they may not enter private homes. These
exceptions apart, their authority ends at the door. That rule protects them and
the public from violence.

 

86.              Moreover, I do not think it is wise to
place the police in situations where they are called upon to breach such a
deeply cherished community value as the sanctity of the home. It is essential
for the police to have the support of the community. With the type of extension
argued for, mistakes are bound to happen and I can imagine few breaches of
community values more calculated to incense the public than this one; see in
this context W. F. Foster and Joseph E. Magnet, ""The Law of Forcible
Entry"" (1977), 15 Alta. Law Rev. 271, at pp. 290‑91.

 

87.              There is another cause for concern in
granting such a vague discretion. It is unlikely to be used as much against the
economically favoured or powerful as against the disadvantaged. It is
interesting that the home in Davis v. Russell, supra, was
described as lodgings, and those in Eccles v. Bourque and the present
case were apartments. As Professor Paul Weiler has stated, ""abuses of
police power will rarely affect respectable members of the middle
classes"", but will instead ""focus on the poor and on marginal,
minority groups"". See Weiler, ""The Control of Police Arrest
Practices: Reflections of a Tort Lawyer"" in Allen M. Linden, ed., Studies
in Canadian Tort Law, p. 416, at p. 448; John Manley, case comment on Eccles
v. Bourque, supra, at p. 656. 

 

88.              Finally, I have mentioned earlier that
Parliament may, if it wishes, amend the law of search warrants to permit
searches for persons as well as things. It might also wish, under well‑defined
circumstances, to extend police powers in respect of dangerous situations and
dangerous and elusive criminals (which is not the case here). I would now add
some general observations about the respective roles of Parliament and the
courts in situations like that in the present case. In my view, if incursions
are to be made upon a legal and political value so deeply inbred in our society
as the sanctity of the home, it is for Parliament to do so and not for the
courts. While the courts must attempt to give reasonable and practical effect to
attempts by Parliament to meet the challenge of widespread criminal activity,
the duty of the courts has always been to act as a brake against laws that
either directly or because of over‑zealous enforcement encroach upon the
liberty of the subject. It would be an ironic reversal of roles if Parliament
was required to act to protect the sanctity of the home from possible excesses
flowing from the application of a judicially created rule. Courts undoubtedly
have a creative role in developing the law, but they must be extremely wary of
widening the possibility of encroaching on our personal liberties; they are the
protectors of our rights. Parliament has the primary duty to respond to the
challenge of criminal activities. The courts should no doubt view their efforts
sympathetically but be forever diligent to prevent undue intrusions on our
liberty.

 

89.              It may in the past have been tempting at
times for courts to extend rules in flagrant circumstances to forestal more
general action by Parliament, then supreme, in response to a transient wave of
public opinion. But the constitutional environment has now changed. The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  clearly tells us that certain fundamental
rights, including the security of the person, fall within the constitutional
protection of the courts. That is, I think, the proper role of the courts.
Seemingly minor intrusions on fundamental principles of the type they might
have been tempted to make in the past are dangerous. Walter Gellhorn has said
it well: 

 

                   In
every society, in every age, and certainly in our own there are multitudes who,
in Archibald MacLeish's phrase, ""fear freedom or are frightened of the
loneliness it implies."" For the most part, however, inroads on freedom are
not initiated by those who prefer that others assume responsibility for
directing their lives; these flabby folk become the hordes that sustain
dictatorships, but they themselves are too inert to bring it to pass. We need
not worry, in my estimation, that freedom will be brought low upon their initiative.
Nor do I think that evilly motivated men will successfully trick us into
surrendering one after another bastion in a heedless quest for an unattainably
perfect security. The real danger lies among those of us who genuinely desire
to protect freedom, and who think that this can best be done by limiting it.
They propose to give a little here to protect a lot there. The motive is
admirable, but the judgment is unsound. The very amplitude of our American
brand of freedom sometimes seduces us into believing that a good deal of it can
be spent without anyone's really noticing the difference‑‑that we
can afford, as Carl Becker put it, ""to take liberties with our
liberty."" But the trouble is that small restrictions accumulate into large
restrictions and, in the process, may become as habitual as, before, freedom
was. Restrictions justified as necessary safeguards of freedom may in fact
safeguard freedom out of existence altogether.

The Citizen's Liberty"" (1966), 9 Can. Bar J. 168, at p. 170. 

 

Conclusion

 

90.              For my part, I am firm that the principle
that a man's home is his castle along with the demonstrably justifiable
exceptions developed under the old common law have together constituted an
excellent balance between the security and privacy of the individual and the
needs of law enforcement from their enunciation in Semayne's Case over
three hundred and eighty years ago. I am confident this arrangement can
continue to be an adequate balance for four hundred years after Semayne's
Case and beyond. If Parliament in its wisdom finds it necessary to adjust
the balance, it can do so. It is in a better position to provide for the
precise balance and has a far better access to the knowledge required to
achieve that balance than the courts. The courts can then perform their duty of
scrutinizing Parliament's laws both in their general tenor and in their
particular application to safeguard our traditional values. That as I
understand it is the role the courts in both Great Britain and the United
States, in their different constitutional environments, play; for Great Britain,
see Morris v. Beardmore, [1980] 2 All E.R. 753 (H.L.); Finnigan v.
Sandiford, [1981] 2 All E.R. 267 (H.L.); for the United States, see Payton
v. New York, supra.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Presumption of innocence
‑‑ Reverse onus ‑‑ Accused presumed to be trafficker on
finding of possession of illicit drug ‑‑ Onus on accused to rebut
presumption ‑‑ Whether or not constitutional guarantee of
presumption of innocence (s. 11(d) of the Charter) violated.








 

                   Respondent was charged with unlawful possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic
Control Act, but was convicted only of unlawful possession. After the trial
judge made a finding that it was beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent was
in possession of a narcotic, respondent brought a motion challenging the
constitutional validity of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. That
section provides that if the Court finds the accused in possession of a
narcotic, the accused is presumed to be in possession for the purpose of
trafficking and that, absent the accused's establishing the contrary, he must
be convicted of trafficking. The Ontario Court of Appeal, on an appeal brought
by the Crown, found that this provision constituted a ""reverse onus""
clause and held it to be unconstitutional because it violated the presumption
of innocence now entrenched in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The Crown appealed and a constitutional question was
stated as to whether s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violated s.
11 (d) of the Charter  and was therefore of no force and effect.
Inherent in this question, given a finding that s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
had been violated, was the issue of whether or not s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act was a reasonable limit prescribed by law and demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society for the purpose of s. 1  of the Charter .


 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed and the constitutional question answered in the affirmative.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Chouinard, Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: Pursuant to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, the accused, upon a finding beyond a reasonable doubt of
possession of a narcotic, has the legal burden of proving on a balance of
probabilities that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking. On proof of possession, a mandatory presumption arises against the
accused that he intended to traffic and the accused will be found guilty unless
he can rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities.

 

                   The presumption of innocence lies at the very heart
of the criminal law and is protected expressly by s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
and inferentially by the s. 7  right to life, liberty and security of the
person. This presumption has enjoyed longstanding recognition at common law and
has gained widespread acceptance as evidenced from its inclusion in major
international human rights documents. In light of these sources, the right to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty requires, at a minimum, that: (1) an
individual be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) the State must bear
the burden of proof; and (3) criminal prosecutions must be carried out in
accordance with lawful procedures and fairness.

 

                   A provision which requires an accused to disprove on
a balance of probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an
important element of the offence in question, violates the presumption of
innocence in s. 11 (d). The fact that the standard required on rebuttal
is only a balance of probabilities does not render a reverse onus clause
constitutional.

 

                   Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
infringes the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
by requiring the accused to prove he is not guilty of trafficking once the
basic fact of possession is proven.

 

                   The rational connection test ‑‑ the
potential for a rational connection between the basic fact and the presumed
fact to justify a reverse onus provision ‑‑ does not apply to the
interpretation of s. 11 (d). A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a
presumed fact, but still not prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt,
which is an important aspect of the presumption of innocence. The appropriate
stage for invoking the rational connection test is under s. 1  of the Charter .


 

                   Section 1  of the Charter  has two functions:
First, it guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in the provisions which
follow it; and second, it states explicitly the exclusive justificatory
criteria (outside of s. 33 of the Constitutional Act, 1982) against
which limitations on those rights and freedoms may be measured.

 

                   The onus of proving that a limitation on any Charter 
right is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society
rests upon the party seeking to uphold the limitation. Limits on
constitutionally guaranteed rights are clearly exceptions to the general
guarantee. The presumption is that Charter  rights are guaranteed unless
the party invoking s. 1  can bring itself within the exceptional criteria
justifying their being limited.

 

                   The standard of proof under s. 1  is a preponderance
of probabilities. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt would be unduly onerous on
the party seeking to limit the right because concepts such as
""reasonableness"", ""justifiability"", and ""free and
democratic society"" are not amenable to such a standard. Nevertheless, the
preponderance of probability test must be applied rigorously.

 

                   Two central criteria must be satisfied to establish
that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. First, the objective to be served by the measures limiting a Charter 
right must be sufficiently important to warrant overriding a constitutionally
protected right or freedom. The standard must be high to ensure that trivial
objectives or those discordant with the principles of a free and democratic
society do not gain protection. At a minimum, an objective must relate to
societal concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic
society before it can be characterized as sufficiently important. Second, the
party invoking s. 1  must show the means to be reasonable and demonstrably
justified. This involves a form of proportionality test involving three
important components. To begin, the measures must be fair and not arbitrary,
carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally
connected to that objective. In addition, the means should impair the right in
question as little as possible. Lastly, there must be a proportion­ality
between the effects of the limiting measure and the objective ‑‑
the more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the more important the
objective must be. 

 

                   Parliament's concern that drug trafficking be
decreased was substantial and pressing. Its objective of protecting society
from the grave ills of drug trafficking was self‑evident, for the
purposes of s. 1 , and could potentially in certain cases warrant the overriding
of a constitutionally protected right. There was, however, no rational
connection between the basic fact of possession and the presumed fact of
possession for the purpose of trafficking. The possession of a small or
negligible quantity of narcotics would not support the inference of
trafficking.

 

                   Per Estey and McIntyre
JJ.: Concurred in the reasons of Dickson C.J. with respect to the relationship
between s. 11 (d) and s. 1  of the Charter  but the reasons of
Martin J.A. in the court below were adopted for the disposition of all other
issues.

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑This appeal concerns the constitutionality of
s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1. The section
provides, in brief, that if the Court finds the accused in possession of a
narcotic, he is presumed to be in possession for the purpose of trafficking.
Unless the accused can establish the contrary, he must be convicted of
trafficking. The Ontario Court of Appeal held that this provision constitutes a
""reverse onus"" clause and is unconstitutional because it violates one
of the core values of our criminal justice system, the presumption of
innocence, now entrenched in s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms . The Crown has appealed.

Statutory and Constitutional Provisions

 

2.                Before reviewing the factual context, I
will set out the relevant legislative and constitutional provisions:

 

Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1.

 

                   3. (1) Except as authorized by this Act or the regulations, no person
shall have a narcotic in his possession.

 

                   (2) Every
person who violates subsection (1) is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable

 

(a) upon summary
conviction for a first offence, to a fine of one thousand dollars or to
imprisonment for six months or to both fine and imprisonment, and for a
subsequent offence, to a fine of two thousand dollars or to imprisonment for
one year or to both fine and imprisonment; or

 

(b) upon
conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for seven years.

 

                   4. (1) No person shall traffic in a narcotic or any substance represented
or held out by him to be a narcotic.

 

                   (2) No
person shall have in his possession a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking.

 

                   (3) Every
person who violates subsection (1) or (2) is guilty of an indictable offence
and is liable to imprisonment for life.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   8. In any prosecution for a violation of subsection 4(2), if the
accused does not plead guilty, the trial shall proceed as if it were a
prosecution for an offence under section 3, and after the close of the case
for the prosecution and after the accused has had an opportunity to make full
answer and defence, the court shall make a finding as to whether or not the
accused was in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3; if the
court finds that the accused was not in possession of the narcotic contrary to
section 3, he shall be acquitted but if the court finds that the accused was
in possession of the narcotic contrary to section 3, he shall be given an
opportunity of establishing that he was not in possession of the narcotic for
the purpose of trafficking, and thereafter the prosecutor shall be given an
opportunity of adducing evidence to establish that the accused was in possession
of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking; if the accused establishes
that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking,
he shall be acquitted of the offence as charged but he shall be convicted
of an offence under section 3 and sentenced accordingly; and if the accused
fails to establish that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the
purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the offence as charged and
sentenced accordingly.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal.

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society.

Facts

 

3.                The respondent, David Edwin Oakes, was
charged with unlawful possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking,
contrary to s. 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. He elected trial by
magistrate without a jury. At trial, the Crown adduced evidence to establish
that Mr. Oakes was found in possession of eight one gram vials of cannabis
resin in the form of hashish oil. Upon a further search conducted at the police
station, $619.45 was located. Mr. Oakes told the police that he had bought ten
vials of hashish oil for $150 for his own use, and that the $619.45 was from a
workers' compensation cheque. He elected not to call evidence as to possession
of the narcotic. Pursuant to the procedural provisions of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, the trial judge proceeded to make a finding that it was beyond
a reasonable doubt that Mr. Oakes was in possession of the narcotic. 

 

4.                Following this finding, Mr. Oakes
brought a motion to challenge the constitutional validity of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, which he maintained imposes a burden on an accused to prove
that he or she was not in possession for the purpose of trafficking. He argued
that s. 8 violates the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of
the Charter .

Judgments

 

(a) Ontario Provincial Court (R. v. Oakes (1982), 38
O.R. (2d) 598)

 

5.                At trial, Walker Prov. Ct. J. borrowed
the words of Laskin C.J. in R. v. Shelley, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 196, at p.
202, and found there was no rational or necessary connection between the fact
proved, i.e., possession of the drug, and the conclusion asked to be
drawn, namely, possession for the purpose of trafficking. Walker Prov. Ct. J.
held that, to the extent that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act requires
this presumption and the resultant conviction, it is inoperative as a violation
of the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

6.                Walker Prov. Ct. J. added that the
reverse onus in s. 8 would not be invalid if the Crown had adduced evidence of
possession as well as evidence from which it could be inferred beyond a
reasonable doubt that the possession was for the purpose of trafficking. If
this were done, there would be a sufficient rational connection between the
fact of possession and the presumed fact of trafficking.

7.                Martin J.A., writing for a unanimous
court, dismissed the appeal and held the reverse onus provision in s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act unconstitutional.

 

8.                Martin J.A. stated that, as a general
rule, a reverse onus clause which places a burden on the accused to disprove on
a balance of probabilities an essential element of an offence contravenes the
right to be presumed innocent. Nevertheless, he held that some reverse onus
provisions may be constitutionally valid provided they constitute reasonable
limitations on the right to be presumed innocent and are demonstrably justified
in a free and democratic society. 

 

9.                To determine whether a particular
reverse onus provision is legitimate, Martin J.A. outlined a two‑pronged
inquiry. First, it is necessary to pass a threshold test which he explained as
follows, at p. 146:

 

                   The
threshold question in determining the legitimacy of a particular reverse onus
provision is whether the reverse onus clause is justifiable in the sense that
it is reasonable for Parliament to place the burden of proof on the accused in
relation to an ingredient of the offence in question. In determining the
threshold question consideration should be given to a number of factors,
including such factors as: (a) the magnitude of the evil sought to be
suppressed, which may be measured by the gravity of the harm resulting from the
offence or by the frequency of the occurrence of the offence or by both
criteria; (b) the difficulty of the prosecution making proof of the presumed
fact, and (c) the relative ease with which the accused may prove or disprove
the presumed fact. Manifestly, a reverse onus provision placing the burden of
proof on the accused with respect to a fact which it is not rationally open to
him to prove or disprove cannot be justified.

 

10.              If the reverse onus provision meets these
criteria, due regard having been given to Parliament's assessment of the need
for the provision, a second test must then be satisfied. This second test was
described by Martin J.A. as the ""rational connection test"". According
to it, to be reasonable, the proven fact (e.g., possession) must
rationally tend to prove the presumed fact (e.g., an intention to
traffic). In other words, the proven fact must raise a probability that the
presumed fact exists.

 

11.              In considering s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, Martin J.A. focused primarily on the second test at p. 147:

 

                   I have
reached the conclusion that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is
constitutionally invalid because of the lack of a rational connection between
the proved fact (possession) and the presumed fact (an intention to
traffic).... Mere possession of a small quantity of a narcotic drug does not
support an inference of possession for the purpose of trafficking or even tend
to prove an intent to traffic. Moreover, upon proof of possession, s. 8 casts
upon the accused the burden of disproving not some formal element of the
offence but the burden of disproving the very essence of the offence.

 

12.              Martin J.A. added that it is not for
courts to attempt to rewrite s. 8 by applying it on a case by case basis.
Furthermore, where a rational connection does exist between possession and the
presumed intention to traffic, such as ""where the possession of a narcotic
drug is of such a nature as to be indicative of trafficking, the common sense
of a jury can ordinarily be relied upon to arrive at a proper conclusion"".
There would not, therefore, be any need for a statutory presumption.

 

13.              One final note should be made regarding
Martin J.A.'s judgment. In assessing whether or not s. 8 was a reasonable
limitation on the constitutional protection of the presumption of innocence,
Martin J.A. combined the analysis of s. 11 (d) with s. 1 . He held that
the requirements of s. 1 , that a limitation be reasonable and demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society, provided the standard for
interpreting the phrase ""according to law"" in s. 11 (d). 

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Issues

 

14.              The constitutional question in this appeal
is stated as follows:

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and thus of no force and effect?

 

Two specific questions are raised by this general question: (1) does s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act violate s. 11 (d) of the Charter ;
and, (2) if it does, is s. 8  a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society for the purpose of s. 1 
of the Charter ? If the answer to (1) is affirmative and the answer to
(2) negative, then the constitutional question must be answered in the
affirmative.

 

                                                                    V

 

Does s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act Violate s. 11(d)
of the Charter ?

 

(a) The Meaning of s. 8

 

15.              Before examining the presumption of
innocence contained in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it is necessary
to clarify the meaning of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act. The
procedural steps contemplated by s. 8  were clearly outlined by Branca J.A. in R.
v. Babcock and Auld, [1967] 2 C.C.C. 235 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 247:

 

                   (A) The
accused is charged with possession of a forbidden drug for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

                   (B) The
trial of the accused on this charge then proceeds as if it was a prosecution
against the accused on a simple charge of possession of the forbidden drug....

 

                   (C)
When the Crown has adduced its evidence on the basis that the charge was a
prosecution for simple possession, the accused is then given the statutory
right or opportunity of making a full answer and defence to the charge of
simple possession....

 

                   (D)
When this has been done the Court must make a finding as to whether the accused
was in possession of narcotics contrary to s. 3 of the new Act. (Unlawful
possession of a forbidden narcotic drug).

 

                   (E)
Assuming that the Court so finds, it is then that an onus is placed upon the
accused in the sense that an opportunity must be given to the accused of
establishing that he was not in possession of a narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

                   (F)
When the accused has been given this opportunity the prosecutor may then
establish that the possession of the accused was for the purpose of
trafficking....

 

                   (G) It
is then that the Court must find whether or not the accused has discharged the
onus placed upon him under and by the said section.

 

                   (H) If
the Court so finds, the accused must be acquitted of the offence as charged,
namely, possession for the purpose of trafficking, but in that event the
accused must be convicted of the simple charge of unlawful possession of a
forbidden narcotic....

 

                   (I) If
the accused does not so establish he must then be convicted of the full offence
as charged. 

 

 

Mr. Justice Branca then added at pp. 247‑48:

 

                   It is
quite clear to me that under s. 8 of the new Act the trial must be divided into
two phases. In the first phase the sole issue to be determined is whether or
not the accused is guilty of simple possession of a narcotic. This issue is to
be determined upon evidence relevant only to the issue of possession. In the
second phase the question to be resolved is whether or not the possession
charged is for the purpose of trafficking.

 

16.              Against the backdrop of these procedural
steps, we must consider the nature of the statutory presumption contained in s.
8 and the type of burden it places on an accused. The relevant portions of
s. 8 read:

 

                   8. ...if the court finds that the accused was in possession of the
narcotic ... he shall be given an opportunity of establishing that he was not
in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking ... if the accused
fails to establish that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the
purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the offence as charged....

 

17.              In determining the meaning of these words,
it is helpful to consider in a general sense the nature of presumptions.
Presumptions can be classified into two general categories: presumptions without
basic facts and presumptions with basic facts. A presumption without a
basic fact is simply a conclusion which is to be drawn until the contrary is
proved. A presumption with a basic fact entails a conclusion to be drawn upon
proof of the basic fact (see Cross on Evidence, 5th ed., at pp. 122‑23).

 

18.              Basic fact presumptions can be further
categorized into permissive and mandatory presumptions. A permissive
presumption leaves it optional as to whether the inference of the presumed fact
is drawn following proof of the basic fact. A mandatory presumption requires
that the inference be made.

 

19.              Presumptions may also be either rebuttable
or irrebuttable. If a presumption is rebuttable, there are three potential ways
the presumed fact can be rebutted. First, the accused may be required merely to
raise a reasonable doubt as to its existence. Secondly, the accused may have an
evidentiary burden to adduce sufficient evidence to bring into question the
truth of the presumed fact. Thirdly, the accused may have a legal or persuasive
burden to prove on a balance of probabilities the non‑existence of the presumed
fact.

 

20.              Finally, presumptions are often referred
to as either presumptions of law or presumptions of fact. The latter entail
""frequently recurring examples of circumstantial evidence"" (Cross
on Evidence, supra, at p. 124) while the former involve actual legal
rules.

 

21.              To return to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, it is my view that, upon a finding beyond a reasonable doubt
of possession of a narcotic, the accused has the legal burden of proving on a
balance of probabilities that he or she was not in possession of the narcotic
for the purpose of trafficking. Once the basic fact of possession is proven, a
mandatory presumption of law arises against the accused that he or she had the
intention to traffic. Moreover, the accused will be found guilty of the offence
of trafficking unless he or she can rebut this presumption on a balance of
probabilities. This interpretation of s. 8 is supported by the courts in a
number of jurisdictions: R. v. Carroll (1983), 147 D.L.R. (3d) 92
(P.E.I.S.C. in banco); R. v. Cook (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 419
(N.S.C.A.); R. v. O’Day (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 227 (N.B.C.A.); R. v.
Landry (1983), 7 C.C.C. (3d) 555 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Stanger (1983),
7 C.C.C. (3d) 337 (Alta. C.A.) 

 

22.              In some decisions it has been held that s.
8 of the Narcotic Control Act is constitutional because it places only
an evidentiary burden rather than a legal burden on the accused. The ultimate
legal burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt remains with the Crown
and the presumption of innocence is not offended. (R. v. Therrien
(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 31 (Ont. Co. Ct.); R. v. Fraser (1982), 138
D.L.R. (3d) 488 (Sask. Q.B.); R. v. Kupczyniski, (June 23, 1982,
unreported, Ont. Co. Ct.))

 

23.              This same approach was relied on in R.
v. Sharpe (1961), 131 C.C.C. 75 (Ont. C.A.), a Canadian Bill of Rights
decision on the presumption of innocence. In that case, a provision in the Opium
and Narcotic Drug Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 201, similar to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, was interpreted as shifting merely the secondary burden of
adducing evidence onto the accused. The primary onus remained with the Crown.
In R. v. Silk, [1970] 3 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (B.C.C.A.), the British Columbia
Court of Appeal held that s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights
had not been infringed because s. 33  of the Food and Drugs Act , (now
R.S.C. 1970, c. F‑27, s. 35) required only that an accused raise a
reasonable doubt that the purpose of his or her possession was trafficking.
This decision, however, was not followed in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R.
303, nor in R. v. Erdman (1971), 24 C.R.N.S. 216 (B.C.C.A.)

 

24.              Those decisions which have held that only
the secondary or evidentiary burden shifts are not persuasive with respect to
the Narcotic Control Act. As Ritchie J. found in R. v. Appleby, supra,
(though addressing a different statutory provision) the phrase ""to
establish"" is the equivalent of ""to prove"". The legislature, by using
the word ""establish"" in s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act,
intended to impose a legal burden on the accused. This is most apparent in the
words ""if the accused fails to establish that he was not in possession of
the narcotic for the purpose of trafficking, he shall be convicted of the
offence as charged"".

 

25.              In the Appleby case, Ritchie J.
also held that the accused is required to disprove the presumed fact according
to the civil standard of proof, on a balance of probabilities. He rejected the
criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, relying, inter alia,
upon the following passage from the House of Lords' decision in Public
Prosecutor v. Yuvaraj, [1970] 2 W.L.R. 226, at p. 232: 

 

                   Generally
speaking, no onus lies upon a defendant in criminal proceedings to prove or
disprove any fact: it is sufficient for his acquittal if any of the facts
which, if they existed, would constitute the offence with which he is charged
are ""not proved"". But exceptionally, as in the present case, an
enactment creating an offence expressly provides that if other facts are
proved, a particular fact, the existence of which is a necessary factual
ingredient of the offence, shall be presumed or deemed to exist ""unless
the contrary is proved"". In such a case the consequence of finding that
that particular fact is ""disproved"" will be an acquittal, whereas the
absence of such a finding will have the consequence of a conviction. Where this
is the consequence of a fact's being ""disproved"" there can be no
grounds in public policy for requiring that exceptional degree of certainty as
excludes all reasonable doubt that that fact does not exist. In their
Lordships' opinion the general rule applies in such a case and it is sufficient
if the court considers that upon the evidence before it it is more likely than
not that the fact does not exist. The test is the same as that applied in civil
proceedings: the balance of probabilities.

 

26.              I conclude that s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act contains a reverse onus provision imposing a legal burden on an
accused to prove on a balance of probabilities that he or she was not in
possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. It is therefore
necessary to determine whether s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act offends
the right to be ""presumed innocent until proven guilty"" as guaranteed
by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .

 

(b)               The Presumption of Innocence and s. 11 (d)
of the Charter 

 

27.              Section 11 (d) of the Charter 
constitutionally entrenches the presumption of innocence as part of the supreme
law of Canada. For ease of reference, I set out this provision again:

 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal.

 

28.              To interpret the meaning of s. 11 (d),
it is important to adopt a purposive approach. As this Court stated in R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, at p. 344:

 

The meaning of a right or
freedom guaranteed by the Charter  was to be ascertained by an analysis
of the purpose of such a guarantee; it was to be understood, in other
words, in the light of the interests it was meant to protect.

 

                   In my
view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom
in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger
objects of the Charter  itself, to the language chosen to articulate the
specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined,
and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights
and freedoms....

 

To identify the underlying purpose of the Charter  right in
question, therefore, it is important to begin by understanding the cardinal
values it embodies. 

 

29.              The presumption of innocence is a hallowed
principle lying at the very heart of criminal law. Although protected expressly
in s. 11 (d) of the Charter , the presumption of innocence is
referable and integral to the general protection of life, liberty and security
of the person contained in s. 7  of the Charter  (see Re B.C. Motor
Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, per Lamer J.) The presumption of
innocence protects the fundamental liberty and human dignity of any and every
person accused by the State of criminal conduct. An individual charged with a
criminal offence faces grave social and personal consequences, including
potential loss of physical liberty, subjection to social stigma and ostracism
from the community, as well as other social, psychological and economic harms.
In light of the gravity of these consequences, the presumption of innocence is
crucial. It ensures that until the State proves an accused's guilt beyond all
reasonable doubt, he or she is innocent. This is essential in a society
committed to fairness and social justice. The presumption of innocence confirms
our faith in humankind; it reflects our belief that individuals are decent and
law‑abiding members of the community until proven otherwise.

 

30.              The presumption of innocence has enjoyed
longstanding recognition at common law. In the leading case, Woolmington v.
Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462 (H.L.), Viscount Sankey
wrote at pp. 481‑82:

 

Throughout the web of the
English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the
duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt subject to what I have
already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory
exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a
reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or
the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious
intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is
entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the
principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of
the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.

 

Subsequent Canadian cases have cited the Woolmington principle
with approval (see, for example, Manchuk v. The King, [1938] S.C.R. 341,
at p. 349; R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, at p.
1316).

 

31.              Further evidence of the widespread
acceptance of the principle of the presumption of innocence is its inclusion in
the major international human rights documents. Article 11(I) of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted December 10, 1948 by the General
Assembly of the United Nations, provides:

 

                                                             Article 11 

 

I. Everyone charged with a
penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty
according to law in a public trial at which he has had all the guarantees
necessary for his defence.

 

In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
1966, art. 14(2) states: 

 

                                                             Article 14

 

2. Everyone charged with a
criminal offence shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved
guilty according to law.

 

Canada acceded to this Covenant, and the Optional Protocol which sets
up machinery for implementing the Covenant, on May 19, 1976. Both came into
effect on August 19, 1976.

 

32.              In light of the above, the right to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty requires that s. 11 (d) have, at a
minimum, the following content. First, an individual must be proven guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, it is the State which must bear the burden
of proof. As Lamer J. stated in Dubois v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R.
350, at p. 357:

 

                   Section
11 (d) imposes upon the Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt as well as that of making out the case against the
accused before he or she need respond, either by testifying or calling other
evidence.

 

Third, criminal prosecutions must be carried out in accordance with
lawful procedures and fairness. The latter part of s. 11 (d), which
requires the proof of guilt ""according to law in a fair and public hearing
by an independent and impartial tribunal"", underlines the importance of
this procedural requirement.

 

(c)               Authorities on Reverse Onus Provisions and
the Presumption of Innocence

 

33.              Having considered the general meaning of
the presumption of innocence, it is now, I think, desirable to review briefly
the authorities on reverse onus clauses in Canada and other jurisdictions.

 

(i)                The
Canadian Bill of Rights Jurisprudence

 

34.              Section 2(f) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, which safeguards the presumption of innocence, provides:

 

                   2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is expressly declared by an Act
of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian
Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied as not to abrogate, abridge or
infringe or to authorize the abrogation, abridgment or infringement of any of
the rights or freedoms herein recognized and declared, and in particular, no
law of Canada shall be construed or applied so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 

(f) deprive a
person charged with a criminal offence of the right to be presumed innocent
until proved guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an
independent and impartial tribunal....

 

The wording of this section closely parallels that of s. 11 (d).
For this reason, one of the Crown's primary contentions is that the Canadian
Bill of Rights jurisprudence should be determinative of the outcome of the
present appeal.

 

35.              The leading case decided under s. 2(f)
of the Canadian Bill of Rights and relied on by the Crown, is R. v.
Appleby, supra. In that case, the accused had challenged s. 224A(1)(a)
(now s. 237(1)(a)) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34,
which imposes a burden upon an accused to prove that he or she, though
occupying the driver's seat, did not enter the vehicle for the purpose of
setting it in motion and did not, therefore, have care and control. This Court
rejected the arguments of the accused that s. 2(f) had been violated; it
relied on the Woolmington case which held that the presumption of
innocence was subject to ""statutory exceptions"". As Ritchie J. stated
in his judgment for the majority at pp. 315‑16:

 

It seems to me, therefore,
that if Woolmington's case is to be accepted, the words ""presumed
innocent until proved guilty according to law ..."" as they appear in
s. 2(f) of the Bill of Rights, must be taken to envisage a
law which recognizes the existence of statutory exceptions reversing the onus
of proof with respect to one or more ingredients of an offence in cases where
certain specific facts have been proved by the Crown in relation to such
ingredients.

 

36.              In a concurring opinion, Laskin J. (as he
then was) put forward an alternative test. He chose not to follow Ritchie J.'s
approach of reading a statutory exception limitation into the phrase
""according to law"" in s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of
Rights, and said at p. 317:

 

                   I do
not construe s. 2(f) as self‑defeating because of the phrase
""according to law"" which appears therein. Hence, it would be
offensive to s. 2(f) for a federal criminal enactment to place upon the
accused the ultimate burden of establishing his innocence with respect to any
element of the offence charged. The ""right to be presumed innocent"",
of which s. 2(f) speaks, is, in popular terms, a way of expressing the
fact that the Crown has the ultimate burden of establishing guilt; if there is
any reasonable doubt at the conclusion of the case on any element of the
offence charged, an accused person must be acquitted. In a more refined sense,
the presumption of innocence gives an accused the initial benefit of a right of
silence and the ultimate benefit (after the Crown's evidence is in and as well
any evidence tendered on behalf of the accused) of any reasonable doubt: see Coffin
v. U.S. (1895), 156 U.S. 432 at 452.

 

Nevertheless, Laskin J. went on to hold that the presumption of
innocence is not violated by ""any statutory or non‑statutory burden
upon an accused to adduce evidence to neutralize, or counter on a balance of
probabilities, the effect of evidence presented by the Crown"" (p. 318).
The test, according to Laskin J., is whether the legislative provision calls
for a finding of guilt even though there is a reasonable doubt as to the
culpability of the accused. This would seem to prohibit the imposition of any
legal burden on the accused; however, Laskin J. upheld a statutory provision
which would appear to have done precisely that.

 

37.              In a subsequent case, R. v. Shelley,
supra, involving a reverse onus provision regarding unlawful
importation, Laskin C.J. discussed further the views he had articulated in Appleby
at p. 200:

 

                   This
Court held in R. v. Appleby that a reverse onus provision, which goes no
farther than to require an accused to offer proof on a balance of
probabilities, does not necessarily violate the presumption of innocence under
s. 2(f). It would, of course, be clearly incompatible with s. 2(f)
for a statute to put upon an accused a reverse onus of proving a fact in issue
beyond a reasonable doubt. In so far as the onus goes no farther than to
require an accused to prove as essential fact upon a balance of probabilities,
the essential fact must be one which is rationally open to the accused to prove
or disprove, as the case may be. If it is one which an accused cannot
reasonably be expected to prove, being beyond his knowledge or beyond what he
may reasonably be expected to know, it amounts to a requirement that is
impossible to meet. 

 

In addition, Laskin C.J. sowed the seeds for the development of a
""rational connection test"" for determining the validity of a reverse
onus provision when he stated at p. 202:

 

                   It is
evident to me in this case that there is on the record no rational or necessary
connection between the fact proved, i.e. possession of goods of foreign
origin, and the conclusion of unlawful importation which the accused under s.
248(1) must, to avoid conviction, disprove.

 

38.              Although there are important lessons to be
learned from the Canadian Bill of Rights jurisprudence, it does not
constitute binding authority in relation to the constitutional interpretation
of the Charter . As this Court held in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.,
supra, the Charter , as a constitutional document, is fundamentally
different from the statutory Canadian Bill of Rights, which was
interpreted as simply recognizing and declaring existing rights. (See also Singh
v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177 per
Wilson J.; R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 613, per Le Dain J.) In
rejecting the Canadian Bill of Rights religion cases as determinative of
the meaning of freedom of religion under the Charter  in R. v. Big M
Drug Mart Ltd., the Court had occasion to say at pp. 343‑44:

 

I agree with the submission
of the respondent that the Charter  is intended to set a standard upon
which present as well as future legislation is to be tested. Therefore
the meaning of the concept of freedom of conscience and religion is not to be
determined solely by the degree to which that right was enjoyed by Canadians
prior to the proclamation of the Charter . For this reason, Robertson
and Rosetanni, supra, cannot be determinative of the meaning of
""freedom of conscience and religion"" under the Charter . We
must look, rather, to the distinctive principles of constitutional
interpretation appropriate to expounding the supreme law of Canada.

 

39.              With this in mind, one cannot but question
the appropriateness of reading into the phrase ""according to law"" in
s. 11 (d) of the Charter  the statutory exceptions acknowledged in Woolmington
and in Appleby. The Woolmington case was decided in the context
of a legal system with no constitutionally entrenched human rights document. In
Canada, we have tempered parliamentary supremacy by entrenching important
rights and freedoms in the Constitution. Viscount Sankey's statutory exception
proviso is clearly not applicable in this context and would subvert the very
purpose of the entrenchment of the presumption of innocence in the Charter .
I do not, therefore, feel constrained in this case by the interpretation of s.
2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights presented in the majority
judgment in Appleby. Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is not
rendered constitutionally valid simply by virtue of the fact that it is a
statutory provision.

 

(ii)               Canadian
Charter Jurisprudence

 

40.              In addition to the present case, there
have been a number of other provincial appellate level judgments addressing the
meaning of the presumption of innocence contained in s. 11 (d). This
jurisprudence provides a comprehensive and persuasive source of insight into
the questions raised in this appeal. In particular, six appellate level courts,
in addition to the Ontario Court of Appeal, have held that s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act violates the Charter : R. v. Carroll, supra;
R. v. Cook, supra; R. v. O’Day, supra; R. v.
Stanger, supra; R. v. Landry, supra; R. v. Stock
(1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 319 (B.C.C.A.) 

 

41.              Following the decision of the Ontario
Court of Appeal in the present case, the Prince Edward Island Supreme Court (in
banco) rendered its decision in R. v. Carroll, supra.
Writing for the majority, MacDonald J. held at p. 105:

 

Unless a provision falls
within s. 1  of the Charter , there cannot be a requirement that an accused must
prove an essential positive element of the Crown's case other than by raising a
reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence cannot be said to exist if by
shifting the persuasive burden the court is required to convict even if a
reasonable doubt may be said to exist.

 

In a concurring judgment, Mitchell J. commented at pp. 107‑08:

 

                   Section
11 (d) gives an accused person the right to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty. It follows that if an accused is to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty, he must not be convicted unless and until the Crown has proven
each and all of the elements necessary to constitute the crime.

 

Applying these legal conclusions to s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act,
the Court held that s. 11 (d) had been violated. As Mitchell J. stated at
p. 108:

 

                   Under
s. 8 an accused is not presumed innocent until proven guilty. He is only
presumed innocent until found in possession. Once the Crown proves the accused had
possession of the narcotic, he is presumed to be guilty of an intention to
traffic until he proves otherwise.

 

42.              The Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appellate
Division, also concluded that s. 8 is an unconstitutional violation of the s.
11 (d) presumption of innocence in its decision in R. v. Cook, supra.
After reviewing R. v. Oakes, supra, and R. v. Carroll, supra,
Hart J.A. concluded at pp. 435‑36:

 

                   Section
8 of the Narcotic Control Act is a piece of legislation that attempts to
relieve the Crown of its normal burden of proof by use of what is known as a
reverse onus. Different types of reverse onus have been known to the law and
proof of a case with the aid of a reverse onus can in my opinion, fall into the
wording of s. 11 (d) of the Charter  as being proof ""according
to law"".... I know of no justification, however, for holding that it would
be ""according to law"" to allow use of a reverse onus clause which
permitted the Crown the assistance of a provision which relieved it from
calling any probative evidence to establish one of the essential elements of an
offence.

 

Although concurring in result, Jones J.A. maintained that the
reasonableness test should be applied with respect to s. 1  and not with respect
to the words ""according to law"" in s. 11 (d).

 

The test of reasonableness
should be available in considering the secondary question under s. 1  of the
Charter . It is important that the burden of proof should be on the Crown to
show that a statute which violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter  is
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. (p. 439)

 

43.              In R. v. O’Day, supra, the
New Brunswick Court of Appeal struck down s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
and registered its agreement with the three earlier provincial appellate level
courts. 

 

44.              The Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.
Stanger, supra, also found s. 8 unconstitutional; however, the court
was not unanimous in this conclusion. On the meaning of s. 11 (d),
Stevenson J.A., writing for the majority, paraphrased Martin J.A.'s comment in Oakes
and stated at p. 351 that the presumption of innocence meant ""first, that
an accused is innocent until proven guilty in accordance with established procedure,
and secondly, that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt"". Mr.
Justice Stevenson also cited MacDonald J.'s comment in Carroll that the
presumption of innocence is maintained ""as long as the prosecution has the
final burden of establishing guilt, on any element of the offence charged,
beyond a reasonable doubt"" (supra, p. 98).

 

45.              I should add that the majority, in Stanger,
correctly rejected the applicability of the Privy Council decision in Ong Ah
Chuan v. Public Prosecutor, [1981] A.C. 648. That case concerned
constitutional provisions of Singapore which are significantly different from
those of the Charter ; in particular, they do not contain an explicit
endorsement of the presumption of innocence. Moreover, the Privy Council did
not read this principle into the general due process protections of the
Constitution of Singapore.

 

46.              In R. v. Landry, supra, the
Quebec Court of Appeal invalidated s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act and
extended its conclusions to s. 2(f) of the Canadian Bill of Rights.
As Malouf J.A. stated at p. 561:

 

                   Both
the Bill of Rights and the Charter  recognize the right of an accused to
be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. I cannot accept that
such a basic and fundamental principle can be set aside by such a reverse onus
provision.

 

47.              Finally, in a very brief judgment, R.
v. Stock, supra, the British Columbia Court of Appeal concurred with
the Court of Appeal decisions reviewed above, endorsing in particular the
Ontario Court of Appeal decision in Oakes. An earlier British Columbia
Court of Appeal opinion, Re Anson and The Queen (1983), 146 D.L.R. (3d)
661 (B.C.C.A.), had dismissed an appeal from a ruling which had upheld the
constitutionality of s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act; however, the
basis for the denial of the appeal was procedural. The court did not assess the
constitutionality of s. 8 in relation to the presumption of innocence.

 

48.              There have also been a number of cases in
which the meaning of s. 11 (d) has been considered in relation to other
legislative provisions; see, for example, R. v. Holmes (1983), 41 O.R.
(2d) 250 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Whyte (1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 277 (B.C.C.A.),
leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted; R. v. Lee’s Poultry Ltd. (1985), 17
C.C.C. 539 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. T. (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 125 (N.S.C.A.); R.
v. Kowalczuk (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 25 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Schwartz
(1983), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 34 (Man. C.A.); Re Boyle and The Queen (1983), 41
O.R. (2d) 713 (Ont. C.A.) 

 

49.              To summarize, the Canadian Charter 
jurisprudence on the presumption of innocence in s. 11 (d) and reverse
onus provisions appears to have solidly accorded a high degree of protection to
the presumption of innocence. Any infringements of this right are permissible
only when, in the words of s. 1  of the Charter , they are reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

(iii)               United
States Jurisprudence

 

50.              In the United States, protection of the
presumption of innocence is not explicit. Rather, it has been read into the
""due process"" provisions of the American Bill of Rights
contained in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the
United States of America. An extensive review of the United States case law
is provided in Martin J.A.'s judgment for the Ontario Court of Appeal. I will,
therefore, merely highlight the major jurisprudential developments.

 

51.              In Tot v. United States, 319 U.S.
463 (1943), Roberts J. outlined the following test at pp. 467‑68:

 

... a statutory
presumption cannot be sustained if there be no rational connection between the
fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed, if the inference of the one from
proof of the other is arbitrary because of lack of connnection between the two
in common experience.

 

The comparative convenience of producing evidence was also acknowledged
as a corollary test. The case involved a presumption to be drawn, from the
possession of firearms by a person convicted of a previous crime of violence,
that the firearms were illegally obtained through interstate or foreign
commerce. Of note was Roberts J.'s comment that even if a rational connection
had been proved, the statutory presumption could not be sustained because of
the prejudical reliance on a past conviction as part of the basic fact. The
accused would be discredited in the eyes of the jury even before he attempted
to disprove the presumed fact.

 

52.              In Leary v. United States, 395 U.S.
6 (1969), Harlan J. articulated a more stringent test for invalidity at p. 36:

 

... a criminal statutory
presumption must be regarded as ""irrational"" or
""arbitrary"", and hence unconstitutional, unless it can at least be
said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact is more likely than not
to flow from the proved fact on which it is made to depend.

 

Harlan J. also noted that since the statutory presumption was invalid
under the above test, ""we need not reach the question whether a criminal
presumption which passes muster when so judged must also satisfy the criminal
`reasonable doubt' standard if proof of the crime charged or an essential
element thereof depends upon its use"" (footnote 64). 

 

53.              The United States Supreme Court did answer
this question in County Court of Ulster County, New York v. Allen, 442
U.S. 140 (1979). It held that where a mandatory criminal presumption was
imposed by statute, the State may not ""rest its case entirely on a
presumption unless the fact proved is sufficient to support the inference of
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" (p. 167). A mere rational connection is
insufficient. This case illustrates the high degree of constitutional
protection accorded the principle that an accused must be found guilty beyond a
reasonable doubt. The rationale for this is well stated by Brennan J. in
In Re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), at pp. 363‑64:

 

                   The
requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has this vital role in our
criminal procedure for cogent reasons. The accused during a criminal
prosecution has at stake interests of immense importance, both because of the
possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the
certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction. Accordingly, a
society that values the good name and freedom of every individual should not
condemn a man for commission of a crime when there is reasonable doubt about
his guilt.

 

(iv)              European
Convention on Human Rights Jurisprudence

 

54.              As mentioned above, international
developments in human rights law have afforded protection to the principle of
the presumption of innocence. The jurisprudence on The European Convention
on Human Rights includes a consideration of the legitimacy of reverse onus
provisions. Section 6(2) of The European Convention on Human Rights
reads:

 

                                                              Article 6

 

2. Everyone charged with a
criminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to
law.

 

The meaning of s. 6(2) was clarified in the Pfunders Case (Austria
v. Italy) (1963), 6 Yearbook E.C.H.R. 740, at p. 782 and p. 784:

 

                   This
text, according to which everyone charged with a criminal offence shall be
presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law, requires firstly that
court judges in fulfilling their duties should not start with the conviction or
assumption that the accused committed the act with which he is charged. In
other words, the onus to prove guilt falls upon the Prosecution, and any doubt
is to the benefit of the accused. Moreover, the judges must permit the latter
to produce evidence in rebuttal. In their judgment they can find him guilty
only on the basis of direct or indirect evidence sufficiently strong in the
eyes of the law to establish his guilt.

 

55.              Although the Commission has endorsed the
general importance of the requirement that the prosecution prove the accused's
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it has acknowledged the permissibility of certain
exceptions to this principle. For example, the Commission upheld a statutory
reverse onus provision in which a man living with or habitually in the company
of a prostitute is presumed to be knowingly living on the earnings of
prostitution unless he proves otherwise (X against the United Kingdom,
Appl'n. No. 5124/71, Collection of Decisions, E.C.H.R., 135). The Commission
noted the importance of examining the substance and effect of a statutory
reverse onus. It concluded, however, at p. 135: 

 

The statutory presumption
in the present case is restrictively worded. ... The presumption is neither
irrebuttable nor unreasonable. To oblige the prosecution to obtain direct
evidence of ""living on immoral earnings"" would in most cases make its
task impossible.

 

(See discussion in Francis Jacobs, The European Convention on Human
Rights (Oxford: 1975), pp. 113‑14.)

 

(d)               Conclusion Regarding s. 11(d) of the Charter 
and s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act

 

56.              This review of the authorities lays the
groundwork for formulating some general conclusions regarding reverse onus
provisions and the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d). We can then
proceed to apply these principles to the particulars of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act.

 

57.              In general one must, I think, conclude
that a provision which requires an accused to disprove on a balance of
probabilities the existence of a presumed fact, which is an important element
of the offence in question, violates the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d).
If an accused bears the burden of disproving on a balance of probabilities an
essential element of an offence, it would be possible for a conviction to occur
despite the existence of a reasonable doubt. This would arise if the accused adduced
sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt as to his or her innocence but
did not convince the jury on a balance of probabilities that the presumed fact
was untrue.

 

58.              The fact that the standard is only the
civil one does not render a reverse onus clause constitutional. As Sir Rupert
Cross commented in the Rede Lectures, ""The Golden Thread of the
English Criminal Law: The Burden of Proof"", delivered in 1976 at the
University of Toronto, at pp. 11‑13:

 

                   It is
sometimes said that exceptions to the Woolmington rule are acceptable because,
whenever the burden of proof on any issue in a criminal case is borne by the
accused, he only has to satisfy the jury on the balance of probabilities,
whereas on issues on which the Crown bears the burden of proof the jury must be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.... The fact that the standard is
lower when the accused bears the burden of proof than it is when the burden of
proof is borne by the prosecution is no answer to my objection to the existence
of exceptions to the Woolmington rule as it does not alter the fact that a jury
or bench of magistrates may have to convict the accused although they are far
from sure of his guilt.

 

59.              As we have seen, the potential for a
rational connection between the basic fact and the presumed fact to justify a
reverse onus provision has been elaborated in some of the cases discussed above
and is now known as the ""rational connection test"". In the context of
s. 11(d), however, the following question arises: if we apply the
rational connection test to the consideration of whether s. 11(d) has
been violated, are we adequately protecting the constitutional principle of the
presumption of innocence? As Professors MacKay and Cromwell point out in their
article ""Oakes: A Bold Initiative Impeded by Old Ghosts"" (1983), 32
C.R. (3d) 221, at p. 233: 

 

The rational connection
test approves a provision that forces the trier to infer a fact that may
be simply rationally connected to the proved fact. Why does it follow that such
a provision does not offend the constitutional right to be proved guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt?

 

A basic fact may rationally tend to prove a presumed fact, but not
prove its existence beyond a reasonable doubt. An accused person could thereby
be convicted despite the presence of a reasonable doubt. This would violate the
presumption of innocence.

 

60.              I should add that this questioning of the
constitutionality of the ""rational connection test"" as a guide to
interpreting s. 11(d) does not minimize its importance. The appropriate
stage for invoking the rational connection test, however, is under s. 1  of the Charter .
This consideration did not arise under the Canadian Bill of Rights
because of the absence of an equivalent to s. 1 . At the Court of Appeal level
in the present case, Martin J.A. sought to combine the analysis of s. 11 (d)
and s. 1  to overcome the limitations of the Canadian Bill of Rights
jurisprudence. To my mind, it is highly desirable to keep s. 1  and s. 11 (d)
analytically distinct. Separating the analysis into two components is
consistent with the approach this Court has taken to the Charter  to date
(see R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra; Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
[1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1
S.C.R. 357).

 

61.              To return to s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act, I am in no doubt whatsoever that it violates s. 11 (d)
of the Charter  by requiring the accused to prove on a balance of
probabilities that he was not in possession of the narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking. Mr. Oakes is compelled by s. 8  to prove he is not guilty of
the offence of trafficking. He is thus denied his right to be presumed innocent
and subjected to the potential penalty of life imprisonment unless he can rebut
the presumption. This is radically and fundamentally inconsistent with the
societal values of human dignity and liberty which we espouse, and is directly
contrary to the presumption of innocence enshrined in s. 11 (d). Let us
turn now to s. 1  of the Charter .

 

                                                                    V

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act a Reasonable and
Demonstrably Justified Limit Pursuant to s. 1  of the Charter ?

 

62.              The Crown submits that even if s. 8 of the
Narcotic Control Act violates s. 11 (d) of the Charter , it
can still be upheld as a reasonable limit under s. 1  which, as has been
mentioned, provides:

 

                   1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  guarantees the
rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits
prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. 

 

The question whether the limit is ""prescribed by law"" is not
contentious in the present case since s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
is a duly enacted legislative provision. It is, however, necessary to determine
if the limit on Mr. Oakes' right, as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter ,
is ""reasonable"" and ""demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society"" for the purpose of s. 1  of the Charter , and
thereby saved from inconsistency with the Constitution.

 

63.              It is important to observe at the outset
that s. 1  has two functions: first, it constitutionally guarantees the rights
and freedoms set out in the provisions which follow; and, second, it states
explicitly the exclusive justificatory criteria (outside of s. 33  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 ) against which limitations on those rights and freedoms must be
measured. Accordingly, any s. 1  inquiry must be premised on an understanding
that the impugned limit violates constitutional rights and freedoms‑‑rights
and freedoms which are part of the supreme law of Canada. As Wilson J. stated
in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, supra, at p.
218: ""... it is important to remember that the courts are conducting this
inquiry in light of a commitment to uphold the rights and freedoms set out in
the other sections of the Charter .""

 

64.              A second contextual element of
interpretation of s. 1  is provided by the words ""free and democratic
society"". Inclusion of these words as the final standard of justification
for limits on rights and freedoms refers the Court to the very purpose for
which the Charter  was originally entrenched in the Constitution:
Canadian society is to be free and democratic. The Court must be guided by the
values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I
believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the
human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a
wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in
social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals
and groups in society. The underlying values and principles of a free and
democratic society are the genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
Charter  and the ultimate standard against which a limit on a right or
freedom must be shown, despite its effect, to be reasonable and demonstrably
justified.

 

65.              The rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter 
are not, however, absolute. It may become necessary to limit rights and
freedoms in circumstances where their exercise would be inimical to the
realization of collective goals of fundamental importance. For this reason, s.
1  provides criteria of justification for limits on the rights and freedoms
guaranteed by the Charter . These criteria impose a stringent standard of
justification, especially when understood in terms of the two contextual
considerations discussed above, namely, the violation of a constitutionally
guaranteed right or freedom and the fundamental principles of a free and
democratic society. 

 

66.              The onus of proving that a limit on a
right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter  is reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society rests upon the party
seeking to uphold the limitation. It is clear from the text of s. 1  that limits
on the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Charter  are exceptions to
their general guarantee. The presumption is that the rights and freedoms are
guaranteed unless the party invoking s. 1  can bring itself within the
exceptional criteria which justify their being limited. This is further
substantiated by the use of the word ""demonstra­bly"" which clearly
indicates that the onus of justification is on the party seeking to limit: Hunter
v. Southam Inc., supra.

 

67.              The standard of proof under s. 1  is the
civil standard, namely, proof by a preponderance of probability. The
alternative criminal standard, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, would, in my
view, be unduly onerous on the party seeking to limit. Concepts such as ""reasonableness"",
""justifiability"" and ""free and democratic society"" are
simply not amenable to such a standard. Nevertheless, the preponderance of
probability test must be applied rigorously. Indeed, the phrase
""demonstrably justified"" in s. 1  of the Charter  supports this
conclusion. Within the broad category of the civil standard, there exist
different degrees of probability depending on the nature of the case: see
Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases (Toronto:
1974), at p. 385. As Lord Denning explained in Bater v. Bater, [1950] 2
All E.R. 458 (C.A.), at p. 459:

 

The case may be proved by
a preponderance of probability, but there may be degrees of probability within
that standard. The degree depends on the subject‑matter. A civil court, when
considering a charge of fraud, will naturally require a higher degree of
probability than that which it would require if considering whether negligence
were established. It does not adopt so high a degree as a criminal court, even
when it is considering a charge of a criminal nature, but still it does require
a degree of probability which is commensurate with the occasion.

 

This passage was cited with approval in Hanes v. Wawanesa Mutual
Insurance Co., [1963] S.C.R. 154, at p. 161. A similar approach was put
forward by Cartwright J. in Smith v. Smith, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 312, at pp.
331‑32:

 

I wish, however, to
emphasize that in every civil action before the tribunal can safely find the
affirmative of an issue of fact required to be proved it must be reasonably
satisfied, and that whether or not it will be so satisfied must depend on the
totality of the circumstances on which its judgment is formed including the
gravity of the consequences....

 

68.              Having regard to the fact that s. 1  is
being invoked for the purpose of justifying a violation of the constitutional
rights and freedoms the Charter  was designed to protect, a very high
degree of probability will be, in the words of Lord Denning, ""commensurate
with the occasion"". Where evidence is required in order to prove the
constituent elements of a s. 1  inquiry, and this will generally be the case, it
should be cogent and persuasive and make clear to the Court the consequences of
imposing or not imposing the limit. See: Law Society of Upper Canada v.
Skapinker, supra, at p. 384; Singh v. Minister of Employment and
Immigration, supra, at p. 217. A court will also need to know what
alternative measures for implementing the objective were available to the
legislators when they made their decisions. I should add, however, that there
may be cases where certain elements of the s. 1  analysis are obvious or self‑evident.


 

69.              To establish that a limit is reasonable
and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, two central
criteria must be satisfied. First, the objective, which the measures
responsible for a limit on a Charter  right or freedom are designed to
serve, must be ""of sufficient importance to warrant overriding a
constitutionally protected right or freedom"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart
Ltd., supra, at p. 352. The standard must be high in order to ensure
that objectives which are trivial or discordant with the principles integral to
a free and democratic society do not gain s. 1  protection. It is necessary, at
a minimum, that an objective relate to concerns which are pressing and
substantial in a free and democratic society before it can be characterized as
sufficiently important.

 

70.              Second, once a sufficiently significant
objective is recognized, then the party invoking s. 1  must show that the means
chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified. This involves ""a form of
proportionality test"": R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at
p. 352. Although the nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on
the circumstances, in each case courts will be required to balance the
interests of society with those of individuals and groups. There are, in my
view, three important components of a proportionality test. First, the measures
adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They
must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. In short,
they must be rationally connected to the objective. Second, the means, even if
rationally connected to the objective in this first sense, should impair
""as little as possible"" the right or freedom in question: R. v.
Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra, at p. 352. Third, there must be
a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are
responsible for limiting the Charter  right or freedom, and the objective
which has been identified as of ""sufficient importance"". 

 

71.              With respect to the third component, it is
clear that the general effect of any measure impugned under s. 1  will be the
infringement of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter ; this is
the reason why resort to s. 1  is necessary. The inquiry into effects must,
however, go further. A wide range of rights and freedoms are guaranteed by the Charter ,
and an almost infinite number of factual situations may arise in respect of
these. Some limits on rights and freedoms protected by the Charter  will
be more serious than others in terms of the nature of the right or freedom
violated, the extent of the violation, and the degree to which the measures
which impose the limit trench upon the integral principles of a free and
democratic society. Even if an objective is of sufficient importance, and the
first two elements of the proportionality test are satisfied, it is still
possible that, because of the severity of the deleterious effects of a measure
on individuals or groups, the measure will not be justified by the purposes it
is intended to serve. The more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the
more important the objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

 

72.              Having outlined the general principles of
a s. 1  inquiry, we must apply them to s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act.
Is the reverse onus provision in s. 8 a reasonable limit on the right to be
presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as can be
demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society?

 

73.              The starting point for formulating a
response to this question is, as stated above, the nature of Parliament's
interest or objective which accounts for the passage of s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act. According to the Crown, s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act
is aimed at curbing drug trafficking by facilitating the conviction of drug
traffickers. In my opinion, Parliament's concern that drug trafficking be
decreased can be characterized as substantial and pressing. The problem of drug
trafficking has been increasing since the 1950's at which time there was
already considerable concern. (See Report of the Special Committee on
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, Appendix to Debates of the Senate, Canada,
Session 1955, pp. 690‑700; see also Final Report of the Commission of
Inquiry into the Non‑Medical Use of Drugs (Ottawa, 1973).) Throughout
this period, numerous measures were adopted by free and democratic societies,
at both the international and national levels.

 

74.              At the international level, on June 23,
1953, the Protocol for Limiting and Regulating the Cultivation of the Poppy
Plant, the Production of, International and Wholesale Trade in, and Use of
Opium, to which Canada is a signatory, was adopted by the United Nations
Opium Conference held in New York. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,
1961, was acceded to in New York on March 30, 1961. This treaty was signed
by Canada on March 30, 1961. It entered into force on December 13, 1964. As
stated in the Preamble, ""addiction to narcotic drugs constitutes a serious
evil for the individual and is fraught with social and economic danger to
mankind,..."" 

 

75.              At the national level, statutory
provisions have been enacted by numerous countries which, inter alia,
attempt to deter drug trafficking by imposing criminal sanctions (see, for
example, Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, 1975 (N.Z.), No. 116; Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971, 1971 (U.K.), c. 38).

 

76.              The objective of protecting our society
from the grave ills associated with drug trafficking, is, in my view, one of
sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right
or freedom in certain cases. Moreover, the degree of seriousness of drug
trafficking makes its acknowledgement as a sufficiently important objective for
the purposes of s. 1 , to a large extent, self‑evident. The first
criterion of a s. 1  inquiry, therefore, has been satisfied by the Crown.

 

77.              The next stage of inquiry is a
consideration of the means chosen by Parliament to achieve its objective. The
means must be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
society. As outlined above, this proportionality test should begin with a
consideration of the rationality of the provision: is the reverse onus clause
in s. 8 rationally related to the objective of curbing drug trafficking? At a
minimum, this requires that s. 8 be internally rational; there must be a
rational connection between the basic fact of possession and the presumed fact
of possession for the purpose of trafficking. Otherwise, the reverse onus
clause could give rise to unjustified and erroneous convictions for drug
trafficking of persons guilty only of possession of narcotics.

 

78.              In my view, s. 8 does not survive this
rational connection test. As Martin J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal
concluded, possession of a small or negligible quantity of narcotics does not
support the inference of trafficking. In other words, it would be irrational to
infer that a person had an intent to traffic on the basis of his or her
possession of a very small quantity of narcotics. The presumption required
under s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act is overinclusive and could lead
to results in certain cases which would defy both rationality and fairness. In
light of the seriousness of the offence in question, which carries with it the
possibility of imprisonment for life, I am further convinced that the first
component of the proportionality test has not been satisfied by the Crown.

 

79.              Having concluded that s. 8 does not
satisfy this first component of proportionality, it is unnecessary to consider
the other two components. 

 

                                                                   VI

 

Conclusion

 

80.              The Ontario Court of Appeal was correct in
holding that s. 8 of the Narcotic Control Act violates the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  and is therefore of no force or effect.
Section 8  imposes a limit on the right guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter 
which is not reasonable and is not demonstrably justified in a free and
democratic society for the purpose of s. 1 . Accordingly, the constitutional
question is answered as follows:

 

Question:

 

Is s. 8 of the Narcotic
Control Act inconsistent with s. 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms  and thus of no force and effect?

 

Answer: Yes.

 

81.              I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

82.              Estey
J.‑‑I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with the
conclusions of the Chief Justice with reference to the relationship between s.
11 (d) and s. 1  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

1970, c. C‑34, ss. 529(4), (5), 613(1)(b)(i), (3).

 

                   The appellant was charged of unlawful possession of
a narcotic (cannabis (marihuana)) for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s.
4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. At the trial, appellant submitted that
he should be acquitted because the Crown particularized the substance in the
indictment as cannabis marihuana when the certificates of analysis indicated it
to be cannabis resin. The trial judge convicted appellant holding that the
Crown had proved that he was unlawfully in possession of a narcotic, to wit,
cannabis, and that he had failed to establish that his possession was not the
purpose of trafficking. The Court of Appeal dismissed appellant's appeal
without reasons. 

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The gravamen of the offence is the possession of a
narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. The word ""narcotic"", as
defined in s. 2 of the Narcotic Control Act, means ""any substance
included in the schedule...."" The substances involved in this case‑‑namely
cannabis resin and cannabis (marihuana)‑‑are included in item 3 of
the schedule. The Crown having particularized the narcotic should have sought
an amendment under s. 529  of the Criminal Code  to correct the variance
between the particular and the evidence. Absent the Crown's motion, the trial
judge should have considered amending the charge proprio motu under that
section. Such an amendment would not have prejudiced the accused as it is
apparent under the particular circumstances of this case that he was not misled
in his defence in any way. Since there was no amendment in the proceedings
below, it is a proper case for this Court, acting under s. 613(1)(b)(i)
and (3) of the Code, to amend the indictment and to dismiss the appeal.

                   APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court of
Appeal dismissing without reasons the accused's appeal from his conviction on a
charge of possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. Appeal
dismissed.

 

                   Michael N. Starr,
for the appellant.

 

                   S. R. Fainstein
and Donna Valgardson, for the respondent.

 

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                Lamer
J.‑‑The accused was charged in the Court of Queen's Bench of
Alberta ""that he on or about the 19th day of April, 1981, at Calgary, in
the Province of Alberta, was unlawfully in possession of a Narcotic, to wit:
cannabis (marihuana), for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4,
Subsection 2 of the Narcotic Control Act and amendments thereto"".

 

2.                The narcotic seized was analyzed and
certificates of analysis, which were introduced at trial, proved the substance
to be cannabis resin.

 

3.                During the trial, counsel for the
appellant submitted that the Crown's case should fail because the certificates
of analysis identified the substance as cannabis resin whereas the indictment
indicated the substance as cannabis marihuana. Counsel for the appellant
submitted that, the Crown having chosen to particularize the substance in the
indictment as cannabis marihuana and being unable to prove it as such, the
accused should be acquitted.

 

4.                The trial judge held that the Crown had
proved that the accused was unlawfully in possession of a narcotic, to wit,
cannabis. He based his decision on the Alberta Court of Appeal's decision in R.
v. Barrett (1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d) 75. I will be referring hereinafter to
this decision.

 

5.                At the end of the trial, the trial judge
held that the appellant had failed to discharge the burden that became his
after he was found in possession and therefore found him guilty of the full
offence of unlawfully being in possession of cannabis for the purpose of
trafficking. The Crown did not move for the amendment of the indictment nor did
the trial judge amend proprio motu under s. 529  of the Criminal Code .


 

6.                The Court of Appeal of Alberta dismissed
the appeal without reasons, obviously and understandably satisfied that matters
had been put to rest in that province in the Barrett decision, supra.
The accused now comes to this Court.

 

                                                                 Issue

 

7.                Did the Court of Appeal of Alberta err
in dismissing the appellant's appeal inasmuch as the indictment charged the
appellant with possession for the purpose of trafficking in cannabis marihuana
and the certificates of analysis proved the substance in question to be
cannabis resin?

 

                                                          The
Legislation

 

8.                Section 4(2) and (3) of the Narcotic
Control Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. N‑1, are those under which Mr. Morozuk
was convicted:

 

                   4. (1) No person shall traffic in a narcotic or any substance represented
or held out by him to be a narcotic.

 

                   (2) No
person shall have in his possession any narcotic for the purpose of
trafficking.

 

                   (3)
Every person who violates subsection (1) or (2) is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

 

9.                       A narcotic is defined at s. 2 of
the Act:

 

""narcotic"" means
any substance included in the schedule or anything that contains any substance
included in the schedule;

 

10.              Marihuana is also defined at s. 2 of the
Act:

 

""marihuana""
means Cannabis sativa L.;

 

11.              This definition refers to a schedule which
lists twenty substances and the preparations, derivatives, alkaloids, salts
(and for cannabis, the similar synthetic preparations), thereof.

 

12.              Item 3 of this schedule is the one which
lists the substances involved in this case, as follows:

 

                   3. Cannabis
sativa, its preparations, derivatives and similar synthetic preparations,
including:

 

(1) Cannabis resin,

 

(2) Cannabis (marihuana),

 

(3) Cannabidiol,

 

(4) Cannabinol (3‑n‑amyl‑6,6,9‑trimethyl‑6‑dibenzopyran‑1‑o1),

 

(5) Pyrahexyl (3‑n‑hexyl‑6,6,9‑trimethyl‑7,8,9,10‑tetrahydro‑6‑dibenzopyran‑1‑o1),
and

 

(6) Tetrahydrocannabinol. 

 

13.              Under each of the other nineteen
substances are listed, in like fashion, the respective derivatives and other
forms of the substances. As a result, there are over a hundred of such listed
items.

 

14.              The first question to be addressed is
whether each of the listed derivatives or preparations is a distinct offence.
Of course if they are, the Crown proved the wrong offence, the indictment
cannot be amended to charge a different offence, the conviction for the offence
charged cannot stand, and the accused must be acquitted.

 

15.              Two courts of appeal, the Court of Appeal
for Saskatchewan, in R. v. Rawlyk (1972), 20 C.R.N.S. 188, and the Court
of Appeal for British Columbia, in R. v. Land (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d)
118, held that each item in the schedule created a distinct offence. Both
decisions turned upon the question whether an accused, when found in possession
of more than one item on the list, could be charged and convicted of separate offences
for possession of each of the respective substances, or whether such possession
constituted only one offence? The result of these appeals was to restore the
convictions for the separate and distinct offences.

 

16.              One court of appeal, the Court of Appeal
for Alberta, in Barrett, supra, took the position that the
offence created by Parliament was possession of cannabis. Inferentially that
decision stands for the proposition that each of the twenty listed substances
creates separate offences but that the derivatives listed under them do not.

 

17.              I think that this Court has already,
albeit under a different statute, settled the question in Elliott v. The
Queen, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 393. The counts in that case were laid in British
Columbia under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
F‑27. Section 42 thereof is identical to s. 4 of the Narcotic Control
Act, supra, and makes it an offence to have in one's possession a
""restricted drug"" for the purpose of trafficking. Section 40 defines
a restricted drug: ""`restricted drug' means any drug or other substance
included in Schedule H"". The only difference between that schedule and the
one involved in this case is that they list different substances.

 

18.              One of the substances listed in the Food
and Drugs Act  is methylenedioxyamphetamine (commonly known as MDA) or any
salt thereof. The three counts in the charge were respectively for, conspiracy
to traffic, traffic, and possession for the purpose of trafficking of a
restricted drug, to wit: MDA. Elliott was not charged as regards the salt of
MDA. Convicted of trafficking (the second count), Elliott appealed and was
successful upon the Court of Appeal for British Colombia finding that although
it had been proved that he had a salt of MDA in his possession for the purpose
of trafficking, it was not shown that he was in possession of MDA, Elliott
v. The Queen (No. 2) (1976), 40 C.R.N.S. 257, at p. 261. 

 

19.              The Crown appealed the acquittal on
possession (the third count) to the Court of Appeal, the bench being differently
constituted. The Crown applied to the Court of Appeal to amend the charge by
adding the words ""a salt of"" prior to the word MDA. The Court allowed
the amendment, allowed the appeal and ordered a new trial on the amended
charge. Commenting on this, Ritchie J., speaking for the majority of this
Court, said at pp. 426‑27:

 

                   In
considering the third count, however, the Court of Appeal, differently
constituted, appears to have recognized that the charge was that the accused
`did unlawfully have in their possession a restricted drug ... for the purpose
of trafficking' and that the failure to allege possession of `a salt of MDA'
constituted a failure to allege `a particular' of the offence which was capable
of being added by way of amendment, in order to conform to the evidence which
the Court had accepted in disposing of count 2.

 

                   The
latter amendment did not in my opinion have the effect of charging a new
offence as it did no more than specify a particular of the offence which had
already been charged. If I thought the amendment to be tantamount to the
charge of a different offence from that contained in the original count, other
considerations might apply, but what we have here is a particularization of an
ingredient of the main charge which was made necessary by the evidence which
the Court had already accepted and which had in fact been in great measure
conceded by the appellant.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

And later on, said, at p. 428:

 

It will be observed that
the gravamen of the offence under these counts is in the one case that the
accused did `unlawfully traffic in a restricted drug ...' and in the other
that they did `unlawfully have in their possession a restricted drug for the
purpose of trafficking'.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

In this respect, I see no difference between the Food and Drugs Act 
and the Narcotic Control Act, and the findings of this Court as regards
the former are equally applicable to the latter. The gravamen of the offence is
the possession of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. It is an offence
to possess cannabis, its derivatives etc., because it is a narcotic. Possession
of anything listed in the schedule is possession of a narcotic. Whether and to
what extent the Crown can break down one act of possession of different
narcotics into different counts is no more in issue in this case than it was in
Elliott, supra, and we need not, and should not, address the
issue in this case. Specifying that the narcotic was cannabis and then further
specifying what kind of cannabis, that is marihuana, was particularizing the
narcotic. 

 

20.              This leads us to the second question. The
Crown having particularized the narcotic (or when having been ordered to do
so), can a conviction be entered if a narcotic other than the one specified is
proved? One thing is certain: the appellant cannot stand convicted of
possession of marihuana when it has never been established that he had
marihuana. The Crown should have sought an amendment under s. 529  of the Criminal
Code  to correct the variance between the particular and this evidence. The
trial judge should have, under s. 529 , absent the Crown's motion, considered
amending proprio motu. The only question he had to address was whether
such an amendment would prejudice the accused and, if so, whether it can be
cured.

 

21.              In my view, the situation is governed by
s. 529(4)  and (5)  of the Criminal Code :

 

                   529. ...

 

                   (4) The
court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment should be made,
consider

 

                   (a)
the matters disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry,

 

                   (b)
the evidence taken on the trial, if any,

 

                   (c)
the circumstances of the case,

 

                   (d)
whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance,
error or omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3), and

 

                   (e)
whether, having regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be
made without injustice being done.

 

                   (5)
Where, in the opinion of the court, the accused has been misled or prejudiced
in his defence by a variance, error or omission in an indictment or a count
thereof, the court may, if it is of opinion that the misleading or prejudice
may be removed by an adjournment, adjourn the trial to a subsequent day in the
same sittings or to the next sittings of the court and may make such an order
with respect to the payment of costs resulting from the necessity for amendment
as it considers desirable.

 

22.              Of course if there is irreparable
prejudice, there can be no amendment, the charge will stay as is, and an
acquittal must be entered. As there has never been any suggestion that the
accused was misled or prejudiced in any way, and, as in any event it is
apparent under the particular circumstances of this case that he was not, the
charge should have been amended at some stage of the proceedings, surely before
registering the conviction. 

 

23.              This brings us to the third and last
question. None of this having been done, must this appeal succeed and, if so,
do we acquit, or do we order a new trial on an amended charge; or, on the other
hand, if the appeal fails, should the appeal be simply dismissed, or should we
amend the charge when dismissing?

 

24.              In Elliott, supra, at p.
267, the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal on the third count and
ordered a new trial. A new trial had to be ordered because the Court of Appeal,
having reversed the trial court on possession, the accused was entitled to an
opportunity of establishing that his possession was not for the purpose of
trafficking. This Court found no error in that order. That is not to say that a
new trial would have had to be ordered had Elliott, at trial, been found to be
in possession, and, like Morozuk, been given and exercised the opportunity of
establishing that trafficking was not the purpose of his possession.

 

25.              The situation here is more akin to that
with which this Court dealt in Lake v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 49.
Though the facts of that case are very different from those in this case, the
decision is of interest because it acknowledges that an appeal court and this
Court can amend a conviction upon dismissing an appeal. Lake had been charged
with obtaining by false pretences a sum of $285 while the evidence indicated a
sum of $56. There was no amendment sought nor made throughout the proceedings
below. Spence J., for the Court said at pp. 52‑53:

 

                   The
question arises whether this Court in dismissing the appeal and confirming the
conviction should amend the latter. I am of the opinion that it is proper to do
so. It would appear that upon the evidence the appellant should only have been
convicted of obtaining by false pretences the amount of $56. The charge as laid
contained a reference to a figure of about $285. This Court has the
jurisdiction to make the appropriate amendment by virtue of s. 600(1)  of the Criminal
Code  which provides:

 

                   600.
(1) The Supreme Court of Canada may, on an appeal under this part, make any
order that the court of appeal might have made and may make any rule or order
that is necessary to give effect to its judgment.

 

The Court of Appeal for
Ontario has power to amend the conviction to set out the smaller amount by
virtue of s. 592(3)  of the Criminal Code  which provides: 

 

                   592.
(3) Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal under subparagraph (i) of
paragraph (b) of subsection (1), it may substitute the verdict that in
its opinion should have been found and affirm the sentence passed by the trial
court or impose a sentence that is warranted in law.

 

The paragraph referred to
therein, i.e., 592(1)(b)(i), provides:

 

                   592.
(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal

 

...

 

(b) may dismiss the
appeal where

 

(i) the court is of
the opinion that the appellant, although he was not properly convicted on a
count or part of the indictment, was properly  convicted on another
count or part of the indictment,

 

(The underlining is my
own.)

 

                   In R.
v. Norcross (1957), 24 W.W.R. 160 at 165, 27 C.R. 220, 120 C.C.C. 108
(B.C.C.A.), the Court amended a conviction of theft by reducing the amount
mentioned in the charge.

 

                   I would
therefore dismiss the appeal. Acting under the provisions of the Criminal
Code , I would substitute a conviction that the appellant between the 6th
day of June 1966 and the 28th day of July 1966, at the City of Ottawa, in the
County of Carleton, did unlawfully obtain the sum of $56 from Wilfred Bauer by
false pretences and with intend to defraud, contrary to s. 304(1) (a) of
the Criminal Code .

 

26.              The same approach is warranted here.
Acting under s. 613(1) (b)(i) and s. 613(3)  of the Criminal Code ,
I would amend the indictment, delete the word ""marihuana"" and insert
instead the word ""resin"", and then dismiss the appeal. 

 

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR QUEBEC

Criminal law — Trial — Absence
of accused — Trial judge examining two jurors in chambers in absence of accused
and counsel — Inquiry relating to impartiality of certain jurors — Whether
trial judge's examination to determine the impartiality of jurors need be in
the presence of the accused — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended,
s. 577.

Criminal law — Fraud — Indictment
— Indictment describing the ""Bank of Montreal"" as the victim of the
conspiracy to defraud and the attempted fraud — No case vis-à-vis the Bank of
Montreal — Motion to amend the indictment denied by trial judge because of
irreparable prejudice to accused — No evidence of prejudice — Indictment
amended and new trial ordered — Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34 as amended,
ss. 338, 529.

The accused were charged with (1) unlawful possession of
stolen Government of Canada bonds, (2) conspiracy to defraud the Bank of
Montreal and (3) attempt to defraud the Bank of Montreal. The evidence adduced
at trial indicated that the accused and two associates attempted unsuccessfully
to cash the bonds with a bank in Switzerland. The Swiss Bank counselled them to
deposit the bonds in that Bank's account with the Bank 

[Page 3]

of Montreal. The latter, however, would not credit the Swiss
Bank with the proceeds of the bonds until it had received the money from the
Bank of Canada. The proceeds were never credited because the Bank of Canada
informed the Bank of Montreal that they were dealing with stolen bonds.

At the close of the Crown's case, the trial judge allowed the
motion of the accused for a directed verdict of acquittal on counts 2 and 3 on
the ground that there was no evidence supportive of a conspiracy to defraud or
an attempt to defraud the Bank of Montreal. The Bank, as agent of the Swiss
Bank, would not make any payment from its own funds and consequently would not
have suffered any prejudice from the transaction. The trial judge denied the
Crown's motion to amend the indictment by deleting the reference to the Bank of
Montreal because the accused would suffer serious prejudice and because there
was no case establishing a risk of prejudice to the economic interests of
anyone, except the owner of the bonds. The jury as directed returned a verdict
of not guilty on counts 2 and 3.

During the course of the jury's deliberations with respect to
the first count, the trial judge received notes from two jurors questioning the
impartiality of two other jurors. After consulting the counsel for the parties
and failing to obtain any consent as to what steps should be taken, the trial
judge questioned the two complaining jurors in his chambers in the sole
presence of a court reporter and concluded that their complaint was without
foundation. He decided that there was no reason for the jury not to continue
its deliberations. The jury found the accused guilty of unlawful possession.

The Court of Appeal allowed both the Crown's appeal from the
directed verdicts of acquittal and the appeals of the accused from their
conviction for possession and in all cases ordered a new trial. The Crown and
the accused now appeal to this Court.

Held: The appeals should be dismissed.

(1) The appeal by the Crown: The examination of the two
jurors by the trial judge in his chambers, without the presence of the accused,
constituted a violation of s. 577  of the Criminal Code . The right of an
accused to be present at his trial means that he has the right to have direct
knowledge of anything that occurs in the course of his trial which could
involve his vital interests. If on the 

[Page 4]

facts of a case it is uncertain whether the accused's vital
interests are involved, the judge may, in the absence of the accused,
investigate the matter. This would include questioning the jurors. But as of
the moment it appears those vital interests are in issue, the issue must be
determined in the presence of the accused. Where a judge is being told by
jurors that the integrity of other jurors is in doubt, the accused's vital
interests are in issue, and the investigation and determination of that issue
must be conducted in the presence of the accused.

(2) The appeals by the accused: Although there was
evidence of an attempt to defraud someone, there was no case to put to the jury
as regards the Bank of Montreal. The accused did not conspire to or attempt to
defraud that Bank. The two concerns with fraud are dishonesty and deprivation.
The element of deprivation is satisfied on proof of detriment, prejudice, or
risk of prejudice to the economic interests of the victim. It is not essential
that there be actual economic loss as to the outcome of the fraud. Hiding the
fact from the Bank of Montreal that the bonds were stolen and representing
one's self as the lawful holder of the bonds satisfies the requirement of
dishonesty. The Bank of Montreal, however, was not, on the facts of this case,
asked to disburse any money for the bonds. The Bank was induced through deceit
into becoming, albeit innocently, instrumental to a fraudulent scheme. As wide
as the notion of deprivation may be, it does not encompass the kind of prejudice
that might flow from such a situation. Any deprivation to the Bank of Montreal
would be speculative and too remote.

On a charge of conspiracy to defraud or of an attempt to
defraud, there is no need to establish the identity of the victim and the reference
to the ""Bank of Montreal"" was unnecessary and mere surplusage. The
surplusage rule, like ss. 510(3) and 529, cannot be invoked in cases where its
application may prejudice the accused in his defence. Here, the trial judge
felt that, after an eight month trial, the prejudice to the accused was
irreparable. He gave no reason for that finding and there was no indication
from the evidence that the accused were misled in their handling of the case.
The trial judge refused the Crown's amendment and granted the motion for a
directed verdict because in his view there were no possible target victims of
their deceit. The amendment therefore had no useful purpose. Even though a
trial judge's finding should not be lightly interfered with, the appeal judge
was justified in reviewing that finding and rightly concluded that there had
been no prejudice. The indictment should be amended by deleting reference to 

[Page 5]

the Bank of Montreal and a new trial held on the indictment as
amended.

Majesty The Queen.

The judgment of the Court was
delivered by

LAMER J.—Donald Côté, Gérard
Vézina and Claude Benloulou were tried before a jury of the Montréal Assizes on
an indictment comprising three counts: illegal possession of stolen bonds, and
as a result of having attempted to negotiate said bonds, of attempted fraud and
of conspiracy to commit fraud. Lamb J. granted a motion for a directed verdict
of acquittal on the latter two counts but denied the motion as regards the
count of possession.

The jury as directed returned a
verdict of not guilty on the two counts, deliberated on the first and found all
three accused guilty of unlawful possession. The Crown appealed the directed
verdicts of acquittal, and the accused appealed their conviction for
possession. Prior to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Benloulou died. In a
unanimous decision the appeals of the Crown were allowed and a new trial was
ordered on the counts of attempted fraud and of conspiracy: (1982), 3 C.C.C.
(3d) 557. The appeals of the accused Côté and Vézina were also allowed,
L'Heureux-Dubé J.A. dissenting: [1982] C.A. 419, 3 C.C.C. (3d) 155, 32 C.R. (3d) 47. The Crown
and the accused all appeal to this Court as of right, the Crown by virtue of
L'Heureux-Dubé J.A.'s dissent, the accused because of the reversal of their
acquittal.

The Crown's Appeal

The Facts

The facts relevant to the Crown's
appeal are conveniently found in Lamb J.'s report on the

[Page 7]

matter to the Court of Appeal,
and concern, he says:

… two written communications
I received during the course of the jury's deliberations from each of two
female jurors indicating their belief that two male members of the jury were
being or had been influenced by one of the accused.

Having informed the accused
and counsel of these communications and having asked for and failed to obtain
agreement of counsel as to what steps should be taken, and since in my opinion
there was, at that stage of the trial, only one course to follow, I conducted
my own inquiry, which is fully documented in the Record of the case, and
interviewed each accusing juror in turn exclusively as to the reasons for her
suspicions. I satisfied myself that these were without foundation. I therefore
permitted the jury's deliberations to continue, rejecting the two alternative
courses of (a) removal from the jury of the two jurors against whom the
accusations had been made, or (b) declaring a mistrial. I formally advised the
accused and counsel of my decision.

The two notes sent to the judge
by the two jurors read as follows:

[TRANSLATION] Your Honour, I
have doubts with respect to the honesty of two jurors, may I meet with you?
Yours truly, Pauline Charbonneau.

Your Honour, We are in a
state of panic caused by the behaviour of Daniel and Denis (juror numbers 9 and
4), who do not want to listen to anyone. They are like wild beasts, and I
accuse them of doing everything possible to influence in a diabolical manner
the weaker jurors; and they are doing this in their own interest, and I believe
I know the source of that interest. I will have much more to say at a more
appropriate time and place. Yours respectfully, Janette Trudel.

The judge, in the presence of the
accused and of counsel, read the notes and made the following request:

[TRANSLATION] Might I just
request the consent of counsel for the defence to my examining-without the
presence of counsel and without the presence of the accused-to my meeting at
her request with juror No. 5 to hear what she has to say?

While consented to by the Crown,
this was clearly objected to by the defence. There ensued a discussion, and,
after a recess for lunch, counsel for the defence made a motion for mistrial.
This motion was based on the fact that given the nature of the accusation the
jury could not enjoy the 

[Page 8]

serenity required to fulfill its
duties. Furthermore, there was some concern that if jurors No. 9 and No. 4 knew
of the nature of the suspicion entertained by some of the jurors, they would be
pressured into giving a verdict that would dispel these suspicions. The defence
asked, in the alternative, that the two jurors who sent the notes be excluded
from the panel. The motions were denied.

Lamb J. met together with these
two jurors in his chambers, in the sole presence of a court reporter. It was
only once the verdict was pronounced that counsel and the accused were informed
in open court of his meeting with the jurors and given a transcript of the
exchange that took place in the judge's chambers. The record does not reveal
whether the judge's disposition of the motions was made prior to his meeting
with the jurors. In fact, as was revealed in the Court of Appeal and referred to
by Owen J.A. in his judgment:

When asked by counsel for
defence whether he had conducted an inquiry with respect to the two jurors who
had written notes, the presiding judge replied:

[TRANSLATION] I can tell you
that I have come to the conclusion that there is no valid reason that the jury
cannot, will not, be able to or should not continue its deliberations in order
to arrive at their verdict.

The Judgments of the Court of
Appeal

Owen and Malouf JJ.A. both found
a violation of s. 577 . Owen J.A. adopted the views of the Court of Appeal of
Ontario in two cases, those expressed by Martin J.A. in R. v. Hertrich,
Stewart and Skinner (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 and those of Zuber J.A. in R.
v. Grimba (1980), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 570. L'Heureux-Dubé J.A. dissented and
found that on the facts of the case there was no violation of the section. She
was of the view that a preliminary investigation determining the impartiality
of the jurors need not be in the presence of the accused.

[Page 9]

The Law 

The relevant facts are in
regard of s. 577 :

577. (1) Subject to
subsection (2), an accused other than a corporation shall be present in court
during the whole of his trial.

(2) The court may

(a) cause the accused
to be removed and to be kept out of court, where he misconducts himself by
interrupting the proceedings so that to continue the proceedings in his
presence would not be feasible,

(b) permit the
accused to be out of court during the whole or any part of his trial on such
conditions as the court considers proper, or

(c) cause the accused
to be removed and to be kept out of court during the trial of an issue as to
whether the accused is, on account of insanity, unfit to stand his trial where
it is satisfied that failure to do so might have an adverse effect on the
mental health of the accused.

(3) An accused is entitled,
after the close of the case for the prosecution, to make full answer and
defence personally or by counsel.

Until Hertrich, supra, the
courts considered that the test as to the scope of s. 577  was to be found in
the words of the judgment of Casey J.A. in Meunier v. The Queen (1965),
48 C.R. 14 (affirmed by this Court, [1966] S.C.R. 399), where he said, at p.
17:

Our problem is whether the
Court proceeded, whether it did anything of a nature to advance the case, in
the absence of the appellant. If it did not appellant's argument must be
rejected; if it did the conviction must be quashed.

In R. v. Grimba, supra,
Zuber J.A. questioned whether the words "" 'of a nature to advance the
case' were intended to be definitive"". In my view, they were not. The
question as put by Casey J.A. was befitting the issue and the facts of that
case. I think the proper test is to be found in Martin J.A.'s judgment in Hertrich,
supra.

In Hertrich, a case also
involving meetings with jurors, the judge was informed by the sheriff that a
juror had conveyed to one of his officers that he had received phone calls
about the case. Prior to 

[Page 10]

questioning the jurors in the
absence of the accused the judge had met with counsel in his chambers to
discuss whether an investigation was necessary, and if so, whether it should be
conducted in the presence of the accused. Over objections of counsel for some
of the accused, the judge decided that an investigation was necessary and
examined the jurors in the presence of counsel, but in the absence of the
accused.

In his reasons, Martin J.A., said
that the accused's right to be present at his trial means that he has the right
""to have direct knowledge of anything that transpires in the course of his
trial which could involve his vital interests"". This obviously includes
(at p. 527):

… proceedings which are part
of the normal trial process for determining the guilt or innocence of the
accused such as arraignment and plea, the empanelling of the jury, the
reception of evidence (including voir dire proceedings with respect to
the admissibility of evidence), rulings on evidence, arguments of counsel,
addresses of counsel to the jury, the judge's charge, including requests by the
jury for further instructions, the reception of the verdict and the imposition
of sentence if the accused is found guilty.

This would also include
""proceedings"" conducted by the judge during the trial for the purpose
of investigating matters which have occurred outside the trial but which may
affect its fairness. This would however exclude events which (at p. 529):

… although in one sense part
of the trial, cannot reasonably be considered to be a part of the trial for the
purpose of the present principle, because they cannot reasonably be said to
have a bearing on the substantive conduct of the trial, or the issue of guilt
or innocence.

Applying these principles to the
facts of that case, the court found that the in-chambers examination of the
jurors was part of the trial. Martin J.A., illustrating what would not be part
of the trial said, at p. 539:

… the communication by the
deputy sheriff to the judge of the information with respect to the anonymous
telephone call, and the preliminary in-chambers conference with counsel to
determine the necessity for an 

[Page 11]

inquiry and the form that it
should take clearly did not constitute part of the trial.

The Issue

Is the presence of the accused
required when the judge is determining whether there is an issue involving his
vital interests, or only as of the moment that that issue having been found to
exist is being determined? This is how I see the question to be addressed on
the facts of this case and given the judgments below. Indeed, it appears to me
that all three judges below agree with the principles and the rules set out in Hertrich,
supra. L'Heureux-Dubé J.A., in her dissenting reasons, quotes at length the
reasons of Martin J.A., including the passage to which I have just referred,
where he states that the discussion in-chambers with the sheriff and then with
counsel was not part of the trial, and she then emphasized the passage
immediately following those comments, where he reformulates the issue to be
decided by the Court of Appeal in that case:

Therefore the question
resolves itself to this: When it had been decided that an investigation was
necessary, did the examination of the jurors under oath constitute part of the
trial for the purpose of the rule that the accused is entitled to be present at
his trial?

Further on L'Heureux-Dubé J.A.
said:

[TRANSLATION] This brings us
back to the crux of the question. In the Hertrich case, Mr.
Justice Martin set out in the following manner the question to be decided (at
p. 529):

The narrow question
presented then by this branch of the appeal is whether an examination of a
juror with respect to the effect on him of an anonymous telephone call received
by or communicated to him is part of the trial.

In the present case, the
parameters of the debate can be delimited as follows:

During the deliberations of
the jury, does the examination of a juror form part of the trial when this
examination has as its sole purpose the verification of the correctness of
suspicions which a juror holds with respect to the impartiality of other
members of the jury as evidenced by a note received from this juror by the
judge and the effect that these suspicions may have on the ability of the juror
to continue deliberations?

[Page 12]

Unlike in the Hertrich
case, in the present case, the facts do not reflect on the impartiality of the
jury. The examination revealed no fact whatsoever of a nature capable of
influencing the jury, but rather revealed simple gossip among jurors possibly
exhausted by the long trial or seized with panic when faced with the difficulty
of their task or even simply upset as a result of being subjected to the
influence of other jurors in the difficult task of arriving at a unanimous
decision. These anxieties are surely not foreign to any jury deliberations.
Generally, however, nothing arises out of them. In the present case, two jurors
informed the judge of them.

I would note immediately
that if the examination carried out by the judge had revealed facts of a nature
which might have influenced the impartiality of the jury or, one of the jurors,
the situation would surely have been different. The case which the court is
presently faced with constitutes somewhat of a preliminary step, the first
phase of a process which could have contained several others if facts had been
discovered bearing on the vital interests of the accused, their guilt or
innocence. If there was no reason to proceed farther in the present case it was
because the preliminary step proved sufficient to assure the judge that no fact
or incident had occurred having any effect on the result of the trial.

It is by keeping in mind the
nature of the communication received from the jurors as well as what was
revealed in the examination that the court will proceed to the examination of
the jurisprudence with respect to s. 577  of the Criminal Code .

L'Heureux-Dubé J.A. equated the
trial judge's in-chambers investigation into the partiality of the jurors to
the preliminaries conducted by the trial judge in the Hertrich case.
With respect I cannot agree with L'Heureux-Dubé J.A.'s qualification of what
transpired in the trial judge's chambers.

I am of the view that if on the
facts of a case it is uncertain whether the accused's vital interests are
involved, the judge may, in the absence of the accused, investigate the matter.
This would include questioning the jurors and, if the judge determines that
these vital interests of the accused are not in issue that ends the matter,
subject of course to a record being kept of the proceedings in order to
determine whether he erred as regards there being uncertainty of what was in
issue at the outset and as regards his final determination of the matter.

[Page 13]

This is what occurred in the Hertrich
case. But as of the moment it appears those vital interests are in issue, the
issue must be determined in the presence of the accused.

If the judge had received a note
saying: ""I must speak to you about something serious and in private"",
I see nothing wrong with the judge's informing counsel and meeting the juror to
find out what the matter is all about. But upon being told by the juror that
the integrity of another juror is in doubt, the accused's vital interests are
in issue, and the investigation and determination of that issue must be
conducted in the presence of the accused.

In this case it is abundantly
clear from the written messages that the partiality of jurors was in issue.
L'Heureux-Dubé J.A. concluded that this is not so relying in part on what was
eventually reported in the transcripts of the exchange between the judge and
the jurors in chambers. This analysis, in my respectful view, misses the point.
For it is confusing the determination of whether partiality was in issue with
the further determination of the issue of partiality. Finding the jurors
impartial does not mean that their impartiality was not in issue. It merely
means that the issue was determined in favour of their impartiality. The events
of this case well illustrate the need for the issue of partiality to be
determined in the presence of the accused, specifically when one considers that
counsel for the accused argued their motion for a mistrial without knowing what
the jurors had to say as regards the partiality of others, not knowing whether
the jurors had conveyed to their fellow jurors including the suspects, their
suspicions, and not even knowing whether the judge had met with those jurors. I
would therefore dismiss the Crown's appeal.

Before addressing the accused's
appeal, I think it desirable that something should be added with regard to
certain comments made by Owen J.A. in his reasons on the appropriateness of the
application of s. 613(1) (b) (iii) to a violation of s. 577 . In
addressing this question Owen J.A. expressed the view that this Court's
decision in the Meunier case went too far and he expressed the hope that
we do 

[Page 14]

as we did in other cases (R.
v. Mitchell, [1964] S.C.R. 471; R. v. Cooper, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 860; Vetrovec
v. The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811) and reconsider Meunier. Owen J.A.
is not the only one who has expressed such views. The most recent complaint as
to the rigidity of the Meunier rule as regards the unavailability of s.
613(1) (b)(iii) was expressed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in
R. v. Fenton (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 109. In the case at bar the Crown in
her factum also invited us to reconsider our adoption of Casey J.A.'s views in Meunier.
This issue would be within our reach had the appeal below been dismissed.
Indeed, the finding of a violation of s. 577  by this Court for the first time
would then have raised, as a question originating in this Court, the question
whether the proviso is applicable to such an error of law and afforded us an
opportunity to reconsider Meunier. Unfortunately, we are precluded from
doing so in this case. This is an appeal as of right based on L'Heureux-Dubé
J.A.'s dissent. The question of law on which she dissented was not the
applicability of s. 613(1) (b) (iii) following a violation of s.
577 . Furthermore leave was sought by the Crown on that issue and was denied by
a panel of this Court. As a last comment on the matter I should not want it to
be taken that, when adopting Martin J.A.'s views in Hertrich, the issue
of whether the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii) was available, has been
inferentially reconsidered and the reasoning in Meunier on that point
reaffirmed in this case.

The Appeal of the Accused Côté
and Vézina 

The Facts

The two counts of the
indictment we are concerned with here read as follows:

[TRANSLATION] CLAUDE
BENLOULOU, GÉRARD VÉZINA and DONALD CÔTÉ, in Montréal, District of Montréal,
between October 5, 1973 and October 17,
 1973 did unlawfully conspire together
and with Charles

[Page 15]

Dolansky, to commit
indictable offences not provided for in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of Section
423(1)  of the Criminal Code , to wit: to defraud by deceit, lies or other fraudulent
means, the Bank of Montréal, 119 St-James St. West, Montréal, of a sum of money
of approximately $975,000, thereby committing an indictable offence as set out
in Section 423(1)  (d) of the Criminal Code .

On or about October 16,
1973, CLAUDE BENLOULOU, DONALD CÔTÉ and GÉRARD VÉZINA did unlawfully attempt to
commit an indictable offence, to wit: defraud by deceit, lies or other
fraudulent means, the Bank of Montreal, 119 St-James St. West, Montréal, of a
sum of money, approximately $975,000, thereby committing an indictable offence
as set out in Section 421 (b) of the Criminal Code .

It was admitted at trial that
General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation Limited, hereinafter
referred to as GAFLAC, purchased thirty-four Government of Canada bearer bonds.
The due date of those bonds was October 1, 1973. They were stolen. The evidence
involving the accused in relation to these bonds, as assessed by Malouf J.A. of
the Quebec Court of Appeal is as follows:

Testifying for the
prosecution, one John Feller stated that he was present at a meeting which took
place on the evening of October 11, 1973, between a Montreal businessman, one Charles
Dolansky and a Swiss national, Fritz Zueger, who together discussed the
encashment of certain bonds in Switzerland. The serial numbers given to Feller by Dolansky
turned out to be exactly the same as the serial numbers of the bonds owned by
GAFLAC. During the evening of October 12th, Feller, who was at Zueger's
apartment in Montreal, received a telephone call from someone identifying
himself as Donald who wished to know if he was aware of the conversation which
had taken place between Zueger and Dolansky concerning the bonds. The same
evening Donald appeared at the apartment wishing to know if Zueger intended to
leave immediately for Switzerland. The latter stated that he was unable to leave due
to business commitments in Montreal. Donald, later identified by Feller as respondent
Donald Côté, was disappointed because the matter was taking too long and he
could no longer wait. On Monday, October 15th, Donald placed a second telephone
call asking Zueger and Feller to continue their attempts to encash the bonds in
Switzerland. It was then that Zueger telephoned a representative
of the Neue Bank in Switzerland giving him the numbers of the bonds. The
representative of the Neue Bank 

[Page 16]

counselled Zueger to deposit
the bonds with the Bank of Montreal for the account of the Neue Bank. The
following day, Donald Côté was informed of these events and he told Zueger that
a carrier, later identified as respondent Vézina, would bring the bonds to the
apartment. After receiving the bonds, Feller and Zueger checked the serial
numbers with the list of numbers given to them by Dolansky and went to the Bank
of Montreal where Feller alone deposited the bonds, receiving a receipt
therefor from Simpson, an employee of the bank. Feller says that, on the same
day, he and Zueger met respondent Vézina and Benloulou in a room where Dolansky
had been hospitalized since October 12th. It was at this meeting that Benloulou
informed them that he would be going to Switzerland to obtain the proceeds of the bonds. In the
meantime, Simpson told Feller that the Bank of Montreal would not credit Neue
Bank with the proceeds of the bonds until it had received the proceeds from the
Bank of Canada. As a matter of fact the proceeds were never credited to the
Neue Bank because Simpson, in communicating with the Bank of Canada, discovered
that they were dealing with stolen bonds.

That same evening, Feller
and Zueger were arrested at an airport in Montreal when Simpson identified Feller as the person who had
deposited the bonds with the bank.

This summary reflects the facts
as described by the trial judge, except as hereinafter explained. Indeed, as
regards the accused's relationship with the Bank of Montreal, the trial judge
took a different view of the evidence, crucial, in my view, to the disposition
of this case. Lamb J. was of the view that when Feller started transactions
with the Bank of Montreal, he and his associates already knew that the Bank was
not being called upon to disburse any monies but to act solely as a conveyor of
the Bank of Canada's money to the Neue Bank.

The Judgments

At the close of the Crown's case,
the accused made a motion for a directed verdict, on the ground that there was
no evidence supportive of a conspiracy or of an attempt to defraud the Bank of
Montreal. All the Bank of Montreal was asked to do, it was argued, was to
obtain the money and send it to the Neue Bank in Switzerland. The 

[Page 17]

Crown sought leave to amend the
indictment by deleting reference to the Bank of Montreal. Counsel for the
accused objected arguing that no one, except the owner of the bonds, could have
been deprived as a result of the conduct of the accused. Not the Neue Bank,
because it would pay only once it had received the money; nor the Bank of
Montreal as it was only a conveyer of the money from the Bank of Canada to the
Neue Bank in Switzerland. The Bank of Canada would incur no loss, as it pays
only once for the redemption of its bonds. As for GAFLAC, appellants argued
that their loss would be the result of the theft and not of the conduct of the
accused.

Lamb J. agreed with the accused
that there was no case to put to the jury as regards the Bank of Montreal and
accordingly granted a motion for a directed verdict of acquittal. He previously
had denied the motion to amend saying that:

[TRANSLATION] There can be
no question, at this stage of the proceedings, of an amendment substituting
someone else for the Bank of Montreal. This would cause serious hardship to the
accused.

He then went on to add that there
could be no other victim:

[TRANSLATION] In any case,
so far as the Neue Bank is concerned, the evidence shows that even if the
latter had paid the $975,000 in Zurich it would have lost nothing, because it
would already have received from the Bank of Canada $975,000 from the
redemption of these bearer bonds, through the intermediary of the Neue Bank,
namely the Bank of Montreal.

In redeeming the bonds the
Bank of Canada would simply be paying its own debt, because according to Mr.
Pritchard's testimony it is required to pay the bearer of the bonds, whoever
that may be, except of course where to the Bank of Canada's knowledge the
bearer has stolen the bonds.

The real victim, the real
loser according to the evidence appears to have been the person who paid for
the bonds: however, his loss also appears to have been the result not of the
alleged conspiracy against the accused 

[Page 18]

but of the theft of the
bonds on or before October 5, 1973, a crime with which the accused were not charged.

In summary, with respect to
the second count, there is no evidence before the jury which would permit them
to find the accused guilty. As a result, the defence motions brought on behalf
of each of the three accused for a directed verdict of acquittal are manifestly
well founded.

It is perhaps worth adding
that there is at least a serious doubt as to the prosecution evidence on the
other essential component of this count in the indictment, namely the deceit,
falsehood or other fraudulent means by which the accused intended to defraud
the Bank of Montreal, according to the wording of this count.

However, in view of the
aforementioned conclusions regarding the total absence of any evidence of
fraud, it is not necessary for the Court to rule on this additional point.

Lamb J. therefore refused the
motion to amend on two grounds: because of irreparable prejudice to the accused
and, though expressed in different terms, because there was, on the facts
tendered in evidence by the Crown, to use the words of Dickson J. (as he then
was) in R. v. Olan, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175, at p. 1182, no case
establishing a ""risk of prejudice to the economic interests"" of
anyone, except GAFLAC. As regards GAFLAC, I should underline in passing,
without further comment, the fact that the Crown chose not to charge the
accused with conspiracy or an attempt to steal (by a trick) from GAFLAC the sum
of $975,000.

On appeal, all three judges
agreed, albeit for varying reasons, that Lamb J. erred in granting the directed
verdicts.

Owen and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ.A.
were both of the opinion that, as proof as to the identity of the victim of any
conspiracy to defraud or of an attempted fraud is not essential, naming the Bank
of Montreal in the indictment was surplusage. L'Heureux-Dubé J.A. also added
that the Bank of Canada would have been defrauded had matters been successfully
completed. Malouf J.A. took the view that whilst the banks would not have been
deprived, the owner would have, and that the 

[Page 19]

person deprived need not be the
person deceived. As for the prejudice caused to the accused by the counts
specifying the wrong victim, Malouf J.A., the only justice in appeal to address
that other ground upon which Lamb J. rested his decision to deny leave to amend
the indictment, said:

In the present instance, the
first count, that of illegal possession, contains the name of the owner of the
bonds as well as the name of the person having a special interest therein. The
proof reveals that the bonds referred to in counts 2 and 3 are the same bonds
referred to in count 1. The fact that counts 2 and 3 do not mention the name of
the owner of the bonds is not, in my opinion, fatal in the present instance for
the reasons just given. Accused were fully aware of the transaction complained
of, knew that GAFLAC was the owner of the bonds, and that Girard Trust Bank had
a special interest therein. These facts were placed before the jury during the
trial. Accused therefore had sufficient details to appreciate the nature and
quality of the transaction complained of.

In my respectful view Lamb J.
erred as regards both of the grounds upon which he rested his decision to
refuse the amendment and grant the motion for directed verdict.

The Law

The two concerns with fraud are
dishonesty and deprivation. ""The element of deprivation is satisfied on
proof of detriment, prejudice, or risk of prejudice to the economic interests
of the victim. It is not essential that there be actual economic loss as to the
outcome of the fraud"" (per Dickson J., as he then was, in R. v.
Olan, supra, at p. 1182).

Fraud consists of being dishonest
for the purpose of obtaining an advantage and which results in prejudice or a
risk of prejudice to someone's ""property, money or valuable
security"". There is no need to target a victim to commit fraud, and the
victim may not be ascertained.

As regards the second ground upon
which Lamb J. rested his decision, namely, the lack of any 

[Page 20]

conspiracy to defraud or an attempt
to defraud, I cannot agree. To begin with, the fact that the accused conspired
to obtain money from the Swiss Bank and commenced the execution of the scheme
by contacting the Bank in Switzerland is, in my opinion, sufficient evidence of a possible
victim other than the Bank of Montreal. The fact that the victim would have
been deprived in Switzerland, is, under the circumstances of this case, of no
effect on the Canadian courts' jurisdiction to try the matter, for the reasons
given by this Court in Libman v. The Queen, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 178.

In any event, clearly there was
evidence of an attempt to defraud someone in the amount of $975,000. Had the
Crown not undertaken to ascertain a victim and then further undertaken to prove
that the Bank of Montreal was the target of the accused, Lamb J. would have
been wrong in granting the motion for a directed verdict.

But the Crown did make those
undertakings, and therefore two questions need to be addressed: Did the conduct
of the accused amount to a conspiracy or an attempt to defraud the Bank of
Montreal? If so, then Lamb J. was wrong in granting the motion for a directed
verdict. If not, then one must address the consequences of a failure to prove
that target, which leads us to Lamb J.'s first ground for a directed verdict of
acquittal, irreparable prejudice to the accused.

First question: Was there
evidence to go to the jury as to whether the accused conspired or attempted to
defraud the Bank of Montreal?

Hiding the fact from the Bank of
Montreal that the bonds were stolen and representing one's self as the lawful
holder of the bonds amply satisfies the requirement of dishonesty. As regards
deprivation, had the accused conspired and attempted to obtain from the Bank of
Montreal $975,000 of its money in exchange for the bonds they would have
intended that the Bank be induced into parting with $975,000 of its money in
cash and be left with only title to cash. That the Bank of Montreal 

[Page 21]

would be reimbursed by the Bank
of Canada and would not lose the amount would, in my respectful view, be
irrelevant as regards the potential economic detriment. An exchange of money
for title to money which would not have taken place but for the dishonest
conduct on the part of the accused is prejudicial. The patrimony of the bearer
of money is surely in a better position than that of one who holds stolen bonds
even if a holder in good faith. Good faith may be questioned and payment
delayed. There would therefore have been, on those facts, as it appeared that
Malouf J.A. perceived them to be, a case to put to the jury as regards the Bank
of Montreal. But according to the trial judge this is not what happened nor
what was attempted. At the outset, the accused wanted to cash the bonds with
the Neue Bank before the theft of the bonds was discovered and reported to the
Bank of Canada. This first attempt did not succeed, because the Swiss Bank
referred them to the Bank of Montreal. The idea was then to get the Bank of
Montreal, by not telling them that the bonds were stolen, to cash the bonds
with the Bank of Canada, and then send the money to the Swiss Bank. They were
not asking the Bank of Montreal to disburse any money for the bonds. The Bank
was induced through deceit into becoming, albeit innocently, instrumental to a
fraudulent scheme.

As wide as the notion of
deprivation may be, I do not see it as encompassing the kind of prejudice to
the Bank of Montreal that that Bank could have incurred. Any deprivation to the
Bank of Montreal would be speculative and too remote.

This Court's reference in Olan,
supra, to ""risk of prejudice"" must be understood in the light of
the facts of that case and as meaning that, for there to be a deprivation, it
is not ""essential that there be actual economic loss"". In Olan,
the victim departed with money in exchange for title, indeed very good title to
money. Prior to the deceit the victim had ownership and possession of money. As
a result of the deceit the victim was left with ownership and title thereto and
had lost possession of the money. The victim's patrimony was minus 

[Page 22]

possession of the money, the
cash, and left with only title. That is deprivation.

Applying the principles set out
in Olan to the facts of this case I find that there was evidence to go
to the jury that the appellants attempted to defraud the Bank of Canada of
$975,000 irrespective of the fact that ultimately the Bank would not be out of
that amount. The Bank held the money with the understanding that it would pay
that amount under certain conditions to the lawful bearer of the bonds. It
would, had the scheme succeeded, have through deceit parted with that amount
and have been put to some identifiable risk of economic prejudice. The element
of deprivation would have been met.

But as regards the Bank of
Montreal there is no such identifiable risk of economic prejudice. The Bank of
Montreal was not being asked to part with anything it owned, possessed or had
any special interest in.

Reference to decisions in other
jurisdictions under the common law of fraud or to English cases under their Larceny
Act, 1861, and 1916, or their Theft Act, 1968, and 1978, must be
read keeping in mind the fact that s. 338 of our Code is different.
While I agree with the oft quoted statement in R. v. Wines (1953), 37
Cr. App. Rep. 197 at p. 199 that ""decei[t] is, by falsehood, to induce a
state of mind"" and that ""to defraud is, by deceit, to induce a course
of action"", we must keep in mind that in Canada s. 338 of the Criminal
Code  reads on to say that that course of action must be in the nature of
depriving someone of ""property, money or valuable security"".

In Scotland it has been found, in
Adcock v. Archibald, [1925] J.C. 58, that under the common law,
""any definite, practical result achieved by the fraud is enough"" (per
Lord Justice-General Clyde, at p. 61), and that ""The essence of the
offence consists in inducing the person who is defrauded either to take some
article he would not otherwise have taken, or to do some act he would not
otherwise have done, or to become the medium of some unlawful act"" (per
Lord Hunter, at p. 61). That 

[Page 23]

wide notion of fraud has met with
resistance in that jurisdiction (see Gordon, G. H., The Criminal Law of
Scotland (2nd ed. 1978), at p. 603). Clearly that cannot be the law in Canada under
our s. 338. I therefore agree with Lamb J. and Malouf J.A. that there was no
case as regards the Bank of Montreal.

The second question: Should Lamb
J. have granted the motion to amend, or should he simply have disregarded this
specification of the victim and the Crown's failure to prove that the Bank of
Montreal was the potential victim?

Owen and L'Heureux-Dubé JJ.A.
rested their decision on the ""surplusage rule"". I agree with them
that specifying the Bank of Montreal in the charge was unnecessary and
surplusage. The Crown, invoking ss. 512 (c) and 515 of the Code,
argues that because there was no need to establish the identity of the victim
the reference to the Bank of Montreal was surplusage and should not have had
any bearing on the issue of this case.

Sections 512 (c)
and 515 of the Code read as follows:

512. No count in an indictment is insufficient by reason
of the absence of details where, in the opinion of the court, the count
otherwise fulfils the requirements of section 510 and, without restricting the
generality of the foregoing, no count in an indictment is insufficient by
reason only that 

…

(c) it charges an
intent to defraud without naming or describing the person whom it was intended
to defraud,

515. No count that alleges
false pretences, fraud or an attempt or conspiracy by fraudulent means, is
insufficient by reason only that it does not set out in detail the nature of
the false pretence, fraud or fraudulent means.

The ""surplusage rule"",
which has been developed by the courts over a great many years, is succinctly stated
as follows, in Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings and Practice in Canada
(1983), at pp. 222-23:

[Page 24]

If the particular, whether
as originally drafted or as subsequently supplied, is not essential to
constitute the offence, it will be treated as surplusage, i.e.,a non-necessary
which need not be proved.

This common law rule is, in
effect, the converse of s. 510(3)  of the Criminal Code , which states:

510. …

(3) A count shall contain
sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the
accused reasonable information with respect to the act or omission to be proved
against him and to identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the
absence of insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.

Both the ""surplusage
rule"" and s. 510(3)  (and its predecessors) are responses to the extreme
formality of the 18th and 19th century law of criminal procedure. At that time,
""at common law, every material fact, that is every fact which formed an
ingredient in the offence, had to be alleged to be done at a particular place
and time"" (Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England
(1883), vol. 1, at p. 281). Defects or omissions in the indictment were
generally fatal, as ""the slightest inexactitude in the wording was capable
of invalidating the indictment"" (Radzi-nowicz, A History of English
Criminal Law (1948), vol. 1, at p. 98).

Although the rules concerning
indictments came to be described as an ""extraordinary and irrational set
of rules"" (Holdsworth, A History of English Law (5th ed. 1942),
vol. 3, p. 618), their purpose, it seems, was to alleviate the excessive
harshness of the early criminal law. As Stephen has indicated (op. cit.,
at p. 284):

I do not think that anything
has tended more strongly to bring the law into discredit than the importance
attached to such technicalities as these … . Such scandals do not seem,
however, to have been unpopular. Indeed, I have some doubt whether they were
not popular, as they did mitigate, though in an irrational, capricious manner,
the excessive severity of the old criminal law.

[Page 25]

With the abrogation of the great
majority of the capital statutes in the 19th century, however, much of the
rationale for the formality and strict adherence to the wording of the
indictment disappeared. Consequently, the legislators and the courts sought to
relax a number of the rules concerning indictments of the courts were empowered
to amend defective indictments (see Stephen, op. cit., at p. 285, and
Radzinowicz, op. cit., at p. 103).

The ""surplusage rule"",
s. 510(3) of the Code, as well as s. 529, are thus designed to overcome
the excessive technicalities of the former procedures and to require the
accused to meet the intrinsic merits of the accusation. All three are
interrelated. Section 510(3)  deals with the issue of insufficient detail, the
""surplusage rule"" deals with additional unnecessary detail and s. 529
empowers the courts to amend defective indictments.

However, all three rules are, in
my view, subject to the proviso that the accused not be prejudiced in his or
her defence. Section 529(4) explicitly states that:

529. …

(4) The court shall, in
considering whether or not an amendment should be made, consider

…

(d) whether the
accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance, error or omission
mentioned in subsection (2) or (3), and

(e) whether, having
regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be made without
injustice being done.

Section 510(3)  states that a
count shall provide ""reasonable information"" to the accused. These
terms must be understood as requiring, at a minimum, sufficient information so
as not to prejudice the accused in his or her defence. In R. v. Adduono
(1940), 73 C.C.C. 152, Masten J.A., on behalf of the Court of Appeal of Ontario,
wrote at p. 155:

My study of the existing
provisions of the Code (ss. 853 and following, and including s. 908) [Note:
s. 853 

[Page 26]

was the predecessor of s.
510(3) ] leads me to the view that their spirit and purpose is to secure to
the accused, when preparing for trial such exact and reasonable information
respecting the charge against him as will enable him to establish fully his
defence. At the same time these sections are directed to a second purpose,
namely, to nullify the old procedure with the purpose of ameliorating its
extreme technicality and facilitating the administration of justice in
accordance with the very right of the case.

(Emphasis added.)

Similarly, in Brodie v. The
King, [1936] S.C.R. 188, Rinfret J. analysed s. 852 of the Code (the
forerunner of s. 510(1)) and stated, at p. 194, that one of the main objects of
the legislation was ""that the accused may have a fair trial and
consequently that the indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable
precision the act or acts with which he is charged, in order that he may be
advised of the particular offence alleged against him and prepare his defence
accordingly"".

Section 510(3) , when viewed in
the light of s. 510(1) and the cases interpreting these sections, is thus
subject to a proviso similar to that expressed in s. 529(4), namely, that the
count must contain sufficient information to allow the accused to
""establish fully"" his or her defence and consequently have a fair
trial. Indeed, to hold otherwise would be to nullify the very purpose of a
written accusation of crime.

Similarly, ""the surplusage
rule"", which, as noted above, is the converse of s. 510(3) , must also be
seen as subject to the proviso that the accused not be prejudiced in his or her
defence. In R. v. Elliott, [1976] 4 W.W.R. 285, Mclntyre J.A. (as he
then was) stated at p. 289:

It is clear in my view that
where the Crown gives material particulars in an indictment it must prove them.
A long list of authorities supports this proposition.

[Page 27]

It is of course true that
immaterial or non-essential averments in indictments need not be strictly
proved if no prejudice results to the accused.

(Emphasis added.)

Indeed, the notion that the
accused not be prejudiced by the application of the ""surplusage rule""
may fairly be said to be a persistent theme throughout the case-law.

In the case of R. v. Little
and Wolski (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d) 531, the accused were charged with theft
from ""Westwood Jewellers Limited"". The evidence established that the
store from which the items were stolen was known as ""Westwood
Jewellers"". Matas J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal of Manitoba,
emphasized at pp. 537-38 that:

In the case at bar, use of
the corporate name in the indictment did not mislead in any way; the accused
had sufficient knowledge, by the indictment, of the circumstances of the
offence; they had reasonable information with respect to the act alleged in the
indictment sufficient to identify the transaction. There was no prejudice to
them.

The judgment of the Court of
Appeal was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 20. De
Grandpré J., for the majority, stated at p. 26:

… on the whole of the
evidence, it is clear that the accused have been given sufficient information
about the circumstances of the alleged offence and were at all times in a
position to identify the transaction referred to in the indictment.
Accordingly, it is my view that they have received a fair trial.

Dickson J. (as he then was), with
whom Beetz J. concurred, agreed with the result and stated, at p. 32:

In my view, the evidence in
this case reasonably identified the owner of the stolen diamond rings with the
person named in the indictment as owner, and the accused were in no way misled
or prejudiced in their defence by failure to prove identity with greater precision.

Similarly, in R. v. Greene
(1962), 133 C.C.C. 294, MacKay J.A., on behalf of the Ontario Court of Appeal,
wrote at pp. 300-01:

[Page 28]

In the present case the
appellant does not allege that he was misled or prejudiced in his defence by
the wrong date in the information, and while I think it might well have been
the better course to amend the information when the evidence disclosed the
error in the date, the failure to amend does not invalidate the conviction.

A number of other cases have
expressed a similar concern, namely, that the accused not be misled or
prejudiced by the use and application of the ""surplusage rule"". See, e.g.,
R. v. MacLean and MacLean (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 318 (Ont. C.A.); R.
v. Simard (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 306 (N.S.C.A.); R. v. O'Connor,
[1963] 1 C.C.C. 229 (P.E.I.C.A.)

In summary, the early Canadian
cases on the ""surplusage rule"", e.g. R. v. Coote (1903), 8
C.C.C. 199 (B.C.S.C.), do not specifically mention the issue of prejudice, but
many of the more recent cases, specifically those noted above, expressly and
repeatedly underline the issue of prejudice. Prejudice to the accused is in my
view, a clear limitation to the invocation of the ""surplusage rule"".

In the case at bar, Lamb J.
denied the Crown's motion to amend because he was of the view that at that
stage of the trial it would prejudice the accused.

Malouf J.A. said, and on this
point I am in full agreement with him, that the accused knew what transaction
was being complained of, which bonds were involved, who the owner was and who
the possible victims could be. But, with respect, this is only one of the ways
the specification of the Bank of Montreal, as being the victim, could have
prejudicially affected the accused in the conduct of their trial. They knew
what conduct on their part had triggered the indictment, and I fully agree with
Malouf J.A. that they were not misled in that regard. However, they were misled
as to whom the Crown, albeit unnecessarily, undertook to prove as being the
victim.

[Page 29]

Counsel for the accused might
have conducted their case on that undertaking. The decisions whether or not to
object to evidence, whether or not to cross-examine and how and to what extent
to cross-examine, might have been made in the light of that undertaking by the
Crown. In the case at bar, the trial judge felt that, after an eight-month
trial, prejudice to the accused was irreparable. While the decision to refuse
an amendment is under s. 529(6)  of the Criminal Code  a question of law
and reviewable by the Court of Appeal on a Crown appeal, the decision of the
trial judge, when based upon a finding of irreparable prejudice should not be
interfered with lightly and should be made keeping in mind the trial judge's
privileged position as regards the effect on the fairness of a trial of events
taking place in the courtroom. One of the matters to be considered by the trial
judge, under s. 529(4)  (e) is ""whether, having regard to the merits
of the case, the proposed amendment can be made without injustice being
done"". In his report to the Court of Appeal the trial judge made it clear
that in his view all of the facts surrounding the transactions were amply
canvassed in chief and in cross-examination. He gave no reasons at the time of
his decision nor in his report for his finding of irreparable prejudice to the
accused. From a perusal of the evidence there is no indication that the accused
could have been misled in their cross-examination of witnesses or more
generally in their handling of the case. Furthermore, Lamb J. could have, upon
granting the amendment afforded them an opportunity to further cross-examine
the witnesses, if requested by the accused. In fact, this was not considered
because, as is clearly apparent from the record, and emphasized by the trial
judge in his report to the Court of Appeal, as regards the facts, the case for
the accused rested upon the success of an attack on Feller's credibility. This
the accused attempted and were afforded an opportunity to that effect by
actually cross-examining Feller, four days a week, over a period of two months.

[Page 30]

Lamb J. was of the view that
there were, in law, no target victims of their deceit. That is the reason why
he granted the motion for a directed verdict, and that is the real reason (and
one that preempted considering prejudice), why he refused the amendment.

This explains the lengthy reasons
he gave in support of his finding no victims. The amendment had, for that
reason, in his view, no useful purpose, and this further explains why he gave
no indication in his reasons of his grounds for finding prejudice, let alone
irreparable prejudice. Under these circumstances and for these reasons Malouf
J.A. was, in my respectful view, justified in exercising his jurisdiction to
review the finding and also right in then finding no prejudice.

I would therefore dismiss the
appeals. The Court of Appeal simply ordered a new trial. In upholding that
decision, I would allow the amendment to the indictment which Lamb J. had
denied, i.e. deletion of the Bank of Montreal as the victim, and order
that a new trial be held on the indictment as amended.

I would accordingly dismiss the
Crown's appeal. As a result, the Court of Appeal's judgment quashing the
convictions and ordering a new trial on the count of possession should stand. I
would dismiss the appeals by the accused and order a new trial on the amended
counts.

Appeals dismissed.

                   Respondents, who owned and operated Casecam
Manufacturing, hired a firm of chartered accountants to arrange additional
financing for their company. An accountant organized a factoring scheme by
which respondents would sell their company's accounts receivable for cash and
the buyer of the accounts would collect the sum due from the manufacturing company's
clients. A sole proprietorship called Casecam Financial Services was
established and registered in the name of the accountant's secretary to serve
as a conduit between the respondents and the individual investor interested in
buying the accounts receivable. When Casecam Manufacturing required funds,
Casecam Financial Services prepared a contract of assignment and the funds,
which were provided to it by an investor, were advanced to the respondents in
return for the company's accounts receivable. The respondents then issued a
cheque to Casecam Financial Services for the first month's interest, which was
divided between Casecam Financial Services, for its administrative services,
and the investor. The respondents acquired an interest in another company,
Gorlee Greenhouses, and a similar factoring scheme was arranged with a sole
proprietorship called Gorlee Financial Services. Later, it was discovered that
the respondents had submitted false invoices. The respondents were acquitted,
on a directed verdict, of charges of defrauding Casecam Financial Services and
Gorlee Financial Services. The trial judge found that sole proprietorships were
not ""persons"", within the meaning of the Criminal Code ,
capable of being defrauded. The trial judge also denied the Crown's motion to
amend the indictment by substituting the names of new victims because it would
be prejudicial to the respondents' defence. The Court of Appeal upheld the
judgment. This appeal is to determine whether the Court of Appeal erred in
affirming the trial judge's decision to refuse the amendment sought by the
Crown and, if not, whether the trial judge correctly directed the verdict.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   While the decision to refuse an amendment is, under
s. 529(6)  of the Criminal Code , a question of law and reviewable by the
Court of Appeal on a Crown appeal, the decision of the trial judge, when based
upon a finding of irreparable prejudice, should not be interfered with lightly
and should be made keeping in mind the trial judge's privileged position as
regards the effect on the fairness of a trial of events taking place in the
courtroom. In the case at bar, there was no good reason for this Court to
interfere with the Court of Appeal's exercise of restraint.

 

                   Proprietorships are not in and of themselves
""persons"" capable of being defrauded. They are the registered names
under which persons, capable of being defrauded, do business. The Crown, in
making reference to the proprietorships, indicated that the victim it was
particularizing was the accountant's secretary‑‑the sole person
registered under the proprietorships‑‑and that it was in the
operation of those two proprietorships that she was defrauded, and it undertook
to make its case within these narrow confines. While it is not essential for a
victim to be defrauded of any property, money or valuable security or that
there be actual economic loss as to the outcome of the fraud, there must
nevertheless be an actual risk of prejudice to the economic interests of the
alleged victim. Under the factoring scheme, however, there was no such risk
because she was only a ""conduit"" in the transactions, being
instrumental to the flow of money between the respondents and the buyers of the
accounts receivable.

Introduction

 

2.                The respondents were acquitted of fraud
on a verdict directed by Judge Hoilett, a County Court Judge of Ontario. That
decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The Crown now comes to
this Court by leave. All of the proceedings below and the granting of leave to
appeal to this Court took place prior to this Court's decision in Vézina and
Côté v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2, wherein most of the issues arising
out of this appeal were addressed extensively.

 

Facts

 

3.                The respondents owned and operated a
manufacturing company, Casecam Manufacturing Co. Ltd. Casecam Manufacturing
used the services of Yale & Partners, a firm of chartered accountants. In
August of 1977 the respondents approached one Brian Rosenthal, a partner with
Yale, seeking additional financing for Casecam Manufacturing. Mr. Rosenthal
arranged for a group of investors to provide funds for a factoring scheme by
which the respondents would sell Casecam Manufacturing's accounts receivable
for cash and the buyer of the accounts receivable would collect the sum due
from Casecam Manufacturing's clients.

 

4.                Mr. Rosenthal arranged for a
""conduit"", in the form of a sole proprietorship called Casecam
Financial Services, to channel funds from individual investors to Casecam
Manufacturing. Casecam Financial Services was established in the name of Anna
Teremy, Rosenthal's secretary and common‑law wife. The routine
established was that when Casecam Manufacturing required funds, the respondent
Kotler would notify Mr. Rosenthal or Ms. Teremy of the name and the amount of
the receivables to be assigned. Mr. Rosenthal would then arrange for an
individual investor to provide funds to Casecam Financial Services. A contract
of assignment would be prepared, and the assignment would be registered. The
respondents provided copies of the invoices for completed sales, and a cheque
would be issued to the respondents in the name of Casecam Financial Services.
The respondents in turn would issue a cheque to Casecam Financial Services for
the first month's interest (2½ per cent per month), which was divided between
Casecam Financial Services (½ per cent) and the individual investor (2 per
cent).

 

5.                In November 1977, the respondents acquired
an interest in Gorlee Greenhouses, a division of Casecam Manufacturing. A
similar factoring scheme was operated in relation to Gorlee Greenhouses, with a
sole proprietorship called Gorlee Financial Services registered in Ms. Teremy's
name and purchasing its accounts receivable.

 

6.                These schemes operated until April or
May of 1978, when it was discovered that the respondents had been submitting
false invoices to Casecam Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services.
These invoices totalled about $524,765. When confronted with this, the
respondents made partial restitution ($80,000), but filed a corporate
assignment in bankruptcy on May 29, 1978. The various individuals and companies
who had invested in the factoring scheme suffered losses ranging from about
$10,000 to $466,660. Ms. Teremy made a profit by reason of the fees received
for her administrative services in relation to Casecam Financial Services and
Gorlee Financial Services.

 

7.                The respondents were charged that they
""by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defrauded Casecam
Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services of monies exceeding
$200.00"".

 

Legislation

 

8.                The sections of the Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, as amended, that are relevant to the disposition of
this appeal are the following:

 

                   2. In this Act

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   ""every
one"", ""person"", ""owner"", and similar expressions
include Her Majesty and public bodies, bodies corporate, societies, companies
and inhabitants of counties, parishes, municipalities or other districts in
relation to the acts and things that they are capable of doing and owning
respectively; 

 

                   338. (1) Every one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means,
whether or not it is a false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds
the public or any person, whether ascertained or not, of any property,
money or valuable security,

 

(a) is guilty of an
indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for ten years, where the
subject‑matter of the fraud is a testamentary instrument or where the
value thereof exceeds two hundred dollars;

 

                   510....

 

                   (3) A
count shall contain sufficient detail of the circumstances of the alleged
offence to give to the accused reasonable information with respect to the act
or omission to be proved against him and to identify the transaction referred
to, but otherwise the absence or insufficiency of details does not vitiate the
count.

 

                   512. No count in an indictment is insufficient by reason of the absence of
details where, in the opinion of the court, the count otherwise fulfils the
requirements of section 510 and, without restricting the generality of the
foregoing, no count in an indictment is insufficient by reason only that

 

                                                                    ...

 

(b) it does not
name the person who owns or has a special property or interest in property
mentioned in the count,

 

(c) it charges an intent
to defraud without naming or describing the person whom it was intended to
defraud,

 

                                                                    ...

 

(g) it does not
name or describe with precision any person, place or thing...

 

                   529. ...

 

                   (4) The
court shall, in considering whether or not an amendment should be made,
consider

 

(a) the matters
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry,

 

(b) the evidence
taken on the trial, if any,

 

(c) the
circumstances of the case,

 

(d) whether the
accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance, error or
omission mentioned in subsection (2) or (3), and

 

(e) whether, having
regard to the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be made without
injustice being done.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

The Judgments

 

County Court

 

9.                After the Crown closed its case, the
accused chose to adduce no evidence. Defence counsel did not, either before or
after announcing that no evidence would be adduced in defence, move for a
directed verdict. Rather, in the course of his address to the jury he expressed
the view that the trial judge would direct a verdict of acquittal on the basis
that the victims alleged in the indictment, Casecam Financial Services and
Gorlee Financial Services, were not persons, in law, capable of being defrauded
within the meaning of s. 338(1)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

 

10.              Following defence counsel's address to the
jury, the trial judge excluded the jury and dealt with the situation as if Mr.
Powell, counsel for the defence, had made a motion for a directed verdict.
Having found that Casecam and Gorlee Financial Services were sole
proprietorships he agreed with Mr. Powell that, not being persons under s. 2 of
the Code, they were not capable of being defrauded.

 

11.              The Crown, who disagreed with this reading
of s. 2, sought, as a fallback position, an amendment which, as described by
the judge, was in substance seeking ""that Mr. Friedlander, Mr. Rosenthal
and Mr. Nelson Goldsmith, who were the principal financial losers in the
relationship between the accused and the two entities described as conduits,
that those persons should be added or substituted as being the persons
defrauded in the indictment"". The trial judge dismissed the motion to
amend, giving the following reasons:

 

In my view, based on the
evidence, if I were to accede to that request for an amendment and either add
or substitute Messrs. Friedlander, Rosenthal and Goldsmith as the persons
defrauded in effect I would be naming a new victim. In my view, that cannot be
considered anything other than a substantial change and variation. That, in
itself, might be grounds enough to deny the application for an amendment.

 

                   Equally
important, in my view, is also the stage at which we have reached in the trial.
Counsel have already made their submissions to the jury. Mr. Powell, for
whatever reasons, has chosen or elected not to adduce any evidence. Given all
those circumstances, in my view, it is impossible to conclude that had an
amendment been sought and granted at some more opportune time that the defence
may not have adopted a different approach in this trial. In fact, Mr. Powell
indicated he very well might have. Given all those circumstances, in my view,
as I have said, it is not an appropriate case for granting an amendment,
notwithstanding the fact that I am of the view that I have the jurisdiction to
do so, notwithstanding the advanced stage of the trial. Accordingly, that
motion is denied.

 

He then concluded his reasons as follows:

 

                   That is
probably sufficient to dispose of my decision but contrary to wisdom I will
gratuitously say that on the evidence, if I were disposed to grant an
amendment, I would think that the more appropriate amendment would be to amend
the indictment to name the person being defrauded as Anna Teremy, carrying on
business under the name of whatever the two entities are. My reason for so
concluding is that although ironically Miss Teremy did not appear to suffer any
financial loss in the sense that the others had, it may validly be argued, in
my view, that in law she was the person who was vested with control of a
substantial amount of money operated through Casecam Financial Services and
Gorlee Financial Services, the sole proprietorships she operated, and as such
was a person capable of being defrauded if properly so named.

 

                   In any
event, as I have said, particularly having regard to the stage of the trial to
which we have reached, I am not prepared to conclude that I could grant such an
amendment without prejudice to the defence. 

 

The trial judge then instructed the jury to return a verdict of not
guilty.

 

Ontario Court of Appeal (Howland C.J.O.)

 

12.              The judgment of the Court is succinct and
can conveniently be reproduced here in toto.

 

                   In the
particular circumstances we are not persuaded that the trial judge was wrong in
refusing to amend the indictment and in directing a verdict of acquittal.

 

                   Nor has
counsel for the Crown persuaded us that a different verdict would necessarily
have been reached if the amendment had been made, because in our opinion there
was no evidence that Anna Teremy had been defrauded.

 

                   We are
not to be understood as having determined that an amendment was necessary in
order to state that Anna Teremy was carrying on business under the names of
Casecam Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Issues

 

13.              There are many ways to frame the issues in
this case. I find it convenient to frame them as follows and in the following
order:

 

1.                Did the Court of Appeal err in not reversing the
trial judge's decision to refuse the amendment sought by the Crown?

 

2.                If not, was the trial judge right in directing
the verdict? This latter issue requires that we address the following
questions:

 

(a) are sole
proprietorships persons capable of being defrauded?

 

(b) if not, was the
naming of the sole proprietorships as the victims a sufficient indication that
the Crown was undertaking to prove that the sole registered owner, Anna Teremy,
was the person defrauded?

 

(c) if so, was the
Court of Appeal correct in its determination that there was no evidence that
Anna Teremy had been defrauded?

 

14.              Most of these issues were recently
addressed by this Court in Vézina and Côté v. The Queen, supra,
and I do not intend to reiterate at any length what was said in that judgment.

 

First Issue: The Amendment

 

15.              The issue is obviously not whether there
was evidence to support the amendment sought. Indeed there was ample evidence
and one wonders why the Crown, having chosen to name victims, chose not to name
Friedlander, Rosenthal and Goldsmith or the other investors as the victims. The
trial judge found that an amendment would have caused irreparable prejudice to
the accused's conduct of the case. The Court of Appeal chose not to interfere
with that finding though it could have on a Crown appeal since under s. 529(6) 
of the Criminal Code  the decision to refuse an amendment is a question
of law. I find no good reason to interfere with the Court of Appeal's exercise
of restraint when considering such a finding by a trial court. As was said by
this Court in Vézina and Côté v. The Queen, supra, at p. 29:
""the decision of the trial judge, when based upon a finding of irreparable
prejudice should not be interfered with lightly and should be made keeping in
mind the trial judge's privileged position as regards the effect on the
fairness of a trial of events taking place in the courtroom"".

 

Second Issue: The Directed Verdict

 

16.              Anna Teremy was the sole person registered
under the proprietorships. Proprietorships are not in and of themselves persons
capable of being defrauded. Proprietorships are the registered names under
which persons, capable of being defrauded, do business. The Crown, in its
written argument before this Court, recognized that the specification of
Casecam Financial Services and Gorlee Financial Services as victims were really
indications that Anna Teremy was the victim. The sole proprietorships were
""simply business aliases for Anna Teremy"" and she was
""synonymous with the proprietorships"".

 

17.              My view of the matter is as follows: The
effect of the Crown's reference to these proprietorships was threefold: first,
the Crown was indicating that the victim it was particularizing was Anna
Teremy; second, that it was in the operation of those two proprietorships that
she was defrauded and not otherwise as, let us say, an investor like Rosenthal;
and thirdly, that the Crown was undertaking to make its case (subject to and
until an amendment was sought and granted) within these narrow confines, and
the defence was entitled to so assume and conduct its case accordingly.

 

18.              The Crown having been unsuccessful with
its attempt to amend, and leaving the trial judge's decision undisturbed, the
sole remaining question is whether the Court of Appeal erred in finding no
evidence that Anna Teremy was defrauded. While it is not essential for a victim
to be defrauded ""of any property, money or valuable security"",
""that there be actual economic loss as to the outcome of the fraud""
(see R. v. Olan, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175, at p. 1182, per Dickson J.
(as he then was)), there must nevertheless be an actual ""risk of prejudice
to the economic interests"" of the alleged victim, in this case Anna
Teremy.

 

19.              Under the scheme there was no such actual
risk of prejudice to the economic interests of Ms. Teremy. She was, as the trial
judge found, but a ""conduit"" in the transactions, being instrumental
to the flow of money between the respondents and the buyers of the receivables.
Even if she had been made an innocent instrument in a scheme she would not have
wanted to be part of had she not been deceived by the accused as regards the
authenticity of certain receivables, that still would not have been sufficient
to meet the test of ""risk of prejudice"" to her economic interests.
This Court has addressed that issue in Vézina and Côté, supra,
and made particular reference to the danger of looking for guidance as regards
the notion of fraud in s. 338 of the Code, to other jurisdictions, where
it was stated, at pp. 22‑23:

 

                   Reference
to decisions in other jurisdictions under the common law of fraud or to English
cases under their Larceny Act, 1861, and 1916, or their Theft Act,
1968, and 1978, must be read keeping in mind the fact that s. 338 of our Code
is different. While I agree with the oft quoted statement in R. v. Wines
(1953), 37 Cr. App. Rep. 197 at p. 199 that ""decei(t) is, by falsehood, to
induce a state of mind"" and that ""to defraud is, by deceit, to induce
a course of action"", we must keep in mind that in Canada s. 338 of the Criminal
Code  reads on to say that that course of action must be in the nature of
depriving someone of ""property, money or valuable security"".

 

                   In
Scotland it has been found, in Adcock v. Archibald, [1925] J.C. 58, that
under the common law, ""any definite, practical result achieved by the
fraud is enough"" (per Lord Justice‑General Clyde, at p. 61),
and that ""The essence of the offence consists in inducing the person who
is defrauded either to take some article he would not otherwise have taken, or
to do some act he would not otherwise have done, or to become the medium of
some unlawful act"" (per Lord Hunter, at p. 61). That wide notion of
fraud has met with resistance in that jurisdiction (see Gordon, G. H., The
Criminal Law of Scotland (2nd ed. 1978), at p. 603). Clearly that cannot be
the law in Canada under our s. 338.

 

20.              I therefore agree with the Court of Appeal
that there was no evidence that Anna Teremy, the only victim upon which the
Crown's case could rest, had been defrauded of property, money or valuable
security.

 

21.              I would accordingly dismiss this appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for manitoba

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Kienapple principle ‑‑
Accused’s stabbing of a pregnant woman causing child’s premature birth and his death
‑‑ Accused convicted of causing bodily harm to the mother ‑‑
Whether rule against multiple convictions precludes a trial on a charge of
manslaughter of the child.

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Procedure ‑‑
Prerogative writs ‑‑ Pre‑trial motion for a stay based on the
principle in Kienapple dismissed ‑‑ Prohibition and certiorari
sought by the accused ‑‑ Whether superior courts should decline to
grant prerogative remedy on an interlocutory application in respect of the rule
against multiple convictions.

 








                   The accused stabbed a pregnant woman in the abdomen
causing the premature birth of her child and his death. The accused, who was
convicted of causing bodily harm to the mother at her first trial, made a
preliminary motion requesting a stay of proceedings on a charge of manslaughter
of the child on the basis of the principle in Kienapple. The trial judge
denied the motion holding that Kienapple was inapplicable. The accused
then made an application to the Court of Queen's Bench for an order of
prohibition to prohibit the trial court from proceeding on the manslaughter
charge and for an order of certiorari to quash the indictment. The
application was dismissed. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the accused
could not be convicted on the charge of manslaughter, granted certiorari
and quashed the indictment. This appeal is to determine whether the accused,
who was convicted of causing bodily harm in respect of the mother, may also be
tried for manslaughter in respect of the deceased child.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   The rule against multiple convictions is applicable
when there is a relationship of sufficient proximity firstly as between the
facts, and secondly as between the offences which form the basis of two or more
charges. In most cases the factual nexus requirement will be satisfied by an
affirmative answer to the question: Does the same act of the accused ground
each of the charges? It will not always be easy to define when one act ends and
another begins, but when such difficulties arise they can be resolved having
regard to factors such as the remoteness or proximity of the events in time and
place, the presence or absence of relevant intervening events, and whether the
accused's actions were related to each other by a common objective.

 

                   No element which Parliament has seen fit to
incorporate into an offence and which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt
ought to be omitted from the offender's accounting to society, unless that
element is substantially the same as, or adequately corresponds to, an element
in the other offence for which he or she has been convicted. The requirement of
sufficient proximity between offences will therefore only be satisfied if there
is no additional and distinguishing element that goes to guilt in the offence
for which a conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple
principle.

 

                   An element cannot be regarded as distinct or
additional for the purpose of the rule against multiple convictions where (1)
an element in one offence is a particularization of an element in another
offence; (2) there is more than one method, embodied in more than one offence,
to prove a single delict; and (3) when Parliament in effect deems a particular
element to be satisfied by proof of a different nature because of social policy
or inherent difficulties of proof. In applying these criteria, however, it is
important not to carry logic so far as to frustrate Parliament's intent or as
to lose sight of the overarching question whether the same cause, matter or
delict underlies both charges. 

 

                   In the case at bar, Kienapple is not
applicable. The requirement of a sufficient factual nexus is satisfied‑‑a
single act of the accused grounds both charges‑‑but there is no
sufficient correspondence between the elements of the two offences to sustain
the operation of the rule against multiple convictions. The first offence
contains as an essential ingredient the causing of bodily harm to the mother;
the second requires proof of the death of her child. Neither of these elements
can be subsumed into the other. Moreover, in so far as crimes of personal
violence are concerned, the rule against multiple convictions is inapplicable
when the convictions relate to different victims.

 

                   Finally, notwithstanding the possibility of
jurisdictional error in some cases, a superior court should generally decline
to consider the merits of a Kienapple argument on an interlocutory
application.

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑This appeal raises once again the scope of
the principle enunciated in Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.
A single act of the respondent, Sandra Prince, caused injury to one person and
is alleged to have caused the death of another. Prince has been convicted of
causing bodily harm in respect of the injured victim. The question is whether
she may also be tried for manslaughter in respect of the deceased victim.

Facts

 

2.                On January 1, 1981, Sandra Prince, by
means of a single blow to the abdomen stabbed Bernice Daniels. At the time
Daniels was six months pregnant. On January 2, 1981, Prince was charged with
the attempted murder of Daniels. On January 6, 1981, Daniels gave birth to a
child who lived for 19 minutes and then died. The cause of death is alleged to
be traceable to the stabbing. The autopsy report indicated that the knife
penetrated the amniotic sac, causing contamination of the amniotic fluid which
in turn caused the child's premature birth. Because the fetus was not
sufficiently developed, the child died.

 

3.                Between December 7, 1981, and January 4,
1982, Prince was tried and acquitted of the attempted murder of Daniels but was
convicted on a charge of causing bodily harm to Daniels. An appeal to the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in respect of her conviction and sentence (six months
imprisonment) was dismissed on October 20, 1982.

 

4.                In the meantime, on July 1, 1981,
following an inquest into the death of the child, and following Prince's
committal for trial on the charge of attempted murder of Daniels, Prince was
charged with manslaughter of the child as follows:

 

THAT she, the said SANDRA
PRINCE, between the thirty‑first day of December, in the year of our Lord
one thousand nine hundred and eighty, and the seventh day of January, in the
year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty‑one, both dates
inclusive, at the City of Winnipeg, in the Eastern Judicial District, in the
Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully cause death to the unnamed male child of
Bernice Daniels, and did thereby commit manslaughter.

 

A preliminary inquiry regarding this charge was held in February, 1982,
and Prince was committed to stand trial. On April 29, 1983, Prince's lawyer
made a preliminary motion to the trial judge, Barkman Co. Ct. J., requesting
him to enter a stay of proceedings on the basis of the principle in Kienapple
v. The Queen.

 

                                                                    II

 

Judgments in the Manitoba Courts

 

5.                Barkman Co. Ct. J. denied the motion. He
held that Kienapple was inapplicable because, although there was only
one act of the accused, there were two persons affected and there were two
different elements: the wounding of Daniels, and the wounding of the child
ultimately resulting in his death. Barkman Co. Ct. J. said that it was
difficult to reconcile the decision in R. v. Hagenlocher (1981), 65
C.C.C. (2d) 101 (Man. C.A.) with other cases. The majority of the Manitoba
Court of Appeal left the impression in its reasons in that case that the focus
of the Kienapple inquiry was on the acts of the accused which grounded
the charges. If a single act was involved, it appeared that Kienapple
would be applicable according to those reasons. Barkman Co. Ct. J. suggested
that whether Hagenlocher was correctly decided was a question which
might possibly be resolved in time. In his view, the majority of the
authorities indicated that Kienapple was inapplicable in multiple‑victim
situations.

 

6.                Prince then applied to the Court of
Queen's Bench for an order of prohibition to prohibit the County Court Judges'
Criminal Court from trying her on the manslaughter indictment, and for an order
of certiorari quashing the indictment. Without dealing with the merits
of the Kienapple argument, Kroft J. dismissed the application. In his
view, the application was in the nature of an appeal from the decision of
Barkman Co. Ct. J. on the preliminary motion. He felt the proper course for
Prince was to appeal the decision of the trial judge at the conclusion of the
trial.

 

7.                In the Manitoba Court of Appeal, on an
appeal from the decision of Kroft J., Matas J.A. delivered the reasons for a
unanimous panel consisting also of O'Sullivan and Huband JJ.A. Matas J.A.
observed that the decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v.
Hagenlocher was affirmed by this Court, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 531, for the
reasons delivered orally by Laskin C.J.:

 

                   We do
not need to hear you, Mr. Margolis and Mr. Zaifman. We are all of the opinion
that the conclusions reached by the majority judgment of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal in applying the Kienapple principle were correct and hence this
appeal must accordingly be dismissed.

 

Matas J.A. felt that Hagenlocher (which I will summarize below)
was applicable to the facts of the present case. Accordingly, Prince could not
be convicted on the manslaughter indictment. The Court of Appeal granted certiorari
and quashed the indictment, noting that it would have been a jurisdictional
error for Barkman Co. Ct. J. to have proceeded with a trial on the manslaughter
charge and that no purpose would be served by refusing relief to Prince and
thereby requiring her to submit to an unnecessary trial: (1983), 27 Man. R.
(2d) 63, 9 C.C.C. (3d) 155, [1984] 2 W.W.R. 114.

The Kienapple Case

 

8.                Since this Court's decision in Kienapple,
there has been considerable controversy about the nature and scope of the
principle of res judicata articulated for the majority by Laskin J., as
he then was. Various commentators have expressed differing views about the
meaning and application of the Kienapple case: see Dennis R. Klinck,
"" ""The Same Cause or Matter"": The Legacy of Kienapple""
(1983‑84), 26 Crim. L. Q. 280; James C. Jordan, ""Application

Criminal Law and Procedure: The 1979‑80 Term"" (1981), 2 Supreme
Court L. R. 177, at pp. 213‑19. The courts also have expressed widely
differing views regarding the proper scope of the Kienapple principle:
contrast, for example, the majority opinion of Huband J.A. with the dissenting
opinion of Monnin J.A., as he then was, in R. v. Hagenlocher.

 

9.                The variance of views within the
judiciary and in the learned journals suggests that the time may well be ripe
for a review of the jurisprudence in this area. The appropriate point of
departure is, of course, the judgment of the majority in Kienapple in which
an accused was indicted on two counts in respect of a single act of non‑consensual
sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old girl who was not his wife. The
defendant, Kienapple, was charged with rape contrary to s. 143 and unlawful
carnal knowledge of a female under fourteen years of age contrary to s. 146(1) 
of the Criminal Code . At page 744, Laskin J. said:

 

                   It is
plain, of course, that Parliament has defined two offences in ss. 143  and
146(1) , but there is an overlap in the sense that one embraces the other
when the sexual intercourse has been with a girl under age fourteen without her
consent. It is my view that in such a case, if the accused has been charged,
first, with rape and, secondly, with a s. 146(1)  offence, and there is a
verdict of guilty of rape, the second charge falls as an alternative charge and
the jury should be so directed. Correlatively, however, the jury should also be
directed that if they find the accused not guilty of rape they may still find
him guilty under s. 146(1)  where sexual intercourse with a girl under age
fourteen has been proved.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

10.              In describing the rationale underlying his
conclusion Laskin J. referred to a principle that there ought not to be
multiple convictions for the same ""delict"", ""matter"" or
""cause"". At page 750, he explained:

 

The relevant inquiry so
far as res judicata is concerned is whether the same cause or matter
(rather than the same offence) is comprehended by two or more offences.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

And at p. 751:

 

                   If
there is a verdict of guilty on the first count and the same or
substantially the same elements make up the offence charged in a second
count, the situation invites application of a rule against multiple
convictions:...

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

The majority judgment at p. 753, however, recognized that Parliament
could create two separate offences out of the same matter and could mandate
multiple convictions if it made clear its intentions in this regard.

 

11.              After considering the legislative history
of the two offences in the Kienapple case, Laskin J. stated at pp. 753‑54:

 

                   If any
conclusion can be drawn from this short history, it is that carnal knowledge of
a victim under age ten, and later under age fourteen, with its lesser
punishment after 1877 (and until that for rape was changed), was regarded as an
alternative charge to rape, unnecessary where there was no consent (since
age was not and is not a necessary averment in rape) but available where proof
of want of consent could not be made or was doubtful.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

12.              Professor Klinck in the following passage
at p. 286 of his article, "" ""The Same Cause or Matter"": The
Legacy of Kienapple"", supra, has in my view correctly identified
the manner in which the two charges in Kienapple were
""alternative"" to each other:

 

Sexual intercourse with a
female under 14 could be regarded as a kind of ""constructive rape"";
it might be said that the statute deems a girl under 14 to be incapable of
consenting.

 

It is only in this fashion that it can properly be said that ""the
same or substantially the same elements"" made up the offences of rape and
carnal knowledge of a female under 14 years of age.

 

13.              Several commentators on the Kienapple
decision have suggested that res judicata in criminal law is an
inappropriate foundation upon which to rest a rule against multiple
convictions, or at least that a new meaning had to be given to res judicata
in order to support the Kienapple decision: Sheppard, supra, at
p. 635; Ewaschuk, supra, at p. 30; Jordan, supra, at pp. 347‑48;
Chasse, supra, at pp. 20‑21; and Mewett, supra, at p. 385.
There may be some merit to questioning the choice of terminology selected by
the majority, and for this reason I prefer to refer to the doctrine enunciated
in Kienapple as a rule against multiple convictions or, simply, as the Kienapple
principle.

 

14.              What cannot seriously be denied, however,
is that there was antecedent Canadian case law precluding multiple convictions
in circumstances that did not fall neatly within the plea of autrefois
convict, or within s. 11  of the Criminal Code  (prohibiting multiple
punishment for the ""same offence""), or within the requirements of an
included offence under s. 589 : see, for example, R. v. Quon, [1948]
S.C.R. 508, and R. v. Siggins (1960), 127 C.C.C. 409 (Ont. C.A.) These
cases, amongst others, prior to the Court's decision in Kienapple, make
it clear that the Canadian courts have long been concerned to see that multiple
convictions are not without good reason heaped on an accused in respect of a
single criminal delict. I therefore cannot agree with those commentators who
refer to the Kienapple case as having created an entirely ""new
defence"": Chasse, supra at p. 20; Jordan, supra, at p. 356.
What was new in Kienapple relative to Quon (though not to Siggins)
was the abandoning of an attempt to give effect to a rule against multiple
convictions by ""reading down"" a Criminal Code  provision. What
was also new was an express recognition that the test for the application of
the rule had to be framed not in terms of whether the offences charged were the
""same offences"" (or ""included offences""), but in terms of
whether the same ""cause"", ""matter"" or ""delict""
was the foundation for both charges.

 

15.              This second change acknowledges that
""offence"" is a term of art and any given offence cannot be ""the
same as"" or ""included in"" any other offence unless there is a
precise correspondence in the definition of the offences. In the words of Lord
Devlin, ""legal characteristics are precise things and are either the same
or not"": Connelly v. D.P.P., [1964] A.C. 1254 (H.L.) See also
Klinck, supra, at p. 285. In short, I believe it was the acknowledgment
of the independent legal identity of different offences which led the majority
in Kienapple to its careful choice of the words, ""cause"",
""matter"", or ""delict"" in lieu of ""offence"".

 

16.              Unfortunately, some commentators and
courts have wrongly inferred from these words that there need be no substantial
nexus between the offences for which an application of the Kienapple
principle is sought, providing there is a common act of the accused
underlying the charges. The excerpts which I have quoted above from the Kienapple
case, including phrases such as ""substantially the same elements"",
""alternative charges"", and ""one [offence] embraces the
other"", suggest that the majority thought otherwise.

 

                                                                   IV

 

The Scope of the Kienapple Principle

 

(i)                The Factual Nexus Between the Charges

 

17.              It is elementary that Kienapple
does not prohibit a multiplicity of convictions, each in respect of a different
factual incident. Offenders have always been exposed to criminal liability for
each occasion on which they have transgressed the law, and Kienapple
does not purport to alter this perfectly sound principle. It is therefore a sine
qua non for the operation of the rule against multiple convictions that the
offences arise from the same transaction.

 

18.              The degree of factual identity between the
charges that is required to sustain the application of the rule is exemplified
by the decision of this Court in Côté v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 303,
which involved two offences normally capable of supporting the rule against
multiple convictions: see Hewson v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 82, at p.
97. In Côté, the accused had been found in possession of property two
years after his conviction for a robbery in respect of the same property. The
accused had been sentenced for the robbery offence, imprisoned and released
from prison when the police found him in possession of the stolen property.
Evidently the accused had hidden the fruits of his robbery before he served his
jail sentence. It was argued that possession by the original thief was merely a
continuation of the act of theft.

 

19.              The majority of the Court, however, held
that the accused's possession was sufficiently removed in time and circumstance
from the original taking of the property so that the accused could be convicted
of both offences. Fauteux C.J. (Ritchie, Abbott and Judson JJ. concurring)
wrote, at pp. 310‑11:

 

In my opinion one cannot
validly maintain, on the one hand, that continuation of the thief's possession‑‑whether
for weeks, months or years‑‑is always a continuation of the act of
theft or, if one prefers, a continuation of the commission of the theft, and
one cannot, on the other hand, maintain that at the very time and place in
which the thief takes or converts the thing, and so acquires possession of it,
he is committing the offence of unlawful possession dealt with in s. 296.

 

                   Determination
of the time when the offence of theft is consummated and the offence of
unlawful possession, described in s. 296, so far as the thief is concerned,
begins, cannot be resolved in the abstract. However, the difficulty that may
exist in determining this time, according to the circumstances of each case,
does not affect the substance of the law.

 

For Pigeon J. (Martland J. concurring) it was the intervening
conviction itself which separated the theft from the possession. In his view,
an accused could not receive judicial sanction to continue breaking the law.
For a continuing offence there is no undue multiplication of convictions when
the second conviction relates to a continuation of the offence beyond the date
of the first conviction.

 

20.              In most cases, I believe, the factual
nexus requirement will be satisfied by an affirmative answer to the question: Does
the same act of the accused ground each of the charges? As Côté
demonstrates, however, it will not always be easy to define when one act ends
and another begins. Not only are there peculiar problems associated with
continuing offences, but there exists the possibility of achieving different
answers to this question according to the degree of generality at which an act
is defined: see Klinck, supra, at p. 292; Leonoff and Deutscher, supra,
at p. 261; and Sheppard, supra, at p. 638. Such difficulties will have
to be resolved on an individual basis as cases arise, having regard to factors
such as the remoteness or proximity of the events in time and place, the
presence or absence of relevant intervening events (such as the robbery
conviction in Côté), and whether the accused's actions were related to
each other by a common objective. In the meantime, it would be a mistake to
emphasize the difficulties. In many cases, including the present appeal, it
will be clear whether or not the charges are founded upon the same act.

 

(ii)               The Nexus Between the Offences: Need There
be One?

 

21.              The next question which must be addressed
is whether the presence of a sufficient factual nexus is the only requirement
which must be met in order to justify application of the Kienapple
principle. Counsel for Sandra Prince refers in his factum to the Kienapple
principle as one relating to multiple convictions for the same act.
Similarly, Sheppard, in his early commentary on Kienapple, propounds a
same transaction test for the rule against multiple convictions. Some
courts, too, have referred to the ""same act"" or ""same
transaction"" underlying two offences in terms which might suggest that
that was sufficient to sustain the operation of the rule: see, for example, R.
v. Boyce (1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 16 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Allison
(1983), 33 C.R. (3d) 333 (Ont. C.A.) and Hagenlocher (Man. C.A.)

 

22.              In my opinion, the application of Kienapple
is not so easily triggered. Once it has been established that there is a
sufficient factual nexus between the charges, it remains to determine whether
there is an adequate relationship between the offences themselves. The
requirement of an adequate legal nexus is apparent from the use by the majority
in Kienapple of the words ""cause"", ""matter"" or
""delict"" in lieu of ""act"" or ""transaction"" in
defining the principle articulated in that case. More telling is the fact that
Laskin J. went to considerable pains to discuss the legislative history of rape
and carnal knowledge of a female under 14 years and to conclude that the
offences were perceived as alternative charges when there was non‑consensual
intercourse with a female under 14. I am not prepared to regard Laskin J.'s
analysis in this regard as unnecessary or irrelevant to the outcome in Kienapple,
which it would of course be if the rule against multiple convictions applied
whenever there was a sufficient factual nexus between the charges.

 

23.              In my opinion, the weight of authority
since Kienapple also supports the proposition that there must be
sufficient nexus between the offences charged to sustain the rule against
multiple convictions. In a unanimous judgment in McKinney v. The Queen,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 401, delivered orally by Laskin C.J., the Court saw no reason
for interfering with a decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal reported at
(1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 566. Although Kienapple was not referred to in
the reasons of this Court, it had been argued in the Court of Appeal. McKinney
and others were charged and convicted of hunting out of season and hunting at
night with lights contrary to ss. 16(1) and 19(1), respectively, of the Wildlife
Act, R.S.M. 1970, c. W140. Both charges arose out of the same hunting
incident. O'Sullivan J.A. for the majority held that the case involved two
""delicts"". Monnin J.A., dissenting on another issue, said that
hunting out of season and hunting with lights were two different ""matters"",
totally separate one from the other and not alternative one to the other. The
judges of the Court of Appeal all agreed that Kienapple was
inapplicable. Thus, notwithstanding there was but a single act of hunting,
there were distinct delicts, causes or matters which would sustain separate
convictions.

 

24.              Numerous other cases can be cited to
illustrate that a single act of an accused can involve two or more delicts
against society which bear little or no connection the one to the other. R.
v. Logeman (1978), 5 C.R. (3d) 219 (B.C.C.A.) involved charges of driving
while suspended and impaired driving; R. v. Lecky (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d)
406 (N.S. Co. Ct.), contributing to juvenile delinquency and trafficking in a
narcotic; R. v. Earle (1980), 24 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 65 (Nfld. C.A.),
breach of recognizance and possession of a narcotic; R. v. Pinkerton
(1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 284 (B.C.C.A.), breach of probation and common assault; R.
v. Père Jean Grégoire de la Trinité (1980), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 542 (Que. C.A.),
contempt of court and unlawfully detaining children. Notwithstanding that a
single act of the accused appears in each of these cases to have given rise to
two charges, Kienapple was held to be inapplicable. In my view, these
cases were correctly decided. If an accused is guilty of several wrongs, there
is no injustice in his or her record conforming to that reality. In short, I
agree with the following remarks of Lambert J.A. in R. v. Harrison
(1978), 7 C.R. (3d) 32 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 37:

 

It is not sufficient to
consider the charges and to ask whether conviction on one will involve
conviction on another. It is not sufficient to consider the facts and to ask
whether only one act is involved. The facts and the charges must be considered
together and in their relationship to each other.

 

There must be a relationship of sufficient proximity firstly as between
the facts, and secondly as between the offences, which form the basis of two or
more charges for which it is sought to invoke the rule against multiple
convictions.

 

(iii)               Is it Sufficient that the Offences Share a
Common Element?

 

25.              It has frequently been suggested that the
presence of a common element in the offences charged will be sufficient to
attract the Kienapple principle. Ewaschuk, supra, at p. 41 of his
1975 article on the rule against multiple convictions suggests:

 

If the offences stem from
the same act and have a common element or elements, then Kienapple
should apply.

 

The common element test rests on the proposition or principle that an
act which constitutes an element of an offence can only be used to sustain a
single conviction. It is thereafter ""used up"" for the purposes of the
criminal law. Mewett, supra, at pp. 383‑84, explained the Kienapple
case in this light:

 

                   Kienapple is as good an illustration as any. The offence on count one embraces
the actus reus of (i) sexual intercourse (ii) woman not his wife and
(iii) no consent. On count two, it embraces (i) sexual intercourse (ii) woman
not his wife and (iii) under fourteen. But two of the elements necessary under
count two have become, as Laskin, J., stated, res judicata‑‑they
are used up, leaving, on count 2 only the third element dangling in the air. The
acts (nouns) of the accused caused by his acting can only be used once‑‑either
for count one or count two but not both. Any acts not previously
adjudicated remain, but, detached from the now adjudicated other acts, could
not support a conviction.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

26.              This principle against the duplication of
elements appears to underlie a number of judicial decisions: see, for example, R.
v. Taylor (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 523 (Nfld. C.A.), at pp. 537‑38 and R.
v. Allison, supra, at pp. 339‑40. But, like the ""same
act"" test, it fails to explain a number of cases which I believe were
correctly decided, such as McKinney and Logeman.

 

27.              In any event, I observe that a common
element test has already been considered and rejected by this Court. In Côté
v. The Queen, supra, at p. 310, Fauteux C.J. wrote:

 

The fact that [a thief's]
possession is a common ingredient of both offences [i.e. theft and unlawful
possession] is no reason to exclude or ignore what is actually the crucial
factor distinguishing one from the other, and is of the essence of their
respective nature.

 

The majority in Côté thus pointed in the direction of a test
which focused not on the presence or absence of a common element, but on
the presence or absence of additional, distinguishing elements.

 

28.              Indeed, such a focus is apparent even in
the Kienapple case. At page 755, Laskin J. specifically addressed the
elements that were different in the two offences for which the Crown sought
convictions:

 

                   In the
circumstances of the present case, the superadded element of age in s.
146(1)  does not operate to distinguish unlawful carnal knowledge from rape. Age
under fourteen is certainly material where consent to the sexual intercourse is
present; but once that is ruled out, as it is in the present case, it
becomes meaningless as a distinguishing feature of the offences of rape and
unlawful carnal knowledge.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

29.              Most recently, in Krug v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 255, this Court unmistakably focused on the presence of
distinguishing elements, rather than on the presence of shared elements, in
assessing the applicability of Kienapple. Krug was charged with robbery
under s. 302(d) and with various firearms offences including an offence
under s. 83(1)(a). Krug submitted that the Kienapple principle at
common law and as allegedly constitutionalized in ss. 7  and 11 (h) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  precluded convictions for the
firearms offences. His arguments regarding the s. 83  conviction were rejected
in a unanimous judgment, delivered by La Forest J.

 

30.              La Forest J. adopted the following passage
from the reasons of Martin J.A. in R. v. Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d)
138 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 145:

 

Notwithstanding that in
most cases of ""armed robbery"" the offender will have used the weapon,
none the less, s. 83(1), by making the use of a firearm an essential
element of the offence created by the subsection, unlike s. 122 which
required only that the offender have a firearm on his person, imports a
further element in addition to those which suffice to constitute theft while
armed with a firearm.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Or, as expressed by La Forest J. himself at pp. 262‑63:

 

[The doctrine of res
judicata] would apply to prevent conviction for both offences if the
difference between the two was limited solely to the fact that s. 83
particularizes the form of weapon since the specific weapon was, of course, the
weapon used in both offences. But s. 83 also requires that the firearms be used,
an act not necessarily encompassed in being armed with it, and there was
evidence of use apart from that of being armed. In short, to be convicted of
an offence under s. 83 it was necessary to prove that the accused did something
beyond what is required to establish the offence under s. 302(d).

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

31.              It has been a consistent theme in the
jurisprudence from Quon, through Kienapple and Krug that
the rule against multiple convictions in respect of the same cause, matter or
delict is subject to an expression of Parliamentary intent that more than one
conviction be entered when offences overlap: see, in particular, McGuigan v.
The Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 284. In Krug, La Forest J. was careful to
explain that the presence of additional, distinguishing elements was in itself
an expression of such an intent. No element which Parliament has seen fit to
incorporate into an offence and which has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt
ought to be omitted from the offender's accounting to society, unless that
element is substantially the same as, or adequately corresponds to, an element
in the other offence for which he or she has been convicted.

 

32.              I conclude, therefore, that the
requirement of sufficient proximity between offences will only be satisfied if
there is no additional and distinguishing element that goes to guilt contained
in the offence for which a conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple
principle.

 

33.              There is, however, a corollary to this
conclusion. Where the offences are of unequal gravity, Kienapple may bar
a conviction for a lesser offence, notwithstanding that there are additional
elements in the greater offence for which a conviction has been registered,
provided that there are no distinct additional elements in the lesser offence.
For example, in R. v. Loyer, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 631, Kienapple was
applied to bar convictions for possession of a weapon for the purpose of
committing an offence when convictions were entered for the more serious
offence of attempted armed robbery by use of a knife. Although the robbery
charges contained the element of theft which distinguished them from the
weapons charges, there were no elements in the weapons charges which were
additional to or distinct from those in the robbery charges. Accordingly, it
was appropriate for the Court to apply Kienapple to bar convictions on
the lesser weapons charges rather than on the robbery charges.

 

(iv)              When is an Element of an Offence not
Additional or Distinct?

 

34.              I now turn briefly to the question of when
an element of an offence sufficiently corresponds to another element so that it
cannot be regarded as additional or distinct. When can it be said that elements
are ""substantially the same"" or ""alternative"" the one to
the other? This is a question which defies precise answers. Differences of
degree are often important and, as La Forest J. has pointed out, abstract logic
must be supplemented by an awareness of practical considerations in
ascertaining Parliament's intention in creating different offences: Krug,
supra, p. 269. Without purporting to be exhaustive, I believe that there
are at least three ways in which sufficient correspondence between elements can
be found, each of which is subject always to the manifestation of a legislative
intent to increase punishment in the event that two or more offences overlap.

 

35.              First, an element may be a
particularization of another element. In Krug, the Court was called upon
to consider not only the relationship between s. 83(1)(a) and s. 302(d),
as described above, but also the relationship between s. 83(1)(a) and s.
84. Section 84 made it an offence to point a firearm at a person. Section
83(1)(a), it will be recalled, made it an offence to use a firearm while
committing an indictable offence. The trial judge had characterized the element
of ""pointing at a person"" as an ingredient additional to
""use"". This Court disagreed, saying, ""It is obvious that
pointing a gun is a manner of using it"" (p. 268). Accordingly, the Court
referred to pointing as a particularization of use. Under the circumstances, it
was difficult to believe that Parliament intended ""automatically to make
the same objectionable behaviour the subject of two separate offences""
(p. 270).

 

36.              In general, the particularization in one
offence of an element of another offence should not be regarded as a
distinguishing feature that renders Kienapple inapplicable. Parliament
may create offences of varying degrees of generality, with the objective (vis‑à‑vis
the more general offence) of ensuring that criminal conduct will not escape
punishment because of a failure of the drafters to think of each individual
circumstance in which the conduct might be committed, or with the objective (vis‑à‑vis
the more specific offence) of addressing with certainty particular conduct in
particular circumstances. In the absence of some indication of Parliamentary
intent that there should be multiple convictions or added punishment in the
event of an overlap, the particularization of an element ought not to be taken
as a sufficient distinction to preclude the operation of the Kienapple
principle.

 

37.              A second way in which elements may
correspond relates to there being more than one method, embodied in more than
one offence, to prove a single delict. In R. v. Gushue (1976), 32 C.C.C.
(2d) 189 (Ont. C.A.), affirmed on other grounds, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 798, the
accused was charged under s. 124 with giving evidence in a judicial proceeding
that was contrary to his own previous evidence. He was also charged with
perjury contrary to s. 121. The Court reached the conclusion that convictions
under both offences would have infringed the Kienapple principle. I
agree. Although s. 121 and s. 124 have different elements, the difference is
clearly not a reflection of any Parliamentary intent to add extra punishment
when both offences can be proven. Section 124 is designed merely to facilitate
proof of false evidence having been given, notwithstanding that no one
particular statement can be proven false. Parliament has merely succumbed to
the imperatives of logic: if two contradictory statements are given, one of
them must be false and the delict of giving false evidence must have been
committed on one of the two occasions.

 

38.              The third situation in which there is
sufficient correspondence between elements to sustain the Kienapple
principle is somewhat similar. It arises when Parliament in effect deems a
particular element to be satisfied by proof of a different nature, not
necessarily because logic compels that conclusion, but because of social policy
or inherent difficulties of proof. The Kienapple case itself affords one
example. There, as we have seen, the element of the victim's age served as a
substitute for the element of non‑consent. A girl of less than fourteen
years of age could not in Parliament's opinion meaningfully consent to sexual
intercourse. Another example is provided by Terlecki v. The Queen,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 483. Although the case largely dealt with a procedural issue,
the Court's decision was predicated on the applicability of Kienapple as
between the offences of impaired driving contrary to s. 234 and ""over
80"" contrary to s. 236. Impairment is inherently difficult to prove, and
Parliament has deemed a certain proportion of alcohol in one's blood to
constitute an impairment of driving ability. The differences between the
elements of these offences are explained by an attempt to facilitate the
apprehension by the police or the conviction by the courts of persons who are
guilty of essentially the same wrongful conduct: see Leonoff and Deutscher, supra,
at p. 261. I believe that elements which serve only as an evidentiary proxy for
another element cannot be regarded as distinct or additional elements for the
purposes of the rule against multiple convictions.

 

39.              I emphasize that in applying the above
criteria it is important not to carry logic so far as to frustrate the intent
of Parliament or as to lose sight of the overarching question whether the same
cause, matter or delict underlies both charges. For example, there exist
offences aimed at a particular evil which (in certain circumstances) contain as
an element the commission of some other offence directed toward an entirely
different wrong. Such was the relationship between the offences in Lecky,
Earle, Pinkerton and Père Jean Grégoire. In these cases,
it could be argued, a substantive offence was subsumed by a greater, generic
offence: Klinck, supra, at pp. 301‑02. To illustrate, the offence
of breach of probation contains as an element the non‑compliance with a
probation order which, as a matter of law, requires the accused to keep the
peace and be of good behaviour: s. 663(2). The fact that breach of probation is
an offence punishable by summary conviction (s. 666(1)) is a clear
indication that Parliament cannot have intended a conviction for that offence
to operate as a bar to a conviction for the substantive offence (which might
attract a far more severe penalty) merely because the substantive offence might
be regarded as a particularization of a failure to keep the peace and be of
good behaviour. Plainly, breach of probation is an offence designed to protect
the effective operation of the criminal justice system, a societal interest
which is entirely different from that protected by an offence such as assault.
Accordingly, Kienapple had no application in those four cases.

 

                                                                    V

 

Applicability of the Kienapple Principle in the Present Case

 

40.              As has been noted above, the respondent
Sandra Prince has been convicted of causing bodily harm to Bernice Daniels. She
has been charged with a second offence, namely, the manslaughter of Daniels'
child, arising out of the same act of stabbing. I should, perhaps, explain that
no question arises regarding the viability of a manslaughter charge founded on
an act prior to the victim's birth. Section 206(2) reads as follows:

 

                   206. ...

 

                   (2) A
person commits homicide when he causes injury to a child before or during its
birth as a result of which the child dies after becoming a human being.

 

The only issue before the Court, therefore, is the applicability of Kienapple.

 

41.              I have no hesitation in concluding that
the requirement of a sufficient factual nexus is satisfied in the present
appeal. A single act of the accused grounds both charges. It is true that the
stabbing produced two separate consequences, the injury to Bernice Daniels and
the death of the child. But such matters as the consequences of an act, the
circumstances in which it was committed, or the status of the victim are most
appropriately considered in the analysis of the legal nexus requirement. For it
is only when consequences, circumstances, or status are incorporated into
elements of an offence that they are relevant.

 

42.              Is there sufficient correspondence between
the elements of the two offences to sustain the operation of the rule against
multiple convictions? One offence contains as an essential ingredient the
causing of bodily harm to Bernice Daniels. The other offence requires proof of
the death of Daniels' child. I cannot see how either of these elements can be
subsumed into the other. There is no sense in which it can be said that one is
a particularization of the other or is designed to facilitate proof of the
other.

 

43.              The respondent relies heavily on the Hagenlocher
case. The accused in Hagenlocher was charged with manslaughter and with
wilfully setting fire to a substance which was likely to cause a building to
catch fire contrary to s. 390. He had poured some vodka on a hotel bed and set
fire to it. The fire spread through the hotel, causing the death of one person
by asphyxiation and extensive property damage. On the facts it is evident that
the manslaughter charge was grounded in s. 205(5)(a), which reads:

 

                   205. ...

 

                   (5) A
person commits culpable homicide when he causes the death of a human being,

 

(a) by means of an
unlawful act

 

The unlawful act was the wilful setting fire to a substance. Assuming
that Hagenlocher was correctly decided, in my view the result can only
be justified if it is regarded as a case in which all the elements of the s.
390 offence were incorporated into a greater offence. The manslaughter charge
consisted of (i) an unlawful act, particularized as the setting of a fire
likely to cause a building to burn, and (ii) a consequence of that act, that
is, the death of a person. No elements of the s. 390 offence remained to
sustain a second conviction. If this Court adopted reasons inconsistent with
those I have just outlined, then I believe the Court erred. But, in my opinion,
this Court's approval of the reasoning below was restricted to the conclusion
that Kienapple applied in that case. I should add that to treat the
arson offence as a particularization of the ""unlawful act""
requirement in s. 205 is, at best, at the very outer edges of the Kienapple
principle. However, the Court has not been asked to reconsider the correctness
of Hagenlocher in the present appeal, and I refrain from doing so.

 

44.              Even if the manslaughter charge in the
case at bar is seen to be framed under s. 205(5)(a) rather than s. 206
the distinction between the present case and Hagenlocher is readily
apparent. The lesser offence in Hagenlocher proscribed only an unlawful
act, the setting of a fire. The lesser offence in the present case, on the
contrary, also proscribes particular consequences which lie at the heart of
that offence.

 

45.              Although the above analysis suffices to
dispose of this appeal, I wish to underline that the conclusion I have reached
reflects the importance which the drafters of the Code have attached to
criminal conduct that results in bodily injury or death of the victim or
victims. Many of the provisions of the Criminal Code , particularly those
in respect of crimes of violence, contain an escalation of penalties for acts
of the accused that result in graver consequences than otherwise identical
conduct. Parliament's concern for the physical safety of the public would be
frustrated by holding that either of the respective elements of bodily injury
to Bernice Daniels or the death of the child were (to use the words of Laskin
J. in Kienapple) ""meaningless as a distinguishing feature"".

 

46.              It is, moreover, of some interest to the
present case that the majority judgment in Kienapple at p. 750 referred
to the death of a victim of violent crime as a ""new relevant
element"". It is clear from this reference that the consequence of a
wrongful act of an accused is an ""element"" which is capable of
distinguishing two convictions in respect of a single unlawful act by an
accused.

 

47.              Also of particular relevance to the
present appeal is a passage at pp. 744‑45 in which Laskin J. referred to
his conclusion in Kienapple in the following terms:

 

                   The
rationale of my conclusion that the charges must be treated as alternative if
there is a verdict of guilty of rape on the first count, that there should not
be multiple convictions for the same delict against the same girl, has a
long history in the common law.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

It would appear from this passage that, at least in so far as crimes of
personal violence are concerned, the rule against multiple convictions is
inapplicable when the convictions relate to different victims. Indeed, I
believe it was never within the contemplation of the majority in Kienapple
that the rule enunciated therein would preclude two convictions for offences
respectively containing as elements the injury or death of two different
persons.

 

48.              Society, through the criminal law, requires
Prince to answer for both the injury to Bernice Daniels and the death of the
child, just as it would require a person who threw a bomb into a crowded space
to answer for the multiple injuries and deaths that might result, and just as
it compels a criminally negligent driver to answer for each person injured or
killed as a result of his or her driving: see R. v. Birmingham and Taylor
(1976), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 386 (Ont. C.A.)

 

49.              I have undertaken the analysis of the
present case as though the respondent were seeking to bar a conviction on the
lesser offence of causing bodily harm to Bernice Daniels. In fact, she seeks to
bar a conviction on the more serious charge of manslaughter, having already
been convicted of causing bodily harm. The Crown elected to proceed by way of
successive trials rather than seek joinder. Although I do not suggest that the
Crown did so in an effort to avoid the rule against multiple convictions, it is
perhaps worth emphasizing that the Kienapple principle cannot be avoided
by the simple expedient of proceeding in this fashion. Had I reached a
different conclusion on the principal issue in this appeal, it would
accordingly have been necessary to consider whether a trial on the more serious
charge would have been entirely precluded, or whether, by analogy to cases such
as Loyer and Terlecki, the trial should have been undertaken on
the understanding that a stay would be entered on the lesser offence in the
event of a conviction on the more serious offence. However, since I have
concluded that Kienapple has no application to the offences charged, I
need not address that issue.

 

50.              Although it was not argued in this Court,
I wish to add that in my view it is normally appropriate for a superior court
to decline to grant a prerogative remedy on an interlocutory application in
respect of the rule against multiple convictions. That rule has proved to be a
fertile source of appeals. The delay engendered by an erroneous application of
the Kienapple principle prior to the conclusion of the trial is
regrettably illustrated by the present case. Prerogative remedies are
discretionary, and notwithstanding the possibility of jurisdictional error in
some cases, it would generally be preferable for superior courts to decline to
consider the merits of a Kienapple argument on an interlocutory
application.

 

51.              I would allow the appeal, reverse the
decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal granting a writ of certiorari
and an order quashing the indictment, and remit the matter for trial on the
manslaughter indictment.

1.                The
Court‑‑This appeal is before us as of right. The appeal is
from the conviction of Harlie Marvin Nehring on a charge of second degree
murder. He was convicted before Egbert J. of the Court of Queen's Bench of
Alberta sitting alone. On appeal, two members of the Alberta Court of Appeal
(McClung and Stevenson JJ.A.) dismissed the appeal with Harradence J.A. in

2.                Three points were raised on behalf of
the appellant in this Court:

 

1. That the learned
trial judge erred in law in misdirecting himself as to burden of proof and that
this misdirection was not a mere slip or harmless deviation from proper
direction;

 

2. That the learned
trial judge erred in failing to warn himself regarding the risk in adopting the
evidence of the Crown witness Von Wolzogen;

 

3. That the learned
trial judge erred in disregarding and failing to assess evidence which could
have affected his verdict.

 

As the law applicable to the facts of this case is not in dispute, it
will suffice to dispose of the appeal in the manner following:

 

3.                Four members of the Court (the Chief
Justice and McIntyre, Chouinard and Le Dain JJ.) are in substantial agreement
with the majority decision of the Court of Appeal of Alberta and would dismiss
the appeal. Three members of the Court (Estey, Lamer and Wilson JJ.) are in

on appeal from the court of appeal for saskatchewan

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Jury verdict ‑‑
Validity ‑‑ Charge of attempted murder with lesser included
offences ‑‑ Jury foreman replying “not guilty” to clerk’s question ‑‑
Accused discharged and jury dismissed ‑‑ Foreman indicating

reconvened to reconsider its verdict ‑‑ Whether or not jury can be
reconvened to complete or correct transmission and recording of verdict reached
prior to its dismissal.

 








                   Appellant was accused of attempted murder and tried
by judge and jury. The judge instructed the jury on a number of lesser included
offences, in addition to the charge on the indictment. After jury returned a
verdict of not guilty on the charge of attempted murder, the judge dismissed
them and discharged the accused. The foreman of the jury then indicated to the
judge that the jury may have found the accused guilty of a lesser included
offence. The judge had the jury reassemble in the body of the courtroom, heard
submissions, and then found that he was functus. The majority of the Court
of Appeal found that the doctrine of functus was not properly applied
here and was of the opinion that the jury verdict was not complete until all
possible verdicts had been dealt with and disposed of. The acquittal was set
aside and a new trial ordered on all of the lesser and included offences. At
issue here is whether the jury can be reconvened after being discharged (1) to
reconsider its verdict or (2) to complete or correct the transmission and
recording of a verdict it had arrived at prior to discharge.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Beetz, McIntyre, Chouinard, Wilson and La Forest JJ.: The nature of the
criminal process requires that the power or duty of the trial judge to
intervene when a jury verdict is returned and to inquire as to the true nature
of the verdict be exercised prior to the jury's discharge. 

 

                   The trial judge here could reasonably conclude that
the jury had considered the included offences and that its verdict was intended
to be a full acquittal on principal and included offences. The court was wholly
functus when the question arose as to verdict and the matter had passed
beyond any stage where any correction could be made.

 

                   Per Lamer J.: A jury,
even after discharge, can be reconvened to correct an improper or incomplete
transmission or registration of a verdict, but it cannot reconsider a verdict
or complete its deliberations with a view to handing down additional verdicts
on counts or on included offences that it had not finally determined prior to that
discharge; nor can anyone go behind the verdict and make inquiries as regards
the nature of the deliberations. The effect of adopting the rule, until now
applicable to civil matters, is to ensure that those found guilty by the jury
do not go free and, more importantly, that those found innocent by the jury are
not convicted.

 

                   The error here was in not ascertaining with
certainty the verdict on the lesser included offences. If that verdict were an
acquittal on all or any of the included offences, the accused should not be
deprived of that verdict because of error in its transmission or registration
but only if error of law was committed in the reaching of that verdict. The
ordering of a new trial is a remedy where the determination of guilt or
innocence by the trial court is vitiated by an error.

 

                   The logical disposition of the appeal would be to
allow the appeal, quash the order for a new trial, and order that the matter be
returned to the trial court so that the jury's verdict might be ascertained. In
view of the time elapsed since the jury's discharge, the ends of justice would
be better served by allowing the appeal, quashing the order for a new trial and
leaving the acquittal, as registered, undisturbed.

                   APPEAL from a judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 198, 34 Sask. R. 216, allowing an appeal from an
acquittal granted by Hrabinsky J., sitting with jury. Appeal allowed.

 

                   June Lancaster,
for the appellant.

 

                   Carol A. Snell,
for the respondent. 

 

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Beetz, McIntyre,
Chouinard, Wilson and La Forest JJ. was delivered by

 

1.                McIntyre
J.‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment prepared by my colleague, Lamer J., in this appeal. I agree with him
that the acquittal recorded at trial should remain undisturbed. I arrive at
this conclusion on a somewhat narrower view of the trial judge's powers on the
return of a jury verdict in a criminal trial.

 

2.                The facts have been set out by Lamer J.
and I need not deal with them at great length. I would emphasize, however, that
during the course of his charge the trial judge instructed the jury on the
offence of attempted murder set out in the indictment, and upon certain
included offences on which the accused could be found guilty, depending upon
the view the jury took of the evidence. No issue has been raised as to the
adequacy of the charge. During the course of their deliberations, the jury
returned to the courtroom with a request for further instruction with respect
to included offences. The trial judge gave the requested direction and shortly
thereafter the jury returned with its verdict of not guilty. The trial judge,
having ascertained that the verdict was unanimous, discharged the prisoner,
discharged the jury, and adjourned the court until its next sitting day. No
question regarding the completeness of the jury's verdict arose until after the
prisoner and the jury had been discharged, and at least one member of the jury
left the others and entered the public part of the court.

 

3.                The law is well settled that a trial
judge, sitting with a jury, must instruct the jury on the principal offence or
offences charged in the indictment, as well as any included offences and the
verdicts that may be returned upon them. This principle emerges from R. v.
George, [1960] S.C.R. 871. The George case did not involve a jury
but the majority of the Court held that it was the duty of a trial judge, in
disposing of a criminal case, to consider all included offences of which there
is evidence, whether raised by counsel or not. It follows that when sitting
with a jury it is the duty of the trial judge to instruct the jury with respect
to included offences. There are several cases which follow and apply this
principle: see R. v. Morehouse (1982), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 231 (N.B.C.A.),
pp. 239‑40, where R. v. George, supra, was referred to, as
well as R. v. Longson (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 421 (B.C.C.A.)

 

4.                On the return of the jury if a clear and
unambiguous verdict is given, it is the judge's duty to accept the verdict and,
in accordance with the practice of his court, cause it to become a part of the
record of the court. Where the verdict is one of acquittal, the prisoner is
entitled to an immediate discharge unless subject to continued lawful detention
by reason of another cause or matter‑‑see: R. v. Blanchard,
[1941] 3 D.L.R. 467 (B.C.C.A.), and R. v. Hess (No. 2) (1949), 94 C.C.C.
57 (B.C.C.A.) In the Hess case, O'Halloran J.A., on a motion for bail by
an accused who had been acquitted in the Court of Appeal, but who had been held
pending a Crown appeal under the then s. 1025A of the Criminal Code 
[enacted by S.C. 1938, c. 44, s. 49], said, at p. 63:

 

When the appeal court
quashes a conviction and does not order a new trial, and as here directs a
verdict of acquittal, the former convict is entitled to walk out of Court a
free man. 

 

This principle is so well grounded in law that further authority is
hardly necessary (but see: R. v. Lonar (1893), 25 N.S.R. 124 (N.S.C.A.),
and R. v. Smith (1893), 25 N.S.R. 138 (N.S.C.A.) The editors of Crankshaw's
Criminal Code (8th ed.) cite these cases for the proposition that upon
acquittal an accused is entitled to an immediate discharge from custody. Where
the verdict is one of guilt, the trial judge should proceed with the
appropriate sentencing procedures in order to complete the disposition of the
case.

 

5.                Where, on the other hand, there is
ambiguity in the verdict or where there is reason to doubt that the verdict is
unanimous, the trial judge should inquire into the matter to ascertain the true
position and, where necessary, he should give such further directions as may be
required and allow further deliberation by the jury to satisfy himself that any
verdict given will indeed be unanimous, complete and expressive of the actual
findings of the jury. The judge has the discretion in such a case to accept a
substituted or second verdict for the first one returned. This discretion,
however, is one which is to be exercised during the course of the trial, that
is, in the presence of the accused and his counsel, and prior to the
dissolution of the court by the discharge of the jury. In R. v. Ford
(1853), 3 U.C.C.P. 209, the jury returned a verdict and after it had been
discharged questions arose concerning the unanimity of the verdict. The court
refused to disturb the verdict and Macaulay C.J., with whom the other two
judges concurred, said, at p. 217‑18:

 

                   That a
jury may correct their verdict, or that any of them may withhold assent and
express dissent therefrom at any time before it is finally entered and
confirmed, is clear from numerous authorities; and the judge presiding over
a criminal court cannot be too cautious in being assured that, when a result so
serious to the party accused as a verdict of guilty is arrived at, all the jury
understand the effect and concur in the decision; and if at any moment, before
it is too late, anything occurs to excite suspicious on this subject, he
should carefully assure himself that there is no misapprehension in the matter.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

Of interest on this point are Laforet v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
869, in this Court where the Ford case was referred to with approval and
discretionary powers of the trial judge were considered, and R. v. Thomas
(1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 464 (Que. C.A.); R. v. Bryan (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d)
342 (B.C.C.A.) It is clear, in my view, that the power or duty of the trial
judge to intervene when a jury verdict is returned and to make inquiries
relating to the true nature of the verdict is one to be exercised prior to the
discharge of the jury and, applying the words of Macaulay C.J. in Ford, supra,
""before it is too late"". It will be too late when the jury is
discharged and the court created for the trial of the accused has been
dissolved.

 

6.                It was argued that there is English
authority to the contrary. The respondent cited R. v. Carter, [1964] 1
All E.R. 187, 48 Cr. App. R. 122. In that case, the two appellants were
indicted on a single count, robbery with an offensive weapon. Though the
prosecutor referred to an alternate verdict of robbery with aggravation, it was
not left to the jury. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty of the offence
charged, whereupon the trial judge discharged the prisoners. The foreman of the
jury then raised the question of included offences and gave a verdict of guilty
of robbery with aggravation. The trial judge entered a conviction despite the
discharge of the prisoners. It was held in the Court of Appeal that the
conviction should stand. The jury was entitled to render the verdict on the
included offence without any direction by the judge. They had therefore not
completed their verdict when the prisoners were discharged and, accordingly,
the discharge was a nullity and the conviction could be recorded. 

 

7.                This is not our case. In Carter,
though the trial judge had discharged the prisoners, he had not discharged the
jury, and upon this basis it could be said, in the words of Lord Parker C.J.,
at p. 188:

 

...a verdict is not
complete until a jury has dealt with all the possible verdicts on the
indictment, and, if a judge discharges a prisoner before the jury have
completed their verdict, in the view of this court that discharge is a complete
nullity.

 

It will be observed that in the Carter case the prisoners were
discharged in the course of the trial while the court constituted for the trial
remained in existence. It was therefore open to the court to correct the
erroneous discharge and accept a verdict of guilt on the lesser offence. It had
not at that point become, in the words of Macaulay C.J. in Ford, supra,
""too late"" because of the discharge of the jury.

 

8.                Some support for the course of action
followed in Carter may be found in two early English cases: R. v.
Parkin (1824), 1 Mood. C.C. 45, and R. v. Vodden (1853), Dears. 229,
169 E.R. 706. They are cited in support of the statement in Halsbury’s Laws
of England (4th), vol. 11, p. 187, para. 321:

 

321. Correction of
verdict. If a verdict is entered which is not in accordance with
the intention of the jurors, the mistake may be corrected and a verdict entered
in accordance with their intention, or they may retire and reconsider the
question and bring in another verdict.

 

It is to be observed, however, that in neither of the two cases does it
appear that the jury had been discharged before it gave its corrected verdict
and these cases merely support the proposition, stated above, that prior to the
discharge of the jury corrections may be made.

 

9.                As has been noted by Lamer J., a wider
discretion has been accorded to judges presiding over civil trials than that
accorded in criminal trials. He has referred to authoritative cases where
judges, even after a discharge of the jury, have recalled jurors for the
purpose of rectifying error or for the clarification of recorded verdicts. I am
unable, however, to find any authority binding on this court which has ever
extended such a power to trial judges in criminal cases and I am of the opinion
that no such extension of the judicial control over juries should be allowed in
criminal cases. There is sound reason for this difference of approach to civil
matters. The civil trial results from a dispute between private parties. The
Crown is not involved. The state takes no part in the resolution of the dispute‑‑beyond
creating the forum for its settlement‑‑and the public generally has
no interest. The parties come to court and, if a jury has been chosen as a part
of the process, each party has a vital interest in securing its verdict in
order to bring to an end the expense and the asperities of litigation. It is in
pursuance of this objective that trial judges have been accorded the wider
discretion which is justifiable, since its purpose and effect is to resolve a
private dispute that is not otherwise of interest to the general public. The
criminal case is different. Here, the state and the general public have vital
interests in the administration of justice. The accused, of course, has a vital
interest in the outcome of his case. Accordingly, sound policy requires a
strict approach to the criminal process which will serve to recognize and
protect both the interests of the state and the public, and the particular interest
of the accused.

 

10.              Turning to the case at bar, it must be
accepted that the charge to the jury was adequate, both as to the principal
offence and as to the included offences. When the jury returned its verdict,
the foreman gave a clear anc completely unambiguous verdict of acquittal and it
was acknowledged, in accordance with accepted practice, by each member of the
jury. The jury had been charged once on included offences and had returned to
the courtroom after commencing deliberation for further instruction. It was
then in these circumstances a reasonable conclusion on the part of the trial
judge that the jury had considered the included offences and that the jury's
verdict was intended to be a full acquittal, including the principal and any
included offences. Even in these circumstances, it might have been wiser for
the trial judge to inquire from the foreman whether they had any verdict or
verdicts respecting the included offences, but I cannot say that it was
reversible error on his part to do as he did and discharge both the prisoner
and the jury. 

 

11.              I am aware that in Longson, supra,
I said, at p. 425, that it was the duty of the trial judge to tell the jury
that:

 

...if they are not
satisfied upon the guilt of the accused on the specific offence they must then
consider the included offence or offences of which they have been informed and
render a verdict upon them.

 

In the case at bar, however, where it was evident that the jury had
considered the included offences, and although to convict on one or more of the
included offences verdicts to that effect would be required, the clear verdict
of not guilty on the principal offence would justify the trial judge in
accepting the verdict as a complete acquittal and it would have that effect.

 

12.              This view finds support in Bower, The
Doctrine of Res Judicata (2nd ed. 1969), where the learned author, in
referring to the significance of a general acquittal when the offence charged
included other offences, said, at p. 273:

 

And there are other cases
in which the jury is authorized by statute, or the Common Law, to acquit the
accused of the offence of which he is charged, and to convict him of some other
offence of less degree. In such cases, if the jury return a verdict of
acquittal, the judgment following the verdict, whereby the accused is acquitted
of the major offence, is deemed to carry with it a judgment of acquittal on the
minor offence also.

 

The same proposition was expressed by Lord Morris of Borth‑y‑Gest
in Connelly v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1964] A.C. 1254, at p.
1305, in these words:

 

In my view, both principle
and authority establish: (1) that a man cannot be tried for a crime in respect
of which he has previously been acquitted or convicted; (2) that a man cannot
be tried for a crime in respect of which he could on some previous indictment
have been convicted....

 

and later, at p. 1312, he quoted:

 

Thus, an acquittal upon an
indictment for murder may be pleaded in bar of another indictment for
manslaughter: and an acquittal upon an indictment for burglary and larceny may
be pleaded to an indictment for the larceny of the same goods; because, in either
of these cases, the prisoner might, on the former trial, have been convicted of
the offence charged against him in the second indictment.

 

I am aware that Lord Morris was in the minority in the Connelly
case, but his views on this particular question were not out of harmony with
the majority. The same principle has found statutory expression in s. 537(2)  of
the Criminal Code .

 

13.              Lord Morris, Bower (2nd ed.), and s. 537
(2)  of the Criminal Code  all deal with the special plea of autrefois
acquit and that plea is not in issue in the case at bar, but the references
are helpful in that they illustrate the finality of a general acquittal and
support the position of the appellant.

 

14.              It follows from what I have said that the
accused is entitled to his acquittal. As described above, he was discharged and
the jury was discharged. The court was then adjourned. Accordingly, the court
which had jurisdiction to try the accused had been dissolved. It was wholly functus.
When the question arose as to the verdict, the matter had passed beyond the
stage where any correction could be made. I would therefore allow the appeal
and restore the acquittal. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

15.              Lamer
J.‑‑The issues in this case are the following: Once
discharged, can a jury be reconvened to, 1. reconsider its verdict; or 2.
complete or correct the transmission and recording of a verdict it had arrived
at prior to discharge?

 

The Facts

 

16.              The facts that gave rise to this appeal
are straightforward. The appellant was accused of attempted murder and was
tried by judge and jury. In his charge to the jury, Hrabinsky J., of the Court
of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan, informed the jury that ""in addition to
the charge on the Indictment, ... there are lesser included offences of which
you may find the accused guilty or not guilty"". He indicated that if the
jury found the accused not guilty of attempted murder, they would have to decide
whether or not the accused was guilty of, 1. causing bodily harm by discharging
a firearm with intent to wound, maim or disfigure; 2. causing bodily harm by
discharging a firearm with intent to endanger the life of any other person; 3.
unlawfully causing bodily harm, or; 4. assault causing bodily harm.

 

17.              After its deliberations the jury returned
to the court room and indicated that it had reached a verdict. The foreman
announced that the jurors had found the accused not guilty. It is, I think,
helpful to reproduce the relevant parts of the record of the events that took
place in the court room.

 

COURT CLERK: Ladies and
Gentlemen of the Jury, have you agreed upon your verdict.

 

FOREMAN: Yes, we have.

 

COURT CLERK: How say you,
is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?

 

FOREMAN: The prisoner is
not guilty.

 

COURT CLERK: Harken to
your verdict as the Court records it, you find the prisoner not guilty.

 

FOREMAN: Yes.

 

COURT CLERK: And so say
you all?

 

JURORS: Yes.

 

THE COURT: Ladies and
Gentlemen of the Jury, I thank you for your careful attention given to this
case and the care that you took in reaching your decision...You are free to
leave, but you must return on Monday, October seventeenth at ten a.m. Thank
you again. If you wish to stay in the court room, you may, if you want to move
into the court room.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

18.              The trial judge then turned to the accused
and told him that he had been found not guilty and that he was discharged. The
clerk of the court then said: ""Court is adjourned until ten o'clock Monday
morning"". The following conversation then took place between the judge and
the foreman of the jury:

 

 

 

THE COURT: Oh, just a
moment, the jury foreman, did you wish to say something?

 

FOREMAN: Well, when we
discussed this we thought we could find the Defendant not guilty of the charge
as laid, but guilty of a lesser charge, is that right?

 

THE COURT: Well, I believe
I'm functus officio. That means that I have nothing further. That is why I
spelled out very clearly to you the various things that you were to find.
However, I'll hear submissions from counsel.

 

19.              Counsel were then invited to make
submissions regarding what had occurred. It was revealed during the oral
submissions that by the time the foreman had spoken to the judge, one of the
jurors had gone past the bar and was in the body of the court room.

 

20.              Hrabinsky J. then made the following
comments: 

 

THE COURT: Sheriff, would
you call the jury in, but have them sit in the body of the court room.

 

JURY RETURN.

 

THE COURT: Now, what has
transpired here today is most unusual indeed, and it is very disappointing
after a number of days of jury trial to end in this manner. However, I have
concluded that because I discharged the jury before the jury spoke up and said,
""Oh, oh, wait, we have something else to say"", and I tried to be
cautious to give the jury lots of time to do this, nothing was said even while
I was saying that I will discharge you until October seventeenth and so on. The
jury even went so far as to go, most of them, back into the jury room, when the
foreman made a motion and said something to me and then indicated that although
they had found the accused not guilty of attempted murder they had a lesser
offence to deal with. Unfortunately they did not bring this to the attention of
the Court when they were asked, ""How say you?"". Under the
circumstances, I am of the opinion that I am functus, that is, without
jurisdiction once having discharged the jury and the accused. The Crown may
have a remedy, and I emphasize may have a remedy, by way of an appeal which
might, if successful, entail a new trial so that justice will be done. But
under the circumstances, as I have already stated, I feel that I am functus and
disappointing as it may be, it is my opinion that that is the law and if there
is any consolation in a situation such as this, I suppose it can be said it is
better to err in favour of the accused if one is to err.

 

The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan

 

21.              The majority of the Court of Appeal held
that the trial judge erred in applying ""the doctrine of"" functus
officio to the facts of the case. According to Tallis J.A., with whom
Vancise J.A. concurred, the jury verdict was not complete as the jury had not
dealt ""with all possible verdicts open to them on the indictment"".
Since the trial judge had instructed the jury on the lesser and included
offences, the majority of the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that the jury
verdict was not complete until it was clear that all of the possible verdicts
had been dealt with and disposed of and held that in such a situation the trial
judge has an obligation to recall the jurors in order to take their complete
verdict. Tallis and Vancise JJ.A. set aside the acquittal and ordered a new
trial on all of the lesser and included offences.

 

22.              Hall J.A., in dissent, was of the opinion
that the record indicated that the accused was acquitted of the principal
charge and all of the included offences and to have him stand trial on any of
the included offences would place him in double jeopardy. He concluded his
brief reasons as follows:

 

                   In any
event, if a new trial should be ordered, in my opinion, it must be limited to
the least of the included offences.

 

                   Under
the circumstances, I would dismiss the Crown's appeal.

 

23.              The disagreement below appears to me to be
factual. Tallis and Vancise JJ.A. were of the view that the jury had not
completely transmitted its verdict to the court while Hall J.A. was of a
contrary view.

 

24.              They all agreed that until the jury had
given its full verdict the judge was not functus.

 

The Law

 

25.              It is generally accepted that a trial
judge sitting without a jury is not functus officio until he has finally
disposed of the case. Where the accused is acquitted the trial judge will have
exhausted his jurisdiction when the accused is discharged and the trial judge
cannot then reopen the case. Following a finding of guilt, however, the judge's
duties are not spent until after a sentence is imposed. The trial judge can, in
exceptional circumstances and before the imposition of the sentence, reopen the
case to permit the accused to tender further evidence. This principle, stated
over one hundred years ago in R. v. Clouter & Heath (1859), 8 Cox
C.C. 237, has recently been reaffirmed in Canada (see for example, R. v.
Lessard (1976), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 70 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Hargraves
(1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 380 (Ont. C.A.); Re Regina and Bertucci (1984),
11 C.C.C. (3d) 83 (Sask. C.A.); and R. v. Mysko (1980), 2 Sask. R. 342
(C.A.)) If the judge, sitting alone, were functus as regards the
determination of guilt as of the moment of that determination, he would have no
jurisdiction to reopen the case.

 

26.              In cases where the trial is before a court
composed of a judge and a jury the rule cannot be the same. The jury, as the
trier of fact, decides whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. Even though
the verdict is unanimous, if it is unclear, the trial judge may refuse to
register it and may require that the jury reconsider its verdict. Up until the
time it is discharged, the jury may correct an error in its verdict, even if
the accused has been discharged (see R. v. Vodden (1853), Dears. 229,
169 E.R. 706; R. v. Carter, [1964] 1 All E.R. 187, 48 Cr. App. R. 122).
But once the jury verdict has been recorded and the jury has been discharged,
the assessment of guilt is, subject of course to an appeal, final. The judge,
by then sitting alone, cannot reopen the case. All that remains, where the accused
has been found guilty, is for the judge to sentence the accused. 

 

27.              Once the verdict has been registered and
the jury has been discharged, the jury cannot be recalled and sent back to
reconsider its verdict but, I hasten to interject, there is a difference
between reconsidering a verdict and correcting an error made in its conveyance
to, or registration by, the court. In Fletcher v. Thomas, [1931] 3
D.L.R. 142, the jury had been discharged after their verdict but still remained
in the court room. A few jurors approached counsel for the plaintiff and stated
that they had misunderstood two of the questions that had been put to them and
that the verdict did not reflect their intentions. Logie J. of the Ontario
Supreme Court refused to reconvene the jury. He stated, at p. 146:

 

                   I would
go further than this and say that to allow a jury functus officio to re‑assemble
and alter or purport to explain a verdict already given by them would be a
scandal on the administration of justice and cannot be permitted at any time
after they have given their verdict and been discharged. If a higher Court
should see fit to order a new trial, that is quite a different matter, and I
conceive that such a course would be taken only on the clearest proof of a
grave miscarriage of justice.

 

28.              In Watson v. Fitzpatrick (1967), 65
D.L.R. (2d) 729, after the jury had been discharged, Ruttan J. of the British
Columbia Supreme Court was asked to consider a motion by the plaintiffs to set
aside the jury verdict and to direct a new trial. The sole reason for the
motion was that the damage award was ""inordinately low"". Ruttan J.
refused to grant the motion stating that ""The jury has been discharged and
cannot now be recalled to consider their decision"". The error, if there
was one, was in the deliberations of the jury and it was held that that cannot
be grounds for recalling the jury to reconsider its decision. (See also Ellis
v. Deheer, [1922] 2 K.B. 113 (C.A.); Knowlton v. Hydro‑ Electric
Power Com'n., [1926] 1 D.L.R. 217 (Ont.); Ainey v. Regem (1930), 48
B.R. 488 (Que. K.B.); Barkhouse v. Vanderploet (1976), 16 N.S.R. (2d)
445 (C.A.); Salerno v. White (1982), 28 C.P.C. 165 (Ont. H.C.))

 

29.              Although the jury cannot be allowed to
reconsider its verdict after it has been discharged, it may be allowed to rectify
errors that were made in the transmission or recording of its verdict
notwithstanding the discharge and, indeed, even if the jury members have
interacted with the public. If it has become apparent, after the discharge of
the jury, that the foreman erred or, as in this case, might have erred in
delivering the verdict, and that, as a result, the record may well not reflect
the decision arrived at in the jury room, the jury is allowed to correct the
error.  Wigmore on Evidence (McNaughton rev. 1961), vol. 8 explains at
paragraph 2355, that the reason for allowing the jury to correct the recording
of the verdict, after the jury has been discharged, is a practical one:

 

                   It has
occasionally been said that this correction must be claimed before the jury are
discharged, but this seems unsound because such errors are seldom ascertained
until after the jury have separated and conversed out of court, and if the
error is satisfactorily established, there can hardly be any fixed time to
limit its correction.

 

30.              At paragraph 2356, he emphasizes that the
statements of the jurors are inadmissible if being tendered for the purpose of
explaining or changing the substance of the verdict:

 

...after the verdict
has been pronounced by the jury and accepted by the judge and the jury has been
discharged, the verdict is final as regards its meaning and effect. Hence, no
statements by the jurors, either unanimously or individually, can be
resorted to for explaining or changing its meaning or legal effect.

 

31.              McCulloch v. Ottawa Transportation
Commission, [1954] 2 D.L.R. 443 (Ont. C.A.), illustrates this point. In
that case, which was an action for damages due to negligence arising from the
operation of motor vehicles, one of the tasks of the jury was to apportion
liability between the plaintiff and the defendant. The apportionment of the
degree of negligence was set forth by the jury as 80% to the plaintiff and 20%
to the defendant. The jury was then discharged. While the judge was discussing
the question of costs with counsel, a juryman, through a constable in
attendance in the court‑room, brought to the attention of the plaintiff's
counsel that there had been an error made in presenting the degrees of the
apportionment. The judge, despite being aware of the error, entered judgment in
accordance with the original findings. Citing Wigmore, Hope J.A., of the
Ontario Court of Appeal, allowed the appeal and corrected the judgment. In his
reasons for judgment, concurred in by both Hogg and F. G. MacKay JJ.A., he
stated, at p. 445:

 

                   I agree
thoroughly ... that no evidence can be received by way of affidavit or
otherwise after the delivery of the verdict to explain some error or mistake
which occurred during the deliberation of the members of the jury in the jury‑room
before arriving at a verdict. However, I think the cases are quite clear that
where a verdict has been reached by a jury, a unanimous verdict, as in this
case, and some clerical error has occurred either in recording that verdict in
the juryroom or by the jury in reporting it to Court, then affidavits may be
received, in the interest of justice, to disclose what the true verdict of the
jury was. 

 

32.              Similarly, in Dardarian v. Schneider
(1956), 3 D.L.R. (2d) 292 (Ont. H.C.), the jury's finding as to the percentage
degree of fault between the plaintiff and the defendant was reversed when it
was presented by the foreman to the court. The jury members were discharged,
left the jury box, and retired ""in a body as far as the outside of the
door leading from the court room"" where, in conferring amongst themselves,
they realized that an error had been made. Having spoken to no one except the
constable, and having taken only four minutes from the time of their discharge
to the time they returned to the jury box, they were allowed to correct the
error that was made in the transmission of the verdict.

 

33.              This Court has had occasion to address
this question but found, on the facts of the case before it, that the error was
not in the transmission of the verdict. In such a situation the affidavits of
the jurors could not be accepted. In Danis v. Saumure, [1956] S.C.R.
403, the appellant contended that the verdict arrived at by the jury was
perverse. The appellant also sought to file affidavits signed by nine members
of the jury purporting to show that the findings made by the jury were not the
findings intended to be made by them. This Court refused to admit the
affidavits and dismissed the appeal. Although he recognized that statements
made by jurors are admissible to show that the written answers do not
correspond to the actual decision arrived at by the jury, or to indicate that
there was an error in the transmission of the verdict, Kerwin C.J., with whom
Rand and Abbott JJ. concurred, was of the view that the affidavits that were
being submitted addressed the actual deliberations or intentions of the jurors.
Since a jury cannot be reconvened either to explain its verdict or to
reconsider the substance of its deliberations, the affidavits were not
receivable.

 

34.              Kellock and Locke JJ. also dismissed the
appeal. In their opinion, even assuming that they were entitled to look at the
affidavits, the affidavits did not suggest an error in the transmission of the
verdict. Since it was ""not a case of error arising between the verdict
which the jury had agreed upon and that which was actually rendered and formed
the basis for the judgment delivered"", the statements by the jurors were
inadmissible. See also McCready v. Scott (1967), 62 W.W.R. 563
(B.C.S.C.); R. v. Emkeit (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 309 (Alta. C.A.), aff'd
[1974] S.C.R. 133; Barkhouse v. Vanderploet, supra; Ralston
Purina (Canada) Ltd. v. Thompson View Fur Farms Ltd. (1984), 12 D.L.R.
(4th) 228 (P.E.I.C.A.)

 

35.              The state of the case law until now is as
follows. Even after discharge, a jury can be reconvened to correct an improper
or incomplete transmission or registration of a verdict, but cannot reconsider
a verdict or complete its deliberations with a view to handing down additional
verdicts on counts or on included offences it had not finally determined prior
to that discharge; nor can anyone go behind the verdict and make inquiries as
regards the nature of the deliberations.

 

36.              I should like to make a final observation
before disposing of this case. Given that the case law upon which I rely has
mainly developed in non‑criminal matters, I initially thought that the
rule governing criminal jury verdicts might preferably be different, and be as
follows: in criminal matters, as of the discharge of the jury, the judge and
jury would be functus even to correct an error in the transmission of
the verdict. The rationale for this rule could be to leave the error, subject
to appeal, to inure to the benefit of the accused. I had no difficulty with
this approach until I wondered what would happen if the error was the other
way, a verdict of guilty being erroneously entered against an accused who had,
in fact, been acquitted by the jury. Once functus the court could not
vary the registering of the verdict either way. This latter concern of mine is
not merely theoretical but has, since I wrote this judgment, been shown to be
justified by a recent decision of the Privy Council in Nanan v. The State,
[1986] 3 All E.R. 248, a case in which the accused's conviction for murder was
left undisturbed notwithstanding the fact that it was the result of the jury
foreman's not understanding the meaning of the word ""unanimous"" when
asked by the clerk of the court whether the verdict was unanimous. It is out of
concern for the really innocent that I have come to adopt the rule applicable
until now to civil matters. Its effect is to ensure that those found guilty by
the jury do not go free, which is not a bad result but, more important, that
those found innocent or not convicted by the jury not be convicted.

 

37.              Now to address the present appeal. I
should first say that I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge that the trial
judge was faced with a situation where the applicable law was very uncertain.
Therefore, anything I say as regards what he should have done is with the
obvious advantage of hindsight, and the retrospective effect of the law once
stated. Given the very clear instructions by the judge regarding the possible
subsidiary verdicts, the blanket statement of ""not guilty"" by the
foreman would normally have ended the matter had it not been for the doubt cast
on its accuracy by the foreman's remarks, where he said: ""when we
discussed this we thought we could find the Defendant not guilty of the charge
as laid, but guilty of a lesser offence, is that right?"" What had until
then been rightly considered a complete and clear verdict became uncertain. As
of the moment of that statement the trial judge should have inquired further
into this comment by the foreman. He should have had all the jury members
recalled to the jury box and, with all of them present, he should have
addressed the jury with a view to ascertaining the precise nature of the
problem. 

 

38.              There are various ways of doing this. As
an example, he could have first ascertained whether they had, prior to their
being discharged, arrived at a verdict and wanted to correct or complete the
transmission of the verdict at which they had arrived. If such was the case he
could then have instructed the clerk of the court to register that verdict. If,
through questioning, he had found out that they had not come to a final verdict
prior to their discharge, then the trial judge could not permit them to reopen
their deliberations; for once they had recorded a verdict and had been
discharged, their jurisdiction to make findings was spent. The problem could
then only be dealt with in the Court of Appeal.

 

39.              As the trial judge did not inquire further
into the statement by the foreman, we do not know whether the jury wished to
continue their deliberations or whether the foreman was merely indicating that
the recorded verdict was not the one arrived at in the jury room, and that the
accused had been found guilty of an included offence.

 

The Remedy

 

40.              Not knowing what the situation is exactly,
though one might suspect that the verdict was incomplete, is the remedy a new
trial as was ordered by the majority in the Court of Appeal? I do not think
that a new trial should be ordered. Hall J.A. appears to be uneasy when
ordering a new trial and touches upon the problem when he says that in any
event he would have ordered a new trial on the lesser of the included offences.
The problem is that we now do not know with certainty what the verdict is on
the included offences. If that verdict is actually an acquittal on all or even
any of the included offences, the accused should not be deprived thereof
because of error in the transmission or registration of the verdict, but only
if error of law was committed in the reaching of that verdict. So the ordering
of a new trial was not the preferable course to follow. The ordering of a new
trial is a remedy where the determination of guilt or innocence by the court of
first instance is vitiated by an error. Here the error was in not ascertaining
with certainty what the verdict was.

 

41.              The logical disposition of this appeal
would be to allow the appeal, quash the order of the Court of Appeal for a new
trial, and order that the matter be returned to the trial court so that the
jury's verdict be ascertained, either in the manner I suggested by reconvening
the jurors, or in any other way that generally meets the purpose of that
endeavour. But logic is not always practical and occasionally will operate unfairly.

 

42.              A considerable amount of time has elapsed
since that jury was discharged. When considering all of the circumstances of
the case, I think that the ends of justice will best be served by allowing this
appeal, quashing the order of the Court of Appeal and leaving the acquittal, as
registered, undisturbed.

 

43.              I should add one final observation.
Fortunately, situations such as this will surely be few in future. Indeed,
since the events of this case took place, many jurisdictions throughout Canada
have, I am told, adopted a procedure long followed by some. The question put to
the jury now specifies each and every possible verdict the Court requested the
jury to consider and is not general, as was the question in this case.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Obscenity ‑‑
Film ‑‑ Whether ""undue exploitation of sex” ‑‑
Community standards ‑‑ Criminal Code , s. 159(8) .

 

                   Evidence ‑‑ Evidence on charge of
obscenity ‑‑ Whether Crown must adduce evidence to establish
undueness.

 

                   Appellant, owner of an Edmonton theatre, was charged
with presenting an obscene motion picture contrary to s. 163  of the Criminal
Code . At trial, the defence adduced evidence indicating that the film had
been approved and classified by the Censor Board as a restricted adult movie
and that it had been previously shown in Alberta to a large audience with no
complaint being made to the Board. The evidence further showed that the film
had been similarly approved and classified by the other provincial censor
boards across the country. The trial judge found the film immoral, indecent and
obscene and convicted the appellant. The Court of Appeal upheld that decision.
This appeal is to determine whether the trial judge applied the proper test in
finding the appellant guilty of presenting an obscene entertainment.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Lamer and Le Dain JJ.: A film is obscene under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code  if it contains as a dominant characteristic the ""undue
exploitation of sex"". To determine ""undueness"" one of the tests
to be applied is whether the accepted standards of tolerance in the
contemporary Canadian community, taken as a whole, have been exceeded. In
applying the community standard of tolerance what matters is not what Canadians
think is right for themselves to see. What matters is what Canadians would not
abide other Canadians seeing because it would be beyond the contemporary
Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see it. Relevant to that
determination is, among other factors, the audience to which the film is
targeted since the community may tolerate different things for different groups
of people depending on the circumstances. 

 

                   The trier of fact must formulate an opinion of what
the contemporary Canadian community will tolerate in order to determine
""undueness"" by the community standards test. The community consensus
must be assessed and community level of tolerance objectively determined. While
evidence of the community standards of tolerance may well be useful in many
cases, it is not essential, for it is the opinion of the trier of fact about
the community standards of tolerance which is important. The judge does not
have to accept evidence, expert or otherwise, but he cannot reject it without
good reason. The trier of fact's personal views regarding the impugned film are
irrelevant.

 

                   In the case at bar, the trial judge applied his own
subjective standards of taste and not the community standards of tolerance. He
did not direct his mind to the question whether most people would tolerate
others seeing the film in question and he failed to consider the fact that the
film was restricted to adults only and that only those who chose to see it
would be exposed to it. Further, it was incumbent upon him to consider and
assess the weight, if any, to be given to the evidence adduced by the defence
indicative of community standards of tolerance. He should not have rejected it
without explanation.

 

                   Per Beetz, Estey and
McIntyre JJ.: The standard to determine ""undueness"" is that of
tolerance. What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to
see but what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because it would
be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see
it. The audience to which the film is exposed, however, is not relevant in the
determination of whether or not it is obscene.

 

                   Per Beetz and Estey
JJ.: The Crown is not required to adduce expert evidence as to community
standards of tolerance. 

 

                   Per McIntyre J.: In
formulating the community standard of tolerance some evidence must be adduced
by the Crown before the trier of fact.

 

                   Per Wilson J.: Under
s. 159(8) of the Criminal Code , a film is deemed to be obscene if
a dominant characteristic of the film is the ""undue exploitation of
sex"". ""Undue"" refers to the treatment of sex which in some
fundamental way dehumanizes the persons portrayed and, as a consequence, the
viewers themselves. The question whether there was ""undueness"" must
be determined according to the objective standard of the contemporary Canadian
community. What must be ascertained is the degree of exploitation of sex
Canadians at any given time will accept in their films. It is therefore not
open to the courts under s. 159(8)  to characterize a movie as obscene if shown
to one constituency but not if shown to another. A movie is either obscene
based on a national community standard of tolerance or it is not.

 

                   There is an onus on the Crown to put evidence before
the court on the issue of ""undueness"". The community standard against
which the allegedly obscene matter must be measured cannot be identified
without it. Indeed, it is naive to think that a judge, drawing on his own
experience alone, can determine the objective standard against which impugned
conduct is to be measured. Moreover, it is wrong in principle. It leaves the
accused with no way of knowing the case to be met, or the level of
acceptability imposed by any particular judge.

 

                   In the case at bar, there is no indication that the
trial judge took into consideration the uncontested evidence adduced by the
defence of the unanimous approval of the film by the censor boards. He did not
address his mind to the issue of the significance of the approvals as evidence
of the community standard of acceptance. Considering that the business of these
boards is to assess films on an ongoing basis for the very purpose of
determining their acceptability for viewing by the community, it is difficult
to think that a judge would be better informed as to what was acceptable to
Canadians across the country. The trial judge, applying an objective test and
giving proper consideration to that evidence, could not have reached the result
he did. The judge clearly saw his role, not as applying the community standard
but as raising it if he personally thought it was too low. In this respect he
erred.

1.                The
Chief Justice‑‑The question is whether the trial judge
applied the proper test in finding Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd. guilty of
presenting an obscene entertainment. The indictment reads:

 

That The Towne Cinema
Theatres Ltd., at Edmonton, in the Judicial District of Edmonton, Alberta, on
or about the 27th day of January, A.D. 1980, being the person in charge of a
theatre, namely: Jasper Cinema (Blue) at 10120 ‑ 156 Street,
did unlawfully present to an audience an entertainment, namely: a motion
picture entitled ""Dracula Sucks"" which entertainment was immoral,
indecent or obscene, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

I The Facts and the Trial Judgment

 

2.                In January, 1980, the accused company
was owner and manager of a theatre, known as Jasper Cinema (Blue), located in
the City of Edmonton. The cinema was a typical picture theatre showing motion
picture films to members of the public who paid an admission fee. On January 25
to 27, 1980 the accused was regularly presenting showings of a motion picture
called Dracula Sucks. The film had been given a ""Restricted""
rating by the Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. A copy of the motion picture
was seized by the Edmonton City Police on January 27, 1980, after the public
showing on that date and before the scheduled second public showing. The
accused was charged and tried before a justice of the Court of Queen's Bench of
Alberta. Three witnesses testified.

 

3.                Staff Sergeant Ashworth of the Edmonton
City Police said he had attended and observed the film and it was he who had
taken possession of the film. The Court then adjourned to the Censor Board film
theatre where the trial judge viewed the film. At the resumption of the trial,
Ashworth testified that on January 21, 1980, the film had been showing at the
Capitol Square Cinema, before being transferred to the Jasper Cinema. While at
the former theatre Ashworth had received about five phone calls from persons
complaining about the film. In cross‑examination he was asked:

 

                   Did you
find the movie very offensive to yourself?

 

He replied: 

 

                   Yeah, I
thought it was disgusting. That's only my personal...

 

The film itself and the evidence of Staff Sergeant Ashworth constituted
the case for the Crown.

 

4.                The defence called two witnesses. The
first was Terrance Yushchyshyn, Director of Operations for the theatres
operated by the accused company in the five westerly provinces. His evidence in
summary was as follows. Prior to being booked into his theatre in Edmonton, the
film, the subject of the present charge, had been shown at two Famous Players'
Theatres, one in Edmonton, where it had been seen by 4065 persons and one in
Calgary, where it had been seen by 4075 persons. The film was then moved to the
Jasper Cinema where it was seen, before seizure, by 555 people, without
complaints. In Mr. Yushchyshyn's opinion the impugned film was ""very passé"",
""boring and dull"". Other films such as Last Tango in Paris,
had far greater emphasis on sexual gratification.

 

5.                Owen Garland Hooper is Chairman of the
Alberta Motion Picture Censor Board. The Board views every film seen in
Alberta. The Board allowed Dracula Sucks to be shown in the province as
a restricted adult movie, no one under the age of eighteen being admitted. The
film was approved in the restricted adult category or equivalent by all of the
provincial censor boards or classification boards across Canada. Mr. Hooper
said that his Board had not made any deletions to the film. Most movies are
""pretty extensively cut when we get them"". This one had been edited
in Toronto. The Board arrives at appropriate classification for a movie
consistent with the Board's interpretation of current community standards of
acceptance. Compared to other movies he had seen, Mr. Hooper described Dracula
Sucks as ""pretty forgettable"". The Board had received no
complaints regarding this particular film. During the preceding year, the Board
viewed 750 films and rejected twelve, because it was felt that adult Albertans
would generally repudiate them. The basis for the Board's assessment of
community standards has shifted during the preceding ten years: now, ""it's
contemporary, it's modern, it must be Canadian"". Mr. Hooper succinctly
described Dracula Sucks: ""Well, it has nudity in it, it has
violence in it, it has simulated sex encounters in it."" 

 

6.                The trial judge found the film to be
immoral, indecent and obscene. It possessed ""absolutely no artistic merit
whatsoever""; ""most of the film was devoted to extreme, tasteless
violence and explicit, unnecessary sex"".

 

7.                The accused company was convicted and fined
$1500.

 

II On Appeal

 

8.                In a brief judgment, the Court of Appeal
of Alberta dismissed the appeal. The Court noted it was not its function to
judge the merits of the film, and it had not found it necessary to see the
film; its sole function was to review the propriety of the trial. The judgment
continued:

 

                   We have
reviewed the reasons for judgment given in support of this conviction. Those
reasons are blunt and impactive. The trial judge, sitting as a jury, was
obliged to determine in an objective way what was tolerable in accordance with
the contemporary standards of the Canadian community. As a trier of fact he was
entitled to draw on his experience in the community. He had to consider the
expert evidence but was entitled to reject it and obviously did. In this we are
paraphrasing the remarks of Howland, C.J.O., in Regina v. Sudbury News
Service 1978 39 C.C.C. (2d) 1 at p. 7.

 

The judgment concluded thus:

 

                   The
reasons of the trial judge challenged in this appeal must be considered in the
context of his whole judgment and the argument which immediately preceded it.
The trial judge found that the only theme of the film ""Dracula
Sucks"", was sex and violence, extreme and explicit. He found no plot. He
asked himself what are contemporary community standards and considered all the
evidence led. He cautioned himself on the dangers of slipping into subjective
standards and concluded that the film did not meet the objective test. We see
no grounds, in law, to disturb this conviction and dismiss the appeal.

 

III Issues

 

9.                In his factum, counsel for Towne Cinema
raised five grounds of appeal. At the hearing oral argument was presented on
only two of these grounds, both alleging errors in the trial judge's
determination of the community standard of tolerance.

 

10.              In view of the importance of the issues
raised in this appeal, the Court felt that it would be proper to request a re‑hearing
before a full bench.

 

11.              The Court requested counsel to address the
following four questions:

 

1. Assuming that for
purposes of s. 159, undue exploitation of sex is to be assessed on the basis of
community standards, do these standards refer to what one would find acceptable
for oneself to see or read, or to what one would tolerate others seeing or
reading?

 

2. How is this standard to
be ascertained by the trier of fact?

 

3. How is an impugned film
to be measured against it? 

 

4. What is the relevance,
if any, of the audience to which a film is geared in determining whether it is
obscene under s. 159(8)?

 

12.              In my view the following issues arise from
the two grounds argued on the appeal and the four questions addressed at the re‑hearing:

 

1.                What is the proper interpretation of the word
""undue"" in s. 159(8)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

2.                Must the Crown adduce evidence to establish
undueness?

 

IV Undueness and the Community Standards Test

 

13.              In 1959 Parliament amended the provisions
of s. 150 (now s. 159) of the Criminal Code  dealing with obscenity by
adding subs. (8) (1959 (Can.), c. 41, s. 11) which reads:

 

                   (8) For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is
the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following
subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene.

 

14.              Any doubt that might previously have
existed on the question of whether s. 159(8)  embodied the proper or the
exclusive test for obscenity in relation to a film was implicitly resolved by
this Court in Dechow v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 951. A number of decisions
in various jurisdictions had previously concluded that films were
""publications"" and therefore properly dealt with under s. 159(8)  (see
R. v. Fraser, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 110 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Goldberg and
Reitman, [1971] 3 O.R. 323 (C.A.); and Daylight Theatre Co. v. The Queen
(1973), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 451 (Sask. Dist. Ct.))

 

15.              Dechow dealt with an allegation of
obscenity with regard to an exhibition of sex stimulators. Using language and
reasoning easily extendible to motion pictures, Ritchie J., writing for the
majority, held that the objects in question, accompanied as they were by
printed instructions for their use, were ""publications"" within the
meaning of that term in s. 159. They were therefore to be judged by the
standard laid down in s. 159(8) , which was the sole test of obscenity in
relation to publications. Chief Justice Laskin, speaking for a minority of the
Court, preferred the view that the articles in question were not publications.
He was, however, of the opinion that the Court should apply exclusively the
test in s. 159(8)  in respect of allegations of obscenity whether such
allegations are made under s. 159 (which deals with publications) or one of the
other sections of the Code, such as s. 163  (under which the charge
against Towne Cinema was laid) or s. 164. 

 

16.              The practical effect of the two judgments,
though they differ widely in approach, is, for present purposes, the same: s.
159(8)  embodies the sole test of obscenity in relation to motion pictures. It
supersedes rather than supplements the much‑criticized test enunciated by
Cockburn C.J. in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360.

 

17.              In Canada, the notion of ""community
standards"", as relevant to the determination of obscenity, has its origins
in the judgment of Judson J. (speaking also for Abbott and Martland JJ.) in Brodie
v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681, the Lady Chatterley’s Lover case. Brodie
was the first obscenity appeal to come before this Court following the
introduction of s. 159(8)  and Judson J.'s explication of this section reveals a
very clear awareness of the criticism that had been leveled against the Hicklin
test and an intention to avoid its pitfalls in the future. In Hicklin
Cockburn C.J. had said:

 

...I think the test of
obscenity is this, whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is
to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences,
and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall.

 

18.              This definition had been criticized for
its focus on the reactions of the weakest and least capable members of society,
for its disregard of serious purpose or artistic merit in the impugned material
and for its excessive dependence on subjective conjecture on the part of the
trier of fact. In Brodie, Judson J. expressed the view that by the
enactment of s. 159(8)  ""all the jurisprudence under the Hicklin
definition is rendered obsolete"" (p. 701) and that the new definition gave
the Court ""an opportunity to apply tests which have some certainty of
meaning and are capable of objective application, which do not so much depend
as before upon the idiosyncrasies and sensitivities of the tribunal of fact,
whether judge or jury"" (p. 702). Henceforth, the standard for obscenity
would be an ""undue exploitation of sex"" and Judson J. proposed two
tests which he regarded as capable of objective application to determine such
""undueness"".

 

19.              The first test focussed on the
""internal necessities"" of the work in question. In the American case
of United States v. Kennerley, 209 F. 119 (1913), Judge Learned Hand had
reluctantly felt bound to apply the Hicklin test, but said, at pp. 120‑21:
""I question whether in the end men will regard that as obscene which is
honestly relevant to the adequate expression of innocent ideas."" In Brodie,
at pp. 704‑05, Judson J. applied this principle to the newly‑enacted
statutory definition: 

 

...I do not think that
there is undue exploitation if there is no more emphasis on the theme than is
required in the serious treatment of the theme of a novel with honesty and
uprightness.... The section recognizes that the serious‑minded author
must have freedom in the production of a work of genuine artistic and literary
merit and the quality of the work, as the witnesses point out and common sense
indicates, must have real relevance in determining not only a dominant
characteristic but also whether there is undue exploitation.

 

20.              Judson J.'s second test for
""undueness"" looked to the standards of the community. The concept of
""community standards"" had previously been applied by courts in
Australia and New Zealand as a measure of whether a work exhibited an
""undue emphasis"" on sex. Judson J. regarded this reading of undue as
meaning ""what the community regards as excessive"" to be preferable to
what he saw as the only alternative (at p. 706):

 

Surely the choice of
courses is clear‑cut. Either the judge instructs himself or the jury that
undueness is to be measured by his or their personal opinion‑‑and
even that must be subject to some influence from contemporary standards‑‑or
the instruction must be that the tribunal of fact should consciously attempt to
apply these standards. Of the two, I think that the second is the better
choice.

 

21.              Judson J. made no attempt to harmonize or
integrate his two tests. He simply concluded that whether the question was
approached on the basis of the internal necessities of the novel itself or on
the basis of an offence against community standards, undue exploitation of sex
was not a dominant characteristic of Lady Chatterley’s Lover.

 

22.              In the present case, no argument was
addressed to the ""artistic merit"" or ""serious purpose"" of Dracula
Sucks‑‑nor, I should think, could such an argument plausibly be
made. This Court is not, therefore, called upon to expound the relationship
between Judson J.'s two tests. We need only consider the issue of obscenity
from the point of view of community standards.

 

23.              Nevertheless, as will presently appear, it
is important to remember that from the very beginning of this Court's
consideration of s. 159(8)  ""community standards"" have been viewed as one
measure of ""undueness"" in the exploitation of sex. They have never
been seen as the only measure of such undueness; still less has a breach
of community standards been treated as in itself a criminal offence. 

 

24.              There are other ways in which exploitation
of sex might be ""undue"". Ours is not a perfect society and it is
unfortunate but true that the community may tolerate publications that cause
harm to members of society and therefore to society as a whole. Even if, at
certain times, there is a coincidence between what is not tolerated and what is
harmful to society, there is no necessary connection between these two
concepts. Thus, a legal definition of ""undue"" must also encompass
publications harmful to members of society and, therefore, to society as a
whole.

 

25.              Sex related publications which portray
persons in a degrading manner as objects of violence, cruelty or other forms of
dehumanizing treatment, may be ""undue"" for the purpose of s. 159(8) .
No one should be subject to the degradation and humiliation inherent in publications
which link sex with violence, cruelty, and other forms of dehumanizing
treatment. It is not likely that at a given moment in a society's history, such
publications will be tolerated. See R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (1983), 36
C.R. (3d) 154 (Ont. Co. Ct.) at p. 173; R. v. Wagner, Alta. Q.B.,
January 16, 1985 (unreported); R. v. Chin, Ont. Prov. Ct., February 22,
1983 (unreported, but summarized at 9 W.C.B. 249).

 

26.              However, as I have noted above, there is
no necessary coincidence between the undueness of publications which
degrade people by linking violence, cruelty or other forms of dehumanizing
treatment with sex, and the community standard of tolerance. Even if certain
sex related materials were found to be within the standard of tolerance of the
community, it would still be necessary to ensure that they were not
""undue"" in some other sense, for example in the sense that they
portray persons in a degrading manner as objects of violence, cruelty, or other
forms of dehumanizing treatment.

 

27.              In the present case, however, only the
community standard of tolerance is directly in issue. The rest of this decision
will be concerned with the community standard of tolerance. 

 

28.              Two years after the Brodie case
this Court, in Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd. v. The Queen,
[1964] S.C.R. 251, adopted in toto the dissenting reasons delivered in
the Court of Appeal of Manitoba by Freedman J.A., [1963] 2 C.C.C. 103. In that
case, as in this, the allegedly obscene material had no discernible serious
purpose or artistic merit. Freedman J.A.'s discussion of whether or not it
unduly exploited sex was therefore focussed on its relationship to community
standards. Applying Judson J.'s observation in Brodie about the need to
test undueness by objective criteria, Freedman J.A. elaborated on several
requisite characteristics of the community standards to be applied. He held
that the standards must be Canadian standards, not those prevailing
elsewhere, and that they must be contemporary standards reflecting the
current level of candour with regard to sexual matters not the level of the
past. On the question of which contemporary Canadians are to be the touchstone
of ""community standards"" Freedman J.A. said at p. 116:

 

Those standards are not
set by those of lowest taste or interest. Nor are they set exclusively by those
of rigid, austere, conservative, or puritan taste and habit of mind. Something
approaching a general average of community thinking and feeling has to be discovered.
Obviously this is no easy task, for we are seeking a quantity that is elusive.
Yet the effort must be made if we are to have a fair objective standard in
relation to which a publication can be tested as to whether it is obscene or
not. The alternative would mean a subjective approach, with the result
dependent upon and varying with the personal tastes and predilections of the
particular Judge who happens to be trying the case.

 

29.              In 1974, in R. v. Odeon Morton Theatres
Ltd. (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 185, Freedman C.J.M. had much the same to say
with regard to the appropriate community standard to apply in determining
whether the film Last Tango in Paris was obscene at p. 188:

 

The learned trial Judge
made it abundantly clear that his obligation was to consider the film not
according to his own subjective views but according to the objective test
furnished by contemporary community standards in Canada. Indeed he expressly
stated in his reasons for judgment that his personal views were adverse to the
acceptability of the film but that he was setting aside those views. That of
course was the correct and judicial thing to do.

 

30.              I said earlier that the undue exploitation
of sex is the touchstone of obscenity under s. 159(8) , and that a breach of
community standards is simply one measure of such undueness. It is harm to
society from undue exploitation that is aimed at by the section, not simply
lapses in propriety or good taste. In R. v. Prairie Schooner News Ltd. and
Powers (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 251 (Man. C.A.), Monnin J.A. and I considered
this point at p. 269: 

 

The Court was urged to
define ""community standards"" as community standards of acceptance, i.e.,
tolerance. I would accept this definition. In the Brodie case Judson J.,
referred, p. 181, to ""standards of acceptance prevailing in the
community"". In the Great West News case, we referred to
contemporary standards of tolerance. I have no doubt, as Dr. Rich testified,
and as the Judge agreed, a distinction can be made between private taste and
standard of tolerance. It can hardly be questioned that many people would find
personally offensive, material which they would permit others to read.
Parliament, through its legislation on obscenity, could hardly have wished to
proscribe as criminal that which was acceptable or tolerable according to
current standards of the Canadian community.

 

31.              A similar point was made by Weatherston
J.A., delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.
Penthouse International Ltd. (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 111 (leave to appeal
refused, [1979] 1 S.C.R. xi) at pp. 114‑15:

 

It is neither helpful nor
accurate to say that the standard of tolerance is synonymous with the moral
standards of the community...the words ""moral standards of the
community"" mean no more than a consensus of what is right and what is
wrong.... The question, in any event, is not whether the content of the
publication goes beyond what the contemporary Canadian community thinks is
right, but rather whether it goes beyond what the contemporary Canadian
community is prepared to tolerate.

 

32.              R. v. Sudbury News Service Ltd.
(1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), was concerned with the distribution to
certain confectionary stores of magazines alleged to be obscene, including Penthouse
and Oui. Howland C.J.O., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal,
reviewed the relevant authorities and then, in a number of propositions
distilled from those authorities expressed, in my view admirably, the present
state of Canadian law as applied to the question presently before the Court.

 

33.              I have taken the liberty of extracting the
following propositions from various places in the judgment: (i) in determining
what is undue exploitation within s. 159(8), one of the tests to be applied is
whether the accepted standards of tolerance in the contemporary Canadian community
have been exceeded; (ii) the standards must be contemporary as times change and
ideas change with them, one manifestation being the relative freedom with which
the whole question of sex is discussed; (iii) it is the standards of the
community as a whole which must be considered and not the standards of a small
segment of that community such as the university community where a film was
shown; (iv) the decision whether the publication is tolerable according to
Canadian community standards rests with the court; (v) the task is to determine
in an objective way what is tolerable in accordance with the contemporary
standards of the Canadian community, and not merely to project one's own
personal ideas of what is tolerable. 

 

34.              The cases all emphasize that it is a
standard of tolerance, not taste, that is relevant. What matters is not
what Canadians think is right for themselves to see. What matters is what
Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because it would be beyond the
contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow them to see it.

 

35.              Since the standard is tolerance, I think
the audience to which the allegedly obscene material is targeted must be
relevant. The operative standards are those of the Canadian community as a
whole, but since what matters is what other people may see, it is quite
conceivable that the Canadian community would tolerate varying degrees of
explicitness depending upon the audience and the circumstances. I would adopt
the following passage of Howland C.J.O. in Sudbury News Service Ltd. (supra)
at p. 8:

 

                   The
next question which arises is the extent to which the manner and circumstances
of distribution are relevant in determining whether or not a publication is
obscene. There are some publications which are so blatantly indecent that they
would not be tolerable by the Canadian community under any circumstances. Some
pictures are offensive to the majority of people to the point that the Canadian
community would not tolerate them on a billboard, or on the cover of a
magazine, or on a television screen where persons of all ages and sensibilities
would be exposed to them, but would be prepared to tolerate them being viewed
by persons who wished to view them. Some pictures would not be acceptable by
Canadian community standards in a children's bedtime story‑book or primer
but would be in a magazine for general distribution. The Canadian community
might be prepared to tolerate the exhibition of a motion picture to an adult
audience, but would consider the exhibition of the same motion picture to a
general audience, which included children, to be an undue exploitation of sex.
Similarly, the general distribution of certain magazines to a neighbourhood
store accessible to all ages would not be tolerable, whereas the distribution
of such magazines to ""adult"" bookstores to which children under a
certain age were not admitted might not be objectionable. The packaging and
pricing of a publication may also be relevant in considering whether Canadian
community standards have been exceeded. The distribution of magazines in plastic
covers marked ""adult"" in some respects might act as an attraction
rather than a deterrent unless the price was high enough to place it beyond the
reach of most children.

 

In endorsing this view I am modifying the position I had adopted in the
Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Great West News Ltd., [1970] 4 C.C.C.
307, at p. 317 (leave to appeal denied, [1970] S.C.R. ix). 

 

36.              With that review of the cases, I turn now
to the trial judgment in the present case. The appellant submits that the trial
judge misdirected himself in holding that his assessment of the local
community's feeling of ""revulsion"" was determinative of the Canadian
community standard of tolerance, and in thereby employing a subjective and
regional rather than objective and national test. According to the appellant
the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the film would not be
tolerated by the Canadian community in the sense that those who do not wish to
view it will not accept or tolerate the fact that others do and will see it.

 

37.              In delivering judgment the trial judge
said:

 

                   I do
not have the benefit of a jury. In making the remarks I have made, I do not
feel that I am imposing my own standards completely, although how can one help
but be subjective in a case like this. None of us live on an island, we all
live in a world which, as evidence has suggested today, is becoming more
tolerant of explicit sex in films and more tolerant of violence. Somebody has
got to draw the line and I don't know how far community standards are prepared
to be stretched before somebody does draw the line on the type of garbage that
I saw this morning.

 

                   I am
satisfied that this film is a long way from meeting the contemporary community
standards. It may satisfy a certain element of a community, it may gratify
them, but I am prepared to say that the majority of the community would feel
the same revulsion for this show that I felt when I left there this morning.

 

                   When I
say the dominant theme of this film was sex and violence, I am not being
entirely correct, it is the only theme. There is no plot, there is no story
whatsoever, unless it is hidden in such a way that I couldn't find it. I was
making notes at the time the show was on, but I was able to watch it in its
entirety.

 

38.              In the present case I think, with respect,
that the trial judge applied a standard of taste, not tolerance, as reflected
in these words:

 

...I am prepared to say
that the majority of the community would feel the same revulsion for this show
that I felt when I left there this morning.

 

In my view this statement can only be interpreted as saying that most
people would be personally offended. The judge did not direct his mind to the
question whether most people would tolerate others seeing the film in question.
In that I think he erred.

 

39.              It should also be noted that the trial
judge gave no consideration to the fact that Dracula Sucks was
restricted to adults only, and that only those who chose to see it would be
exposed to it. As I have said, these factors are important considerations in
applying a test of tolerance. 

 

40.              The appellant argues, as I have indicated,
that the trial judge applied a subjective and local standard rather than a
national objective test. In Brodie, Judson J. makes it clear that the
trier of fact is not supposed simply to apply his own subjective standard but
rather to assess the community standard. The statement of the trial judge,
""I do not feel that I am imposing my own standards completely"" seems
to imply that he is imposing his own standards primarily and lends support to
the submission of the appellant that the test applied was subjective and not
objective. In particular, the sentence reading: ""Somebody has got to draw
the line and I don't know how far community standards are prepared to be
stretched before somebody does draw the line on the type of garbage that I saw
this morning"" suggests that the judge is imposing his own standard‑‑somebody
has to draw the line and he is going to be the one to do it.

 

41.              Reading his comments as a whole, I can
reach no conclusion other than the trial judge applied his own subjective
standards of taste and not community standards of tolerance.

 

V The Evidentiary Issue

 

42.              The appellant's second ground is that the
judge failed to have regard to the unrebutted evidence of the Chairman of the
Censor Board that the film did not fall below contemporary community standards.
Counsel for the appellant does not contend that censor board approval is a bar
to a criminal prosecution. He readily concedes that it is for the courts to
decide whether a publication is obscene (Daylight Theatre Co. v. The Queen
(supra); R. v. McFall (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 181 (B.C.C.A.)

 

43.              Counsel does, however, take the point that
in light of the evidence, not disputed, of the approval of the allegedly
obscene film by all of the censor boards or classification boards across the
country there was an additional onus on the Crown to adduce evidence to
establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the film went beyond what the
contemporary Canadian community is prepared to tolerate. In support of this
argument counsel cited several passages on the subject of expert evidence from
the dissenting judgment of Laskin J.A., as he then was, in R. v. Cameron
(1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 486 (Ont. C.A.) and urged us to accept them as correct
statements of the evidentiary requirements in obscenity cases. 

 

44.              The issue of who must place evidence of what
before the trier of fact in obscenity cases is a vexing and recurring problem.
Under the Hicklin rule expert evidence was in general held to be
irrelevant. As Laidlaw J.A. explained in R. v. American News Co. (1957),
118 C.C.C. 152 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 157, since, under the Hicklin test, the
gravamen of the offence was a tendency to deprave or corrupt, evidence
as to artistic merit‑‑no matter how reliable‑‑was held
to be irrelevant to the issue of obscenity. And as for evidence tending to show
that the material in question had no tendency to deprave or corrupt, Laidlaw
J.A.'s discussion, at p. 161, illustrates that the prevailing rules of evidence
held such testimony to be inadmissible opinion evidence going to the very
question to be determined by the trier of fact.

 

45.              With the inception of the new statutory
definition in s. 159(8)  this rigid inflexibility was considerably relaxed. In Brodie
(supra), at p. 703, Judson J. made it clear that expert evidence as to
the seriousness of the artist's purpose and the artistic merit of the material
in question was certainly admissible, and, in his view, very helpful:

 

I can read and understand,
but at the same time I recognize that my training and experience have been, not
in literature but in law and I readily acknowledge that the evidence of the
witnesses who gave evidence in this case is of real assistance to me in
reaching a conclusion.

 

46.              In the Prairie Schooner case one
issue was the admissibility of expert evidence (in the form of public opinion
polls) on the question of the actual state of contemporary community standards.
At page 266 of the report of that case there appears the following passage in
the judgment of Monnin J.A. and myself:

 

...it would seem to me
that when it becomes necessary to determine the true nature of community
opinion and to find a single normative standard, the Court should not be denied
the benefit of evidence, scientifically obtained in accordance with accepted
sampling procedure, by those who are expert in the field of opinion research.
Such evidence can properly be accorded the status of expert testimony.
The state of mind or attitude of a community is as much a fact as the state of
one's health: it would seem therefore as proper to admit the opinion of experts
on the one subject as on the other.

 

(Emphasis added.) 

 

47.              To hold expert evidence admissible
with regard to the factual underpinnings of the community standard test for
""undueness"" is, of course, not the same as holding such evidence to
be mandatory. In R. v. Great West News Ltd. (supra), the
appellants attempted to impose precisely that obligation on the Crown. It was
argued that the Crown must fail because no evidence had been put before the
court from which the court could objectively determine prevailing community
standards. Counsel submitted that the court must determine from evidence placed
before it by the Crown: (i) what is the community standard, that is to say,
what is the standard of tolerance of Canadians as a whole to material of the
nature of that impugned? (ii) does the material impugned so far transcend that
standard as to be branded as criminal? After a review of the cases, and
speaking also for Smith C.J.M., I had occasion to say, at pp. 314‑15:

 

                   The
authorities would seem to ascribe to the Judge a much more important role in
the assessment of contemporary community standards than counsel for the
appellants would accord him. I do not find in Brodie or elsewhere in the
Commonwealth, any majority opinion that expert evidence of community standards
is an essential ingredient to a finding of guilt. If any inference can be drawn
from Brodie it is that the Judge must, in the final analysis, endeavour
to apply what he, in the light of his experience, regards as contemporary
standards of the Canadian community. In so doing he must be at pains to avoid
having his decision simply reflect or project his own notions of what is
tolerable.

 

48.              I am unaware of any majority opinion,
since the Great West News Ltd. judgment, in Canada or elsewhere in the
Commonwealth, which has made expert evidence of community standards mandatory.
To impose on the Crown a positive requirement to adduce expert evidence as to
community standards would be unrealistic. Expert evidence is always expensive,
sometimes simply not available and frequently unreliable. The American
experience‑‑based, to be sure on a somewhat different test for
obscenity‑‑has been summarized in Paris Adult Theatre I v.
Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 (1973) at p. 56, Note 6. Obscenity, it is said,
""is not a subject that lends itself to the traditional use of expert
testimony...indeed the `expert witness' practices employed in these cases have
often made a mockery out of the otherwise sound concept of expert
testimony"". United States v. Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise,
709 F.2d 132 (2d Cir. 1983) at p. 135, a recently reported American obscenity
decision, confirms that although the government bears the burden of proving
each element of obscenity (including a breach of community standards) to the
satisfaction of the trier of fact, expert evidence of community standards is
not constitutionally required, and that absent (or even in the face of) such
evidence, the impugned materials may ""speak for themselves"" so as to
ground a conviction for obscenity. 

 

49.              This is essentially the situation that
obtains in Canada. In R. v. Cameron (supra), in the judgment
cited by the appellant, Laskin J.A. distills from the case law five
propositions regarding the law of obscenity. The fifth, at p. 513, is:

 

Expert evidence is
admissible on the issue of ""undueness"" but it must be weighed by the
Court even when it is all one way and stands uncontradicted.

 

50.              With respect, I agree that this is an
accurate statement of the law. If later passages in Laskin J.A.'s dissent do in
fact retreat from this position, so as to suggest that expert evidence, whether
in chief or in rebuttal, is a legal prerequisite for a finding of obscenity,
then with great respect I cannot agree. I consider as accurate the following
statement of evidentiary requirements enunciated in the recent decision of
Borins J. in R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (supra), at pp. 171‑72:

 

It is well established
that if the material itself is introduced into evidence, expert evidence as to
obscenity or community standards is not required. Indeed, even if it is
presented, the trier of fact is not bound to accept it. There is no necessity
for the judge or jury to rely on evidence introduced in court as the basis for
identifying community standards. Therefore, the trier of fact may determine for
himself or herself (or themselves, in cases tried by a jury) the content of the
community standard which is to be applied in determining whether the material
in issue exceeds that standard. It is an objective test which applies. The test
is not based on the level of tolerance of the judge or the jury. It is what the
judge or jury believe the national level of tolerance to be.

 

51.              Although, with great respect, I would not
subscribe to any suggestion in Laskin J.A.'s dissent in R. v. Cameron (supra)
that expert evidence is mandatory, I would nonetheless adopt his comment at p.
515 of that judgment:

 

Of course, that ultimate
issue was for him [the judge], but even the most knowledgeable adjudicator
should hesitate to rely on his own taste, his subjective appreciation, to
condemn art. He does not advance the situation by invoking his right to apply
the law and satisfying it by a formulary advertence to the factors which must
be canvassed in order to register a conviction. 

 

52.              What is essential to a determination of
undueness by means of the community standards test is that the trier of fact
formulate an opinion of what the contemporary Canadian community will tolerate.
In forming this opinion, the trier of fact must assess the community consensus.
This assessment will inevitably involve judgments about values since it is one
that touches the very fundamental mores and viewpoints of the Canadian
community.

 

53.              I would repeat, however, that this inquiry,
though involving judgments about values, must be distinguished from the
application of the trier of fact's subjective opinions about the tastelessness
or impropriety of certain publications. The decision must focus on an objective
determination of the community's level of tolerance and whether the publication
exceeds such level of tolerance, not the trier of fact's personal views
regarding the impugned publication. Thus, the role of an appellate court on an
appeal from a determination of the community standard is to ensure that the
trier of fact's decision is based on an opinion on the community standard of
tolerance, not on his or her opinion about the tastelessness or impropriety of
the impugned publication.

 

54.              Evidence of the community's standard of
tolerance may well be useful and indeed desirable in many cases. Nonetheless, I
do not consider that there must be evidence, expert or otherwise, which the
trier of fact accepts before a particular publication can be determined to violate
the community standard. It is the opinion of the trier of fact on the community
standard of tolerance with which we are concerned. It ought not to be stated as
a matter of law that the trier of fact must have evidence, expert or otherwise,
to be able to form an opinion on the community standard of tolerance.

 

55.              As I have indicated, the defence did lead
evidence of Mr. Hooper, the Chairman of the Alberta Censor Board for the
purpose of showing that the film did not fall below contemporary community
standards. The trial judge made only one reference to this evidence:

 

                   Now,
whether or not the film was approved by the Censor Board, as far as I am
concerned, has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not the Crown can
prefer an indictment against it for providing an immoral, indecent or obscene
performance. The Court is the one that has to decide that. 

 

56.              The law is clear that a trier of fact does
not have to accept testimony, whether expert or otherwise. He can reject it, in
whole or in part. He cannot, however, reject it without good reason. In this
case, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider and assess the weight, if
any, to be given to the evidence, indicative of community standards of tolerance,
afforded by the approval of the film by censor boards or classification boards
as well as the fact that no complaints had been received by the Board in
Alberta although more than 8,500 people had viewed the film. He might, for
instance, have considered the following assessment of similar evidence with
regard to Last Tango in Paris by Freedman C.J.M. in R. v. Odeon
Morton Theatres Ltd. (supra), at p. 196:

 

[The issue of obscenity]
must be determined according to contemporary community standards in Canada.
Relevant to that determination are many factors. One is the testimony of the
experts, to be judicially assessed and weighed. Another is the circumstance
that the film is adult fare only, as it has been given the classification
""Restricted Adult"", thereby becoming unavailable to persons under 18
years of age. A third is the fact that the film is being shown in New
Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia, in all of which Provinces it
was given clearance by censor boards who made no deletions in it. (The film is
of course being shown in many other countries in the world as well.) The record
does not disclose a single Province that has banned ""Last Tango"". I
am loath to believe that Manitobans are less tolerant, less sophisticated, or more
in need of protective shelter than other Canadians.

 

In the present case the trial judge should certainly not have rejected
the evidence before him without explanation.

 

57.              It must also be kept in mind that the
Crown must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. If at the end of the case
the trial judge, whether on the basis of the defence evidence or otherwise, has
a reasonable doubt that the material falls below community standards, he must
acquit. There is no onus on the accused to show that community standards have
been met.

 

58.              In my view the trial judge erred in
failing to have regard to the unrebutted evidence of the Chairman of the Censor
Board of Alberta.

 

59.              Both the points advanced by the appellant
are well taken. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgments at
trial and on appeal, and order a new trial. 

 

                   The reasons of Beetz and Estey JJ. were delivered by

 

60.              Beetz
J.‑‑I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for
judgment written by the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice McIntyre and Madame Justice
Wilson.

 

61.              Like Mr. Justice McIntyre, I agree with
the Chief Justice that the standard we seek is that of tolerance and that:
""What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see.
What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because
it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow
them to see it."" I agree, however, with the Chief Justice that the Crown
is not required to adduce expert evidence as to community standards.

 

62.              Again like Mr. Justice McIntyre, I agree
with Madame Justice Wilson that the audience to which a film or other
publication is exposed is not relevant to a consideration of whether it is
obscene.

 

63.              I would dispose of the appeal as do the
Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

64.              McIntyre
J.‑‑I have read the reasons for judgment prepared for
delivery by the Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson. I am in agreement with
the Chief Justice that the standard we seek is that of tolerance and that:
""What matters is not what Canadians think is right for themselves to see.
What matters is what Canadians would not abide other Canadians seeing because
it would be beyond the contemporary Canadian standard of tolerance to allow
them to see it."" I agree, however, with Madame Justice Wilson that the
audience to which a film or other publication is exposed is not relevant to a
consideration of whether it is obscene, and also share her view that to
formulate the community standard, which is an element of the proof required
from the Crown in a criminal case, some evidence, expert or otherwise, must be
adduced by the Crown before the trier of fact. I would dispose of the appeal as
do the Chief Justice and Madame Justice Wilson. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

65.              Wilson
J.‑‑I concur in the result reached by the Chief Justice. I
wish, however, to express my own view as to what the trial judge did in this
case that constituted error in law. In so doing I have found it necessary to
some extent to revert to first principles. I start with the wording of s.
159(8) of the Criminal Code which reads:

 

                   (8) For
the purposes of this Act, any publication a dominant characteristic of which is
the undue exploitation of sex, or of sex and any one or more of the following
subjects, namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence, shall be deemed to be
obscene.

 

It seems to me that the question which the section poses is: is the
undue exploitation of sex a dominant characteristic of this movie? The narrower
question is: is the exploitation of sex in this movie ""undue""? If the
exploitation of sex in the movie is not ""undue"", then it matters not
that the exploitation of sex is a dominant characteristic of the movie; it
cannot be obscene under the section. The primary question then to which all
others are subordinate is: is the exploitation of sex in the movie
""undue""?

 

66.              I turn to the test of
""undueness"". How is ""undueness"" to be measured? Clearly it
postulates a standard which cannot be exceeded and that standard has been
stated by the courts to be an objective one, the contemporary community
standard in Canada. The problem then becomes one of how to identify that
contemporary community standard in order to decide whether or not it has been
exceeded.

 

67.              The standard we are concerned with, it seems
to me, is the degree of exploitation of sex which the Canadian community at any
given point of time is prepared to accept in its movies. This is sometimes
referred to as the Canadian standard of tolerance. I take no issue with the
word tolerance. In my view there is no difference in meaning between acceptance
by the community and tolerance by the community. I do not find it helpful,
however, to refine further on that standard by identifying it as the degree of
exploitation of sex to which Canadians are prepared to have other Canadians
exposed. I think this is a different standard, a much more difficult one to
identify and one not mandated by the section. 

 

68.              The test by which the trier of fact must
assess the community standard is an objective one. The community standard
itself, however, necessarily contains an element of subjectivity since what
must be objectified are the subjective views of the entire community as to what
degree of exploitation of sex is acceptable. To identify the community standard
in terms of the degree of exploitation of sex to which Canadians are prepared
to have other Canadians exposed has the effect, however, of introducing an even
greater degree of subjectivity into the community standard. I believe this is
so because what Canadians consider to be acceptable for other Canadians is
likely to depend heavily on which other Canadians they have in mind. The
community may feel that the degree of exploitation of sex in a particular film
would be unacceptable if the film were shown to an audience of young people or
senior citizens but nevertheless feel that it would be acceptable if the film
were shown to a university group. In determining this community standard the
trier of fact would be forced to speculate not only on what the community
considers to be acceptable but on which particular constituency the community
has in mind in setting the standard of acceptability.

 

69.              I think we have to approach the question
more directly and ask: do Canadians today accept this degree of exploitation of
sex in their movies? If they do, then the movie is not obscene. If they don't,
then the exploitation is ""undue"" and, if it is a dominant
characteristic of the movie, the movie is deemed to be obscene under the
section. It is not, in my opinion, open to the courts under s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code  to characterize a movie as obscene if shown to one constituency but
not if shown to another. I do not doubt that it is desirable to regulate the
movies that can be shown to different constituencies. A movie which is not
obscene within the meaning of the Criminal Code  may still not be
desirable viewing material for persons under the age of 18. Such regulation, as
will be mentioned later in these reasons, is authorized in various provincial
jurisdictions but it is the regulation of material which is not obscene under
the Code. I do not think the Court should, by segregating the community
into different groups for purposes of ascertaining the standard of tolerance the
community would adopt for each group, inject into s. 159(8)  of the Criminal
Code  a series of different tests of obscenity. In my view, a movie is
either obscene under the Code based on a national community standard of
tolerance or it is not. If it is not, it may still be the subject of provincial
regulatory control. 

 

70.              ""Undueness"", however, is not
purely a matter of degree. It must have reference to the total context of the
movie. As Judson J. said in Brodie v. The Queen, [1962] S.C.R. 681 at p.
702, in discussing obscenity in literature:

 

It is not the particular
passages and words in a certain context that are before the Court for judgment
but the book as a complete work. The question is whether the book as a whole is
obscene not whether certain passages and certain words, part of a larger work,
are obscene.

 

The same point was made by Chief Justice Freedman in R. v. Odeon
Morton Theatres Ltd. (1974), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 185 (Man. C.A.), when, in
speaking of the film Last Tango in Paris, he said at p. 193:

 

It must be judged as a
whole. It should not be condemned as obscene merely by reference to its sexual
episodes or to its occasional gross and earthy language. Both the episodes and
the language must be assessed in the context of and in their relationship to
the entire film.

 

71.              Coming back then to the determination of
the community standard in the terms I have described, namely the standard the
community at any given time is prepared to accept or tolerate, how is this
moral consensus to be ascertained? I describe it as a ""moral""
consensus because I agree with the Chief Justice that we are not concerned here
with matters of ""taste"". To use the standard accepted by members of
the community for themselves does not, in my view, substitute ""taste""
for moral acceptability. I think it is incorrect to say that when I am deciding
whether or not I myself am prepared to be shown a certain type of movie I am
making a decision merely on the basis of taste but when I am deciding
whether or not I am prepared to have that same movie shown to others I am
making a decision on the basis of tolerance. This, in my view, is a
false distinction. In either case tolerance in the sense of moral acceptability
is the issue‑‑in the former case moral acceptability to myself and
in the latter moral acceptability to others. People may, of course, refuse to
patronize certain movies on grounds of taste but this is not at all what we are
concerned with under the Criminal Code . 

 

72.              The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary
defines  ""toleration"" as ""the action or practice of tolerating
or allowing what is not actually approved"". It is apparent from this
definition that there is a distinction between that which is not approved and
that which is not to be tolerated. In R. v. Doug Rankine Co. (1983), 36
C.R. (3d) 154 (Ont.) at p. 173, Borins Co. Ct. J. made the following assessment
of community standards of tolerance in relation to what may be described as
""sex films"":

 

In my opinion,
contemporary community standards would tolerate the distribution of films which
consist substantially of scenes of people engaged in sexual intercourse.
Contemporary community standards would also tolerate the distribution of films
which consist of scenes of group sex, lesbianism, fellatio, cunnilingus, and
anal sex. However, films which consist substantially or partially of scenes
which portray violence and cruelty in conjunction with sex, particularly where
the performance of indignities degrades and dehumanizes the people upon whom
they are performed, exceed the level of community tolerance.

 

In drawing this distinction I do not think that Borins Co. Ct. J. was
suggesting that the average Canadian finds the former type of film to his or
her taste or that such films are inoffensive to most Canadians. Rather, I think
that Borins Co. Ct. J. recognized that whether or not Canadians found the
former type of films distasteful, they were prepared to tolerate their being
shown.

 

73.              It seems to me that the undue exploitation
of sex at which s. 159(8)  is aimed is the treatment of sex which in some
fundamental way dehumanizes the persons portrayed and, as a consequence, the
viewers themselves. There is nothing wrong in the treatment of sex per se
but there may be something wrong in the manner of its treatment. It may be
presented brutally, salaciously and in a degrading manner, and would thus be
dehumanizing and intolerable not only to the individuals or groups who are
victimized by it but to society at large. On the other hand, it may be
presented in a way which harms no one in that it depicts nothing more than non‑violent
sexual activity in a manner which neither degrades nor dehumanizes any
particular individuals or groups. It is this line between the mere portrayal of
human sexual acts and the dehumanization of people that must be reflected in
the definition of ""undueness"".

 

74.              How is the Court to determine where the
line is drawn? By guidelines read into the definition as a matter of
interpretation of the word ""undue""? By consideration of the presumed
social ills sought to be avoided by restrictions on freedom of publication? By
statistics showing what people are prepared to look at and what they are not?
The courts have said that the test is an objective one and clearly that must be
so. But objectivity requires criteria and the courts have not been too
successful in evolving them. Yet this is a criminal offence and it is basic to
our system of criminal justice that the public know what conduct is criminal
and what is not.     

 

75.              This, it seems to me, militates very
strongly against a community standard test of undueness which varies with
""the targetted group"". I believe it is important to the publishing
industry to have some degree of certainty as to when they may be exposing
themselves to a criminal charge. The only way to provide that degree of
certainty is, in my opinion, to have a uniform community standard test of
""undueness"" under the Code. With great respect to those who
think otherwise, I see nothing in s. 159(8)  which would permit something to be
obscene under the section when shown to X but not obscene when shown to Y.
Moreover, it seems to me that this approach would inevitably lead to problems
where a publication targetted to one group by the accused fell into the hands
of others.

 

76.              As I see it, the essential difficulty with
the definition of obscenity is that ""undueness"" must presumably be
assessed in relation to consequences. It is implicit in the definition that at
some point the exploitation of sex becomes harmful to the public or at least
the public believes that to be so. It is therefore necessary for the protection
of the public to put limits on the degree of exploitation and, through the
application of the community standard test, the public is made the arbiter of
what is harmful to it and what is not. The problem is that we know so little of
the consequences we are seeking to avoid. Do obscene movies spawn immoral
conduct? Do they degrade women? Do they promote violence? The most that can be
said, I think, is that the public has concluded that exposure to material which
degrades the human dimensions of life to a subhuman or merely physical
dimension and thereby contributes to a process of moral desensitization must be
harmful in some way. It must therefore be controlled when it gets out of hand,
when it becomes ""undue"".

 

77.              Addressing the problem of
""undueness"" in the context of agreements which ""prevent or
lessen, unduly, competition"" in a product, Mr. Justice Idington said in Weidman
v. Shragge (1912), 46 S.C.R. 1 at pp. 20‑21: 

 

                   This
being a criminal statute we must try to find the vicious purpose aimed at in
order to bring parties within its prohibitions.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   Crimes
usually imply something all right‑minded men condemn.... The test must in
each case be the true purpose and its relation to the activities specified in
and by the words of the statute and a finding of an evil or vice answering to
the descriptive word ""unduly"".

 

He found the vicious purpose in the context of combines legislation to
be the destruction of all competition. What is the vicious purpose aimed at in
the case of obscenity legislation? The statutory definition does not provide an
answer nor, with respect, does the existing jurisprudence.

 

78.              The test of the community standard is
helpful to the extent that it provides a norm against which impugned material
may be assessed but it does little to elucidate the underlying question as to
why some exploitation of sex falls on the permitted side of the line under s.
159(8)  and some on the prohibited side. No doubt this question will have to be
addressed when the validity of the obscenity provisions of the Code is
subjected to attack as an infringement on freedom of speech and the
infringement is sought to be justified as reasonable. Suffice it to say, that
clearly some fairly basic values are designed to be protected by the obscenity
provisions and the community standards test is premised on the assumption that
these values are held in common by the contemporary Canadian community.

 

79.              The community standard test in Canada, I
believe, had its origin in Brodie (supra), the Lady Chatterley’s
Lover case, in which four members of this Court concluded that the
definition of obscenity introduced into the Code in 1957 made the test
in R. v. Hicklin (1868), L.R. 3 Q.B. 360, obsolete. In their view it was
no longer necessary to show a tendency to corrupt and deprave if the dominant
characteristic of the publication was an exploitation of sex which was
""undue"". The test of ""undueness"", said Mr. Justice Fauteux
at p. 697, was whether the exploitation was shocking and disgusting
""having regard to the existing standards of decency in the
community...."" Mr. Justice Judson agreed at pp. 705‑06 that the
standards of acceptance prevailing in the community provided the test of
""undueness"" for purposes of the definition. The statutory definition,
he felt, could not be superimposed upon the Hicklin test without leaving
the citizen in the position of not knowing whether he was committing a criminal
act or not. 

 

80.              The community standard test was applied
the same year (1962) in Manitoba by Freedman J.A. (as he then was) dissenting
in R. v. Dominion News & Gifts (1962) Ltd., [1963] 2 C.C.C. 103. The
learned justice said he would have judged the magazines by the standards of the
community and this Court, in reversing the decision of the Manitoba Court of
Appeal ([1964] S.C.R. 251), unanimously approved and adopted his reasons. I
quote the relevant passage in full from pp. 116‑17 of Mr. Justice
Freedman's reasons:

 

The case for the Crown
stands or falls on the applicability or otherwise of the first part of the
definition‑‑namely, that a dominant characteristic of these
magazines was ""the undue exploitation of sex"".

 

                   Can it
fairly be said that this was a dominant characteristic of either Dude or
Escapade? I have examined them both with care. That they do not qualify as
reading matter which I would personally select for myself even in an idle hour
is undoubtedly the case. But that does not make them obscene. In this area of
the law one must be especially vigilant against erecting personal tastes or
prejudices into legal principles. Many persons quite evidently desire to read
these magazines, even though I do not. I recognize, of course, that the mere
numerical support which a publication is able to attract is not determinative
of the issue whether it is obscene or not. Let a publication be sufficiently
pornographic and it will be bound to appeal, in the hundreds or thousands, to
the prurient, the lascivious, the ignorant, the simple, or even the merely
curious. Admitting, therefore, that a large readership is not the test, I must
yet add that it is not always an entirely irrelevant factor. For it may have to
be taken into account when one seeks to ascertain or identify the standards of
the community in these matters. Those standards are not set by those of lowest
taste or interest. Nor are they set exclusively by those of rigid, austere,
conservative, or puritan taste and habit of mind. Something approaching a
general average of community thinking and feeling has to be discovered.
Obviously this is no easy task, for we are seeking a quantity that is elusive.
Yet the effort must be made if we are to have a fair objective standard in
relation to which a publication can be tested as to whether it is obscene or
not. The alternative would mean a subjective approach, with the result
dependent upon and varying with the personal tastes and predilections of the
particular Judge who happens to be trying the case.

 

                   Community
standards must be contemporary. Times change, and ideas change with them.
Compared to the Victorian era this is a liberal age in which we live. One
manifestation of it is the relative freedom with which the whole question of
sex is discussed. In books, magazines, movies, television, and sometimes even
in parlour conversation, various aspects of sex are made the subject of
comment, with a candour that in an earlier day would have been regarded as
indecent and intolerable. We cannot and should not ignore these present‑day
attitudes when we face the question whether Dude and Escapade are obscene
according to our criminal law.

 

                   Community
standards must also be local. In other words, they must be Canadian. In
applying the definition in the Criminal Code  we must determine what is
obscene by Canadian standards, regardless of attitudes which may prevail
elsewhere, be they more liberal or less so.

 

                   I think
I should add my view that, in cases close to the border line, tolerance is to
be preferred to proscription. To strike at a publication which is not clearly
obscene may have repercussions and implications beyond what is immediately
visible. To suppress the bad is one thing; to suppress the not so bad, or even
the possibly good is quite another. Unless it is confined to clear cases,
suppression may tend to inhibit those creative impulses and endeavours which
ought to be encouraged in a free society. 

 

81.              In reversing the Manitoba Court of Appeal
Taschereau C.J. said at p. 251:

 

                   We are
all of opinion that the appeals should be allowed. We agree with the reasons
given by Freedman J.A. in the Court of Appeal for Manitoba. We wish to adopt
those reasons in their entirety and do not find it necessary to add anything to
them.

 

I would respectfully adopt ""the Freedman approach"" as the law
applicable to this case.

 

82.              If I am correct as to how the community
standard in Canada is to be identified, namely with reference to what Canadians
at any given point of time will accept in their movies, then what is the
significance of the evidence of the unanimous approval of this film by the
censor boards of all the provinces having such boards?

 

83.              I believe that there is an onus on the
Crown to put evidence before the court on the issue of ""undueness"". I
cannot see how the community standard against which the allegedly obscene
matter has to be measured can be identified without it. In R. v. Cameron
(1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 486 (Ont.), Laskin J.A. (as he then was) pointed out in
dissent that because a judge or jury may be limited in the geographical range
of his exposure, which in turn might result in ""a limitation of
opportunity of appreciation and understanding"" of the particular subject‑matter‑‑in
that case artists' drawings‑‑expert evidence was indispensable. He
said at p. 515:

 

I think that such evidence
would always be necessary to support the case for the Crown as well as to
support the defence, especially where, as here, pictures by artists of repute
are seized from a reputable gallery. Holding this view, I cannot but be
surprised that the Crown in the case at bar produced no expert evidence and
relied on the pictures themselves to convey obscenity to the Magistrate. Of
course, that ultimate issue was for him, but even the most knowledgeable
adjudicator should hesitate to rely on his own taste, his subjective
appreciation, to condemn art. He does not advance the situation by invoking his
right to apply the law and satisfying it by a formulary advertence to the
factors which must be canvassed in order to register a conviction.

 

84.              Laskin J.A. was, of course, speaking of
expert evidence in the context of that case but it seems to me that the point
is well made with respect to non‑expert evidence as well. Having regard
to the fact that the onus is on the Crown to establish obscenity beyond a
reasonable doubt, it seems to me that the onus is on it to establish both what
the community standard of acceptability is and that the accused has gone beyond
it. The accused may counter the Crown's evidence of the community standard with
evidence of its own and the judge may reach his decision on the evidence in the
usual way. In my view it is naive to think that a judge, drawing on his own
experience alone, can determine the objective standard against which impugned
conduct is to be measured. As Borins Co. Ct. J. said in R. v. Doug Rankine
Co. (supra) the legislature cannot credibly expect a trier of fact to have
his finger on the ""pornographic pulse of the nation"". Moreover, it is
wrong in principle. It leaves the accused with no way of knowing the case it
has to meet, at what level of acceptability the line will be drawn by any
particular judge. There is no certainty. It is the length of the Chancellor's
foot imported into the criminal law. 

 

85.              The result feared by Laskin J.A. when no
evidence is presented to the trial judge is precisely what happened here. The
trial judge made ""a formulary advertence to the factors that had to be
canvassed"". He indicated that he knew that the test of
""undueness"" was an objective one, that he had to decide whether or
not the film exceeded the standard of acceptability to the community as a whole
but he then proceeded to attribute the sense of revulsion which he experienced
on viewing the film to the community as a whole. He gave no indication of the
basis on which he felt able to make that leap and there is no suggestion that
he took into consideration the evidence of censor board approval which was
before him. That evidence was not contested and, having regard to the statutory
purpose for which these boards were created, I think it was relevant evidence
and evidence which he was obliged to consider.

 

86.              The legislation creating these boards
varies from province to province but the role of the boards, generally
speaking, is to approve, prohibit or regulate the exhibition of films within
their respective provinces. The boards are not only empowered to approve or
disapprove films in toto. In some provinces the legislation also
authorizes the boards to ""remove by cutting or otherwise"" parts of
films. Most provinces have a film classification system, the classes, generally
speaking, being ""general"", ""adult"" and
""restricted"".

 

87.              Since the business of these boards is to
assess films on an ongoing basis for the very purpose of determining their
acceptability for viewing by the community as a whole or a segment of the
community depending upon classification, they must be regarded as tribunals
with expertise at least on the community standard within their own province. It
is hard to think that a judge, or even a jury, sitting in or drawn from a local
area would be better informed as to what was acceptable to Canadians across the
country. Moreover, in this case at least, the boards' assessments disclose a
remarkable degree of uniformity. I do not see how the learned trial judge,
applying an objective test and giving proper consideration to that evidence,
could have reached the result he did. I believe it is clear from his reasons
that he saw his role, not as applying the community standard, but as raising
the standard if he personally thought it was too low. I think he was clearly in
error in this regard. 

 

88.              The Court of Appeal on this aspect of the
case stated:

 

The trial judge, sitting
as a jury, was obliged to determine in an objective way what was tolerable in
accordance with the contemporary standards of the Canadian community. As a
trier of fact he was entitled to draw on his experience in the community. He
had to consider the expert evidence but was entitled to reject it and obviously
did.

 

With respect, I think it is far from obvious that the trial judge
rejected the expert evidence. The only comment he made on it was:

 

                   Now,
whether or not the film was approved by the Censor Board, as far as I am
concerned, has nothing whatsoever to do with whether or not the Crown can
prefer an indictment against it for providing an immoral, indecent or obscene
performance. The Court is the one that has to decide that.

 

There is no question that the approval of the censor board does not
preclude the preferring of an indictment. The issue the judge had to decide was
the significance of the approvals as evidence of the community standard of
acceptance. It seems to me that he never addressed his mind to that issue.

 

89.              In my view, the practice of allowing the
trier of fact to rely exclusively on his or her personal experience of
community standards of tolerance (see R. v. Great West News Ltd., [1970]
4 C.C.C. 307 (Man. C.A.) at pp. 314‑15) is an invitation to the type of
error committed by the trial judge in this case. The problem can be readily
avoided by requiring the Crown to adduce evidence of the community standard.
The trier of fact would then determine the community standard on the basis of
the evidence before him in the same way as he determines the factual issues in
any other kind of criminal case. 

 

90.              I cannot see how such a requirement would,
as has been suggested, frustrate the Crown's ability to secure a conviction in
a meritorious case. At present the trier of fact in an obscenity case can be
faced with the unenviable task of deciding the level of tolerance of a
community of 24 million people on the basis of nothing more than his or her own
personal experience. In effect, what the trier of fact does in the absence of
evidence is attribute by inference his or her own perception to the entire
Canadian community. I would think that requiring the trier of fact to make the
determination on the basis of evidence adduced would render the task easier
rather than more difficult. It would also, in my view, inspire greater public
confidence in the result. Moreover, it might well have the very desirable
effect of enhancing uniformity in the application of the law of obscenity since
evidence of community standards which is relevant to one prosecution will
commonly be relevant to others.

 

91.              I agree with the Chief Justice that the
appeal must be allowed, the judgments at trial and on appeal set aside and a
new trial ordered.

                   The appellants are Roman Catholics who were charged,
pursuant to s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code , with wilfully disturbing the
order or solemnity of an assemblage of persons met for religious worship. The
appellants opposed a change in the liturgy, approved by the Bishop, requiring
communion to be received by parishioners while standing rather than kneeling as
had been the previous practice. As a result of this liturgical change, there
had been an ongoing dispute between appellants and their parish priest and
other members of the congregation. A diocesan directive, describing in
particular the manner communion was to be administered and received, was
regularly read at services and twice during mass on the day in question.
However, appellants attempted to receive communion in a kneeling position. Each
was told by the priest to stand if he wished to receive it. After a few
seconds, each one stood and, without having received communion, returned to his
seat in an orderly manner. The trial judge convicted the accused, finding their
actions hampered the spirituality of this part of the service, held up the
communion lines briefly and created a degree of anxiety and tension which
distracted the priests and some members of the congregation. Both the County
Court and the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, Appellate Division, upheld the conviction.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   Per Dickson, Beetz,
McIntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: Subsection 172(3)  of the Criminal
Code  is valid federal legislation pursuant to s. 91(27)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . This subsection is a prohibition which, by means of
summary conviction penalty, protects people, who have gathered to pursue any
kind of socially beneficial activity, from being purposefully disturbed or
interrupted. This prohibition, with its consequent penal sanctions, serves the
needs of public morality by precluding conduct potentially injurious to the
public interest. It therefore bears the essential characteristics by which
matters falling within the criminal law power of Parliament are commonly
identified.

 

                   The conduct of the appellants did not violate s.
172(3)  of the Criminal Code . Appellants' conduct was undoubtedly wilful
and took place at an assemblage of persons met for religious purposes. Conduct
producing annoyance, anxiety or emotional upset in the members of the
assemblage met for religious worship is not sufficient, however, to found a
conviction under the subsection. Where the impugned acts are brief, essentially
passive in nature and are voluntarily desisted from, upon request, then there
is no crime. Some activity in the nature of a disorder must occur as a result
of this type of conduct before a trial judge would be entitled to find the
order or solemnity of a meeting had been disturbed. 

 

                   To found criminal liability under this subsection,
the actions must meet a definition of the word ""disturbs"" suitable in
law to the context of the section and the offence thereby enacted. Not all
conduct capable of being described as disturbing or creating a disturbance will
fall within s. 172(3) . The use of the all‑encompassing term ""anything"",
to describe the type of acts that can be the cause of the disturbance, is an
indication of the need to restrict the meaning of the word
""disturbs"". Parliament could not have intended that s. 172(3)  could
be triggered by conduct which is not disorderly in itself or productive of
disorder. The heading of ss. 169‑175 of the Code‑‑Disorderly
Conduct‑‑supports this conclusion. There was no identifiable
disorder in this case. A brief holdup of the lines and a heightening of the
existing atmosphere of tension discerned by some of those present is not
evidence of a disorder. The trial judge erred in law in his interpretation of
s. 172(3)  and wrongly convicted the appellants.

 

                   Per Lamer and Wilson
JJ.: The trial judge erred in holding that kneeling instead of standing to
receive communion fell within the meaning of the word ""anything"" when
properly interpreted in light of the legislative context and legislative
history of s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code . The appellants should not
have been convicted.

 

                   The legislative context and history of the provision
dictates that the word ""anything"" should be given a restricted
interpretation consonant with the purpose of the statute. Prior to 1954, a
disturbance, interruption or disquiet of a religious assembly was only punishable
if it took place ""by profane discourse, by rude or indecent behaviour or
by making noise"". In amending the section in the 1953‑54 Code
to its present form, Parliament did not intend to expand its scope to cover
peaceful acts of defiance of religious authority. This view is reinforced by
the fact that s. 161 of the 1953‑54 Code (like s. 172 of the
present Code) is one of a series of offences falling under the heading
""Disorderly Conduct"". Accordingly, although the trial judge found on
proper evidence that the appellants' conduct disturbed the order and solemnity
of the service, no offence was committed.

 

                   Section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  is
properly characterized as criminal law since, in substance, it is an enactment
to prevent breaches of the public peace and to enable citizens to conduct
services of worship without fear of disturbance. Although, as a matter of
statutory interpretation, the appellants' conduct is not caught by the section,
this does not mean that the Criminal Code  could not, if clear and
unambiguous language were used for the purpose, characterize such conduct as
criminal where the result of it was to disturb the solemnity of a religious
service.

Part I‑‑Introduction

 

2.                The six appellants are Roman Catholics
who were charged, pursuant to s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code , with
wilfully doing an act that disturbed the order or solemnity of an assemblage of
persons met for religious worship. The charge was laid following their attempt
to receive holy communion in a kneeling position, contrary to a diocesan
directive that communion would only be given to parishioners who stood to
receive it. The accused were convicted at trial. Their convictions were
affirmed on appeal by both the Nova Scotia County Court and the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appellate Division. This case calls for consideration of the
proper interpretation in law to be given s. 172(3)  as well as the
constitutional validity of this subsection in light of s. 91(27)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 .

 

Part II‑‑Background and Facts

 

3.                The facts of the case are
straightforward and undisputed. The six appellants are practising members of
the Roman Catholic faith. They have for many years attended Our Lady of Lourdes
Parish Church in Stellarton, Nova Scotia. Our Lady of Lourdes is one of ninety‑three
parishes which make up the Diocese of Antigonish.

 

4.                It has become the custom in this diocese
for communion to be received standing by those able to do so. This custom is a
relatively recent development. The previous practice had been for communion to
be received kneeling. This change has been accepted and approved by the Bishop
responsible for the diocese. 

 

5.                Nonetheless, the appellants continued to
oppose this change in the liturgy. As a result of their opposition, there has
been what has been characterized before us as an ongoing dispute between the
appellants on the one hand and the priests and other members of this church, on
the other hand.

 

6.                To aid in the resolution of this
dispute, the parish priest and his assistant drew up a directive concerning the
procedures to be followed during mass. This directive dealt in particular with
the manner in which communion was to be administered and received. This
directive was regularly read during services to the parishioners prior to the
day of the alleged offence.

 

7.                On that day as well, this directive was
read to the assembled congregation, among whom were then present most, if not
all, of the appellants. The directive was again read shortly before communion
was administered by which time all appellants were present.

 

8.                When the point in the mass had been
reached when communion was to be taken, the appellants, with the other members
of the congregation who desired to receive communion, made their way to the
back of the church. From there, two lines formed and made their way down the
centre aisle towards the three communion stations at or near the altar. The two
lines spread into three as they approached these communion stations.

 

9.                As each accused arrived at a communion
station, he or she knelt before the priest. They were each told to stand if
they wished to receive communion. After a few seconds, each one stood and,
without receiving communion, moved off in an orderly manner to the sides of the
church and returned to his or her seat.

 

Part III‑‑Courts Below

 

10.              The appellants were all charged upon
informations dated June 30, 1982, alleging that each of the appellants, at the
time and place set forth, ""did unlawfully at or near a meeting of
Religious Worship at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish, did wilfully disturb the order
or solemnity of that Religious Worship and Meeting, contrary to section 172(3) 
of the Criminal Code  of Canada"".

 

11.              Section 172  of the Criminal Code 
reads:

 

                   172. (1) Every one who 

 

(a) by threats or
force, unlawfully obstructs or prevents or endeavours to obstruct or prevent a
clergyman or minister from celebrating divine service or performing any other
function in connection with his calling, or

 

(b) knowing that a
clergyman or minister is about to perform, is on his way to perform, or is
returning from the performance of any of the duties or functions mentioned in
paragraph (a)

 

(i) assaults or offers any
violence to him, or

 

(ii) arrests him upon a
civil process, or under the pretence of executing a civil process,

 

is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

 

                   (2)
Every one who wilfully disturbs or interrupts an assemblage of persons met for
religious worship or for a moral, social or benevolent purpose is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   (3)
Every one who, at or near a meeting referred to in subsection (2), wilfully
does anything that disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

12.              A motion for particulars was granted by
Judge R. MacEwan of Provincial Magistrate's Court on July 5, 1982. The Crown
filed the following reply to this order:

 

...the defendants failed
to take Communion in a manner that was directed and accepted by Our Lady of
Lourdes Parish; in that the Defendants kneeled rather than stood for the
purpose of receiving Communion, as is the accepted practice, and which kneeling
did interfere, and or distract other parishioners who were taking Communion as
was directed and accepted for the purpose of enabling said parishioners to
celebrate the Mass.

 

On August 18, 1982, Judge MacEwan convicted the appellants. Sentence
was suspended and each of the appellants was placed upon six months probation.

 

13.              The trial judge was of the view that the
appellants' refusal to take communion in the manner accepted in the parish
amounted to a violation of s. 172(3)  because it hampered the spirituality of
this part of the service. He concluded that both the order and the solemnity of
the meeting had been disturbed because the open defiance of the legitimate
authority of the priests was a disruptive act. In his view, it created a degree
of anxiety and tension which distracted the priests and the congregation from
one of the holiest moments in the mass. In reaching this conclusion, he
accepted and relied upon the uncontradicted evidence of the two priests
administering mass and three parishioners present during the service as to
their reaction to the appellants' attempts to receive communion while kneeling.

 

14.              An appeal against conviction and sentence
to the Nova Scotia County Court was dismissed by MacLellan J. He summarized his
reasons for denying the appeal against conviction in the following terms: 

 

                   In the
result then I am of the view that the appeal has no merit whatsoever. I think
the learned trial Judge, as I have indicated, had ample evidence to support the
conclusions that he reached. I see no failure of the evidence to support his
finding. I don't consider that his conclusion is unreasonable and in my view
there has been no miscarriage of justice. The appeal against conviction is
therefore dismissed.

 

15.              A further appeal to the Nova Scotia
Supreme Court, Appellate Division, sub nom. R. v. Hafey (1983), 4 C.C.C.
(3d) 344, 32 C.R. (3d) 285, 57 N.S.R. (2d) 100, 120 A.P.R. 100, brought with
the leave of that court, was also dismissed. Hart J.A., wrote for the unanimous
three member panel. I reproduce here the body of his reasoning:

 

                   The Criminal
Code  makes it an offence punishable on summary conviction for anyone to
disturb the order or solemnity of a religious meeting, and the trial judge
after hearing all of the evidence and arguments of counsel reached the
conclusion that the actions of the appellants under all of the circumstances
showed a defiance of the authority of their church and constituted a wilful
disturbance of the service. There was ample evidence, in my opinion, upon which
he could have reached that conclusion, and I have here to consider only whether
in law the offence contemplated by the Criminal Code  was in fact
committed.

 

                   Counsel
for the appellants argues that the bishop of the parish did not have the
authority to change the form of liturgy and insist upon the celebration of
communion in the new fashion, and that therefore the directive given by the
parish priest was not valid. She claims that her clients had the right to
receive communion in the kneeling position and had not therefore committed any
offence against the Criminal Code . She suggests strongly that the matter
is one for determination within the church and that a criminal prosecution
should not have been taken, as the acts committed by the appellants were not of
a criminal nature of the kind envisioned by the Code as an offence
against s. 172 .

 

                   In my
opinion there is no merit to the position taken by counsel for the appellants.
It is a criminal offence to disturb the order or solemnity of a religious
meeting, and that is exactly what the trial judge found as a fact the appellants
had done. If several persons disagree with the form of the religious service
they may have the right to withdraw but not to insist upon their procedures
against the will of the hierarchy of the church. The actions of the appellants
although relatively passive were conducted during the course of a bitter
dispute within the church and it was open to the trial judge to find that in
these circumstances their actions constituted a disturbance, and, in my
opinion, this type of disturbance is the very type of conduct intended to be
prohibited by the provisions of the Criminal Code . Feelings were
obviously running high among the parishioners and emotions were near the point
of explosion. The actions of the appellants could do nothing but disturb the
solemnity of the service.

 

16.              Leave to appeal was granted by this Court
[1983] 1 S.C.R. xiv. The appeals of all the appellants were treated as one
cause, as they had been in the courts below. The Attorney General of Canada
intervened in support of the position advanced by the Attorney General of Nova
Scotia. 

 

Part IV‑‑Issues

 

17.              The proper resolution of this case
necessitates consideration of the following two issues:

 

1. Whether s. 172(3) is intra
vires Parliament of Canada pursuant to s. 91(27)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 ;

 

2. Whether the courts
below have applied the proper legal standard in determining whether the
appellant's conduct violated s. 172(3)?

 

Part V‑‑Constitution Act,
1867 : s. 91(27) 

 

18.              The first issue then is whether s. 172(3) 
of the Criminal Code  is intra vires the Parliament of Canada. I
think it plainly is. The ""matter"" in relation to which this
subsection has been enacted comes within the power granted to Parliament by s.
91(27)  of the Constitution Act, 1867  to legislate upon criminal law.

 

19.              Subsection 172(3) , much like subs. 172(2),
is a prohibition which, by means of summary conviction penalty, protects
people, who have gathered to pursue any kind of socially beneficial activity,
from being purposefully disturbed or interrupted. The subsection is designed to
safeguard the rights of groups of people to meet freely and to prevent the
breaches of the peace which could result if these types of meetings were
disrupted. Vide R. v. Reed (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 153 (B.C.Co.Ct.), at p.
166, aff'd (1984), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 573 (B.C.C.A.)

 

20.              There is no difficulty in concluding that
this prohibition, with its consequent penal sanctions, serves the needs of
public morality by precluding conduct potentially injurious to the public
interest. It therefore bears the essential characteristics by which matters
falling within the criminal law power of Parliament are commonly identified: Canadian
Federation of Agriculture v. Attorney‑General for Quebec, [1951] A.C.
179 (P.C.) approving Rand J. in sub nom. Reference re Validity of Section
5(a) of the Dairy Industry Act, [1949] S.C.R. 1, at pp. 49‑50.

 

21.              The appellants' argument upon this
division of powers question began with the submission that subs. 172(3) was not
competent to either Parliament or the provincial legislature in so far as it
dealt with religious matters. The argument, framed in this manner, is obviously
inapposite to any analysis of which body in the Canadian federal system is
empowered to legislate. It will not be competent to either legislative body to
enact legislation which contravenes the rights and freedoms guaranteed under
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Charter  does
not, however, alter the distribution of powers between the provinces and the
federal parliament which continues to be governed by ss. 91  and 92  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . 

 

22.              It is thus my opinion that s. 172(3)  is intra
vires the Parliament of Canada.

 

Part VI‑‑Interpretation of s.
172(3) 

 

23.              The next issue is whether the courts below
have applied the proper legal standard in determining whether the appellants'
conduct violated s. 172(3) . With due respect to the judges in the courts below,
it is my view that the conduct of the appellants did not violate s. 172(3)  when
that subsection is properly interpreted.

 

24.              Although s. 172(3) of the Code has
a long legislative history it has received little judicial consideration. In R.
v. Lavoie (1902), 6 C.C.C. 39 (Que. Rec. Ct.) the accused was charged with
having unlawfully and wilfully disturbed, by rude behaviour and by making
noise, an assemblage of persons met for a social purpose, to wit, the holding
of a meeting in a hall on Bonsecours Street in the City of Montréal. He was
acquitted on the ground that s. 173 of the 1892 Criminal Code  did not
apply to a meeting of electors of a city ward called in aid of a candidate for
election. In the view of the recorder, the section was not intended for the
preservation of order at political or municipal meetings.

 

25.              In R. v. Gauthier (1905), 11 C.C.C.
263 (Que. K.B.), the accused was convicted on appeal of disturbing the order or
solemnity of a meeting for religious worship. The accused entered a meeting of
the Salvation Army in a rented hall in the Municipality of St. Louis du Mile
End. The meeting was already in progress. He moved to the front, turned and
asked all French speaking people to rise, and when the majority arose, he
invited them to leave on the basis that the meeting was no place for French
Roman Catholics like himself. Most of the people in the room began to leave,
alarming the chairman of the meeting who attempted to prevent them.

 

26.              The presence of the Salvation Army in the
community had raised some hostile feelings and there was a large crowd of some
1200 people gathered outside. As the people began to leave the meeting, the
crowd began to throw objects through the windows of the hall, one of which hit
the chairman in the face. The crowd eventually dispersed. The accused,
acquitted at trial, was convicted on appeal to the King's Bench. Hall J.
concluded that ""...the members of the [Salvation] Army had the right to
the audience they had secured and no man had a right to go there and by a
peremptory command or even by personal influence to interfere with that
audience and take them away"". 

 

27.              See also Chaput v. Romain, [1955]
S.C.R. 834, per Taschereau J. at p. 842; R. v. Reed, supra;
R. v. Cardinal (1969), 8 C.R.N.S. 325 (Alta. Mag. Ct.); R. v. Wasyl
Kapij (1905), 9 C.C.C. 186 (Man. C.A.)

 

28.              To be guilty of an offence under s. 172(3) 
the following elements must be present:

 

(1) A person must wilfully
do ""anything"";

 

(2) at or near ""an
assemblage of persons met for religious worship or a moral, social or
benevolent purpose"";

 

(3) that ""disturbs
the order or solemnity of the meeting"".

 

29.              There can be no dispute, as the trial
judge concluded, that the appellants' conduct was wilful. They deliberately and
purposefully knelt to receive communion in acknowledged defiance of the
priest's direction that they stand.

 

30.              It is equally plain that the appellants'
actions took place at an assemblage of persons met for religious worship. They
were in church during the celebration of mass at which some 100 to 200 persons
were in attendance.

 

31.              I am not persuaded, however, that the
appellants' conduct could be said in law to have disturbed the order or
solemnity of the meeting. I have come to the conclusion that the trial judge
erred in law in his interpretation of the subsection and that he was wrong in
convicting the appellants. I have done so on the basis of the description given
at trial of the appellants' conduct and the reaction to it.

 

32.              The following are the facts, the only
facts, upon which the trial judge found a disturbance: (i) the appellants held
up the communion lines briefly and inconvenienced, to some degree, one or two
handicapped people who were behind them in line, (ii) their actions created
some anxiety or tension in the priests administering the communion as well as
those communicants who observed what took place. 

 

33.              In my opinion, it is not sufficient to
found a conviction under s. 172(3)  that an accused's conduct produce annoyance,
anxiety or emotional upset in the members of the assemblage met for religious
worship. Where the impugned acts are brief, essentially passive and peaceful in
nature and are voluntarily desisted from, upon request, as they were in this
case, then there is no crime. There must be some activity in the nature of a
disorder which occurs as a result of this conduct before a trial judge would be
entitled to find the order or solemnity of a meeting had been disturbed. Where,
on the other hand, the impugned actions are not passive nor peaceful in nature,
they may in themselves constitute activity in the nature of a disorder
sufficient to found a conviction under this subsection.

 

34.              There was no identifiable disorder in this
case. A brief holdup of the lines and a heightening of the existing atmosphere
of tension discerned by some of those present is not evidence of a disorder.

 

35.              The trial judge, however, accepted the
definitions of ""disturb"" and ""disturbance"" given in the Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary and Black’s Law Dictionary. The Shorter
Oxford English Dictionary defines ""disturb"" as, inter alia:

 

3. To interfere with the settled course or operation of; to interrupt,
hinder, frustrate...

 

Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979)
defines ""disturbance"" as:

 

Any act causing annoyance,
disquiet, agitation, or derangement to another, or interrupting his peace, or
interfering with him in the pursuit of a lawful and appropriate occupation or
contrary to the usages of a sort of meeting and class of persons assembled that
interferes with its due progress or irritates the assembly in whole or in part.

 

36.              I recognize that the appellants' conduct
could fall within the ordinary meaning of the word ""disturb"".
Equally, it could be embraced by the definition of ""disturbance""
given in Black’s Law Dictionary. (I would point out that the American
context from which the Black’s Law Dictionary definition appears to be
drawn is markedly different from the Canadian one, particularly, s. 172(3) : see
12 Am. Jur. 2d 661 ""Breach of Peace and Disorderly Conduct"".) Not all
conduct capable of being described as disturbing or creating a disturbance will
fall within s. 172(3) . To found criminal liability under this subsection, the
actions must meet a definition of the term ""disturbs"" suitable in law
to the context of the section and the offence thereby enacted. It is necessary
for the conduct to be disorderly in itself or productive of disorder to be rendered
criminal. Conduct which falls below this threshold will not be caught by the
subsection. 

 

37.              Parliament could not have intended that s.
172(3)  of the Criminal Code  could be triggered by conduct which is not
disorderly in itself or productive of disorder. The use of the all‑encompassing
term ""anything"" to describe the type of acts that can be the cause of
the disturbance is an indication of the need to restrict the meaning of the
word ""disturb"". If ""disturb"" in the context of s. 172(3)  is
taken to encompass annoyance, anxiety or emotional upset, then
""anything"", no matter how trivial, which would lead to such
annoyance, anxiety or emotional upset would be caught by the provision: a man
might be convicted under the section for failing to take his hat off in a
church, or failing to keep it on in a synagogue.

 

38.              This interpretation of the word is
strengthened by the context in which s. 172(3) of the Code is found. The
heading for ss. 169‑175 of the Code is ""Disorderly
Conduct"". Some assistance in interpreting the word ""disturb"" may
be gained from the use of the words ""disorderly conduct"" in the
heading.

 

39.              The role of headings in statutory
construction has been thoroughly canvassed by Mr. Justice Estey in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357. Estey J. noted
that neither the Canadian, English, nor American jurisprudence expresses any
definite canon of construction applicable to statute headings.

 

40.              Estey J. states at p. 376:

 

                   The
question of the role of the heading in the interpretation of statutes appears
to be open.

 

He then continues, with reference to the Charter , at p. 377:

 

                   At a
minimum the heading must be examined and some attempt made to discern the
intent of the makers of the document from the language of the heading. It is at
best one step in the constitutional interpretation process. It is difficult to
foresee a situation where the heading will be of controlling importance. It is,
on the other hand, almost as difficult to contemplate a situation where the
heading could be cursorily rejected although, in some situations, such as, in
the case of ""Legal Rights"", which in the Charter  is at the
head of eight disparate sections, the heading will likely be seen as being only
an announcement of the obvious. 

 

41.              The principles stated by Estey J. with
reference to headings in constitutional provisions are equally applicable to
enactments of Parliament such as the Criminal Code . Kellock J. in Attorney‑General
of Canada v. Jackson, [1946] S.C.R. 489, in a concurring opinion on a point
not discussed by the majority, stated (at pp. 495‑96):

 

                   Where
the language of a section is ambiguous, the title and the headings of the
statute in which it is found may be resorted to to restrain or extend its
meaning as best suits the intention of the statute, but neither the title nor
the headings may be used to control the meaning of enacting words in themselves
clear and unambiguous.

 

It should be noted that the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
I‑23, refers only to marginal notes and preambles and therefore does not
preclude the use of headings as an aid for statutory construction (see ss. 12
and 13).

 

42.              In my opinion, reliance may be placed upon
the heading of ss. 169‑175 of the Code as an aid in interpreting
the word ""disturb"" in s. 172(3) . The heading supports the conclusion
that Parliament intended only to proscribe conduct which is either disorderly
in itself or productive of disorder.

 

43.              It is therefore my view that the trial
judge incorrectly interpreted the kind of conduct which is capable in law of
amounting to a disturbance of the order or solemnity of an assemblage of
persons met for religious worship. Applying the interpretation of the
subsection I have outlined above, there was clearly no evidence available to
the trial judge upon which the appellants could have been convicted.

 

Part VII‑‑The Constitutional
Questions

 

44.              Prior to the hearing of the appeal, the
late Chief Justice Laskin granted an order stating the following constitutional
questions for the purpose of serving notice upon the Attorney General of Canada
and upon the Attorneys General of the Provinces:

 

(a)  Is Section
172(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, as adopted by the Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal, in this decision, intra vires the Criminal Code 
of Canada? 

 

(b)  Was the subject
matter of the offence of which the Applicants were convicted, within the scope
of the criminal law power or was it in any event an offence known to law; and
did the decision constitute a breach of the Applicants rights as guaranteed
under Section 11 (g) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
(Constitution Act, 1982 )?

 

(c)  Did the Decision
infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms as declared in the Canadian
Bill of Rights; and did this infringement render Section 172(3)  of the Criminal
Code  of Canada inoperable?

 

(d)  Did the Decision
infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms as guaranteed under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 ); and did
this infringement render Section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada
inoperable?

 

45.              As Mr. Justice Beetz has recently noted in
Bisaillon v. Keable, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 60 at p. 71, this Court is not
bound to answer constitutional questions when it may dispose of the appeal
without doing so. In view of my conclusion that the appellants' conduct did not
violate s. 172(3)  when that section is properly interpreted, it is not
necessary to deal with the other constitutional issues this case may raise.

 

Part VIII‑‑Conclusion

 

46.              I would allow the appeal, quash the
convictions and acquit the appellants. I would order the restoration to the
appellants of the $150 awarded as costs to the Crown by Judge MacLellan. 

 

                   The reasons of Lamer and Wilson JJ. were delivered
by

 

47.              Wilson
J.‑‑The appellants were charged on informations dated June
30, l982 that on or about June 27, l982 they ""unlawfully at or near a
meeting of Religious Worship at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish did wilfully disturb
the order or solemnity of that Religious Worship and meeting, contrary to
section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada"". They were convicted on
August 18, 1982 in the Provincial Magistrate's Court and given suspended
sentences. An appeal was taken to the County Court and dismissed by His Honour
Judge R. F. MacLellan. A further appeal to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court,
Appellate Division, was likewise dismissed. Leave to appeal to this Court was
granted on April 27, 1983.

 

1. The Facts

 

48.              The appellants are Roman Catholics and for
many years have attended Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church in Stellarton, a
small town in Pictou County, Nova Scotia. In recent years the manner in which
communion is administered has been changed by the parish priests with the
approval of the Bishop. Members of the congregation must now stand to receive
communion rather than kneel as was the prior custom and, although the
parishioners are given a choice whether to accept the host in the hand or on
the tongue, they are not given a choice whether to stand or kneel.

 

49.              The appellants have opposed this change in
liturgy and have apparently been quite obstinate in their opposition. This
dispute between the appellants and the priests and other members of the
congregation had been going on for at least two years when, in an attempt to
end it, a directive was drawn up by the priest and his assistant and approved
by the Bishop of the Diocese. This directive made it clear that from then on
communicants were to stand for communion. The directive was made known to the
parishioners. 

 

50.              On the day of the offence under appeal the
directive was read before the commencement of mass and persons who were
unwilling to comply were instructed either to remain in their seats during
communion or to leave when communion was being served. The directive was read
again just before the parishioners were summoned to take communion. The
appellants proceeded to the front of the church along with the other
parishioners but, when they presented themselves to receive communion, they knelt.
They were informed that they were causing a disturbance and that they would not
receive communion in that position. They were instructed to return to their
seats and they did so.

 

51.              The evidence revealed that the acts of the
appellants, although peaceful in nature, upset the parish priest and his
assistant and upset some members of the congregation as well. There was some
suggestion also that the conduct of the appellants disturbed the order of the
service by slowing the progress of the lines of communicants. However, I think
it is fair to say that the principal disturbance was to the solemnity rather
than to the order of the service. This stemmed from the fact that the
appellants' defiance of the priest's directive caused a certain amount of
unease and tension on the part of other participants in the service. The
appellants' conduct did not, on the other hand, produce any overt reaction on
the part of other participants either in word or conduct.

 

52.              Several brief observations may be made
about these facts. The first is that reasonableness and a spirit of
accommodation do not appear to have been features of either side's conduct in
this liturgical dispute. The church has three aisles and, if traffic management
were the real reason for the liturgical change, one would have thought it
possible to accommodate those who wanted to kneel for communion by having them
use only one of the three aisles. On a perusal of the evidence one is left with
the suspicion that the contest of standing versus kneeling represents only the
tip of an iceberg in the dispute between the appellants and church authorities.


 

53.              This suspicion would appear to be
confirmed by the manner in which the informations were laid. The incidents in
question took place on June 27, 1982 and six informations were sworn out by one
Ken Francis of Stellarton on June 30, 1982. In his testimony at trial one of
the parishioners, Mr. Gregory MacDonald, testified that he had been asked to
observe the order of mass on the day in question. Mr. DiPersio gave a rather
evasive answer when he was asked whether he had been requested to take note of
the proceedings. While one cannot say so with certainty, it does appear that
the appellants' defiance of the directive was something that had been
anticipated and that some members of the congregation at least had hit upon the
idea of making use of s. 172  of the Criminal Code  before the incident in
question ever took place. If this is in fact the case, it lends some credence
to the appellants' contention that the essence of what is being done here is
the use of the Criminal Code  to sanction the appellants for their
obstinacy in refusing to obey the directive.

 

54.              At a more concrete level I think it is
important to note that the appellants' act of defiance of the priest's
directive was done deliberately with the knowledge that it would, or at least
was likely to, produce an adverse reaction in the priest, his assistant and
other members of the congregation. This seems to be the way in which the
Provincial Court Judge interpreted the concept of wilfulness in his factual
finding that the appellants' acts were wilful within the meaning of s. 172(3)
of the Code. On the other hand, I do not think that there is any finding
that the sole or primary intent of the appellants was to disturb the service.
At most the disturbing of the service was a natural and foreseeable consequence
of their conduct.

 

55.              Finally, I would make particular note of
the existence of concurrent findings of fact in the courts below on the issue
of whether or not the service was disturbed. The Provincial Court Judge
reviewed the evidence in some detail and I think it is implicit in his findings
that he found all the witnesses to be credible. After instructing himself on
the dictionary definition of ""disturb"" and ""disturbance"" he
found that the order and solemnity of the service had been disturbed. He made
particular reference to the existence of tension and anxiety as a result of the
appellants' acts and concluded that the spirituality of the service had been
impaired and that the priest and the people had been distracted. County Court
Judge MacLellan commended the trial judge on these findings. They were accepted
also in the Appellate Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court (1983), 4
C.C.C. (3d) 344, 32 C.R. (3d) 285, 57 N.S.R. (2d) 100, 120 A.P.R. 100. 

 

2. The Issues

 

56.              The issues in this case may be
conveniently addressed under two headings namely (1) statutory interpretation
and (2) constitutional aspects.

 

(1) Statutory interpretation

 

57.              The appellants rely on two general
propositions with respect to the interpretation of criminal statutes. They are:

 

(a) the subject is
entitled to rely on the strict words of the statute i.e. even if the
statute was arguably intended to prohibit the conduct engaged in by the
accused, if the conduct is not prohibited by the express words of the statute,
criminal liability will not ensue; and

 

(b) the subject is
entitled to argue that even though the conduct engaged in might be prohibited
by the express words of the statute, it does not fall within the spirit of the
enactment and the statute should be construed accordingly.

 

For these propositions the appellants rely upon the case of R. v.
Thompson (1913), 14, D.L.R. 175 (S.C. Alta.) The Crown does not appear to
contest these propositions and I think they are sufficiently well established
in our criminal law that no further authority need be cited in support of them.
The question is: how do they apply to s. 172(3)  of the Criminal Code ?

 

58.              Section 172 of the Code is one of a
group of seven sections, ss. 169 to 175, placed under the heading
""Disorderly Conduct"". The section in its entirety reads as follows: 

 

                   172. (1) Every one who

 

(a) by threats or
force, unlawfully obstructs or prevents or endeavours to obstruct or prevent a
clergyman or minister from celebrating divine service or performing any other
function in connection with his calling, or

 

(b) knowing that a
clergyman or minister is about to perform, is on his way to perform, or is
returning from the performance of any of the duties or functions mentioned in
paragraph (a)

 

(i) assaults or offers any
violence to him, or

 

(ii) arrests him upon a
civil process, or under the pretence of executing a civil process,

 

is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for two years.

 

                   (2)
Every one who wilfully disturbs or interrupts an assemblage of persons met for
religious worship or for a moral, social or benevolent purpose is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   (3)
Every one who, at or near a meeting referred to in subsection (2), wilfully
does anything that disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

For present purposes there are three elements to an offence under s.
172(3)  namely (i) wilfulness; (ii) doing ""anything""; and (iii)
disturbing the order or solemnity of a religious service. I propose to examine
each of these elements in turn.

 

(i) Wilfulness

 

59.              There are in this case concurrent findings
of fact in the courts below that the appellants' acts were wilful. These
findings do not, however, preclude this Court from allowing the appeal if the
courts below misdirected themselves as to the legal test for wilfulness under
the subsection.

 

60.              It might be argued that to constitute a
wilful disturbance the acts done by the appellants would have to have been done
for the specific purpose of causing a disturbance. There is no finding in the
courts below to this effect. Accordingly, if the element of wilfulness is
construed in this fashion the appellants' convictions could not stand. I do not
believe, however, that such a construction can be supported either in light of
s. 172(2) or in light of the authorities. The difference between s. 172(2)  and
s. 172(3)  is immediately apparent: in the former, the disturbance or
interruption of the assembly must be wilful; in the latter, only the act
which disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting need be wilful. It appears
to me, however, that wilfulness in the latter context must imply both
deliberation and knowledge that the act would, or was likely to, disturb the
service. Thus, as MacLellan Co. Ct. J. pointed out, s. 172(3)  cannot apply
to involuntary acts such as coughing or sneezing. Equally, in my view, the
subsection cannot apply to voluntary acts which are done in ignorance of the
fact that they are likely to disturb the service. Thus a person who was
ignorant of a particular religious custom could not be convicted for violation
of the custom even if this caused a disturbance unless he persisted in
violating the custom after he had been informed of the offensive nature of his
behaviour. In the present case the appellants' act satisfies both the test of
voluntariness and the test of knowledge of its likelihood to disturb the
service. In my view, therefore, the courts below quite properly interpreted the
section in this respect. 

 

61.              The authorities, such as they are, seem to
support this conclusion. In R. v. Gauthier (1905), 11 C.C.C. 263 (Que.
K.B.), the accused was a French Canadian Roman Catholic who interrupted a
Salvation Army meeting by addressing the other French Canadians and Roman
Catholics in the meeting hall and telling them that they ought to leave with
the result that the meeting was broken up. The accused argued that his
intention was not to break up the meeting but merely to withdraw from the
meeting those whom he thought were his co‑religionists and particularly
young people whom he feared might be subjected to violence if they stayed. Hall
J. had some doubts about this version of the facts but, even giving the accused
the benefit of the doubt, he found that he had disturbed the order and
solemnity of the meeting. Although this prosecution took place under s. 173 of
the 1892 Code and this provision was worded somewhat differently from
the present section, the element of wilfulness must, in my view, be construed
in the same way under s. 172(3) of the present Code.

 

(ii) Doing ""anything"" that disturbs

 

62.              Under s. 172(3) the accused must do
something that disturbs the service. His mere presence would not, it seems,
be sufficient even although this was disturbing to the meeting. On the other
hand the appellants here did something which the trial judge found
disturbed the service, namely kneeling to take communion contrary to express
instructions not to do so. The word ""anything"" is certainly
sufficiently broad on its face to cover these acts. Indeed, nothing could be
broader than ""anything"". On the other hand, as I have already
indicated, an accused is entitled to argue that the intendment of the Act is
narrower than the words construed in their ordinary sense might indicate. If the
entire context raises a doubt as to the meaning of the section the courts are
entitled to adopt a narrower construction more consonant with the purpose of
the statute.

 

63.              It seems to me that there are strong
policy reasons for concluding that passive or trivial acts are not encompassed
by the word ""anything"" as used in the section. I believe also that
the legislative history of s. 172(3) affords a basis for a narrower
construction of the word ""anything"".

 

64.              The Crown has conveniently set out the
legislative history of the section on pp. 6 and 7 of its factum and I reproduce
them here. The emphasis is my own. 

 

A.                An
Act Respecting Offences Against The Person S.C. 1869, c. 20, s. 37 (Note: a
similar provision was found in the English Statute Offences Against The
Person Act 1861, s. 36 (11 Halsbury 4th Ed. Para. 1010)):

 

37. Whosoever wilfully disturbs, interrupts, or disquiets any
assemblage of persons met for religious worship, or for any moral, social or
benevolent purpose, by profane discourse, by rude, or indecent behaviour, or
by making a noise, either within the place of such meeting or so near it as
to disturb the order or solemnity of the meeting, may be arrested on view by
any peace officer present at such meeting or by any other person present
thereto verbally authorized by any Justice of the Peace present thereat, and
detained until he can be brought before a Justice of the Peace; and such
offender shall, upon conviction thereof before a Justice of the Peace, on the
oath of one or more credible witnesses, forfeit and pay such sum of money, not
exceeding twenty dollars, as the said Justice may think fit, and costs, within
the period specified for the payment thereof, by the convicting Justice at the
time of the conviction‑‑and in default of payment, such Justice
shall issue his warrant to a constable to levy such fine and costs within a
time to be specified in the warrant, and if no sufficient distress can be
found, such Justice shall commit the offender to the common gaol of the
District, County or place wherein the offence was committed, for any term not
exceeding one month, unless the fine and costs be sooner paid.

 

B.                An
Act Respecting Offences Against Religion, R.S.C. 1886, c. 156, s. 2:

 

2. Every one who wilfully disturbs, interrupts or disquiets any
assemblage of persons met for religious worship, or for any moral, social or
benevolent purpose, by profane discourse, by rude or indecent behavior, or
by making a noise, either within the place of such meeting or so near it as
to disturb the order or solemnity of the meeting, is guilty of a misdemeanor
and liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding twenty dollars
and costs, and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
one month,‑‑and may be arrested on view by any peace officer
present at such meeting, or by any other person present, verbally authorized
thereto by any justice of the peace present thereat, and detained until he can
be brought before a justice of the peace. 32‑33 V., c. 20,
s. 37.

 

C.                Criminal
Code, S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 173:

 

173. Every one is guilty of an offence and liable, on summary conviction,
to a penalty not exceeding fifty dollars and costs, and in default of payment
to one month's imprisonment, who wilfully disturbs, interrupts or disquiets
any assemblage of persons met for religious worship, or for any moral, social
or benevolent purpose, by profane discourse, by rude or indecent behaviour,
or by making a noise, either within the place of such meeting or so near it
as to disturb the order or solemnity of the meeting. R.S.C., c. 156, s. 2.

 

D.                R.S.C.

E.                R.S.C.
1927, c. 36, s. 20l (Same as 1892, s. 173).

 

F.                S.C.
1953‑54, c. 51, s. 161(2) and (3):

 

                   s. 161(2) Every
one who wilfully disturbs or interrupts an assemblage of persons met for
religious worship or for a moral, social or benevolent purpose is guilty of an
offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

                   s. 161(3) Every
one who, at or near a meeting referred to in subsection (2), wilfully does
anything that disturbs the order or solemnity of the meeting is guilty of
an offence punishable on summary conviction.

 

G.                R.S.C.
1970, c. C‑34, s. 172(2) and (3) (Same as 1953‑54). 

 

65.              It is noteworthy that in legislation
dating from 1869 disturbance, interruption or disquiet of a religious assembly
was only punishable if it took place ""by profane discourse, by rude or
indecent behaviour, or by making a noise"". The Crown argues that the 1953‑54
amendment to the section, as part of a major revision to the Criminal Code ,
broadened the section and such restrictions are no longer applicable. This does
not, however, appear to have been Parliament's intention.

 

66.              It seems to me that all Parliament
intended to do in enacting s. 161(3) of the 1953‑54 Code was to
use general rather than specific words to cover the types of things which were
considered capable of disturbing the order or solemnity of a meeting. I do not
believe they were seeking to expand the scope of the provision to cover
peaceful acts of defiance of religious authority. I am reinforced in this view
by the fact that s. 161 of the 1953‑54 Code (like s. 172 of the
present Code) is one of a series of offences falling under the heading
""Disorderly Conduct"". I believe, therefore, that the word
""anything"" must be read down so as to extend only to things in the
nature of profane discourse, rude or indecent behaviour or making a noise.
Where, as in this case, the appellants' acts were peaceful and orderly I would
be reluctant to find that an offence had been committed even if the acts did
disturb the order or solemnity of the service to the minimal extent found by
the trial judge.

 

(iii)               Disturbance of the order or solemnity of a
meeting

 

67.              There has been a fair measure of judicial
debate as to the nature and extent of the disturbance which must be caused by
an accused charged under one of the ""Disorderly Conduct"" provisions
of the Criminal Code . By way of illustration s. 171 of the Code
which deals with causing a disturbance in a public place or a dwelling house
has been interpreted in New Brunswick as requiring some externally manifested
disturbance on the part of observers or passersby (R. v. C.D. (1973), 13
C.C.C. (2d) 206 (N.B.C.A.)), but has been perceived in Nova Scotia as requiring
only that the accused's act cause an emotional disturbance in the mind of
observers (R. v. Swinimer (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 432 (N.S.C.A.)). Given
that s. 171  is aimed at acts creating disturbances in public places or dwelling
houses without reference to any specific context in which the observer is
disturbed, the reasoning of Hughes C.J.N.B. in R. v. C.D., supra,
is probably correct in its assessment that in the absence of any actual
""activities in the nature of a disorder"" on the part of observers the
act cannot be said to be the type of disorderly conduct at which the provision
is aimed. Otherwise, anyone in any given situation would act at the risk of
causing some unmanifested emotional upset or ""disturbance"" to another
person. 

 

68.              When considering s. 172(3), however, this
reasoning does not appear to be appropriate. This subsection expressly provides
a context in which the disturbance takes place (i.e. a religious
service) and makes explicit the fact that the act may be offensive if it
disturbs the ""solemnity"" of the meeting. Thus, it is not confined, as
is s. 171, to the causing of an actual physical disturbance. Rather, the
disruption might well be to the emotional state of the observers or other
participants in the service since emotional upset would certainly serve to
break the solemn mood of a religious service. Accordingly, it would seem that
the reasoning pursued by Chief Justice Hughes in R. v. C.D., supra,
is not persuasive when applied to s. 172(3), as the two statutory contexts are
not analogous. Indeed, one might even say that the fact that s. 171 is
restricted in application to acts which cause, in the words of Hughes C.J.N.B.,
""... a tumult, an uproar, a commotion and any other disorder"", leads
one to the conclusion that s. 172(3) is not so restricted. By specifying that
the proscribed act is one which either disturbs the order or the
solemnity of a religious meeting, Parliament has made it clear that the offence
might either cause the same type of disruption in a religious place as that
described in s. 171 with regard to public places and dwelling houses or it
might cause a silent, emotional disturbance to the solemnity of the moment in a
way specific to religious services.

 

69.              As I have indicated above, MacEwan Prov.
Ct. J. made factual findings that both the order and the solemnity of the
service were disturbed by the appellants' actions. The disturbing of the order
flowed from the slowing down of the lines and the disturbing of the solemnity
from the upsetting and distracting effect of the appellants' conduct on the
priests and other worshippers. I have already referred to the minor delay in
the serving of the other communicants which occurred as a result of the
kneeling. The trial judge found that this disturbed the order of the service.
The disturbing of the solemnity of the service must presumably be assessed in
terms that are subjective, solemnity itself being in significant measure a
subjective concept. It seems to me that the trial judge's finding that the
solemnity and spirituality of the service were disturbed in the eyes of the
priest and parishioners cannot be contested. Since they are the persons whose
notions of solemnity are protected by the section it would seem to follow that
the courts below correctly focused on the question whether their sense of the
solemnity of the occasion had been disturbed. 

 

70.              However, accepting these findings of the
trial judge that the order and solemnity of the service were, as a factual
matter, disturbed, it does not in my opinion follow that the acts in question
are the type of acts prohibited by the section. I believe that this is a proper
case for the application of the principle relied on by the appellants, namely
that while their conduct falls within the strict wording of the subsection when
read in the broadest way possible in that it was conduct which disturbed the
order or solemnity of the service, it does not fall within the narrower meaning
intended by Parliament. I rely for this conclusion partly on the legislative
context and legislative history of the statutory provision as already discussed
but partly also on the factual context of the events.

 

71.              These appellants may have been violating a
new form of liturgical practice and flouting the authority of their Church.
They may be obstinate, insubordinate and disobedient parishioners but I find it
difficult to see them as criminals. I may say that I find it equally difficult
to see their fellow parishioners as informants instigating criminal proceedings
against them but such is the case.

 

72.              I have no doubt that the insistence of the
appellants in kneeling to receive communion, because it was an overt act of
disobedience and defiance of church authority, disturbed the solemnity of the
service and disturbed some of the worshippers as the learned trial judge found.
It is also clear, however, that their conduct was intended as a formal
expression of their convictions and not as a means of disrupting the service.
The physical disruption was negligible. They responded immediately and silently
to the priest's refusal of communion and instruction to return to their seats.
As for the disturbing of the worshipful atmosphere in the church, one might
well wonder, in light of the evidence of some of the witnesses and the fact
that the informations were laid so precipitously thereafter, just how worshipful
it was. But be that as it may, I do not believe that kneeling to receive
communion as a result of firmly‑held convictions is within the spirit of
s. 172(3) of the Code even if it is within its literal wording.

 

73.              I expressed the view earlier that there
were strong policy grounds for limiting the scope of the word
""anything"" in s. 172(3). I think such a limitation is required in
order to avoid a weakening of the authority of the criminal law by its application
to trifles. While it may be true that the only acceptable definition we can
give of a crime is an act which is prohibited by the legislature with penal
consequences, when the legislature employs language as broad as it has here, I
think it is open to the Court to refine it in light of what it perceives to be
the degree of public condemnation any impugned conduct would be likely to
attract. I believe also that an interpretation of ""anything"" which
would make the criminal law available as a tool for the enforcement of
liturgical practice or the settlement of liturgical disputes may represent an
extension of the arm of the law into areas which a substantial segment of the
public (although apparently not the informants) would find unacceptable. For
these policy reasons, therefore, as well as for reasons arising from the
legislative context and history of s. 172(3), I find that the conduct impugned
here is not caught by the subsection.  

 

(2) Constitutional aspects

 

74.              The constitutional aspects of this case
are reflected in the questions stated by the late Chief Justice Laskin:

 

a)                Is
Section 172(3) of the Criminal Code  of Canada, as adopted by the Nova
Scotia Court of Appeal, in this decision, intra vires the Criminal
Code  of Canada?

 

b)                Was
the subject matter of the offence of which the Applicants were convicted,
within the scope of the criminal law power or was it in any event an offence
known to law; and did the decision constitute a breach of the Applicants rights
as guaranteed under Section 11 (g) of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 )?

 

c)                Did
the Decision infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms, as declared
in the Canadian Bill of Rights; and did this infringement render Section
172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada inoperable?

 

d) Did the Decision
infringe the Applicants religious rights and freedoms as guaranteed under the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 ); and did this
infringement render Section 172(3)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada
inoperable?

 

Notice of these questions was given to the Attorney General of Canada
and to the Attorneys General of the Provinces. The Attorney General of Canada
chose to intervene and was heard in support of the submissions of the
respondent that s. 172(3)  was valid and enforceable criminal legislation and
that the appeal should be dismissed.

 

75.              I do not find it necessary to deal with
the questions raised under the Canadian Bill of Rights or the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  since I have already found that the word
""anything"" must be given a restricted interpretation and that, in
light of that restricted interpretation, the subsection does not apply to this
case. It may be appropriate, however, to say a brief word about question (a)
and the first part of (b) in order to highlight the important distinction that
needs to be made in this case between interpretation and constitutional
validity.  

 

76.              The argument of the appellants is that
certain acts are not criminal in nature and that the mere provision of penal
consequences for the doing of such acts does not render them criminal and thus
bring them within the legislative competence of Parliament under s. 91(27)  of the
Constitution Act, 1867 .

 

77.              For division of powers purposes it has
certainly been recognized that the mere labelling of something as criminal does
not entitle Parliament to assert legislative jurisdiction over it. As with all
questions of characterization for constitutional purposes it is a matter of
ascertaining the ""pith and substance"" of the legislation. However, it
seems to me that the Crown's submission that s. 172  is properly characterized
as criminal law is correct since in substance it is an enactment to prevent
breaches of the public peace and to enable citizens to conduct services of
worship without fear of disturbance.

 

78.              The appellants argue that they have been
convicted of the act of kneeling in church and that such an act is not capable
of being the subject of a criminal offence. I agree, however, with His Honour
Judge MacLellan that the actus reus here is not the act of kneeling but
doing so in a certain context i.e. where it was known that to do so
would disturb the solemnity of a religious service. Just as an act which is
guilty in one context may be quite innocent in another, so also an act which is
innocent in one context may be guilty in another. To use a simple example, it
may be an offence to use foul and abusive language in a courtroom but it may be
inoffensive to do the same thing in a noisy tavern or in the privacy of one's
own home. While it is, in my view, sound to interpret the Criminal Code 
in such a way that the appellants' conduct is not characterized as criminal, it
is a much more radical step to assert that the Criminal Code  could
not characterize the appellants' conduct as criminal where the result of
such conduct is to disturb the carrying on by their fellow parishioners of their
religious services. I would be hesitant, indeed, to accept such a submission.

 

79.              I would allow the appeal and quash the
convictions against the appellants on the ground that s. 172(3)  of the Criminal
Code  does not extend to the conduct alleged against the appellants. I would
order the restoration to the appellants of the $150 awarded as costs to the
Crown by His Honour Judge MacLellan. Otherwise I would make no order as to
costs. If it is necessary to make an order to this effect, I would order that
the criminal record of the appellants be expunged.

Verdicts upheld on appeal ‑‑ Whether or not error in upholding
verdicts incompatible and contradictory in fundamental reasons.

 

                   Mechanics’ liens ‑‑ Trustee ‑‑
Whether or not appellant trustee as defined by the Mechanics’ Lien Act.

 

                   Appellant was convicted of (1) fraud, (2) converting
with fraudulent intent trust funds, held for the benefit of workers and
suppliers and for which he was a trustee, to a use not authorized by the trust,
and (3) stealing funds exceeding two hundred dollars. The Court of Appeal
upheld the convictions. At issue here was (1) whether or not appellant was a
trustee within the definition of The Mechanics’ Lien Act, and
therefore, under the Criminal Code , and (2) whether or not the Court of
Appeal erred in law by upholding verdicts that were incomptible and contradictory
in their fundamental reasons.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed in part.

 

                   Appellant was not a trustee and the conviction of
breach of trust could not be supported on that basis. Although appellant needed
not be a trustee to commit the offence of breach of trust, the Crown, in that
it charged appellant with ""being a trustee"", undertook to prove that
averment. To find otherwise would mislead the accused, not as regards the
offence he committed, but as regards the actus reus the Crown was
undertaking to prove.

 

                   The other convictions stood. No conflict remained,
if any had existed, between the convictions for theft and fraud. The fraud was
committed and consummated prior to the commencement of the theft.

                   The following is the judgment delivered by 

 

1.                The
Court‑‑The appellant, Mr. Rosen, was indicted and convicted
in County Court in Ontario by Locke Co. Ct. J. of the following counts:

 

1. HERSHEY ROSEN stands
charged that he during the years 1974, 1975, 1976, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, and elsewhere in the
Province of Ontario, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defrauded
Benjamin Pape Associates Limited, Heller‑Natofin (Ontario) Limited, and
the Bank of Nova Scotia of property or funds or other valuable securities
having a value of $1,200,000.00 in money more or less, by representing that the
said property or funds or other valuable securities would be used for
construction of buildings, on Whiteoaks Boulevard and Marlborough Drive in
Oakville, Ontario, by Greater National Building Corporation, contrary to the
Criminal Code .

 

2. HERSHEY ROSEN stands
further charged that he during the years 1974, 1975 and 1976, at the
Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, and
elsewhere in the Province of Ontario being a trustee of funds for the use or
benefit of workmen and suppliers of materials to residential buildings being
constructed in Oakville, Ontario converted, with intent to defraud and in
violation of the trust, the said funds to a use that was not authorized by the
trust, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

3. HERSHEY ROSEN stands
further charged that he during the years 1974, 1975 and 1976, at the
Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York and
elsewhere in the Province of Ontario stole funds, the property of Greater
National Building Corporation, of a value exceeding two hundred dollars,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

2.                Mr. Rosen's appeal to the Ontario Court
of Appeal was dismissed. There were no reasons given. The appellant was granted
leave to this Court on the following two questions of law:

 

 

1.                Did
the Honourable Court of Appeal of Ontario err in law in holding that the
appellant was a trustee within the definition of trustee in the Mechanics' Lien
Act (R.S.O. 1970, c. 267, as amended by S.O. 1975, c. 43) and therefore under
the Criminal Code ?

 

2.                Did
the Honourable Court of Appeal of Ontario err in law by upholding verdicts that
are incompatible and self‑contradictory in their fundamental reasons?

 

3.                As regards the count of ""breach of
trust"", the respondent says the conviction should be upheld on the basis
that Rosen was ""a trustee"" or, alternatively, on the basis that he
was an ""aider and abettor"" to Greater National Building Corporation.
We are all of the view that Rosen was not a trustee, and the conviction cannot
be supported on that basis.

 

4.                However, the appellant needed not be a
trustee to commit the offence of breach of trust. By causing the trustee
company to breach its trust he, by the operation of s. 21 of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, could have committed the offence. But he
was not charged with that offence in that way, but with that of breach of
trust, ""being a trustee"". Having charged the appellant with
""being a trustee"", the Crown thereby undertook to prove that
averment.

 

5.                There is no doubt as to the soundness of
the proposition that an aider and abettor may be charged and convicted as a
principal. Mr. Rosen, charged with breach of trust could have stood convicted.
But if particulars are volunteered or ordered by the Court, they must be met.
To find otherwise is, in most cases and is in this case, to mislead an accused,
not as regards the offence he committed, but as regards the actus reus
the Crown is undertaking to prove. That conviction should therefore be quashed.

 

6.                The other convictions should stand as we
find no merit in the other points raised by the appellant. Indeed, there is no
conflict left, if any ever existed, between the convictions for theft and
fraud. The fraud was committed and consummated prior to the commencement of the
theft.

 

7.                The appeal is allowed in part, the
conviction for breach of trust is quashed and an acquittal on that count is
entered, but the appellant stands convicted of theft and fraud.

on appeal from the court of appeal for quebec

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Trial ‑‑
Function of judge ‑‑ Examination of witnesses ‑‑ Right
of judge to intervene ‑‑ Limits of right to intervene ‑‑
Doubt as to impartiality of judge ‑‑ New trial ordered.

 

                   Appellant was charged with extortion and convicted
by a judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace. At trial, the judge took an
active part in questioning the accused and another witness for the defence,
interrupting counsel and the witnesses on several occasions and asking many
questions himself. On appeal, appellant complained of the judge's conduct,
saying that he had been biased, and argued that he had not been able to make
full answer and defence. He further alleged that the trial judge had committed
errors of law and fact. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal and affirmed
the conviction. This appeal was based on essentially the same grounds.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Having regard to the evidence presented at the
trial, the conviction by the trial judge is not unreasonable and is not based
on an error of law or fact. The issue was essentially one of credibility and
the trial judge chose to believe the complainant. It is in the interests of
justice, however, that a new trial be held. Though the trial judge has a right,
and often a duty, if justice is in fact to be done, to question witnesses,
interrupt them and if necessary call them to order, he must do so within
certain limits and in such a way that justice is seen to be done. In the case
at bar, the trial judge went beyond the limits. By his many interventions and
questions during the testimony of the accused and of another defence witness,
the trial judge gave the impression of assisting counsel for the prosecution.
By his conduct the trial judge raised some doubt as to his impartiality, which
only a new trial can erase.

Facts

 

2.                Appellant and the complainant, Mrs.
Madeleine Lebel, have known each other since May 1977. They did business
together and were partners in two companies. On July 3, 1979, appellant visited
the complainant at her home and demanded the sum of $6,000 from her. According
to the complainant and one of her daughters, he threatened her. This led to a
charge of extortion, worded as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  At
Montréal, district of Montréal, on or about July 3, 1979, Jean Pierre
Brouillard, without reasonable justification or excuse, with intent to extort,
attempted to induce Madeleine Lebel by threats, accusations, or violence to do
something, to wit: to give him the sum of $6,000, thereby committing an
indictable offence under section 305(1)  of the Criminal Code .

 

Judgments

 

At Trial

 

3.                In an oral judgment the Sessions judge,
expressing certain reservations concerning the credibility of the accused and
of another defence witness, the complainant's other daughter, said that he
believed the complainant and her witnesses and was convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt.

 

4.                The relevant passages of his judgment
read as follows:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
So there was not only the mother who said she was threatened, there was another
witness, the girl, and I cannot doubt the girl's testimony, because she
testified honestly that she did not wish to get involved in these matters . . .

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
mother, her testimony . . . was corroborated by the testimony of the girl
Michèle . . .

 

                    As for
the other girl, there were contradictions in the answers she gave the Court . .
.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
testimony of Mr. Chatel, well, I'll tell you sincerely, it was evasive. He was
asked direct questions, and replied with a series of answers that had no
bearing on the questions he was asked. He tried to fabricate, that's the word,
fabricate, in any case, he tried to tell us all sorts of stories which, in my
opinion, don't stand up. 

 

5.                The judge's decision is thus clearly
based on the credibility he gave the witnesses.

 

On Appeal

 

6.                In the Court of Appeal the accused
Brouillard complained of errors of law and of fact on the part of the trial
judge and maintained that he should have been acquitted. He also complained of
the judge's conduct, saying that he had been biased, and argued that he had not
been able to make full answer and defence.

 

7.                The Court of Appeal's decision is
succinct:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
THE COURT, ruling on appellant's appeal from a judgment rendered by a judge of
the Court of Sessions of the Peace, district of Montréal, on January 29, 1981,
convicting him of attempted extortion;

 

                   After
reviewing the record, hearing argument and deliberating;

 

                   WHEREAS
even though this Court cannot sanction all the said judge's interventions
during the trial, it was not established before us that either through these
interventions or otherwise, appellant was deprived of his right to make full
answer and defence;

 

                   WHEREAS
it was not established either that the said judge erred in law or incorrectly
assessed the evidence;

 

                   WHEREAS
this Court should therefore not intervene in the said judgment;

 

                   DISMISSES
the appeal.

 

8.                Appellant relied on essentially the same
grounds of appeal in this Court. He also requested leave to present additional
evidence. We shall dispose of this request first.

 

9.                I have read the material submitted by
appellant and I am of the view that this evidence, which he sought to present
at trial as well, is not relevant to the case; consequently I would deny this
request.

 

10.              With regard to his allegations of errors
of law and of fact, I share the Court of Appeal's opinion and am of the view
that they are unfounded. The judge's conclusion is not unreasonable having
regard to all the evidence and is not based on an error of law in interpreting
the provision under which the accused was charged or an error respecting the
law of evidence or procedure. The issue was one of credibility and the judge
chose to believe the complainant. Had he entertained a reasonable doubt in
favour of the accused, a verdict of acquittal would not have been at all
unreasonable either.

 

11.              There remains the question of the judge's
conduct and alleged bias.

 

12.              The role of a trial judge is sometimes
very demanding, owing to the nature of the case and the conduct of the
litigants (parties). Like anyone, a judge may occasionally lose patience. He
may then step down from his judge's bench and assume the role of counsel. When
this happens, and, a fortiori, when this happens to the detriment
of an accused, it is important that a new trial be ordered, even when the
verdict of guilty is not unreasonable having regard to the evidence, and the
judge has not erred with respect to the law applicable to the case and has not
incorrectly assessed the facts. 

 

13.              The reason for this is well‑known.
It is one of the most fundamental principles of our case law, the best known
formulation of which is to be found in Lord Hewart's judgment in R. v.
Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy, [1924] 1 K.B. 256, at p. 259:

 

...[it] is of fundamental
importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and
undoubtedly be seen to be done.

 

14.              In the case at bar I am certainly not
convinced that the judge was biased. On the contrary, I am inclined to believe
that he meant to be impartial. I am thus of the view that the accused was not
prevented from presenting his defence, calling all relevant witnesses and
adducing all relevant evidence, although not without difficulty. However, I am
obliged to conclude that, by his conduct, the trial judge allowed there to be
some doubt on this subject, which only a new trial can erase. In this regard I
am, with respect, in complete disagreement with the Court of Appeal in that I
am not of the view that it is sufficient for justice to have been done to
dispose of this appeal.

 

15.              Before discussing the judge's conduct, we
should mention certain rules arising out of the principle put forward by Lord
Hewart, as well as their limits. This is not intended to be exhaustive. There
are numerous decisions and substantial legal opinion on the subject. It would
perhaps be sufficient to refer to the remarks of the late Chief Justice Fauteux
in Le livre du magistrat* (1980), which sets out the precepts that
should govern a judge's conduct.

 

*A separate English version, A Book for Judges (1980), was
written by the Hon. J. O. Wilson.

 

16.              We shall mention here his remarks that are
relevant to the case at bar.

 

17.              First of all, it is clear that judges are
no longer required to be as passive as they once were; to be what I call sphinx
judges. We now not only accept that a judge may intervene in the adversarial
debate, but also believe that it is sometimes essential for him to do so for
justice in fact to be done. Thus a judge may and sometimes must ask witnesses
questions, interrupt them in their testimony and if necessary call them to
order.

 

18.              One of the decisions most often cited in
support of this rule is Jones v. National Coal Board, [1957] 2
All E.R. 155 (C.A.) Lord Denning stated the following, at pp. 158‑59: 

 

                   No one
can doubt that the judge, in intervening as he did, was actuated by the best
motives. He was anxious to understand the details of this complicated case, and
asked questions to get them clear in his mind. He was anxious that the
witnesses should not be harassed unduly in cross‑examination, and
intervened to protect them when he thought necessary. He was anxious to
investigate all the various criticisms that had been made against the board,
and to see whether they were well founded or not. Hence he took them up himself
with the witnesses from time to time. He was anxious that the case should not
be dragged on too long, and intimated clearly when he thought that a point had
been sufficiently explored. All those are worthy motives on which judges daily
intervene in the conduct of cases and have done for centuries.

 

                   Nevertheless,
we are quite clear that the interventions, taken together, were far more than
they should have been. In the system of trial which we have evolved in this
country, the judge sits to hear and determine the issues raised by the parties,
not to conduct an investigation or examination on behalf of society at large,
as happens, we believe, in some foreign countries. Even in England, however, a
judge is not a mere umpire to answer the question ""How's that?"" His
object above all is to find out the truth, and to do justice according to the
law; . . .

 

19.              More recently, in Canada, in R. v.
Torbiak and Campbell (1974), 26 C.R.N.S. 108, which involved a problem
similar to the one in the case at bar, the Ontario Court of Appeal stated the
following, at pp. 109‑10:

 

                   The
proper conduct of a trial judge is circumscribed by two considerations. On the
one hand his position is one of great power and prestige which gives his every
word an especial significance. The position of established neutrality requires
that the trial judge should confine himself as much as possible to his own
responsibilities and leave to counsel and members of the jury their respective
functions. On the other hand his responsibility for the conduct of the trial
may well require him to ask questions which ought to be asked and have not been
asked on account of the failure of counsel, and so compel him to interject
himself into the examination of witnesses to a degree which he might not
otherwise choose.

 

                   Since
the limits of the allowable conduct are not absolute, but relative to the facts
and circumstances of the particular trial within which they are to be observed,
every alleged departure during a trial from the accepted standards of judicial
conduct must be examined with respect to its effect on the fairness of the
trial.

 

20.              Another illustration of the precept is to
be found in the remarks of Lord Greene, M.R., in Yuill v. Yuill, [1945]
1 All E.R. 183 (C.A.), at p. 185: 

 

It is, of course, always
proper for a judge‑‑and it is his duty‑‑to put
questions with a view to elucidating an obscure answer or when he thinks that
the witness has misunderstood a question put to him by counsel. If there are
matters which the judge considers have not been sufficiently cleared up or
questions which he himself thinks ought to have been put, he can, of course,
take steps to see that the deficiency is made good. It is, I think, generally
more convenient to do this when counsel has finished his questions or is
passing to a new subject. It must always be borne in mind that the judge does
not know what is in counsel's brief and has not the same facilities as counsel
for an effective examination‑in‑chief or cross‑examination.
In cross‑examination, for instance, experienced counsel will see just as
clearly as the judge that, for example, a particular question will be a crucial
one. But it is for counsel to decide at what stage he will put the question,
and the whole strength of the cross‑examination may be destroyed if the
judge, in his desire to get to what seems to him to be the crucial point,
himself intervenes and prematurely puts the question himself.

 

21.              Finally, I cite with approval the judgment
to which the respondent Crown referred us in R. v. Darlyn (1946), 88
C.C.C. 269, where Bird J.A. wrote the following on behalf of the British
Columbia Court of Appeal (at p. 277):

 

                    The
nature and extent of a Judge's participation in the examination of a witness is
no doubt a matter within his discretion, a discretion which must be exercised
judicially. I conceive it to be the function of the Judge to keep the scales of
justice in even balance between the Crown and the accused. There can be no
doubt in my opinion that a Judge has not only the right, but also the duty to
put questions to a witness in order to clarify an obscure answer or to resolve
possible misunderstanding of any question by a witness, even to remedy an
omission of counsel, by putting questions which the Judge thinks ought to have
been asked in order to bring out or explain relevant matters.

 

22.              In short, everyone agrees that a judge has
a right and, where necessary, a duty to ask questions, but also that there are
certain definite limits on this right. On this point respondent cited the
remarks of Humphreys J. in R. v. Bateman (1946), 31 Cr. App. R. 106,
where he stated:

 

                    Judges
are entitled, if they form the opinion that a witness is not trying to help
the Court, to do what counsel cannot do, and say: ""You behave yourself
and tell me the truth"". It is sometimes very useful to be able to say that.
Sometimes it pulls a witness together and makes him say what is the truth, but,
of course, it must not be done until the witness has given some indication that
he or she is not trying to tell the truth.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

23.              The judge may on occasion call to order a
witness who is obviously trying to avoid testifying, who ""is not trying to
help the Court"". In Bateman a witness said she was not able to
recall dates or times accurately. The appellate judges, at pp. 110‑11,
disapproved in the following terms, of the reprimand the Commissioner presiding
at the trial had given her: 

 

For some reason the
Commissioner, who was presiding at the trial, formed the opinion that the
witness could give much more satisfactory evidence if she liked, and he cross‑examined
her and treated her as if she were a thoroughly disreputable liar. It must not
be forgotten by those who preside at criminal trials that witnesses, whether
called for the prosecution or the defence, are entitled to be treated with
courtesy and politeness unless and until they show some symptom of refusing to
assist the Court by giving evidence promptly and properly. With all due respect
to the Commissioner, it is not the duty of any presiding Judge, as soon as a
witness says: ""I cannot tell you with accuracy what time something
happened"", to say: ""Oh, yes, you can. You be careful"", or
anything designed to force the witness to say something which she really cannot
say. The result was that when that cross‑examination was taken up to some
extent by counsel for the prosecution, this unfortunate woman was induced to
give about seven or eight different times as being very probably the times when
the appellant went there. Mr. Gordon, who appeared for the appellant, has told
us that in the result‑‑and this agrees with our own reading of the
transcript‑‑the witness showed herself to be the sort of women who,
if sufficiently badgered, would say anything. It means, not that the woman was
not trying to tell the truth, but that she was a person who could not fix times
and whose evidence was valueless.

 

It was only further on that they added the remarks cited by the Crown,
and then, by way of clarification, at pp. 111‑12:

 

The mere fact that a
witness cannot fix a time is no reason for treating her in that way, and why it
was thought necessary so to treat the witnesses in this case is a little
difficult to understand.

 

                   The
observations which were made in Gilson and Cohen (1944), 29 Cr. App. R.
174, at p. 181, in which the Court adopted the language of a previous decision,
Cain (1936), 25 Cr. App. R. 204, at p. 205, are apposite in this case.
The observations were to this effect: ""There is no question why the Judge
should not from time to time interpose such questions as seem to him fair and
proper. It was, however, undesirable that . . . the Judge should proceed,
without giving much opportunity to counsel for the defence to interpose, and
long before the time had arrived for cross‑examination, to cross‑examine
(the witness) with some severity. The Court agrees with the contention that
that was an unfortunate method of conducting the case. It is undesirable that
during an examination‑in‑chief the Judge should appear to be not so
much assisting the defence as throwing his weight on the side of the
prosecution by cross‑examining a prisoner."" We would adopt those
observations and apply them to any witness, whether called by the prosecution
or the defence.

 

The remarks of Humphreys J. were cited out of context, and the Bateman
decision as a whole seems somewhat contrary and even fatal to the Crown's
position. 

 

24.              Finally, prudence and the resulting
judicial restraint must be all the greater where the accused is a witness. He
must be allowed to proceed, within limits, of course, but always bearing in
mind that at the end of the day he is the only one who may be leaving the court
in handcuffs.

 

25.              In conclusion, although the judge may and
must intervene for justice to be done, he must nonetheless do so in such a way
that justice is seen to be done. It is all a question of manner.

 

26.              In the case at bar, the least that can be
said is that the judge was aware of his right to intervene. He asked the
witness Dominique Gauthier, the complainant's daughter and the accused's
girlfriend and witness, some sixty questions, almost as many as the Crown, and
interrupted her more than ten times during her testimony.

 

27.              During the accused's testimony the judge
asked many more questions than the two counsel. In fact during the examination‑in‑chief
he interrupted the examination being conducted by counsel for the defence
almost twenty times, and cross‑examined the accused. As a result he asked
the accused, still during the examination‑in‑chief, twice as many
questions as his own lawyer asked. Since his questions were more in the nature
of a cross‑examination, he thus clearly gave the impression of assisting
the Crown by doing precisely what he would have had to prevent the Crown from
doing if necessary. The accused was interrupted by the judge a total of over
sixty times in his answers in chief and in cross‑examination. Both the
accused and the witness Gauthier were the object of sarcastic remarks.

 

28.              By way of illustrating the general
situation, I quote:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
The Court:

 

Q.               Tell
the truth Miss, tell what happened in this case, that document, what was it
for, tell me the truth?

 

A.                Well
I've been telling the truth.

 

Q.               Stop
beating around the bush.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   No, no,
no but can I explain myself? 

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Ah!
explain yourself. You better have, I better have very good explanations.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Explain
that to me. You know, I understand, I'm not intelligent, I've never studied
law, I've never done any civil or whatever but in any case.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   If I
told you that on the first of August '79 . . .

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Ah!
tell me what you like but you need . . .

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   But you
are asking me questions.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   . . .
you need to have an explanation, and a good one this time.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   If I
told you that on the first of August '79, I didn't owe the company that sum of
money.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Ah! why
didn't you tell the company to go to hell?

 

                   The
Crown:

 

Q.               What
did you owe the company?

 

A.                Well
at that . . .

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   When I
don't owe anything, and a guy is trying to collect from me, do you know what I
do? I tell the guy: get three lawyers, ten lawyers, do what you like, but come
and collect from me if you can.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   That's
right.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Eh. You
you're a president . . .

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   That's
right.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   . . .
of marketing, you're a specialist in marketing and you write a letter to an
individual saying he's going to be arrested and then after that he'll pay. Come
on. Do you take me for an idiot? I'm not Mrs. Lebel. Just a minute. Do you take
me for an imbecile?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Not at
all. 

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   No. And
I'll tell you something. You'll be making a mistake if you take me for an
imbecile.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Not at
all.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Then
continue with your evidence, and you're under oath.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Yes,
yes. I know.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   And I'm
warning you, you're under oath.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Eh! . .
.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   You're
going to speak properly.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   I shall
file a document shortly.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   You can
file all the documents you like, but when you're asked questions, you'll answer
the questions. But don't take me for an idiot. That's not true. Because we're
more or less the same age, I've lived as long as you. But I wasn't a president
of marketing. I don't know for what company. In fact, at that time, I don't
know what company you were with, you're working for your brother.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   I said
. . .

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   You'll
tell the truth.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   I said
I was a marketing consultant.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   What I
want to know is the truth. I'll tell you something. Tell me the truth.

 

                   The
Crown:

 

                   It
would be much simpler for everyone. 

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   It's
simple, the truth.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   I'm
telling the truth. 

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Yes.

 

                   The
Crown:

 

                   Okay.
We'll continue.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   But I
don't believe you. So far. Change stories.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   One
thing's certain, if a guy owed me forty thousand bucks ($40,000.00), I wouldn't
lend him even six thousand (6,000); I don't know, I don't know.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   It's
based, my Lord, on Mrs. Lebel's instalments and on the conversation I had with
her, on July 3rd. I know, I was there.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Yes.
There were others who were there and they don't say the same thing as you.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   No, no,
the others weren't there at the time . . .

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   There
were two others who were there, and they don't say the same thing as you.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   And
then when I make out a cheque, or anyone intelligent here, you're more
intelligent than us because you're in marketing, you know that, when I make out
a personal cheque, I imagine I must know whether I'm the one paying or whether
it's someone else. You're being asked a clear and straightforward question. Did
you always make your payments to the company, what's it called?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Minico.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Minico?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Perhaps
. . .

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Was it
you or was it someone else who made the payments?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Well,
I'll answer that. 

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   That's
clear?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Well .
. .

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Yes or
no?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   But I
can't answer yes or no.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   No?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   No, no,
but I'll tell you why.

 

                   The
Crown:

 

                   These
are words he doesn't know.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   No.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Yes or
no?

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Well it
was done by both.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   Maybe
yes, maybe no. Yes, well, okay.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   There's
something I wonder about.

 

                   The
witness:

 

                   Because
I'm the one who had the contract.

 

                   The
Court:

 

                   How is
it that you weren't capable of making out a cheque?

 

29.              In my view it is clearly in the interests
of justice that a new trial be held.

 

30.              In conclusion I would like to reiterate
certain remarks I made at the beginning of my reasons. The task of a trial
judge is not always an easy one. In trials involving relatives or people who
have emotional ties, emotions run high and the judge's intervention is often
required more than is usual. The danger the judge then runs, even if he is the
best of judges, is that he will lose patience. Hence my sympathy (the
undersigned has also been a trial judge in difficult circumstances) for trial
judges in general and for the particular judge who presided over the Brouillard
trial. However, this in no way relaxes the rule that justice must be seen to
have been done. 

 

31.              I would therefore allow the appeal, set
aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal and order a new trial.

 

32.              Appellant is asking us to acquit him. In
support of this request he raised at the hearing the fact that he has already
served his probationary sentence. This is a factor which the judge presiding at
the new trial would surely wish to take into account, should it prove necessary
to decide on a sentence. It is also a factor which the Attorney General may
take into account in exercising his discretionary powers as a prosecutor. As I
have already mentioned, the verdict of guilty is not unreasonable, just as a verdict
of acquittal would not have been at all unreasonable. The issue is one of
credibility. This Court is intervening in this case only to order a new trial.
The new trial judge and the Attorney General are in the final analysis the only
ones, although in a different way, capable of taking this aspect of the
situation into account.

 

                   Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Cross‑examination ‑‑
Disagreement in Court of Appeal regarding the effect of accused’s improper
cross‑examination ‑‑ Cross‑examination not prejudicial
to accused ‑‑ No miscarriage of justice.

 

                   Appellants were charged with rape and tried jointly
by a judge sitting without a jury. In his testimony, Murphy contradicted the
evidence given by the complainant. Brown did not testify but a statement he
made to the police supported the evidence of his co‑accused. At trial,
the Crown conducted an overly‑aggressive cross‑examination of
Murphy which exceeded the limits of permissible cross‑examination. The
trial judge found both appellants guilty. His conclusion was based on findings
of credibility not on the impugned cross‑examination. On appeal, the
majority of the Court of Appeal did not find the cross‑examination
prejudicial to the appellants and dismissed their appeals acting on the power
contained in s. 613(1) (b)(ii) of the Criminal Code . The
dissenting judge took the view that it was prejudicial and that, in any event,
it was of such nature as to bring the system of justice into disrepute. Hence
this appeal.








 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed. 

 

                   Assuming that a disagreement as to the existence of
prejudice could amount to a question of law which would give jurisdiction to
this Court to entertain the appeal, the Court of Appeal made no error in
finding that the improper cross‑examination was not prejudicial to the
accused. As to the suggestion that in the absence of prejudice the appeal
should be allowed lest the system of justice be brought into disrepute, it is
evident that in dismissing the appeal the majority rejected any such suggestion
and they made no error in that respect.

a statement he made to the police supported the evidence of Murphy. The
complainant swore that shortly after midnight on July 30, 1979, when returning
to her apartment after making a telephone call at a nearby public telephone,
the appellant, Brown, followed her and forced his way into her apartment. He
was followed by Murphy who on entry locked the door behind him. Murphy seized
her, took her down the hall to a bedroom and had intercourse with her without
her consent. Later Brown entered the room and the performance was repeated. She
gave many details of the events that occurred which need not be repeated here.
Murphy, on the other hand, swore that the complain­ant invited him and Brown
into the apartment to wait until a friend arrived with some marijuana. He
admitted intercourse but said that it was with the complainant's consent and
cooperation. Brown denied intercourse. The principal issue then was one of
credibility.

 

3.                During the trial counsel for the Crown
conducted what might be termed an overly‑aggressive and improper cross‑examination
of Murphy. There can be no doubt that the cross‑examination in many ways
was objectionable and exceeded the limits which should bind Crown counsel in
cross‑examination. The trial judge did not restrict Crown counsel
sufficiently. In the Court of Appeal other grounds were advanced by the
appellants, but the sole ground upon which the court called for argument by the
Crown was the cross‑examination point. It was also the principal point
raised in this Court. 

 

4.                The trial judge on conflicting evidence
found that the appellants were guilty. In doing so he based his conclusion on
findings of credibility. He believed the complainant and he disbelieved the
appellants. In his reasons for judgment he reviewed her evidence. He recognized
certain inconsistencies in her testimony, and he noted as well corroborative
facts which supported it. He found significant corroboration of her evidence in
the medical testimony which included observations by the examining physician of
abrasions upon her back that were consistent with her account of events. He
weighed and balanced her evidence against that of the appellants and made his
finding of credibility upon that comparison. There was evidence before him upon
which he could reach his conclusion, and it is evident from his reasons that he
did not base his conclusion on the impugned cross‑examination but upon
the conflicting evidence which was before him and after considering the various
factors which ought to affect the approach of a trial judge to a case where the
conviction will depend essentially upon the evidence of one person.

 

5.                The majority of the Court of Appeal
expressed disapproval of the cross‑examination, but they did not find it
prejudiced the appellants. In dismissing the appeal, they were, of course,
acting on the powers contained in s. 613(1) (b)(ii). This means that they
decided that the appeal could not be allowed on any grounds set out in s.
613(1) (a). In other words, they concluded that the appeal could not
succeed on the ground that the conviction was unreasonable or could not be
supported on the evidence; that the trial judgment should not be set aside on
the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law; and that there was no
miscarriage of justice. Harradence J.A., in dissent, agreed that the cross‑examination
was improper. He considered, however, that prejudice had been caused to the
appellants and that, even if it had not resulted in prejudice, it was of such
nature that it would bring the system of justice into disrepute. He concluded
that the prejudice resulted in a miscarriage of justice.

 

6.                It will be seen that the only difference
between the majority and the minority in the Court of Appeal turns on the
effect of the cross‑examination. The majority takes the view that it was
not prejudicial to the appellant and is not a ground upon which the appeal
should be allowed. The dissenting judge takes the view that it was prejudicial
and should have been effective to allow the appeal and that, in any event, it
was of such nature as to bring the system of justice into disrepute. Assuming,
without deciding, that a disagreement as to the existence of prejudice could
amount to a question of law which would give jurisdiction to this Court to
entertain the appeal, it is my opinion that the majority of the Court of Appeal
made no error. As to the suggestion that in the absence of prejudice the appeal
should be allowed lest the system of justice be brought into disrepute, it is
evident that in dismissing the appeal the majority rejected any such suggestion
and, in my view, they made no error in that respect.

 

7.                I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

                   Appellants, Coast Salish Indians, were charged with
hunting deer out of season contrary to the British Columbia Wildlife Act.
The deer had been killed for use in an ancient religious ceremony involving the
burning of raw deer meat. Appellants were convicted at trial and their appeals,
first to the County Court and then to the Court of Appeal, were dismissed. At
issue is whether or not the Wildlife Act was inapplicable in that it
interfered with appellants' freedom of religion, and with their aboriginal
religion or hunting as a way of life such that it regulated appellants qua
Indians. The incident occurred before the proclamation of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms .

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The prohibition of killing deer by the Wildlife
Act raised no question as to freedom of religion or the practice of an
aboriginal religion. Killing the deer itself formed no part of the ceremony and
no evidence supported the contention that it was sacrilegious to use other than
fresh meat. The intention that the raw deer meat be used for burning in this
religious ceremony was the ""motive"", and as such, was irrelevant to
legal responsibility for the commission of the offence, notwithstanding the bona
fides of the motive itself. The argument that hunting went to the root of
Indian culture and that the prohibition against hunting was therefore
inapplicable in that it regulated Indians qua Indians should be
dismissed for reasons given in Dick v. The Queen.

II‑‑The Facts

 

4.                For the most part, the facts are not in
dispute. They can be read in the judgments of the courts below, all of which
have now been reported.

 

5.                At pages 30‑31, Taggart J.A. thus
begun the recital of the facts:

 

                   The
appellants are both members of the Tsartlip Band of Indians and live on the
Tsartlip Indian Reserve in Saanich, British Columbia. The Tsartlip Band is one
of the bands making up the Coast Salish people. Elizabeth Jack is the wife of
the appellant Anderson Jack and the sister of the appellant George Louie
Charlie. She was present when her brother shot a deer on Pender Island at a
place which is not within an Indian reserve. Anderson Jack helped George Louie
Charlie load the dead deer into the trunk of their car. The three then drove to
the place where they had been staying on Pender Island and there cleaned and
dressed the deer. Later as they were driving to the ferry which would take them
to Saanich they were stopped by police officers who found the deer carcass in
the trunk of the car.

 

6.                At page 341, the trial judge said:

 

The two accused testified
they had committed the act in order to help Elizabeth Jack obtain raw deer meat
for a burning ceremony for her great‑grandfather.

 

7.                At page 27, the County Court judge
wrote:

 

They freely admitted to
the killing and possession; their plea before the provincial court, and here,
is one of confession and avoidance. The deer, they contend (and the evidence on
this point is accepted in its entirety by the Crown) was killed in preparation
for a religious ceremony, in which the meat thereof would be burned to satisfy
the requirements of an ancestor by means of a sort of reverse
transubstantiation.

 

8.                The religious ceremony and its meaning
were described by several defence witnesses. Here is what Taggart J.A. wrote
about this at pp. 31‑32:

 

                   The
religious ceremony was described by witnesses who were members of the Tsartlip
Band and by Dr. Barbara Lane. Dr. Lane is an anthropologist who since 1948 has
studied the Coast Salish people and especially their religious beliefs and
practices. She said that the Coast Salish people were believed to have lived in
British Columbia for about 20,000 years. The Coast Salish believe that members
of their people who die do not go to another world but that their spirits
remain close to where they lived. The belief is that the spirits have the same
kinds of needs and desires as living people. Dr. Lane explained the belief in
this way:

 

They become lonely and
want to visit their relatives, they become hungry and want to have the kind of
foods that they had before, and they have desires for other things that they've
left behind here, and they transmit these desires to their close relatives
through dreams and other kinds of experiences, and these needs are satisfied
and the desires of the deceased relatives are met by the living providing to
them the things that they request.

 

                                                                    ...

 

As I was attempting to
suggest earlier, the entire world view of Coast Salish Indian people is quite
different from that which those of us who are raised in the Judaeo‑Christian
tradition have. Coast Salish Indian people perceive of the world as an
intimately inter‑related phenomenon in which the living and the dead
animals and humans, all things are intimately connected and belong together in
this place and do not leave it. And the function of burning food for the dead
is to carry on the mutual responsibilities and respect that Indian people here
try to accord to all of the other parts of the world as they see it. One of the
things that always seems to be incomprehensible to Indian people is how the
rest of us can pick ourselves up from one part of the world and move to another
and abandon and cut themselves off from our dead relatives because they
perceive of themselves as being in continuous association with and having
ongoing responsibilities to the dead.

 

                   Dr.
Lane described the practice of serving the spirits of the dead by burning food.

 

A.                Well, this is a very ancient traditional
practice among all Coast Salish people and the essence of the ceremony is to
provide food for deceased relatives by burning it and the essence of the food,
as I understand it, is transmitted through the smoke to the essence of the
deceased person.

 

                   Dr.
Lane said that the practice of burning food for the dead had been described in
articles by other anthropologists who had studied the practices of the Coast
Salish people.

 

                   The
religious practices described by Dr. Lane were also spoken of by elders of the
Tsartlip Band and by the appellants and Elizabeth Jack. The latter said she had
been visited by the spirit of her great grandfather who had asked that she burn
raw meat for him. She sought the assistance of her husband and her brother to
obtain raw deer meat for the burning ceremony.

 

9.                There can be no doubt about the
sincerity of the appellants' religious beliefs. Here is what the trial judge
held on this subject, at pp. 339 and 341:

 

That evidence was
interesting, revealing the religious beliefs and practices of the Coast Salish
Indians and of the Saanich people, part of the Coast Salish tribe or culture,
to which people the two accused and Mrs. Elizabeth Jack belong, as well as the
witnesses for the defence Louie Charlie, David Elliott, Tom Sampson, Samuel Sam,
Louie Charlie and Philip Paul. I should also say at the outset that I believe
the defence is put forward sincerely by these people and that they are, so far
as appears, quite law abiding persons who committed the act rather fearfully,
but apparently in the bona fide effort to obtain deer meat for a
religious ceremony. The impression I obtained from the evidence was that they
were fearful of breaking this law, because they are law abiding persons
usually.

 

                                                                    ...

 

I must say, also, that I
found the elders of the Saanich people impressive. Some of those who spoke in
English are very articulate, although they are naturally inclined to use few
words, but ingenuously poetic in a manner which obviously springs from deep
sincerity.

 

III‑‑The Defences Offered by the Appellants

 

10.              The submissions made by counsel for the
appellants to this Court appear to have been substantially the same as those
made to the courts below. They can be summarized in three propositions:

 

1. The Wildlife
Act interferes with the appellants' freedom of religion and ought to be
read down so as not to apply to them in the circumstances of this case.

 

2. In interfering
with aboriginal religion, the Wildlife Act goes to the root of
Indianness, and purports to regulate the appellants qua Indians; it
accordingly should be held inapplicable to them.

 

3. Apart from
religion, hunting is at the root of the culture and way of life of the Coast
Saalish people so that its prohibition attains the appellants qua
Indians and ought to be held inapplicable to them.

 

11.              I must observe however that the reading of
the reasons given by the courts below does not clearly disclose whether the
third proposition was advanced there as distinct from the second one.

 

12.              More should be also said about the legal
basis relied upon for the freedom of religion invoked in the first proposition.

 

13.              This basis is not a statutory one such as
the Freedom of Worship Act, R.S.Q. 1941, c. 307, referred to in Saumur
v. City of Quebec, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 299, and in Chabot v. Commissaires
d'écoles de Lamorandière, [1957] Que. Q.B. 707, 12 D.L.R. (2d) 796; there
was no such statutory provision relating to the freedom of worship or religion
in force in British Columbia at the time the offence was committed.

 

14.              This basis is not either a paramount
constitutional or quasi‑constitutional instrument. The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  had not been enacted at the time the offence
was committed. As for the Canadian Bill of Rights, counsel for the
appellants expressly declined to rely upon it on the ground that it applied
only to federal legislation whereas the Wildlife Act was a provincial
statute. The trial judge alludes to this at p. 342 of his reasons. Neither
before the trial judge, nor before the other courts below, nor before this Court
was it considered whether the Canadian Bill of Rights might govern the Wildlife
Act if the latter Act applied to Indians not ex proprio vigore but
by referential adoption under s. 88 of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑6.

 

15.              The legal basis relied upon for the
freedom of religion invoked by the appellants, as I understand it, is a
fundamental principle of law, recognized by judges such as Rand and Kellock JJ.
in the Saumur case, supra, of the same nature as the freedom of
the press also recognized by this Court in the Reference re Accurate News
and Information Act, [1938] S.C.R. 100, and in Gay Alliance Toward
Equality v. Vancouver Sun, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 435. This fundamental freedom,
while not absolute and subject to some legal restrictions, possesses, it is
claimed, a degree of paramountcy over or exempting force from provincial law of
general application, provided certain conditions are satisfied in what is
called a balancing test. Here is how counsel for the appellants express themselves
on this point in their factum:

 

That in construing the
application of a valid Provincial law of general application against a
fundamental freedom, the Courts should apply a balancing test. The balancing
test may be stated as follows: where the religious belief is held to be in good
faith, and where the conduct is held to be justified to the practice of the
religion, and where no compelling state interest is found to justify the
curtailment of the religious practice, the general legislation must be applied
so as to preserve the fundamental freedom. 

 

16.              It will readily be seen that this
balancing test resembles closely the one which would be required if s. 1  of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms  were applicable. In their
factum, counsel for the appellants concede that there is no direct authority
for their submission but argue that, even prior to the coming into force of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the balancing test has been used
implicitly as the framework for analysis in some cases which need not be
reviewed in these reasons, given the view I take of the case at bar.

 

IV‑‑The Judgment of the Courts Below

 

17.              The trial judge reviewed and distinguished
the authorities relied upon by counsel for the appellants. Then at page 343 he
wrote:

 

It was suggested
that...the Wildlife Act here could not prohibit the free exercise of
one's religious practices, but as I shall say I do not think their religious
practices are interferred with or prohibited.

 

18.              At pages 344‑45, he relied upon the
decision of this Court in Kruger v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 104, and
thereafter made what in my opinion are crucial findings:

 

In Kruger and Manuel v.
The Queen (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 377, 75 D.L.R. (3d) 434, [1978] 1 S.C.R.
104, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the very statute which is said to
have been breached here, and decided unanimously that it was a statute of
general application and a valid enactment, having as its object the
conservation and management of provincial wildlife resources and that the
accused, who were Indians, were subject to its provisions so long as the Act,
in its policy, did not seek to impair the status and capacities of the accused as
Indians. It is here contended that the effect of the provision which is
sought by the Crown to be enforced is to impair the status of the accused as
Indians by preventing them from exercising their bona fide religious
practices. I am unable to accept that contention .... If Indians wish to
exercise their historic religious practices there are ways within the bounds of
the provincial statute in which to exercise those religious practices. They
can, for example, retain a supply of deer meat in storage for such purposes.
Section 9 [rep. & sub. 1971, c. 69, s. 9] of the Wildlife Act makes
provision for that. The purpose of the Act is what matters. This Act has been
held to be and is, clearly, I think, of general application and was certainly
not aimed at preventing the Coast Salish from exercising any religious
practice, and the act of burning food as an offering to the spirit of an
ancestor is not prohibited. If it is exercised within the limits of the general
law it may be freely carried out by the Saanich people.

 

19.              In appeal, the County Court judge
distinguished between religious belief and religious practices and said he was
concerned with the latter. At page 28 he wrote:

 

It is safe to say, I
think, that generally speaking a practice arising from a sincerely held
religious belief may be restrained if it is a breach of the peace, or
interferes with public or private rights or otherwise amounts to an illegal
act.

 

20.              He turned to the question of the impact of
the Wildlife Act upon the status and capacity of the appellants. He
quoted a passage of the Kruger case in this Court and, at p. 30,
concluded as follows:

 

                   There
was no evidence before the learned judge from which it could be inferred that
the Wildlife Act was directed against native persons in any unfair or
discriminatory way. There was no evidence of a legislative policy, expressed in
the Wildlife Act, to impair the native status and capacity of the
appellants as ""Indians"", nor can it be said that the effect of the
Act is to do so.

 

21.              In the British Columbia Court of Appeal,
Taggart and Craig JJ.A. both referred to the adoption by this Court, in Robertson
and Rosetanni v. The Queen, [1963] S.C.R. 651, of a statement by
Frankfurter J. in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette,
319 U.S. 624 (1943), at p. 653:

 

                   The
constitutional protection of religious freedom terminated disabilities, it did
not create new privileges. It gave religious equality, civil immunity. Its
essence is freedom from conformity to religious dogma, not freedom from
conformity to law because of religious dogma.

 

22.              Both justices of appeal held, in effect,
as Taggart J.A. put it at p. 35, that

 

... freedom of religion
must be exercised within the limits permitted by validly enacted legislation.

 

23.              On the issue of the impact of the Wildlife
Act on the status and capacity of the appellants, Taggart J.A. quoted a
passage of Dickson J., as he then was, in the Kruger case, emphasizing
certain parts and then concluded, at p. 37:

 

                   I have
added the emphasis because in my opinion, in order to succeed on this second
argument the appellants must show that the policy of the Act is to impair the
capacity of Indians to practise their religion. It is conceded that the Act
does not affect the status of Indians. In my opinion, there is no evidence
before us of a legislative policy to impair the capacity of Indians in the
manner contended for by the appellants. That being the case the second argument
fails.

 

24.              Craig J.A. held that this second argument
did not raise a question of law alone and he would have refused leave to appeal
on this issue.

 

25.              Hutcheon J.A. dissented on the merits of
the main issue. Essentially, he accepted the submission made on behalf of the
appellants with respect to a balancing test which he concluded resolved the
case in favour of the appellants. He wrote, at p. 41:

 

The issue in this case is
whether Anderson Jack and George Louie Charlie were guilty of an offence when
they hunted and killed deer out of season. The hunting and killing was a part
of a religious ritual of the Coast Salish people of 20,000 years' duration. The
ritual is not harmful to society, is not opposed to the common good and is not
in violation of the rights of any other individual. I have concluded that they
were not guilty of an offence and that this appeal should be allowed. The law
is aimed at wildlife conservation. There is no suggestion that the loss of one
deer for the purpose of the ritual would impair the legislative purpose. I
think that the freedom of religion of Jack and Charlie ought not to be taken
away by the application of an enactment of general application in the absence
of evidence of some compelling justification.

 

26.              And then, at p. 42:

 

The question that concerns
me is whether a religious practice is to be prohibited by an Act of general
application. More precisely, it is whether Jack and Charlie are guilty of an
offence because they took part in a centuries‑old religious ritual that
harmed no person.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   Thus,
we have a law that is not directed in any way at religion. According to the
Crown it has the effect of prohibiting a religious practice that has been
followed by the Coast Salish people for 20,000 years‑‑a religious
practice affecting only those involved in its exercise and one not touching
issues of public well‑being or morals.

 

27.              He then distinguished two cases, R. v.
Harrold (1971), 3 C.C.C. (2d) 387, and R. v. Beales (unreported,
decision No. 760‑71, November 1, 1971 (B.C.C.A.)), relied upon by the
Crown. At page 44, he analogized the situation of the case at bar to the
drinking of wine for sacramental purposes: 

 

                   In my
opinion, neither the Harrold case nor the Beales case support the
broad proposition put forward by Mr. Lang. Taken to its logical conclusion such
a view may require the conviction of a minister of religion who drinks British
Columbian wine for sacramental purposes in a public building such as a church.
I find no exemption in the Liquor Control and Licensing Act, R.S.B.C.
1979, c. 237, for that religious practice.

 

28.              Hutcheon J.A. then proceeded to his
conclusions:

 

                   There
is, however, high authority for the reading down of a statute to preserve a
fundamental freedom. In Gay Alliance Toward Equality v. Vancouver Sun
(1979), 97 D.L.R. (3d) 577, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 435, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 118, the
Supreme Court of Canada by its majority read s. 3 of the Human Rights Code:

 

3(1) No person shall

 

(a)               deny
to any person ... any ... service,

 

(b)               ...
customarily available to the public,

 

so as to acknowledge the
right of a newspaper to refuse to publish material that was contrary to the
views of the newspaper. This was done to preserve an essential ingredient of
freedom of the press.

 

                   In my
opinion, the Wildlife Act ought to be read so as to acknowledge the
right to Jack and Charlie on these facts to practise their religion where no
competing interest of society exists.

 

                   I would
grant leave to appeal and allow the appeals.

 

V‑‑The Submissions of the Crown

 

29.              The reasons I said earlier I did not feel
it was necessary to review the authorities relied upon by the appellants is
that they fail to answer two submissions made by the Crown which are fatal to
the position of the appellants and which, in my view, are clearly well founded.
These two submissions may have been made in this Court for the first time,
since they are not discussed in the reasons of the courts below; and they may have
been made in response to the reasons of the dissenting justice of appeal.

 

30.              The fundamental issue in this case, says
the Crown, is ""whether hunting by Indians for the propitiation of the dead
enjoys higher constitutional protection than hunting for the sustenance of the
living"". If it does not, then the judgment of this Court in the Kruger
case is indistinguishable and conclusive. It was decided in that case that
Indians hunting for food had no constitutional defence to a charge under s.
4(1)(c) of the Wildlife Act‑‑hunting in close season‑‑the
very section at issue in the case at bar.

 

31.              The Crown submits that, for two reasons,
the Kruger case cannot be distinguished on the basis that s. 4(1)(c)
of the Wildlife Act interferes with the appellants' freedom of religion.
The two reasons are that:

 

(a)               the hunting itself was not a religious practice;

 

(b) the intended use
of the deer meat in a religious ceremony amounts merely to ""motive""
and is therefore irrelevant to legal culpability. 

 

32.              In my opinion, which I express with the
greatest of respect, the learned dissenting judge erred in stating [at p. 41]
that ""The hunting and killing was a part of a religious ritual"". And
the appellants' counsel are also in error in writing in their factum that there
was an undisputed and unchallenged finding of fact to that effect at trial.
There is no such finding in the reasons of the trial judge. In fact he
expressly found that the Wildlife Act did not interfere with or prohibit
appellants' religious practices which could be carried out with deer meat
retained in storage and he referred to a section of the Wildlife Act
which makes provision for that. The trial judge wrote at p. 345 that

 

... the fact that the deer
was killed to obtain deer meat for use in a religious ceremony, as here, is no
defence.

 

33.              This was confirmed in appeal by the County
Court judge who, in the above quoted passage, at p. 27, accepted appellants'
contention, unchallenged by the Crown, that the deer had been killed ""in
preparation for a religious ceremony"". There is no suggestion that the
deer was killed as part of the ceremony.

 

34.              These conclusions are entirely consistent
with the evidence which is detailed and precise in the description of the
ceremony itself but bare and perfunctory in the description of the killing.

 

35.              There was some evidence that the type of
food to be burned was of significance and that raw deer meat was required in
this case but no evidence as to the circumstances or methods of obtaining it,
except by theft, which would render the meat unsuitable. There was no evidence
that the use of defrosted raw deer meat was sacrilegious as is alleged in
appellants' factum. There was evidence that the food had to be disposed in
several plates to provide for the guests of the honoured spirit, that the
shaman presiding over the ceremony pronounced a name over each plate, that
attendants had to remain at a certain distance from the fire, that cedar wood
was preferred for the burning.

 

36.              By contrast, there was no evidence that
the killing of the deer was part of the religious ceremony. Mrs. Jack had
previously hired two men to get her a deer. Since they failed to do so, she
asked her husband and her brother for assistance. When the three of them saw
the deer, her brother came out of the car and shot the deer five or six times
with an automatic rifle. If he had shot two deer on the same spot, in the same
manner, at the same time, one deer for a burning and one for food, there is no
indication that any one of them was more suitable for one purpose than for the
other.

 

37.              As to the analogy drawn by the dissenting
justice of appeal with the drinking of wine for sacramental purposes, here is
what the Crown has to say in its factum:

 

                   The
offence in question relates to the circumstances of obtaining meat for the
ceremony, not the conduct of the ceremony itself, hence the analogy of a
clergyman committing an offence under the Liquor Act by conducting the
sacrament of Holy Communion, drawn by Hutcheon, J.A. in the Court of Appeal (in
dissenting reasons relied upon by the Appellants) is inapt.

 

                   The Wildlife
Act does not in any way prohibit or regulate the burning ceremony, it
regulates the killing of deer, meat from which may be used for such a ceremony.

 

                   To draw
the parallel analogy, the obtaining of wine for sacramental purposes is not
part of the sacrament of Holy Communion, and regulation of the sale of wine
does not, therefore, prohibit the exercise of that religious ceremony. Such regulation
cannot, therefore, be said to affect religious freedom.

 

                   No
clergyman could raise a defence based on religious freedom, to a charge of
obtaining wine illegally while liquor stores were closed, simply because it was
intended to use the wine for the sacrament of Holy Communion. Similarly a
defence based on ""freedom of religion"" must fail the Appellants in
this case, where the charge is killing a deer in the closed season. Since
killing the deer is not, in itself, ceremonial, the actus reus of the offence
cannot be regarded as a religious observance. If it is not such an observance,
then logically, its prohibition by the Wildlife Act raises no question
of religious freedom.

 

38.              I agree with this statement and with its
conclusion that the prohibition of deer killing by the Wildlife Act
raises no question of religious freedom.

 

39.              It follows that appellants' main defence,
relating to freedom of religion, as well as their second defence, relating to
aboriginal religion, are without substance and must be dismissed.

 

40.              In addition, I find no error in the
Crown's second submission which is presented as follows in its factum:

 

                   The
intention of the Appellants that the deer meat be used for the burning ceremony
was their ""ulterior intention"" or ""motive"". As such, it is
irrelevant to legal responsibility for the commission of the offence: Lewis
v. The Queen, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 821, at 833.

 

                   This
can be illustrated as follows: if the two men hired by Mrs. Jack to ""get
[her] a deer"" had killed a deer without knowledge of Mrs. Jack's intended
use of it, the defence raised by the Appellants would be unavailable to them,
even if the deer had actually been ceremonially burned. The ultimate, actual or
intended ""end"" of killing the deer is ulterior to the mens rea
of the offence, and is therefore irrelevant.

 

                   Since
the ""ulterior intention"" of the Appellants is irrelevant as an
element of the offence, the fact it is based on a religious belief, however bona
fide, must logically be irrelevant as well, and can therefore provide no
basis for the defence advanced by the Appellants.

 

VI‑‑The Third Defence Offered by the Appellants

 

41.              That defence to the effect that, apart
from religion, hunting is at the root of the culture and way of life of the
Coast Salish people so that its prohibition attains the appellants qua
Indians is indistinguishable from the defence dismissed in Dick v. The Queen
[[1985] 2 S.C.R. 309], in which judgment is being delivered today. It should
accordingly be dismissed for the same reasons in the case at bar.

 

VII‑‑Conclusions

 

42.              I would dismiss the appeal and make no
order as to costs.

                   Appellant, a non‑treaty Indian member of the
Alkali Lake Band, was charged with the killing of a deer out of season without
being the holder of a permit, contrary to s. 3(1) of the British Columbia Wildlife
Act. Appellant killed the deer for food on the traditional hunting grounds
of the Alkali Lake Band outside the reserve. Appellant was convicted and his
appeals to the County Court and the Court of Appeal were dismissed. This appeal
raises several issues: (1) whether the Wildlife Act impairs the status
and capacity of Indians, an invasion of the federal field under s. 91(24)  of
the Constitution Act, 1867 ; (2) if so, whether the Wildlife Act
is a law of general application referentially incorporated into federal law by
s. 88  of the Indian Act ; and (3) whether this appeal raises a question
of law alone for the purpose of s. 114 of the Offence Act of British
Columbia. 

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The Wildlife Act of British Columbia is a law
of general application and it applies to the appellant either by its own force
or, assuming that the Wildlife Act has the effect of regulating him qua
Indian, by referential incorporation under s. 88  of the Indian Act .

 

                   (a) Laws of general application: To
determine whether a provincial enactment is not a law of general application,
it must be shown that the intent, purpose or policy of the legislation was to
impair the status or capacities of a particular group. While it is assumed in
this case that the Wildlife Act impairs the status or capacity of
Indians, it has not been demonstrated that the provincial legislator intended
this particular impact nor has it been established that the legislative policy
of the Wildlife Act singles out Indians for special treatment or that it
discriminates against them in any way.

 

                   (b) Referential incorporation: Section
88  of the Indian Act  does not incorporate, as part of federal
legislation in respect to Indians, all provincial laws of general application.
On one hand, s. 88  refers to the provincial laws which cannot apply to Indians
without regulating them qua Indians, i.e., provincial legislation
which, per se, would not apply to Indians under the Indian Act 
unless given force by federal reference. On the other hand, provincial laws of
general application which can apply to Indians without touching their
Indianness apply to them ex proprio vigore.

 

                   Finally, this Court entertains grave doubts as to
whether the first two issues on which an appeal was taken to the Court of
Appeal were founded ""on any ground that involves a question of law
alone"". Indeed, it does not appear possible to resolve these issues
without weighing the evidence adduced by the parties. However, since the appeal
should be dismissed, there is no need to decide that question.

I The facts

 

2.                The facts are not in dispute. They are
summarized by Lambert J.A., dissenting in the British Columbia Court of Appeal
whose reasons for judgment are reported: R v. Dick (1982), 3 C.C.C. (3d)
481. At pages 484‑85, Lambert J.A. related the facts:

 

                   Arthur
Dick is a member of the Alkali Lake Band of the Shuswap people. He lives on the
Alkali Lake Reserve in the Chilcotin District of the County of Cariboo. He is a
non‑treaty Indian.

 

                   The
Alkali Lake Band is comprised of about 10 families, or approximately 350
people, all told. They subsist in large measure by foraging. They catch fish
for food and they kill deer and moose for food and other uses.

 

                   The
Shuswap word for May is ""Pellcwewlemten"". It means ""time to go
fishing"". In response to this imperative Arthur Dick and two other band
members, with two members of the Canoe Creek Band, set off on May 4, 1980, for
Gustafsen Creek, where they intended to catch fish. On the way they passed
Holdon Lake. There Arthur Dick killed a deer with a rifle. His purpose was to
provide food for the members of the foraging party and for other band members.
The carcass, cut up in pieces, was taken on to Gustafsen Creek where a
provincial conservation officer and four R.C.M.P. constables found the five
Indians in possession of dip nets, a number of rainbow trout, and the deer
meat.

 

3.                One precision should perhaps be added.
The killing of the deer occurred in the traditional hunting grounds of the
Alkali Lake Band but outside a reserve. I now return to the recital of the
facts by Lambert J.A.:

 

                   The
Wildlife Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, said it was a
closed season for hunting for deer. So Arthur Dick was charged under the Act
with two counts; first, with killing wildlife, to wit; one deer, at a time not
within the open season, contrary to s. 3(1); and, secondly, with possession of
wildlife that was dead, to wit: parts of one deer, during a closed season,
contrary to s. 8. It was also a closed season for fishing in Gustafsen Creek.
All five Indians were charged with respect to the fishing, and those charges
are the subject‑matter of a separate appeal by the Crown, raising quite
different issues from those raised in this appeal.

 

                   The
trial took place before His Honour Judge Gilmour, a judge of the provincial
court. The evidence was extensive. The accused was convicted on the first count
and sentenced to a fine of $50. No conviction was entered on the second count.
The accused appealed. His appeal was heard by His Honour Judge Andrews, sitting
as a judge of the County Court of the County of Cariboo. The appeal was
dismissed. Both Judge Gilmour and Judge Andrews reserved judgment and each of
them prepared full and carefully considered written reasons.

 

                   An
application has now been made to this court, under s. 114 of the Offence Act,
R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305, for leave to appeal on a ground or grounds involving a
question or questions of law alone.

 

4.                Leave to appeal was granted by the Court
of Appeal but the appeal was dismissed, Lambert J.A. dissenting.

 

5.                Appellant further appealed to this Court
by leave of this Court.

 

II The issues

 

6.                Appellant and respondent appear to agree
in substance as to the issues raised by this appeal, save one. But they express
them differently and I find it preferable to rephrase them as follows: 

 

1. Is the practice of
year‑round foraging for food so central to the Indian way of life of the
Alkali Lake Shuswap that it cannot be restricted by ss. 3(1) and 8(1) of the Wildlife
Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, without impairment of their status and capacity
as Indians, and invasion of the federal field under s. 91 (24)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 ?

 

2 If the answer to the
first question is in the affirmative and, consequently, the Wildlife Act
cannot apply ex proprio vigore to the appellant, then is this Act a law
of general application referentially incorporated into federal law by s. 88 of
the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I‑6, which provides:

 

88. Subject to the terms of any treaty and any other Act of the Parliament
of Canada, all laws of general application from time to time in force in any
province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to
the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule,
regulation or by‑law made thereunder, and except to the extent that such
laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made by or under this
Act.

 

3. Does this appeal
raise a question of law alone for the purpose of s. 114 of the Offence Act,
R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 305?

 

7.                The third issue was raised only by
respondent.

 

8.                In addition, a constitutional question
was stated by the Chief Justice:

 

Are ss. 3(1)(c) and
8(1) of the Wildlife Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, constitutionally
inapplicable in the circumstances of this case on the ground that the
restriction imposed by such sections affects the appellant qua Indian
and therefore may only be enacted by the Parliament of Canada pursuant to s.
91(24)  of the Constitution Act, 1867 ?

 

9.                The Attorney General of Canada and the
Attorney General of Nova Scotia intervened in support of respondent.

 

10.              Another issue had been raised by appellant
in the Court of Appeal, namely whether the County Court Judge had erred in holding
that the manner of administration of the Wildlife Act by provincial
officials‑‑somewhat misleadingly referred to as the policy of the
Act‑‑had not significantly changed since the judgment of this Court
in Kruger v. The Queen, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 104. But the Court of Appeal,
following R. v. Haines (1981), 34 B.C.L.R. 148, unanimously held that
this issue was not a ""ground that involves a question of law alone"".
While appellant referred in his factum to the policy of the provincial
government not to issue sustenance permits for out of season hunting by Indians
who regularly depend on hunting for their food, I did not understand him to
press this matter in this Court as a distinct issue. 

 

11.              One issue that does not arise is that of Aboriginal
Title or Rights. In its factum, the appellant expressly states that he has
""not sought to prove or rely on the Aboriginal Title or Rights in the case
at bar"". As in the Kruger case, the issue will accordingly not be
dealt with any more than the related or included question whether the Indians'
right to hunt is a personal right or, as has been suggested by some learned
authors, is a right in the nature of a profit à prendre or some other
interest in land covered by the expression ""Lands reserved for the
Indians"", rather than the word ""Indians"" in s. 91(24)  of the Constitution
Act, 1867 . (See Kenneth Lysyk, ""The Unique Constitutional Position of
the Canadian Indian"" (1967), 45 Can. Bar Rev. 513, at pp. 518‑19;
Anthony Jordan, ""Government, Two‑‑Indians, One"" (1978),
16 Osgoode Hall L.J. 709, at p. 719.) No submission was made on this
last point and in this Court, as well apparently as in the courts below, the
case has been argued as if the Indians' right to hunt were a personal one.

 

III The first issue

 

12.              Appellant's main submission which was
apparently presented in the Court of Appeal as an alternative argument, is that
the Wildlife Act strikes at the core of Indianness, that the question
stated in the first issue should accordingly be answered in the affirmative and
that the Wildlife Act, while valid legislation, should be read down so
as not to apply to appellant in the circumstances of the case at bar.

 

13.              As was noted by Andrews Co. Ct. J., whose
reasons for judgment are reported sub nom. R. v. Tenale (1982), 66
C.C.C. (2d) 180, at pp. 182‑83:

 

                   A
considerable volume of evidence was called at trial as to Indian culture,
habits, history, the significance of hunting and fishing as part of that
culture, and specifically as to provincial conservation objectives and methods,
sustenance permits, food requirements, traditional claims and so on. This
testimony was supported by various maps as to alleged historic hunting areas,
policy statements and lengthy opinion evidence of a Dr. M. Asch, an
anthropologist who is the author of numerous papers dealing with, inter alia,
aboriginal rights. 

 

14.              Provincial Court Judge Gilmour stated, in
his reasons for judgment:

 

                   I have
reviewed the evidence in the case at bar and I am not convinced that the policy
of either the Fishing or Game legislation as presently expounded by the
Provincial and Federal Governments and under review in this case, is such that
it was intended to, or does in fact, ""impair the status or capacities of
Indians"".

 

15.              At page 191 of his reasons, Andrews Co.
Ct. J. wrote:

 

                   I have
reviewed this material and the substantial testimony of trial witnesses. It is
apparent therefrom that hunting and fishing forms a significant part of the
Indian culture. I do not conclude however, that the trial Judge was in error. I
do not find in all of that evidence anything from which I might have reasonably
concluded that the policy of the Wildlife Act was such as to impair, at
least in any substantial way, the status and capacity of the appellants. I do
not find in all that evidence anything from which I can reasonably conclude
that status and capacity of the appellant was impaired to any greater degree
than those Indians involved in the Kruger and Manuel and Haines
cases, supra.

 

                   As to
the argument that the Wildlife Act affects this appellant qua
Indian and thus cannot apply to him because the federal authorities have
exclusive jurisdiction over Indians, I do not agree.

 

16.              In the Court of Appeal, Seaton J.A.
concluded as follows at p. 484:

 

                   The
decisions under attack were primarily decisions of fact. To the extent that
there were questions of law alone, I am not persuaded that error has been
shown. I would grant leave, but dismiss the appeal.

 

17.              Macdonald J.A. refrained from expressing
any views on the merits of the three issues raised in the Court of Appeal. At
page 496 he concluded:

 

My opinion is that none of
the three issues involves a question of law alone. I would therefore dismiss
the appeal.

 

18.              The reasons of Lambert J.A., dissenting,
are quite elaborate. For the greater part, they expound the similarities and
differences between the case at bar and Kruger and his understanding of
the tests adopted in the latter case to determine whether a law is one of
general application, a matter to which I will return in dealing with the second
issue. But he used the same tests to answer the question stated in the first
issue, namely whether the application of the Wildlife Act to appellant
would regulate him qua Indian. Here is what he wrote at p. 492:

 

... it seems to me that
the same tests as are applied to determine whether the application of a
provincial law to a particular group of Indians in a particular activity is the
application of a law of general application, should also be applied to
determine whether the application of a provincial law to a particular group of
Indians in a particular activity is legislation in relation to Indians in their
Indianness.

 

                   So,
subject to the question of referential incorporation, which I will come to
next, it is my opinion that the evidence and argument which I have set out in
Part III of these reasons require the conclusion that the Wildlife Act
should be ""read down"" in order to preserve its constitutionality.
That ""reading down"" would prevent it from applying to Arthur Dick in
his activity in this case. 

 

19.              It is well worth quoting substantial parts
of the evidence and argument set out in Part III of the reasons of Lambert
J.A., which, as I just said, were also relied upon by him to resolve the first
issue. He wrote, at pages 487, and 489‑91:

 

                   In Kruger
and Manuel v. The Queen, supra, the two accused were members of the
Penticton Indian Band. They shot four deer for food on unoccupied Crown land on
the traditional hunting grounds of the Penticton Indian Band. It was the closed
season under the Wildlife Act and Kruger and Manuel did not have a
sustenance permit which would have allowed them to shoot a deer during the
closed season. They were convicted. Their appeal to Judge Washington took the
form of a trial de novo. It was allowed. The Crown appealed to this
court. That appeal was aso allowed and the convictions were restored: 24 C.C.C.
(2d) 120, 60 D.L.R. (3d) 144, [1975] 5 W.W.R. 167. Kruger and Manuel appealed
to the Supreme Court of Canada. Their appeal was dismissed. Mr. Justice
Dickson's reasons were the reasons of the full court of nine.

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   The
evidence in this appeal goes much further than the agreed facts in Kruger
and Manuel v. The Queen. Here there is evidence which indicates that the
line demarking laws of general application from other enactments has been
crossed. In Kruger and Manuel v. The Queen the only relevant evidence
was the statement in the agreed facts that the accused had hunted deer during
the closed season on land that was the traditional hunting grounds of the
Penticton Indian Band. There was no evidence that the statutory restrictions on
the right to hunt impaired the status and capacities of Kruger and Manuel as
Indians. There was no evidence that the Penticton Indian Band depended on
hunting for their supply of meat. There was no evidence that it would be
impracticable to hunt sufficient meat during the open season. There was no
evidence as to the amount of meat obtained through hunting, the amount of meat
needed to feed an Indian family for a year, or the amount of meat allowed to
Indians under the prevailing hunting quotas. Finally, there was no evidence to
indicate that hunting was central to the way of life of the Penticton Indian
Band. There was, in the words of Mr. Justice Dickson, an ""absence of clear
evidence"" that the provisions in the Wildlife Act crossed the line
demarking laws of general application from other enactments. 

 

                   The
situation is entirely different in the present appeal where, in my opinion, the
evidence indicates that the line has been crossed.

 

                   Nine
members of the Alkali Lake Band and three members of the Canoe Creek Band gave
evidence. They described their lives and the significance of the rituals of
food gathering. They told of their dependence on moose and deer for food and
for traditional and valued items of daily clothing and ceremonial clothing.
Their evidence was placed in its cultural framework by Dr. Michael Asch, an
anthropologist.

 

                   In
1980, the year in which Arthur Dick shot the deer at Holdon Lake, there were 45
active hunters in the Alkali Lake Band. They took 117 deer and 48 moose in the
year. That provided a yield of 65 to 70 pounds of meat for every man, woman and
child in the Band. The meat was shared out among band members in accordance
with the institutional practices of the Shuswap people.

 

                   The
times of year for hunting animals and for fishing, the places to hunt, and the
techniques of hunting are taught to young male members of the band by their
fathers and grandfathers.

 

                   Some of
the meat is smoked, some is salted, some is frozen, and some is eaten fresh.
The preservation of the meat and the preparation of food is largely done by the
women of the band. Women also tan and treat the hides and make the traditional
clothing. The skills and techniques for preserving food and making clothing are
handed down from one generation to the next.

 

                   When
the meat supply runs out the hunters go out for more. They go when it is
needed. That happens every spring when the supply of preserved meat, from
animals killed in the fall, comes to an end.

 

                   The
hunters in the Alkali Lake Band do not hunt for trophies; they do not hunt for
recreation, nor do they look on hunting as recreation; they do not leave the
carcasses of the animals they kill in the woods. If they work for wages it is
not as an alternative to hunting but in order to acquire the means to hunt for
food.

 

                   Ricky
Dick, a member of the Alkali Lake Band, and one of the foraging party on May 4,
1980, gave evidence that his own family needs four or five deer each year for
food. But the evidence of the conservation officer at 100 Mile House is that
the limit for one hunter in one year from Region 5 is one deer. Of course, if
you travel from one region to another, as recreational hunters do, then you can
shoot deer in other regions to a total kill of three deer in one year. But, for
the hunters of the Alkali Lake Band, the Wildlife Act and regulations,
if they were to apply, would provide a limit of one deer for each hunter in
each year within their hunting grounds. 

 

                   Dr.
Asch drew the relationship between the testimony of the Indian witnesses and
the institutions and practices of the traditional way of life of the Alkali
Lake Band of the Shuswap people.

 

                   In my
opinion, it is impossible to read the evidence without realizing that killing
fish and animals for food and other uses gives shape and meaning to the lives
of the members of the Alkali Lake Band. It is at the centre of what they do and
what they are.

 

                   In my
opinion, this case is distinguishable from Kruger and Manuel v. The Queen,
(1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 377, 75 D.L.R. (3d) 434, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 104, because
here the appellant has led evidence which, in my opinion, establishes that the Wildlife
Act in its application to hunting for food impairs the status and
capacities of the Alkali Lake Band members and crosses the line demarking laws
of general application from other enactments.

 

20.              And, before concluding at p. 495, Lambert
J.A. wrote:

 

Indeed, I would add that
if the facts in this case do not place the killing of the deer within the
central core of Indianness, if there is one, or within the boundary that
outlines the status and capacities of the Alkali Lake Band, then it is
difficult to imagine other facts that would do so.

 

21.              In Cardinal v. Attorney General of
Alberta, [1974] S.C.R. 695 at p. 706, it had already been held, apart from
any evidence, that provincial game laws do not relate to Indians qua
Indians. In the case at bar, there was considerable evidence capable of
supporting the conclusions of Lambert J.A. to the effect that the Wildlife
Act did impair the Indianness of the Alkali Lake Band, as well as the
opposite conclusions of the courts below.

 

22.              I am prepared to assume, without deciding,
that Lambert J.A. was right on this point and that appellant's submission on
the first issue is well taken.

 

23.              I must confess at being strenghtened in
this assumption by what Lambert J.A. said at p. 493:

 

                   The question
of whether provincial legislation affects Indians as Indians, or Indians in
their Indianness, to put it another way, is at the root of both arguments that
I have considered in this appeal. I think it is worth adding that I have
derived some sense of the nature of Indianness from the fact that the Indians
in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have the right to hunt and fish for food
at all seasons of the year (see the Natural Resources Agreements and the Constitution
Act, 1930, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix No. 25), and the treaty Indians in British
Columbia also have that right: see R. v. White and Bob (1965), 52 D.L.R.
(2d) 481 n., [1965] S.C.R. vi. I think that those rights are
characteristic of Indianness, at least for those Indians, and if for those
Indians, why not for the Alkali Lake Band of the Shuswap people?

 

24.              On the basis of this assumption and
subject to the question of referential incorporation which will be dealt with
in the next chapter, it follows that the Wildlife Act could not apply to
the appellant ex proprio vigore, and, in order to preserve its
constitutionality, it would be necessary to read it down to prevent its
applying to appellant in the circumstances of this case.

 

IV The second issue

 

25.              In holding that the tests adopted by this
Court in Kruger to determine whether a law is one of general application
are the same tests which should be applied to determine whether the application
of the Wildlife Act to appellant would regulate him in his Indianness,
Lambert J.A. fell into error, in my respectful opinion. And this error resulted
from a misapprehension of what was decided in Kruger as to the nature of
a law of general application. 

 

26.              The tests which Lambert J.A. applied in
reviewing the evidence in his above quoted reasons are perfectly suitable to
determine whether the application of the Wildlife Act to the appellant
would have the effect of regulating him qua Indian, with the
consequential necessity of a reading down if it did; but, apart from
legislative intent and colourability, they have nothing to do with the question
whether the Wildlife Act is a law of general application. On the
contrary, it is precisely because the Wildlife Act is a law of general
application that it would have to be read down were it not for s. 88  of the Indian
Act . If the special impact of the Wildlife Act on Indians had been
the very result contemplated by the Legislature and pursued by it as a matter
of policy, the Act could not be read down because it would be in relation to
Indians and clearly ultra vires.

 

27.              The Wildlife Act does not differ in
this respect from a great many provincial labour laws which are couched in
general terms and which, taken literally, would apply to federal works and
undertakings. So to apply them however would make them regulate such works and
undertaking under some essentially federal aspects. They are accordingly read
down so as not to apply to federal works and undertakings: Reference re
Minimum Wage Act of Saskatchewan, [1948] S.C.R. 248; Commission du
Salaire minimum v. Bell Telephone Co. of Canada, [1966] S.C.R. 767; Letter
Carriers' Union of Canada v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, [1975] 1
S.C.R. 178. But it has never been suggested, so far as I know, that, by the
same token, those provincial labour laws cease to be laws of general application.

 

28.              In his reasons for judgment, Lambert J.A.
relied on two passages of Kruger which he quoted and commented. The
first passage is to be found at p. 110 of the Supreme Court Reports:

 

If the law does extend
uniformly throughout the jurisdiction the intention and effects of the
enactment need to be considered. The law must not be ""in relation to""
one class of citizens in object and purpose. But the fact that a law may have
graver consequence to one person than to another does not, on that account
alone, make the law other than one of general application. There are few laws
which have a uniform impact. The line is crossed, however, when an enactment,
though in relation to another matter, by its effect, impairs the status or
capacity of a particular group.

 

29.              The second passage of Kruger quoted
by Lambert J.A. is at p. 112 of the Supreme Court Reports: 

 

                   Game
conservation laws have as their policy the maintenance of wildlife resources.
It might be argued that without some conservation measures the ability of
Indians or others to hunt for food would become a moot issue in consequence of
the destruction of the resource. The presumption is for the validity of a
legislative enactment and in this case the presumption has to mean that in the
absence of evidence to the contrary the measures taken by the British Columbia
Legislature were taken to maintain an effective resource in the Province for
its citizens and not to oppose the interests of conservationists and Indians in
such a way as to favour the claims of the former. If, of course, it can be
shown in future litigation that the Province has acted in such a way as to
oppose conservation and Indian claims to the detriment of the latter‑‑to
""preserve moose before Indians"" in the words of Gordon J.A. in R.
v. Strongquill (1953), 8 W.W.R. (N.S.) 247‑‑it might very well
be concluded that the effect of the legislation is to cross the line demarking
laws of general application from other enactments. It would have to be shown
that the policy of such an Act was to impair the status and capacities of
Indians. Were that so, s. 88  would not operate to make the Act applicable to
Indians. But that has not been done here and in the absence of clear evidence
the Court cannot so presume.

 

30.              Lambert J.A. then emphasized the
importance of the effect of the legislation as opposed to its purpose. At page
489 of his reasons he wrote:

 

... evidence about the
motives of individual members of the Legislature or even about the more
abstract ""intention of the legislature"" or ""legislative purpose
of the enactment"" is not relevant. What is relevant is evidence about the
effect of the legislation. In fact, evidence about its ""application"".

 

31.              With all due deference, it seems to me
that the correct view is the reverse one and that what Dickson J., as he then
was, referred to in Kruger when he mentioned laws which had crossed the
line of general application were laws which, either overtly or colourably,
single out Indians for special treatment and impair their status as Indians.
Effect and intent are both relevant. Effect can evidence intent. But in order
to determine whether a law is not one of general application, the intent,
purpose or policy of the legislation can certainly not be ignored: they form an
essential ingredient of a law which discriminates between various classes of
persons, as opposed to a law of general application. This in my view is what
Dickson J. meant when in the above quoted passage, he wrote: 

 

It would have to be shown
that the policy of such an Act was to impair the status and capacities of
Indians.

 

32.              I am reinforced in this view by the fact
that at p. 113, Dickson J. quoted with approval the following passage of Davey
J.A. in R. v. White and Bob (1965), 52 W.W.R. 193, at p. 198:

 

                   Secs. 8
and 15 of the Game Act specifically exempt Indians from the operation of
certain provisions of the Act, and from that I think it clear that the other
provisions are intended to be of general application and to include Indians. If
these general sections are sufficiently clear to show an intention to abrogate
or qualify the contractual rights of hunting notoriously reserved to Indians by
agreements such as Ex. 8, they would, in my opinion, fail in that purpose
because that would be legislation in relation to Indians that falls within
parliament's exclusive legislative authority under sec. 91(24) of the B.N.A.
Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict., ch. 3 , and also because that would conflict
with sec. 87  of the Indian Act  passed under that authority.

 

33.              I am further confirmed in this view by one
of the examples chosen by Dickson J. to illustrate, with an analogy, when a law
is not one of general application. At page 110, he mentioned the case of Great
West Saddlery Co. v. The King, [1921] 2 A.C. 91, where Ontario, Manitoba
and Saskatchewan statutory provisions were held ultra vires so far as
they paralysed the status and capacities of federal companies. Those provisions
generally discriminated between provincially incorporated companies and extra‑provincial
companies including federal ones. They were clearly not laws of general application
and on that ground they were prima facie suspicious from a
constitutional point of view. I find it significant that Dickson J. abstained
from referring to another ""company case"", that of Attorney‑General
for Manitoba v. Attorney‑General for Canada, [1929] A.C. 260, where
two Manitoba statutes prohibiting companies from selling their own shares
within the province without the consent of a provincial commissioner or board
were held not to apply to federal companies. Unlike the provisions considered in
the Great West Saddlery Co. case, these two Manitoba statutes were
clearly laws of general application and they were in fact ""read down""
although this is not what was explicitly said since the expression does not
seem to have then been in use and the case was a reference stating a specific
constitutional question.

 

34.              Reference should also be made to a later
""company case"", Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2
S.C.R. 161, where it was held, inter alia that ss. 113 and 114 of The
Securities Act of Ontario, R.S.O. 1970, c. 426, applied to federally
incorporated companies. Dickson J. as he then was, delivered the reasons of the
majority. (But there was no division on this point.) At page 183 Dickson J.
wrote:

 

It is well established
that the provinces have the power, as a matter of property and civil rights, to
regulate the trade in corporate securities in the province, provided the
statute does not single out federal companies for special treatment or
discriminate against them in any way. There must be no impairment of status or
of the essential power to raise capital for corporate purpose. But federal
incorporation does not render a company immune from securities regulation of
general application in a province. 

 

35.              It has already been held in Kruger
that on its face, and in form, the Wildlife Act is a law of general
application. In the previous chapter, I have assumed that its application to
appellant would have the effect of regulating the latter qua Indian.
However, it has not been demonstrated, in my view, that this particular impact
has been intended by the provincial legislator. While it is assumed that the Wildlife
Act impairs the status or capacity of appellant, it has not been
established that the legislative policy of the Wildlife Act singles out
Indians for special treatment or discriminates against them in any way.

 

36.              I accordingly conclude that the Wildlife
Act is a law of general application within the meaning of s. 88  of the Indian
Act .

 

37.              It remains to decide whether the Wildlife
Act has been referentially incorporated to federal laws by s. 88  of the Indian
Act .

 

38.              In Kruger, Dickson J. wrote at p.
115:

 

                   There
is in the legal literature a juridical controversy respecting whether s. 88 
referentially incorporates provincial laws of general application or whether
such laws apply to Indians ex proprio vigore. The issue was considered
by this Court in Natural Parents v. Superintendent of Child Welfare
(1975), 60 D.L.R. (3d) 148, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 751.

 

This controversy has so far remained unresolved in this Court.

 

39.              I believe that a distinction should be
drawn between two categories of provincial laws. There are, on the one hand,
provincial laws which can be applied to Indians without touching their
Indianness, like traffic legislation; there are on the other hand, provincial
laws which cannot apply to Indians without regulating them qua Indians.

 

40.              Laws of the first category, in my opinion,
continue to apply to Indians ex proprio vigore as they always did before
the enactment of s. 88  in 1951‑‑then numbered s. 87  (1951 (Can.),
c. 29)‑‑and quite apart from s. 88 . (Vide R. v. Hill (1908),
15 O.L.R. 406, where an Indian was convicted of unlawful practice of medecine
contrary to a provincial medical act, and R. v. Martin (1917), 41 O.L.R.
79, where an Indian was convicted of unlawful possession of intoxicating
liquor, contrary to a provincial temperance act.)

 

41.              I have come to the view that it is to the
laws of the second category that s. 88  refers. I agree with what Laskin C.J.
wrote in Natural Parents v. Superintendent of Child Welfare, [1976] 2
S.C.R. 751, at p. 763:

 

When s. 88 refers to
""all laws of general application from time to time in force in any
province"" it cannot be assumed to have legislated a nullity but, rather,
to have in mind provincial legislation which, per se, would not apply to
Indians under the Indian Act  unless given force by federal reference. 

 

                   I am
fully aware of the contention that it is enough to give force to the several
opening provisions of s. 88, which, respectively, make the
""provincial"" reference subject to the terms of any treaty and any
other federal Act and subject also to inconsistency with the Indian Act 
and orders, rules, regulations or by‑laws thereunder. That contention
would have it that s. 88  is otherwise declaratory. On this view, however, it is
wholly declaratory save perhaps in its reference to ""the terms of any
treaty"", a strange reason, in my view, to explain all the other provisions
of s. 88 . I think too that the concluding words of s. 88 , ""except to the
extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made
by or under this Act"" indicate clearly that Parliament is indeed effecting
incorporation by reference.

 

42.              I also adopt the suggestion expressed by
Professor Lysyk, as he then was, op. cit., at p. 552:

 

                   Provincial
laws of general application will extend to Indians whether on or off reserves.
It has been suggested that the constitution permits this result without the
assistance of section 87  of the Indian Act , and that the only significant
result of that section is, by expressly embracing all laws of general
application (subject to the exceptions stated in the section), to contemplate
extension of particular laws which otherwise might have been held to be so
intimately bound up with the essential capacities and rights inherent in Indian
status as to have otherwise required a conclusion that the provincial
legislation amounted to an inadmissible encroachment upon section 91(24) of the
British North America Act.

 

43.              The word ""all"" in s. 88 is
telling but, as was noticed by the late Chief Justice, the concluding words of
s. 88 are practically decisive: it would not be open to Parliament in my view
to make the Indian Act  paramount over provincial laws simply because the
Indian Act  occupied the field. Operational conflict would be required to
this end. But Parliament could validly provide for any type of paramountcy of
the Indian Act  over other provisions which it alone could enact,
referentially or otherwise. (It is true that the paramountcy doctrine may not
have been as precise in 1951 as it has become, at a later date, but it is
desirable to adopt a construction of s. 88  which accords with established
constitutional principles.)

 

44.              In a supplementary factum, appellant
argues that a prospective incorporation into the Indian Act  of future
provincial laws which would regulate the appellant qua Indian, involves
interdelegation of powers of a type held unconstitutional in Attorney
General of Nova Scotia v. Attorney General of Canada, [1951] S.C.R. 31. In
my opinion Attorney General for Ontario v. Scott, [1956] S.C.R. 137, and
Coughlin v. Ontario Highway Transport Board, [1968] S.C.R. 569, provide
a complete answer to this objection.

 

45.              I accordingly conclude that, in view of s.
88  of the Indian Act , the Wildlife Act applies to appellant even
if, as I have assumed, it has the effect of regulating him qua Indian.

 

V The third issue

 

46.              I entertain grave doubts as to whether the
first two issues on which an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal were
founded ""on any ground that involves a question of law alone"". 

 

47.              The first issue was whether the Wildlife
Act affects appellant qua Indian. The same issue arose on an
alternative basis in R. v. Jack and Charlie (1982), 139 D.L.R. (3d) 25
and, at p. 41, Craig J.A. like Macdonald J.A., and, semble, also like Seaton
J.A. in the case at bar, held that it did not involve a question of law alone.
It does not appear possible to resolve that issue without weighing the abundant
evidence adduced by the parties. To quote Dickson J., as he then was, speaking
for the majority in Poitras v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 649 at p. 653,
it does seem to be a question which

 

... can be asked, and
answered, without reference to the detail of the particular case.

 

                   The
first issue would appear to raise a question of mixed law and fact.

 

48.              The second issue comprises two questions
namely whether the Wildlife Act is a law of general application and
whether s. 88  of the Indian Act  referentially incorporates provincial
laws of general application. The second question is probably one of law alone
but it constitutes only one half of the problem. The other half cannot be
resolved without a consideration of whether it has been established that, in
enacting the Wildlife Act, the legislator intended to single out Indians
for special treatment, again a matter of evidence, at least in part.

 

49.              Even the constitutional question,
referring as it does to ""the circumstances of this case"", sounds like
a question of mixed law and fact, which is not unusual for constitutional
questions: see for instance Northern Telecom Canada Ltd. v. Communication
Workers of Canada, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 733.

 

50.              The matter is further complicated by s.
41(3) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. S‑19 and
amendments, which must be read in the context of s. 41(1):

 

                   41. (1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court
from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a
province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular
case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or not leave to appeal
to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court, where, with respect
to the particular case sought to be appealed, the Supreme Court is of the
opinion that any question involved therein is, by reason of its public
importance or the importance of any issue of law or any issue of mixed law and
fact involved in such question, one that ought to be decided by the Supreme
Court or is, for any other reason, of such a nature or significance as to
warrant decision by it, and leave to appeal from such judgment is accordingly
granted by the Supreme Court.

 

                                                                    ...


 

                   (3) No
appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any
court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or
acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question of law
or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.

 

51.              If the issues on which the appeal was
taken to the Court of Appeal do not involve questions of law alone, it is
arguable that the Court of Appeal exceeded its jurisdiction in entertaining the
appeal, in which case we could have granted leave to appeal on this question of
jurisdiction, while being precluded from reviewing the merits. But since the
Court of Appeal and the County Court have reached the same result, it becomes
unnecessary to decide whether the Court of Appeal has exceeded its
jurisdiction.

 

52.              It may seem anomalous that this Court and
even a Court of Appeal be cut off from a constitutional question of some
importance, but it is not unheard of: thus, Reference re Minimum Wage Act of
Saskatchewan, supra, was a reference ordered because, in that case,
no appeal lay to this Court from a decision of the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal.

 

53.              These doubts, I would have to resolve if I
thought that, on the merits, the appeal should succeed. But since I have
reached the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed in any event, I
believe I can leave my doubts unresolved.

 

VI The constitutional question

 

54.              I would answer the constitutional question
as follows:

 

Sections 3(1) and 8(1) of
the Wildlife Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 433, being laws of general
application in the Province of British Columbia, are applicable to the
appellant either by referential incorporation under s. 88 of the Indian Act,

                   Appellant and five other persons were charged with
conspiracy to traffic in a narcotic and with trafficking in a narcotic, namely
P.C.P. After the preliminary inquiry, the charge laid against the caretaker of
the building where the P.C.P. was made was withdrawn. At his trial before a
jury appellant was convicted, and his appeal to the Court of Appeal was
dismissed. The appeal at bar was based on three grounds: did the Court of
Appeal err in law (1) in affirming the judgment of the trial judge which
dismissed a motion for a mistrial made as a result of certain comments
contained in the argument of counsel for the Crown regarding alleged prior
acts; (2) in finding that the trial judge did not err in refusing to delete
from recorded conversations passages referring to appellant's criminal past;
and (3) in finding that the authorization to intercept the private
conversations was legal? Appellant argued that this authorization was not in
keeping with the provisions of the Code since, first, the person named
in the authorization, the building caretaker, was only a ""straw man""
whose name was used as a pretext for obtaining authorization to intercept the
private communications of any person using the building where the P.C.P. was made,
and second, the authorization was too wide and did not have the necessary
limitations as to the persons whose communications could be intercepted and the
place where this could be done. 

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be dismissed.

 

                   The trial judge did not err in dismissing the motion
for a mistrial made by appellant. In his charge to the jury, the trial judge
was able to remove any prejudice which the comments of counsel for the Crown
may have caused him. The trial judge clearly indicated to the jury that they
were not to take into account the comments by the Crown regarding the alleged
prior acts committed by appellant.

 

                   The effect of this direction was also to remove any
prejudice which the passages not deleted from the recorded conversations may
have caused appellant. The comments of the Crown were based on one of the three
passages not deleted. The jury was certainly able to understand from the trial
judge's direction that any evidence as to appellant's criminal past must be
disregarded.

 

                   There is no basis for finding the authorization
unlawful. The mere fact that the charge against the building caretaker was
withdrawn does not establish that the use of his name in the application for an
authorization was a fiction. The record as it stands does not support this
conclusion. It might as well be said that in view of his function as a
caretaker and the extent of the activities suspected, and which in fact
occurred in the building, the signatory of the sworn statement could believe in
good faith, at the time of the application for an authorization, that he was in
league with the others.

 

                   Finally, when there is a clear dividing line between
the good and bad parts of an authorization, and they are not so interwoven that
they cannot be separated but are actually separate authorizations given in the
same order, the court can divide the order and preserve the valid portion,
which then forms the authorization. In such a case interceptions made under the
valid authorization are admissible. In the case at bar, without the offending
paragraph the authorization is perfectly valid. Since this paragraph was not
used, it can be excluded and all the conversations intercepted by authority of
an otherwise valid authorization are admissible.

                   English version of the judgment of the Court
delivered by 

 

1.                Chouinard
J.‑‑At his trial before a jury, appellant was convicted of
the following indictable offences:

 

                   1.
Between April 1st, 1980 and April 28, 1980, did unlawfully conspire together
with WILLIAM BRADLEY and with other unknown persons, to commit an indictable
offence not included in paragraphs a, b or c of Section 423(1) of the Criminal
Code , to wit: trafficking in a narcotic, that is, P.C.P. (phenyl cyclohexyl
piperidine), contrary to Section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. N‑1, committing thereby an indictable offence pursuant to Section
423(1) (d) of the Criminal Code ;

 

                    2.
Between April 1st, 1980 and April 28, 1980, did unlawfully traffic in a
narcotic, to wit: approximately 7.58 pounds of P.C.P. (phenyl cyclohexyl
piperidine), contrary to Section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1970,
c. N‑1, committing thereby an indictable offence pursuant to Section 4(3)
of the said Narcotic Control Act.

 

2.                His appeal to the Court of Appeal was
dismissed unanimously: (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 78.

 

3.                Appellant summarized the facts as
follows:

 

                   [TRANSLATION] 
Appellant was arrested on April 28, 1980 with the co‑accused MARUSKA, DI
SALVO, THOMAS and BRADLEY, at 620 rue St‑Jacques, Montréal.

 

                    This
is a vacant commercial building. In the basement there is a garage and storage
rooms. The caretaker is one Wayne Murphy; he was arrested and charged with the
others; however, at the preliminary inquiry he was called as a witness by the
Crown, which withdrew the charges against him.

 

                    The
building was searched immediately after the arrests. Certain objects were
seized and later produced at the trial. Two tanks containing P.C.P. were found,
one of them behind the caretaker's desk and containing 7.58 pounds of P.C.P.,
the other in the first floor ceiling and containing 42 grams of P.C.P. 

 

                    Traces
of P.C.P. were found on various articles (a barrel, a mixer and the clothes of
certain of the accused, including appellant).

 

                    The
evidence presented by the Crown against appellant and his co‑accused at
the trial rested primarily on the testimony of police officers who observed the
searched building and on the entering in evidence of the material and articles
connected with P.C.P. that were seized at 620 rue St‑Jacques.

 

                    The
police observation evidence established that one of the accused, MARUSKA, was
seen at 620 rue St‑Jacques on April 25, 1980. The latter confirmed this
in his testimony, explaining that he had indeed gone to the aforementioned
location with two of the co‑accused (DI SALVO and THOMAS) to discuss
renting the empty premises with the caretaker. Maruska testified that he also
saw chemicals and various kinds of equipment: so far as he knew, these items
were to be sold following a bankruptcy. He got this information from the
caretaker.

 

                    However,
the Crown's argument is that the most overwhelming evidence against appellant
rests on the latter's conversations with the co‑accused. These
conversations established, in the view of the Crown, knowledge and production
of P.C.P. by the accused. Cpl. Bell, who was in charge of the investigation,
identified the voices of each of the accused, except Di Salvo.

 

                    Only
the accused MARUSKA entered a defence.

 

                    Maruska
testified that he did not participate in producing the P.C.P., and believed
that Bradley was making a perfectly legal product. This belief was based on
research which he did with Bradley at McGill University Library. Bradley denied
any participation in the final manufacture of P.C.P. He admitted having made
certain tests, but said he was unaware that the product was illegal.

 

                    Appellant
Grabowski did not testify and called no witnesses. 

 

4.                In this summary by appellant, respondent
only disputed the statement that [TRANSLATION]  ""the most overwhelming
evidence against appellant rests on the latter's conversations with the co‑accused"".
Instead, respondent argued, the offences were established by all the evidence
which she presented to the jury. Respondent further made the following
additional points, not disputed by appellant:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Appellant
was arrested at 1 a.m. on Monday, April 28, 1980, as he was about to leave the
rear door of an office building located in the heart of the financial district
of Montréal, at 620 St‑Jacques West.

 

 The building in question
was an office building most of which was tenanted.

 

 Appellant and his
accomplices had no right of access to the building.

 

 Appellant was seen at
about 9:55 a.m. on Sunday, April 27, as he was leaving the building; he
returned a few minutes later and it was not until he was arrested that he was
about to leave with his accomplices.

 

 Appellant fled inside the
building when the police arrived.

 

 The very strong smell of
chemicals noticeable inside the building.

 

 In the part of the
basement containing the lockers in which the equipment and chemicals used to
manufacture P.C.P. were stored, the floor was wet and had recently been washed.

 

 The lower part of
appellant's trousers was wet.

 

 The keys to the building
were found on the ground a few feet from where appellant was finally stopped by
the police, near the entrance at the front of the building.

 

 Radio equipment of the
""walkie‑talkie"" type was found on the accomplices, Thomas, Di
Salvo and Bradley, when they were arrested.

 

 These three items of
radio equipment operated on the same frequency as a fourth item found in one of
the basement lockers.

 

 Radio equipment of the
""scanner"" type was seized: inter alia, it could get three
radio frequencies of the RCMP and one radio frequency of the M.U.C. Police.

 

 Phencyclidine (P.C.P.)
was found on the clothing of appellant and the other accomplices arrested with
him.

 

 P.C.P. was found in the
basement in a barrel used as a tank and on a mixer placed in the barrel.

 

 A preliminary product,
piperidine cyclohexane carbonitrite (P.C.C.), was found in the basement and on
the ground floor. 

 

 Maruska had bought
heating strips identical to those found in the basement of the building and
those shown on a diagram found on him when he was arrested.

 

 The instructions for use
of the heating strips were found on appellant Thomas when he was arrested.

 

 The products necessary
for the manufacture of P.C.P. were found in two of the lockers in the basement
at 620 St‑Jacques West, where appellant and his accomplices were
arrested.

 

 Certain liquid products
used to manufacture P.C.P. found at the location were replaced by water in
their containers, so that the containers appeared to be full.

 

5.                Appellant raised three grounds, stated
in the form of questions.

 

6.                The first question is as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Did the
Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in upholding the validity of the judgment of
the learned trial judge who dismissed a motion for a mistrial made as a result
of certain comments contained in the argument of counsel for the Crown?

 

7.                Appellant alleged that counsel for the
respondent, during his argument, had referred to alleged prior offences. The
passage of the argument giving rise to this complaint is as follows:

 

He was talking about 80
pounds of P.C.P. I am submitting to you that it wasn't the first time they made
P.C.P. there. So I'm telling you that it's not the first time. But you're not
being asked to convict the accused on those previous times. You're being asked
to convict the accused of only what is in the Indictment.

 

8.                This statement by counsel for the
respondent was based on the following passage from the conversations
intercepted:

 

(KG) I'm out and now
I got to get the council man to mix it now.

 

(UM) Yeah.

 

(KG) I got about
eighty pounds there already so, be enough for the first batch.

 

9.                However, the Court was persuaded that
the reference to 80 pounds did not concern the earlier production of P.C.P.,
but the chemical ingredients present in the makeshift laboratory which were to
be used in preparing 7.49 pounds of P.C.P. 

 

10.              In his elaborate judgment dismissing the
motion for a mistrial, the judge reviewed the intercepted conversations as a
whole, and in particular all the quantities mentioned at various points. He
made many calculations in arriving at his conclusion.

 

11.              The judge said:

 

                    Those
calculations and the above analysis confirm me in my interpretation of that
passage at the end of the third conversation, as referring to ingredient
products and not to finished P.C.P.

 

The judge later went on to pose the following question:

 

                    Hence,
Crown counsel should not have made the above‑cited comment. Having done
so has caused a prejudice to the four accused. The question I must now consider
and resolve is: Is that prejudice irreparable or can it be remedied by
appropriate comments and directives to the Jury in my Charge?

 

12.              The judge cited Beetz J.:

 

                    In the
unreported judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. vs. Boka,
rendered on April 11th, 1974 in Case No. 10‑000151‑72, Mr. Justice
Beetz (as he then was) wrote:

 

[TRANSLATION]  ""It
must be assumed that jurors have average intelligence and are capable, provided
they are given legally admissible evidence and adequate directions on the law,
of sufficient abstraction to be judges of fact.""

 

                    On
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, that dictum was approved.

 

13.              (On the last point, it would be more
correct to say that an application for leave to appeal was dismissed by this
Court: [1975] 1 S.C.R. vii.)

 

14.              Finally, the judge said he was persuaded
that he would be able, by his charge to the jury, to remedy the damage caused
the accused by the comments of counsel for the respondent and, exercising his
discretion, he dismissed the motion.

 

15.              In his charge to the jury, the judge
restated his analysis of the intercepted conversations as a whole and the
detailed calculation of the various quantities. He told them he was persuaded
that the reference to 80 pounds concerned ingredients to be used in preparing
P.C.P., not P.C.P. that may have been produced on some other occasion. The
judge then gave the jury the following charge: 

 

 Now I suggest to you, but
that is my opinion, that Bélanger was wrong in giving you his assessment of
that eighty (80) pounds as referring to previous PCP, but you're not bound by
what I tell you. You are free to apply to that your own opinion, your own
conclusions on the evidence. It should be more than opinion. It should be
conclusions.

 

                    Now,
if, notwithstanding everything I have just told you, which would surprise me
very much, but I've been surprised before, you agree with Bélanger's
interpretation of that passage, then I tell you as a matter and directive of
law that, if you agree with Bélanger that that refers to eighty (80) pounds of
PCP, which you don't have in evidence here, that in law you cannot and must not
construe that as constituting similar fact evidence in relation to any one of
the accused here. You've heard me discuss similar fact evidence...if you choose
to agree with Mr. Bélanger's interpretation of the eighty (80) pounds, you must
not and you shall not in any way apply that conclusion or that opinion to any
of the accused here, if you so agree with Mr. Bélanger, which again would
surprise me. You must disregard entirely what he said. Put it out of your
minds. It bears no relationship to this case. It is not evidence in this case,
and it is not evidence in any way of the commission by any of the ...accused
here of any of the... counts in the present indictment of which they stand
charged.

 

16.              McCarthy J.A., after citing the same
passage, dismissed this argument by appellant. He wrote, on behalf of the Court
of Appeal (at p. 81): 

 

 In my view, the trial
judge thus removed any prejudice that Mtre Bélanger's comments may have caused
the accused. The fact that the trial judge charged the jury eight days after
Mtre Bélanger made his comments is not, as the appellants argue, significant.
The charge was quite clear and there is no reason to assume that the jurors
were not sufficiently intelligent to understand and act on it.

 

17.              I agree.

 

18.              Appellant's second ground was presented as
follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Did the
Quebec Court of Appeal err in law in finding that the learned judge did not err
in law in refusing to delete from the recorded conversations passages referring
to applicant's criminal past?

 

19.              A number of passages from the intercepted
conversations were deleted by the judge. Appellant is here referring to three
passages which were not deleted, including the one already mentioned.

 

20.              In dismissing this argument the Court of
Appeal relied on the judge's charge to the jury, cited above. I concur in the opinion
of the Court of Appeal and adopt the following passage of McCarthy J.A. (at pp.
81‑82):

 

 However, here again, I
think that the trial judge's instructions quoted above removed any prejudice
that may have been caused the accused. Those instructions were occasioned by
Mtre Bélanger's comments on one particular extract but any intelligent listener
would, I think, have understood from them that any evidence of past
similar criminal conduct was to be disregarded.

 

21.              The third ground, which was the principal
focus of the pleading in this Court, concerned the admissibility in evidence of
the intercepted conversations. Appellant stated it as follows:

 

[TRANSLATION]  Did the
Court of Appeal err in law in finding that the authorization to intercept
private conversations was legal and in accordance with the provisions of the
Criminal Code ?

 

22.              Appellant disputed the legality of the
authorization.

 

23.              The rules on the interception of
communications are contained in Part IV.1 of the Criminal Code , headed
""Invasion of Privacy"".

 

24.              The first rule is stated in s. 178.11(1) : 

 

                    178.11
(1) Every one who, by means of an electromagnetic, acoustic, mechanical or
other device, wilfully intercepts a private communication is guilty of an
indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for five years.

 

25.              Subsection (2)  of s. 178.11 lists the
exceptions, including:

 

                    (2)
Subsection (1) does not apply to

 

                                                                    ...

 

 (b) a person who
intercepts  a private communication in  accordance with an  authorization or
any person  who in good faith aids in any  way a person whom he has  reasonable
and probable  grounds to believe is acting  with any such authorization;

 

26.              Under s. 178.12(1) an authorization may be
obtained by an application accompanied by an

 

 ...affidavit which may be
sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer or public officer
deposing to the following matters, namely:

 

 (c) the facts
relied upon to  justify the belief that an  authorization should be given 
together with particulars of  the offence;

 

 (d) the type of
private  communication proposed to be  intercepted;

 

 (e) the names,
addresses and  occupations, if known, of all  persons, the interception of 
whose private communications  there are reasonable and  probable grounds to
believe  may assist the investigation  of the offence, a general  description
of the nature and  location of the place, if  known, at which private 
communications are proposed  to be intercepted and a  general description of
the  manner of interception  proposed to be used;

 

 (e.1) the number
of  instances, if any, on which  an application has been made  under this
section in  relation to the offence and  a person named in the  affidavit
pursuant to  paragraph (e) and on which  the application was  withdrawn
or no  authorization was given, the  date on which each such  application was
made and the  name of the judge to whom  each such application was  made;

 

 (f) the period for
which the  authorization is requested;  and

 

 (g) whether other 
investigative procedures have  been  tried and have failed or why  it appears
they are unlikely  to succeed or that the  urgency of the matter is such  that
it would be impractical  to carry out the  investigation of the offence  using
only other  investigative procedures.

 

27.              Section 178.13(2)  governs the content and
limitation of the authorization: 

 

                    178.13
(1) . . .

 

                    (2) An
authorization shall

 

 (a) state the
offence in respect of which private communications may be intercepted;

 

 (b) state the type
of private communication that may be intercepted;

 

 (c) state the
identity of the persons, if known, whose private communications are to be
intercepted, generally describe the place at which private communications may
be intercepted, if a general description of that place can be given, and
generally describe the manner of  interception that may be used;

 

 (d) contain such
terms and conditions as the judge considers advisable in the public interest;
and;

 

 (e) be valid for
the period, not exceeding sixty days, set forth therein.

 

28.              It is apparent from para. (c)
above, and the courts have consistently held, that an authorization must
contain limitations on the persons whose communications may be intercepted, the
place where they may be intercepted and the method of interception.

 

29.              The relevant portion of the authorization
in the case at bar states:

 

[TRANSLATION]  3. The
persons whose communications may be intercepted are:

 

 (a) William MURPHY
(building caretaker); and

 

 (b) certain other
persons whose identity is at present unknown, but who have acted, are acting or
may act in concert or in collusion with a person named in subparagraph (a) or
with a person found in one of the places named in paragraph 4, and whose
private communications may be intercepted by means of this authorization.

 

 4. The places or
localities where the private communications of the persons mentioned in
paragraph 3 may be intercepted are:

 

 (a) 620 St‑Jacques
West, Montréal, Que. (underground garage); and/or

 

 (b) any other place
or locality, stationary or mobile, where the persons named in paragraph 3 could
be found, but the nature and location of which are at present impossible to
specify.

 

30.              Appellant submitted that the authorization
was not in keeping with the provisions of the Code because it amounted
to a ""blank"" authorization. He challenged it on two grounds.

 

31.              First, he said that the person named,
William Murphy, was a ""straw man"". His name was used as a pretext for
obtaining authorization to intercept the private communications of any person
using the commercial building in question. 

 

32.              Second, because of paragraph 4(b), the
authorization was too wide and did not have the necessary limitations as to the
persons whose communications could be intercepted and the place where this
could be done. The authorization allowed [TRANSLATION]  ""interception of
almost any conversation of anyone"".

 

33.              On the first point, counsel for the
appellant wrote:

 

[TRANSLATION]  WILLIAM
MURPHY was arrested at the same time, but at his place of residence, and at
the preliminary inquiry the Crown withdrew the charge against him. WILLIAM
MURPHY then testified that he was only the caretaker of the building and had no
knowledge of the suspicious acts of the accused.

 

34.              The mere fact that the charge against
Murphy was withdrawn does not establish that the use of his name in the
application for authorization was a fiction. It might as well be said that, in
view of his function as a caretaker and the extent of the activities suspected,
and which in fact occurred in the building, the signatory of the sworn
statement could believe in good faith, at the time of the application for an
authorization, that he was in league with the others. The record as it stands
does not support the conclusion that appellant suggested, based on the
withdrawal of the charge.

 

35.              On the second point, in my opinion ‑‑
and I say so with respect for the contrary view ‑‑ paragraph 3(b),
read with paragraph 4(b), means that this authorization allowed the
conversations of anyone to be intercepted anywhere.

 

36.              The persons whose communications can be
intercepted are William Murphy and certain other persons whose identity is
unknown at present, provided the latter are in collusion with Murphy or in
collusion with someone at one of the places mentioned in paragraph 4. According
to paragraph 4(b), this includes anywhere that a person mentioned in paragraph
3 may be found, thus including persons whose identity is unknown.

 

37.              In my opinion, the authorization
consequently contains no limitation as to persons or place. 

 

38.              In R. v. Ritch (1982), 69 C.C.C.
(2d) 289, an authorization was ruled invalid and the communications intercepted
inadmissible in evidence for this reason. The judgment of the Alberta Court of
Appeal was affirmed by this Court sub nom. R. v. Brese, [1984] 2
S.C.R. 333. The Court stated ""We are in substantial agreement with the
majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal"". In Ritch, the relevant
portion of the authorization read as follows:

 

2.                The
types of communication that may be intercepted are:

 

 (a) any
telecommunication made by GARRY GORDON BRESE;

 

 (b) Any
telecommunication in respect of telephone number 468‑1421 located at
Suite #9, 6920‑101 Ave., Edmonton, Alta.  (walk‑up apartment
building) or any subsequent number as a result of change of address or
telephone number; and

 

 (c) any oral
communication made by GARRY GORDON BRESE and/or another person or persons at
Ste #9, 6920‑101 Ave.,  Edmonton, Alta. or at such other public or
private places within the jurisdiction of this Court as may be resorted to by
GARRY GORDON BRESE.

 

39.              The police had intercepted all calls
through the telephone number mentioned in paragraph (b), regardless of the
identity of the persons speaking, and the prosecution had entered some 120
telephone conversations in evidence. The question was whether paragraphs (a)
and (b) could be read together, so that the authorization in (a) was limited by
(b) as to place and that in (b) was limited by (a) as to persons. The Alberta
Court of Appeal held that, in view of the semi‑colon placed at the end of
paragraph (a), they could not be read with each other. The effect of this
punctuation mark was to make paragraphs (a) and (b) two separate authorizations
which did not contain the limitations, as to place in (a) and as to persons in
(b), required by s. 178.13(2) (c). All the conversations intercepted were
accordingly found to be inadmissible.

 

40.              At pages 294‑95, the Court said:

 

 If para. 2(a) and (b) are
to be read together the semicolon following the name ""Brese"" in para.
2(a) must be deleted, the letter ""(b)"", denoting the subparagraph,
must be deleted and, finally, the words ""any telecommunication"" where
they appear in para. 2(b) become redundant and must be deleted.

 

                    In our
view para. 2(c) is significant in that it demonstrates that when the framers of
the order wanted to combine name and location they did so in one paragraph.
True it is that para. 2(c) is concerned with oral communications, but that, in
our opinion, is irrelevant. Paragraph 2(c) adds further strength to the
argument that para. 2(a) and (b) cannot be read together. 

 

                    We
conclude that the investigating officers wanted a ""basket clause"",
they obtained what they thought was a ""basket clause"", and they acted
upon the authorization as if it was a ""basket clause"". They installed
a ""dead"" monitor and they intercepted all calls to and from the
telephone number specified in para. 2(b) without regard to the identity of the
persons involved. Certainly they treated that paragraph as separate and apart
from para. 2(a). Crown counsel now concede that para. 2(b) cannot stand alone.

 

                    It is
clear that para. 2(a) is unlawful. It has no limitation as to place and
purports to authorize a tap anywhere in Canada. As stated by counsel for Ritch
and Andrews it is ""like a search warrant without any limitation as to
place"".

 

41.              I note that the foregoing passage appears
to suggest that paragraph 2(c) was valid, as in concluding that paragraphs (a)
and (b) were invalid the Court emphasized the difference in wording between
them and paragraph (c); but the case was not concerned with paragraph 2(c).

 

42.              I therefore consider that if that were all
appellant should succeed.

 

43.              However, respondent submitted
alternatively that the authorization in the case at bar is severable and that
if paragraph 4(b) is excluded, it is perfectly valid. Accordingly, the
interceptions made under paragraphs 3(b) and 4(a) are admissible. All the
conversations at issue were intercepted at 620 St‑Jacques West, as coming
from the makeshift laboratory used by the accomplices.

 

44.              In Ritch paragraphs (a) and (b)
were considered separately, and were found to be invalid separately. On the
other hand, it would appear that paragraph (c) would probably have been found
to be valid. However, the question as presented in the case at bar, namely
whether an authorization may be severed into valid and invalid parts, was not
directly raised in Ritch.

 

45.              Nevertheless, in Ritch the Alberta
Court of Appeal relied essentially on a judgment of McQuaid J. of the Supreme
Court of Prince Edward Island, R. v. Blacquiere (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d)
330. In that case, McQuaid J. upheld certain parts of the impugned
authorizations and invalidated others. He ruled that certain intercepted
communications were admissible in respect of certain of the accused and
inadmissible in respect of another. 

 

46.              At page 332, McQuaid J. wrote:

 

                    The
above‑named accused, together with seven others, stands charged with
conspiracy to traffic in narcotics contrary to s. 423(1) (d) of the Criminal
Code . The trial of the matter commenced with a voir dire respecting
the admissibility of a large number of tapes of intercepted telephone
communications as between the several accused, together with the typed
transcript of selected portions of those tapes, all allegedly secured pursuant
to s. 178.1  (am. 1976‑77, c. 53, s. 7 ) of the Code. Before the
trial can proceed further, if indeed it can, it is necessary to rule on a
number of points respecting admissibility raised in argument both by the Crown
and the several counsel representing the accused.

 

47.              In that case the applicable portion of the
authorization read as follows:

 

 Wayne Ernest Blacquiere
of Summerside, in Prince County in the Province of Prince Edward Island,
labourer, and in respect of other persons whose identities are not known a
general description of the place at which private communications to and from
such persons may be intercepted is: 21 Heckbert Street, Apartment #3,
Summerside, Prince Edward Island and any other premises in the Province of
Prince Edward Island resorted to or used by the said Wayne Ernest Blacquiere or
any such person who is found to be in communication with the said Wayne Ernest
Blacquiere.

 

48.              For greater clarity, McQuaid J. divided
this paragraph into three, at p. 337:

 

                    The
first authorization was issued on December 4, 1978, effective from that date to
January 31, 1979, and contained the wording above quoted, which may be broken
down into three components:

 

 (a) Wayne Ernest
Blacquiere of Summerside, in Prince County in the Province of Prince Edward
Island, labourer;

 

 (b) and in respect
of other persons whose identities are not now known, a general description of
the place at which private  communications may be intercepted is: 21 Heckbert
St., Apartment No. 3, Summerside, Prince Edward Island;

 

 (c) (and in respect
to other persons whose identities are not now known), any other premises in the
Province of Prince Edward Island resorted to or used by the said Wayne Ernest
Blacquiere or any such person who is found to be in contact with the said Wayne
Ernest Blacquiere.

 

49.              Regarding the limitations on place and
persons which an authorization must contain as the legislation stands at
present, McQuaid J. said the following at p. 335: 

 

                    In the
present amended legislation, what is to be included is:

 

 (a) if the person
whose private communication is to be intercepted is known, the name of that
person together with the general identification of the place at which such
interception is to take place;

 

 (b) if the person
whose private communication is to be intercepted is not known the order must
contain the general identification of the place at which such interception is
to take place.

 

50.              McQuaid J. found part (a) of the
authorization invalid, because it contained no limitation as to place, and part
(c) invalid as well because it contained no limitation as to persons or place.
However, he found part (b) valid. At page 338, he wrote:

 

                    In my
view, since the authorization was defective, and thus ineffective, with respect
to Wayne Blacquiere, since it did not conform to the statutory requirement, and
since it would be illogical to sweep him into the basket clause if he was
precluded from being caught directly, the interception could not be said to be
a lawful one in so far as he was concerned. On the other hand, the same
interception was a lawful one in so far as the unknown was concerned under the
provisions of the basket clause. The answer, I think, is to take the position,
which I do, that any communication either to or from either 21 Heckbert St., or
384 North Market St., codes ""Blackie"" or ""Keli"", are not
admissible as against Blacquiere, but are admissible as against whomever is the
other party to any such communication. The same reasoning will apply to John
McLean respecting communications to or from 215 Linden St., and to Brian Perry
respecting communications to or from 1 Hillside Ave.

 

                    As to
segment (c) of the authorization, I would hold this to be a nullity, in as much
as it contains two unknowns, the identity of the person, and the location of
the telephone service. While this might have been permissible under the pre‑1977
legislation, it does not appear to be what is contemplated under the present
legislation.

 

                    Since
the legislation is primarily directed at the protection of privacy, it is
encumbent upon the Crown to bring itself clearly within the exceptions. I am of
the opinion that it has not done so in respect to segment (a) or (c) of the
authorization, but has done so in respect to segment (b), and to this extent I
would hold the authorization to be valid, and that all interceptions made which
fall under that category to have been lawfully made, subject to what has been
stated immediately above respecting those communications.

 

51.              In Ritch, affirmed by this Court,
the Alberta Court of Appeal cited several passages from the McQuaid judgment,
including the following at p. 294. It is the beginning of the preceding
passage, and I reproduce it again:

 

                    In my
view, since the authorization was defective, and thus ineffective, with respect
to Wayne Blacquiere, since it did not conform to the statutory requirement, and
since it would be illogical to sweep him into the basket clause if he was
precluded from being caught directly, the interception could not be said to be
a lawful one in so far as he was concerned. On the other hand, the same
interception was a lawful one in so far as the unknown was concerned under the
provisions of the basket clause. 

 

52.              Immediately following this, still at p.
294 of Ritch, there is the following passage by the Alberta Court of
Appeal:

 

                    Even
though in R. v. Blacquiere the authorization in issue did not divide the
telecommunications to be intercepted into subsections in the manner of the
authorizations before us the court there held that because the mandatory
requirement of s. 178.13 (2) (c) was not met the authorization was
unlawful as it affected the accused Blacquiere. The court refused to read the
operative part of the authorization as one.

 

                    With
respect we agree with the reasoning of McQuaid J. . . .

 

53.              In R. v. Paterson, Ackworth and Kovach
(1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 137, rendered on February 5, 1985, the Ontario Court of
Appeal unanimously held that an authorization was severable and that
interceptions made on the basis of the valid portions of the authorizations
were admissible.

 

54.              Among other clauses the authorization in
that case contained the following:

 

 (3)(b) Authorization is
also hereby given to intercept the private communications of persons whose
identities are presently unknown, in accordance with the terms of this
Authorization, provided that there are reasonable and probable grounds to
believe that the interception of such private communications may assist the
investigation of any of the offences stated in paragraph 1 above, whether or
not any such person described in paragraph 3(a) above is party to such private
communications.

 

55.              About this clause Martin J.A. wrote for
the Court at p. 148:

 

                    Paragraph
3(b) of the authorization granted by Judge McCart does not restrict the
interception of private communications of unknown persons to persons at
particular premises as in R. v. Samson et al. (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d)
194....Nor does the authorization restrict the interception of private
communications of unknown persons to persons who are associating with, dealing
with or in contact with the named persons in respect of which the authorization
is granted. In my view, the ""basket clause"" is invalid.

 

56.              Martin J.A. further wrote, at p. 149:

 

                    The
invalidity of the ""basket clause"" is, however, of no assistance to
the respondents in the present case, since it is clear that it was never used.
All private communications intercepted under Judge McCart's authorization took
place at 124 Cantley Cres. in London, the residence of Brian Daley. Brian Daley
was a party to each of the communications, save in an interception on June 28,
1982 between Daley and the respondent Paterson when Daley broke off the
conversation temporarily and apparently requested his wife, Helen Daley, to talk
to Paterson, while he went to the bathroom. On Brian Daley's return he resumed
his conversation with Paterson. The brief conversation between Helen Daley and
Paterson, even if inadmissible, was of little consequence in light of the other
evidence. 

 

57.              He went on:

 

                    Further,
I am of the opinion that the ""basket clause"" is severable and does
not affect the validity of the balance of the authorization.

 

58.              Martin J.A. concluded on this point, at
pp. 149‑50:

 

                    In the
present case, there is a clear line of demarcation between the good and the bad
parts of the authorization; they are not interwoven. The offending paragraph is
not vital to the part of the authorization relating to the interception of the
private communications of named persons and its excision in the circumstances
of this case does not subvert the policy of the legislation. In the present
case, since all the interceptions were made pursuant to the valid part of the
authorization, the necessity for separating evidence flowing from the valid and
invalid parts does not arise. The ""basket clause"" was never resorted
to, it generated no evidence, nor any derivative evidence.

 

59.              The Alberta Court of Appeal relied on this
case in R. v. Munroe (1985), 38 Alta. L.R. (2d) 189. Kerans J.A.,
speaking for the Court, separated the objectionable part from the valid part of
an authorization the remainder of which was in accordance with the law.

 

60.              I adopt the passages cited above from
Martin J.A.

 

61.              When there is a clear dividing line
between the good and bad parts of an authorization, and they are not so
interwoven that they cannot be separated but are actually separate
authorizations given in the same order, the Court in my opinion can divide the
order and preserve the valid portion, which then forms the authorization. In
such a case interceptions made under the valid authorization are admissible.

 

62.              If paragraph 4(b) is excluded in the case
at bar, the authorization is perfectly valid. As in Paterson and Munroe,
the offending paragraph was not used in any way. All the interceptions were
made at 620 St‑Jacques West. I consider that paragraph 4(b) can be
excluded and that the conversations intercepted by authority of an otherwise
valid authorization are admissible.

 

63.              For these reasons, I would dismiss the
appeal.

on appeal from the court of appeal for alberta

 

                   Constitutional law ‑‑ Charter of Rights  ‑‑
Self‑incrimination ‑‑ Retrial ‑‑ First trial
taking place prior to proclamation of Charter ‑‑ Incriminating evidence
given by accused at first trial not admissible against him at second trial ‑‑
Protection against self‑incrimination guaranteed by s. 13 of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

 

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Evidence ‑‑
Admissibility ‑‑ Self‑incrimination ‑‑ Retrial ‑‑
Accused's evidence at first trial not admissible against him at second trial ‑‑
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , s. 13 .

 








                   Appellant was convicted by a jury of second degree
murder but the Court of Appeal granted a new trial on grounds of misdirection
to the jury. At the second trial, held after the proclamation of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms , the Crown introduced as evidence
appellant's testimony given voluntarily at his first trial. Defence counsel objected
arguing that it was contrary to s. 13  of the Charter  which provided that
""A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have any
incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any other
proceedings...."" The trial judge ruled that the protection against self‑incrimination
guaranteed by s. 13  did not apply as the Charter  came into force after
appellant had testified in his first trial. Appellant was again convicted. His
appeal, on the sole ground that his first trial testimony should have been
excluded, was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that the second trial was not
""any other proceedings"" within the meaning of the section and
therefore appellant could not invoke s. 13  under these circumstances. 

 

                   Held (McIntyre J.
dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

 

                   Per Dickson C.J. and
Estey, Chouinard, Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain JJ.: Section 13  of the Charter 
precludes the admission at the second trial of the evidence given by the appellant
at his first trial. The purpose of s. 13 , when the section is viewed in the
context of s. 11 (c) and (d) ‑‑ the right of non‑compellability
and the presumption of innocence ‑‑ is to protect individuals from
being indirectly compelled to incriminate themselves. This protection inures to
an individual at the moment an attempt is made to utilize previous testimony to
incriminate him. The time at which the previous testimony is given is
irrelevant. Thus, no issue of retrospectivity arises in this case since the
attempt to use appellant's testimony occurred after the coming into force of
the Charter .

 

                   The fact that s. 13  is framed in the present tense,
does not preclude it from applying in a situation where the witness in question
was the accused and when the testimony in issue had been given previously. The
phrase ""A witness who testifies..."" merely clarifies that the word
""witness"" includes a voluntary witness.

 

                   Although s. 13 refers twice to the notion of
incrimination, the evidence in issue need not be incriminating in the first
proceeding in which it was given and in the second where the Crown attempts to
use it. The purpose of the section clearly indicates that the incriminating
nature of the evidence must be evaluated only in the second proceeding. Any
evidence the Crown tenders as part of its case against the accused is, for the
purpose of s. 13, incriminating evidence.

 

                   A retrial of the same offence falls within the
meaning of the words ""any other proceedings"". The courts must
interpret each section of the Charter  in relation to the others. Here,
to allow the Crown to use, as part of its case, the accused's previous
testimony would in effect allow the Crown to do indirectly what it is estopped
from doing directly by s. 11 (c), i.e., to compel the accused to
testify. It would also permit an indirect violation of the right of the accused
to be presumed innocent and remain silent until proven guilty by the Crown, as
guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter . Such a result should be
avoided.

 

                   Finally, assuming that s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of
the Criminal Code  can apply to a Charter  violation and to a
remedy under s. 24 , given the nature of the evidence, this would not be a
proper case for applying the proviso. 

 

                   Per McIntyre J., dissenting:
Where a court of appeal quashes a conviction and orders a new trial, s. 13  of
the Charter  does not preclude the admission at the second trial of the
evidence given by the accused at his first trial. A new trial cannot, on a fair
reading of s. 13 , be considered as another proceeding. The word
""proceedings"" in s. 13 , means, in a criminal case, all judicial steps
taken upon one charge to resolve and reach a final conclusion of the issue
therein raised between the same party and the Crown. This would include the
preliminary hearing, the trial, and an appeal and a new trial. Therefore, while
s. 13  provides a wider protection against self‑incrimination than that
provided by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act , the section does not
apply to evidence voluntarily given at a different stage in the same
proceedings.

 

                   Although appellant cannot be compelled to give
evidence at his second trial, this protection, provided by s. 11 (c) of
the Charter , does not extend to bar the use in evidence of earlier
voluntarily statements that he has made which are clearly relevant to the
issues.

                   The judgment of Dickson C.J. and Estey, Chouinard,
Lamer, Wilson and Le Dain JJ. was delivered by 

 

1.                Lamer
J.‑‑When a new trial is ordered on the same charge or on an
included offence by a court of appeal, can the Crown adduce as evidence‑in‑chief
the testimony given by an accused at the former trial? That question was
addressed by this Court prior to the coming into force of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (Constitution Act, 1982 , as enacted
by the Canada Act 1982, 1982 (U.K.), c. 11), in a different legal
setting, in R. v. Brown (No. 2) (1963), 40 C.R. 105, and answered
affirmatively. It now comes back to us because of s. 13  of the Charter .

 

The Facts

 

2.                The appellant was charged in Alberta
with second degree murder. At his trial before Rowbotham J. sitting with a
jury, the appellant gave evidence in his defence, admitting that he had killed
the deceased but also alleging certain circumstances of justification. The
appellant did not invoke the protection of s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10. The appellant was convicted, but successfully
appealed the conviction to the Alberta Court of Appeal and was granted a new
trial on grounds of misdirection to the jury: (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 494. At
the new trial, the Crown read in the appellant's testimony from the first trial
over the objection of appellant's counsel, such objection based on s. 13  of the
Charter . The appellant chose not to testify nor did he call any
evidence. He was again convicted. He appealed again to the Alberta Court of
Appeal on the sole ground that the trial judge erred in admitting into
evidence, as part of the Crown's case, the testimony of the appellant from his
former trial. The appeal was dismissed: (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 453, 9 C.R.R.
61, 39 C.R. (3d) 281, 31 Alta. L.R. (2d) 16, 8 D.L.R. (4th) 589, 51 A.R. 210,
[1984] 3 W.W.R. 594. The accused now comes to this Court.

 

3.                The Charter  had not come into
force at the time the appellant testified in his first trial but was in force
when Crown counsel adduced his evidence‑in‑chief in the second
trial. 

 

The Statutes

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 

 

                   13. A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have
any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any
other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of
contradictory evidence.

 

                   13. Chacun a droit à ce qu'aucun témoignage incriminant qu'il donne ne
soit utilisé pour l'incriminer dans d'autres procédures, sauf lors de
poursuites pour parjure ou pour témoignages contradictoires.

 

Canada Evidence Act 

 

                   5. (1) No witness shall be excused from answering any question upon the
ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him, or may tend
to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown
or of any person.

 

                   (2)
Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground
that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his
liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person,
and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness
would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although
the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act,
compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in
evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding
against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in
the giving of such evidence.

 

The Judgments

 

Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench

 

4.                Moshansky J. admitted into evidence the
appellant's previous testimony, holding that s. 13  of the Charter  did
not apply as the Charter  did not come into force until after the
appellant had testified in his first trial: (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 273, 6 C.R.R.
125. He stated that since s. 13  is framed in the present tense, it is intended
to apply to a witness who testifies rather than to one who has testified on
some previous occasion.

 

5.                The trial judge then went on to say that
regardless of the retrospectivity question, s. 13  would still not apply as the
section is intended to apply to a witness rather than to an accused. He did not
find it necessary to deal with the argument concerning the meaning of the words
""other proceedings"" in s. 13 . 

 

Alberta Court of Appeal

 

6.                The court ruled that the evidence was
admissible, although it disagreed with the trial judge's finding that s. 13  did
not apply because of the retrospectivity argument. The court held that s. 13 
did apply in a situation where the witness in question was the accused and when
the testimony in question had been given previously. The court stated that s.
13  in effect sets forth ""the right to have the testimony not used"".
However, the court ruled that the second trial is not ""any other
proceedings"" and therefore the accused could not invoke s. 13  under these
circumstances.

 

7.                Respondent Crown takes the view that s.
13  could not be invoked by the accused at his second trial because it applied
only to testimony given after the advent of the Charter , that in any
event the evidence in this case when given was not ""incriminating"",
and furthermore, that a retrial is not ""any other proceedings"".
Finally, the respondent invokes, as a subsidiary argument, s. 613(1) (b)(iii)
of the Criminal Code .

 

8.                As I am of the view that this appeal
should succeed, I will address all of the issues raised by the respondent in
support of the Court of Appeal's conclusion to dismiss the accused's appeal.

 

Nature and Purpose of s. 13 

 

9.                A plain reading of s. 13  indicates that
the guarantee it provides is directed against self‑incrimination through
the use of one's previous testimony. It is a very specific form of protection
against self‑incrimination and must therefore be viewed in the light of
two closely related rights, the right of non‑compellability and the
presumption of innocence, set forth in s. 11 (c) and (d) of the Charter :


 

                   11. Any person charged with an offence has the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(c) not to be
compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the
offence;

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

10.              Section 11 (d) imposes upon the
Crown the burden of proving the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as
well as that of making out the case against the accused before he or she need
respond, either by testifying or by calling other evidence. As Laskin J. (as he
then was) wrote in R. v. Appleby, [1972] S.C.R. 303, at p. 317:

 

The ""right to be
presumed innocent"" ...is, in popular terms, a way of expressing the fact
that the Crown has the ultimate burden of establishing guilt; if there is any
reasonable doubt at the conclusion of the case on any element of the offence
charged, an accused person must be acquitted. In a more refined sense, the
presumption of innocence gives an accused the initial benefit of a right of
silence and the ultimate benefit (after the Crown's evidence is in and as well
any evidence tendered on behalf of the accused) of any reasonable doubt: see Coffin
v. U.S. (1895), 156 U.S. 432 at 452.

 

11.              The Crown's ""burden of establishing
guilt"" and the ""right of silence"", i.e., the concept of a
""case to meet"", which are essential elements of the presumption of
innocence, also underlie the non‑compellability right. For, as Professor
Ratushny has written,

 

                   In many
ways, it is the principle of a `case to meet' which is the real underlying
protection which the `non‑compellability' rule seeks to promote. The
important protection is not that the accused need not testify, but that the
Crown must prove its case before there can be any expectation that he will
respond, whether by testifying himself, or by calling other evidence. However,
even where a `case to meet' has been presented, the burden of proof remains
upon the Crown to the end.

 

12.              (""The Role of the Accused in the
Criminal Process"", in Tarnopolsky and Beaudoin (eds.), The Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms  (1982), at pp. 358‑59.)

 

The accused need only
respond once. The Crown must present its evidence at an open trial. The accused
is entitled to test and to attack it. If it does not reach a certain standard,
the accused is entitled to an acquittal. If it does reach that standard, then
and only then is the accused required to respond or to stand convicted.

 

13.              (Self‑incrimination in the
Canadian Criminal Process (1979), at p. 180.) 

 

14.              As such, the concept of the ""case to
meet"" is common to ss. 11 (c), (d) and 13 . In the context of
ss. 11 (c) and 13 , it means specifically that the accused enjoys
""the initial benefit of a right of silence"" (R. v. Appleby, supra)
and its corollary, protection against self‑incrimination. Section 13 ,
like s. 11 (c), is a recognition of the principle that,

 

...the individual is
sovereign and that proper rules of battle between government and individual
require that the individual not be bothered for less than good reason and not
be conscripted by his opponent to defeat himself.

 

15.              (Wigmore on Evidence, vol. 8
(McNaughton rev. 1961), para. 2251, at p. 318.)

 

16.              Hence, the purpose of s. 13 , when the
section is viewed in the context of s. 11 (c) and (d), is to
protect individuals from being indirectly compelled to incriminate themselves,
to ensure that the Crown will not be able to do indirectly that which s. 11 (c)
prohibits. It guarantees the right not to have a person's previous testimony
used to incriminate him or her in other proceedings.

 

17.              The consequences which flow from the
nature and purpose of the right enunciated in s. 13  touch upon the following
issues:

 

1. Whether the
section applies to a witness who testifies or to a person who has testified on
a previous occasion, that is, the determination of the beneficiary of the
right;

 

2. the interpretation
of the terms ""incriminating evidence"" and ""used to
incriminate"";

 

3.                the interpretation of the terms ""any other
proceedings"".

 

18.              For reasons hereinafter stated, while s.
11 (c) and (d) both have a bearing on the determination of these
three issues, s. 11 (c) (non‑compellability) is determinative as
regards the first two, whilst s. 11 (d) (the burden of proof and the
concept of the case to meet) is determinative of the third question, the
meaning of ""any other proceedings"".

 

19.              I shall address each in turn. 

 

The Beneficiary of the Right

 

20.              In my view, s. 13  is not being given in
this case a retrospective effect. As I have indicated earlier, s. 13 
guarantees the right not to have a person's previous testimony used to
incriminate him or her in other proceedings. That right came into force on
April 17, 1982, the date of the coming into force of the Charter .
However, given the nature and purpose of the right, it inures to an individual
at the moment an attempt is made to utilize previous testimony to incriminate
him or her. The time at which the previous testimony was given is irrelevant
for the purpose of determining who may or may not claim the benefit of s. 13 .
As of April 17, 1982, all persons acquired the right not to have evidence
previously given used to incriminate them. The protection accorded by the right
is related not to the moment the testimony is given, but to the moment at which
an attempt is made to use that evidence in an incriminating fashion.

 

21.              The fact of having given previous
testimony is no more than a requisite for the operation of s. 13 . To quote
Martin J.A. in R. v. Antoine (1983), 5 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at pp. 102‑03:

 

An enactment does not,
however, operate retrospectively because a part of the requisites for its
operation is drawn from a time antecedent to its coming into force, nor because
it takes into account past events: see R. v. Johnston (1977), 34 C.C.C.
(2d) 325, [1977] 2 W.W.R. 613, 37 C.R.N.S. 234; affirmed [1978] 2 S.C.R. 391,
39 C.C.C. (2d) 479n, [1978] 2 W.W.R. 478 (S.C.C.); R. v. Negridge
(1980), 54 C.C.C. (2d) 304, 17 C.R. (3d) 14, 6 M.V.R. 255 (Ont. C.A.).

 

22.              As section 13 guarantees the right of a
person against self‑incrimination, rather than the rights of a witness
giving testimony, it inures to an individual only at the moment an attempt is
made to use previous testimony to incriminate its author. Since in this case
the attempt to use Dubois' previous testimony occurred after the coming into
force of the Charter , there arises here no issue of retrospectivity.

 

23.              The Crown has argued that the right
expressed in s. 13 accrues only to an individual who is a ""witness"",
that the right is given ""to an individual qua witness and not qua
accused"". The Crown seeks support for this position in the fact that the
section speaks in the present tense. The protection, it is argued, is given to
""a witness who testifies and not to a witness who has testified"".
That argument was answered in part by Kerans J.A. of the Alberta Court of
Appeal in the present case reported at (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 453 where he
stated at p. 455: 

 

It is argued correctly for
the Crown that, on the day on which the Charter  came into force, the accused
was a witness who had testified, and not a witness who was yet to testify. But
the expression `a witness who testifies' was inserted in the Charter  in
substitution of the draft words `a witness...when compelled to testify' in
order to remove doubt whether a technically voluntary witness, such as an
accused, can assert the protection of the section. The words `who testifies'
merely clarify that `witness' includes a voluntary witness: see the analysis by
Grotsky J. in R. v. Staranchuk (1982), 3 C.C.C. (3d) 138, [1983] 2
W.W.R. 145, 45 C.B.R. (N.S.) 200 (overruled on other grounds 8 C.C.C. (3d) 150,
3 D.L.R. (4th) 574, [1983] 6 W.W.R. 729). I therefore accept the contention for
the accused that the right to prevent incriminating use of previous testimony
extends to all witnesses, and whenever they testify.

 

24.              Section 13, unlike s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , does not require any objection on the part of the person
giving the testimony, nor does it refer to any compulsion to answer. Indeed, as
noted by Kerans J.A. in the passage quoted above, the ""compulsion to
answer"" requirement, which was set forth in a previous draft of s. 13 , was
ultimately removed from the final version of the section. Thus, the legislative
history of the provision indicates that "" `witness' includes a
voluntary witness"".

 

25.              Moreover, given the nature and purpose of
the right, which is essentially protection against self‑incrimination,
the issue of whether the testimony was compulsory or voluntary at the moment it
was given is largely irrelevant. The focus of the right is on the second proceedings,
the time at which the previous testimony is sought to be used, rather than the
time at which it is given.

 

26.              For these reasons, s. 13, in my view,
applies as much to testimony voluntarily given by an accused as to testimony given
by a witness under compulsion.

 

27.              The Crown has relied upon the case of Marcoux
v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 763, in support of its position. In that
case, Dickson J., (as he then was), speaking for the Court, stated that the
privilege against self‑incrimination extended to the accused ""qua
witness and not qua accused"". However, in that case Dickson J. was
delineating the scope of the privilege in relation to a refusal by a suspect to
participate in an identification line‑up and thus contrasting testimonial
compulsion with other forms of compulsion. He stated, at pp. 768‑69:


 

The privilege,
historically and comprehensively analyzed in 8 Wigmore on Evidence
(McNaughton revision 1961) art. 2250, pp. 284 et seq., developed in revulsion
from the system of interrogation practised in the old ecclesiastical courts and
the Star Chamber, i.e. summoning a person, without giving him warning of
the charge against him, and examining him on oath. The general rule evolved
that no one was bound to answer any question if the answer would tend to expose
him to a criminal charge. As applied to witnesses generally, the privilege must
be expressly claimed by the witness when the question is put to him in the
witness box, Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10, s. 5. As
applied to an accused, the privilege is the right to stand mute. An accused
cannot be asked, much less compelled, to enter the witness box or to answer
incriminating questions. If he chooses to testify, the protective shield, of course,
disappears. In short, the privilege extends to the accused qua witness
and not qua accused, it is concerned with testimonial compulsion
specifically and not with compulsion generally ....

 

28.              Marcoux thus stands for the proposition
that the protection against self‑incrimination is not functionally
operative at the pre‑trial stage of a police line‑up. It in no way
shores up the argument advanced by the Crown.

 

29.              My view, therefore, is that the protection
of s. 13  operates at the second proceedings; consequently the time at
which the previous testimony was given and the question of whether it was given
voluntarily or under compulsion are irrelevant. I am strengthened in this view
by a brief analysis of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  in relation to
s. 13  of the Charter . 

 

30.              At common law, a witness had the privilege
of refusing to answer a question where the answer would tend to criminate him
or her. That common law privilege has been abolished by s. 5(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act . Section 5(2) of the Act provides, however, that:

 

                   (2)
Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer ... although the
witness is ... compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or
receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal
proceeding against him thereafter taking place ....

 

31.              This limited form of protection against
self‑incrimination clearly has no application to the proceedings in which
the testimony is taken and applies only to subsequent proceedings (Di Iorio
v. Warden of the Montreal Jail, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 152 at pp. 219‑20).
It applies, in other words, in subsequent proceedings in which the former
witness has become the accused. Hence section 5(2) has to some extent shifted
the focus of the protection against self‑incrimination from the
proceedings in which the testimony is given to subsequent proceedings in which
the witness has become the accused.

 

32.              The focus on the subsequent proceedings is
even more pronounced in s. 13  of the Charter , which does not refer to
any compulsion to answer at the time of the testimony nor to any objection to
answer on the part of the accused. Consequently, although s. 13  refers to
""A witness who testifies"", it is, like its predecessor, designed to
be operative and to protect the interests of the person in the subsequent
proceedings. Indeed, it is even clearer in s. 13  that the right functions at
the level of the ""other proceedings"".

 

33.              For these reasons, the Crown cannot, in my
view, succeed in this portion of its argument.

 

Incriminating Evidence

 

34.              The wording of the section refers twice to
the notion of incrimination. According to the Crown, this means that the
evidence in issue must, (1) have been incriminating in the first proceedings in
which it was given, and (2) be incriminating in the second proceedings where the
Crown attempts to use it. 

 

35.              Although a literal reading of the section
supports the position of the Crown, I am nevertheless of the view that s. 13 
does not require that the incriminating character of the evidence be evaluated in
the first proceedings as well as in the second. Indeed, the literal approach
defeats the nature and purpose of the section and furthermore leads to
absurdity. When such is the case, the literal approach should not prevail
unless the language used is of ""absolute intractability"", which is
not the case here. The comments of Anglin J. in Regina Public School
District v. Gratton Separate School District (1915), 50 S.C.R. 589, at p.
624 are, in my view, appropriate to the Charter  context:

 

Only `absolute
intractability of the language used' can justify a construction which defeats
what is clearly the main object of a statute.

 

                                                                    ...

 

It would be contrary to
sound construction to permit the use of a term not altogether apt to defeat the
intention of the legislature, which must not be assumed to have foreseen every
result that may accrue from the use of a particular word.

 

This Court has already adopted a purposive approach in the context of
the Charter 's interpretation: see Hunter v. Southam Inc., [1984]
2 S.C.R. 145; R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295. As
elaborated in the preceding pages of this judgment, the purpose of the section
indicates that the only moment in time which is relevant to the assessment of
the incriminating nature of the evidence is the second proceedings.

 

36.              As regards absurdity, in a great many
cases, whether evidence is incriminating or not can only be properly assessed
at the time it is being used in the subsequent proceedings, at the time when
the Crown seeks to make use of the evidence. How, for example, could one assess
the incriminating nature of evidence at the first proceedings, when the witness
is not necessarily the accused and when the crime for which the witness may
subsequently be charged may not even yet have been committed.

 

37.              The decision of this Court in Piché v.
The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 23, presents additional support for the view that
the incriminating nature of the evidence must be evaluated in the second
proceedings. In that case, a majority of this Court held that the admission in
evidence of statements made by an accused to persons in authority, whether
inculpatory or exculpatory at the time they were made, was governed by the same
considerations that is, by reference to the use which the Crown sought to make
of it rather than by its content. 

 

38.              In the context of s. 13 , the use which the
Crown seeks to make of the evidence can only be ascertained at the time of the
second proceedings.

 

39.              For all of these reasons, I would reject
the Crown's argument that the evidence in issue must be incriminating in both
the first and second proceedings.

 

40.              I am also of the view that any evidence
the Crown tenders as part of its case against an accused is, for the purpose of
s. 13 , incriminating evidence. The Crown tenders evidence to support its case
and obtain a conviction; it knows best what is incriminating. In a sense, the
Crown could be said to be estopped from arguing that the evidence it tenders to
that end is not incriminating. Since in this case, the Crown is tendering the
evidence as part of its case, which clearly comes within the meaning of
""used to incriminate"", we need not here address the question of
whether those words include resort to the previous testimony for the purpose of
cross‑examining the accused, were the latter to choose to take the stand
again in his or her own defence.

 

Any Other Proceedings

 

41.              Having established that s. 13  is a form of
protection against self‑incrimination, it is still necessary to consider
whether this implies that an accused who has chosen to testify should be
protected in a retrial of the same offence or one included therein.

 

42.              I do not see how the evidence given by the
accused to meet the case as it was in the first trial could become part of the
Crown's case against the accused in the second trial, without being in
violation of s. 11 (d), and to a lesser extent of s. 11 (c). For,
the accused is being conscripted to help the Crown in discharging its
burden of a case to meet, and is thereby denied his or her right to
stand mute until a case has been made out. 

 

43.              To allow the prosecution to use, as part
of its case, the accused's previous testimony would, in effect, allow the Crown
to do indirectly what it is estopped from doing directly by s. 11 (c), i.e.
to compel the accused to testify. It would also permit an indirect violation of
the right of the accused to be presumed innocent and remain silent until proven
guilty by the prosecution, as guaranteed by s. 11 (d) of the Charter .
Our constitutional Charter  must be construed as a system where
""Every component contributes to the meaning as a whole, and the whole
gives meaning to its parts"" (P. A. Côté writing about statutory
interpretation in The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (1984), at
p. 236). The courts must interpret each section of the Charter  in
relation to the others (see, for example, R. v. Carson (1983), 20 M.V.R.
54 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Konechny, [1984] 2 W.W.R. 481 (B.C.C.A.); Reference
re Education Act of Ontario and Minority Language Education Rights (1984),
47 O.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.); R. v. Antoine, supra). To hold that a new
trial is not ""any other proceedings"" within the meaning of s. 13 
would in fact authorize an interpretation of a Charter  right which would
imply a violation of another Charter  right. Such a result should be
avoided.

 

44.              A retrial of the same offence or one
included therein, ordered by a court of appeal, is therefore ""other
proceedings"" within the meaning of s. 13 .

 

45.              Concern has been expressed as regards the
logical extension of this reasoning to the admissibility of evidence given by
an accused at the preliminary inquiry under s. 469  of the Criminal Code .
The matter is not raised on this appeal. But, even assuming without deciding
that a preliminary inquiry is another proceeding, the question then to be
addressed is whether s. 469  would be, under s. 1  of the Charter , an
unreasonable limit to the protections afforded by s. 13 . Relevant to this
determination would, amongst other considerations, be the nature of the
jeopardy in which an accused is placed, at that stage, if he chooses not to
testify at the preliminary to rebut the ""prima facie case"". 

 

46.              Because of the Crown's great reliance on
this Court's endorsement of Johnson J.A.'s remarks in R. v. Brown (No. 2),
supra, I feel something must be said on the matter before concluding.
That was a case where the Northwest Territories Court of Appeal (1963), 40 C.R.
90 had found that when a new trial is ordered because the first trial was a
mistrial, the accused's evidence given at the first trial is not admissible in
evidence against him at the second trial. Johnson J.A. dissented, and said that
it was admissible. This Court reversed the Court of Appeal and adopted Johnson
J.A.'s reasons. With respect, Johnson J.A.'s ratio decidendi is
uncertain. It is difficult to ascertain to what extent the judge's dissent is
dependent upon the fact that the accused did not object to answer, assuming he
could have under the law, thereby bringing himself within the protection
afforded by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . The decision in Brown
would not be an impediment to what I find is the proper construction of s. 13 
of the Charter  were it not for the following passage in Johnson J.A.'s
reasons, at p. 101:

 

This privilege may be
waived, and, of course, waiver takes place when a witness voluntarily enters
the witness‑box and, without claiming the protection afforded by s. 5(2) 
of the Canada Evidence Act , gives evidence of a criminating nature. In Chambers
v. Chambers (No. 2), [(1960), 31 W.W.R. 399], the court held that the
privilege once waived could be reclaimed in the second trial between the same
parties. Applying that rule to the present case, it is obvious that, because
the appellant had waived the privilege of testifying at his first trial, he
cannot be compelled by the Crown to enter the witness‑box and give the
same evidence at the second. But it is said that admitting this evidence in
the way it was done here amounts to calling the accused as a Crown witness without
allowing him the right of refusing to testify. This argument is best answered
in the words of Lord Campbell C.J. in the Regina v. Scott case, supra,
p. 59. Referring to the accused, his Lordship says:

 

                   ""The
accusation of himself was an accomplished fact, and at the trial he was not
called upon to accuse himself. The maxim relied upon (nemo tenetur seipsum
accusare) applies to the time when the question is put, not to the use
which the prosecutor seeks to make of the answer when the answer has been given.""

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

47.              The Scott case (R. v. Scott
(1856), Dears. & B. 47, 169 E.R. 909) concerns a bankrupt who was, under
the laws of England, bound by statute to answer all questions touching matters
relating to his trade dealings. He did so and was subsequently prosecuted under
the same statute for having mutilated his business book and records. This was a
clear statutory exception to the protection given under the common law maxim
""nemo tenetur seipsum accusare"". In his judgment, Lord
Campbell C.J. said, at p. 59: 

 

Finally, the defendant's
counsel relies upon the great maxim of English law ""nemo tenetur se
ipsum accusare."" So undoubtedly says the common law of England. But
Parliament may take away this privilege, and enact that a party may be bound to
accuse himself; that is, that he must answer questions by answering which he
may be criminated. This Act of Parliament, 12 & 13 Vict. c. 106, creates
felonies and misdemeanors, and compels the bankrupt to answer questions which
may shew that he has been guilty of some of those felonies or misdemeanors. The
maxim of the common law therefore has been overruled by the Legislature, and
the defendant has been actually compelled to give and has given answers,
shewing that he is guilty of the misdemeanor with which he is charged. The
accusation of himself was an accomplished fact, and at the trial he was not
called upon to accuse himself.

 

It is immediately after having said this, that his Lordship added the
passage later quoted by Johnson J.A.,

 

The maxim relied upon
applies to the time when the question is put, not to the use which the
prosecutor seeks to make of the answer when the answer has been given.

 

48.              Of no little importance when considering
the meaning of those words, are those immediately following:

 

If the party has been
unlawfully compelled to answer the question, he shall be protected against any
prejudice from the answer thus illegally extorted; but a similar protection
cannot be demanded where the question was lawful and the party examined was
bound by law to answer it.

 

49.              Therefore, the reference by Lord Campbell
C.J. to the time the maxim applies, is in relation to the legality of
compelling the answer. It has, with respect, nothing to do with, and is not an
answer, let alone the best answer, to the question phrased by Johnson J.A., i.e.,
whether admitting the evidence in the Brown case in the way it was being
done then amounts to calling the accused as a Crown witness without allowing
him or her the right of refusing to testify.

 

50.              In any event, whatever may have been the
ultimate ratio decidendi of the decision of this Court in R. v. Brown
(No. 2), supra, that decision can be distinguished from the present
case on many grounds. First, Brown was rendered prior to the coming into
force of the Charter  and the new right which it sets forth in s. 13 .
Secondly, it is difficult to ascertain to what extent Johnson J.A.'s dissent,
adopted ""in substance"" by this Court, is dependent upon the fact that
the accused did not object to answer, thereby failing to bring himself within
the protection afforded by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act , assuming
of course that the protection of the section is available to an accused
testifying in his own defence. 

 

51.              In any event, had the common law maxim of
""nemo tenetur seipsum accusare"" and s. 5  of the Canada
Evidence Act  been interpreted in the light of the Charter , as they
now must be, I would venture to suggest that a different result may well have
ensued in R. v. Brown (No. 2), supra.

 

52.              Although the constitutionality of s. 5(2) 
of the Canada Evidence Act  was not in issue in the case at bar, it is
clear that it must now be interpreted in the light of the Charter  and,
if it is found to be inconsistent therewith, it will be of no force or effect
to the extent of the inconsistency.

 

53.              For these reasons, the protection of s.
13 , in my view, covers a retrial.

 

Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code 

 

54.              Both parties to this appeal, when
addressing the applicability of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , dealt with the adduction of the testimony as if it were an ordinary
error of law and argued pro and con the issue as to whether or not it caused a
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. No one addressed the question of
the relationship, if any, between a Charter  violation and the available
remedy under s. 24  of the Charter  on the one hand, and the proviso of s.
613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  on the other. This important
question should be left to be decided in another case. Assuming without
deciding that s. 613(1) (b)(iii) can apply to a Charter  violation
and to a remedy under s. 24 , given the nature of the evidence, I am of the view
that this would not, in any event, be a proper case for applying the proviso.

 

55.              I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and order a new trial. 

 

                   The following are the reasons delivered by

 

56.              McIntyre
J. (dissenting)‑‑This appeal in‑ volves, for
the first time in this Court, consideration of the effect of s. 13  of the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms . It is the sole issue raised before us.

 

57.              The facts may be simply stated. The
appellant was charged in an indictment which charged that he:

 

...at Calgary, in the
Judicial District of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, on or about the 6th
day of March, A.D. 1980, did unlawfully kill Bruno Williams and did thereby
commit second degree murder, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

The appellant gave evidence at his trial and was convicted. Although he
was represented by counsel he did not in giving his evidence, nor in the cross‑examination,
object to any questions. Accordingly, the provisions of s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  did not come into play to protect him against any later use of
his evidence in a criminal trial. He appealed his conviction. The Court of
Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a new trial: (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d)
494. The Court of Appeal allowed the appellant's appeal on the basis of
misdirection or non‑ direction on the defences raised by the appellant's
evidence. At the new trial, the Crown read in as part of its case the evidence
the appellant had given at his earlier trial. This evidence consisted of sixty
pages of transcript and contained an admission that he, the appellant, had
killed the deceased, alleging certain circumstances in justification. The
appellant objected to this evidence being received. He based his objection on
s. 13  of the Charter . The appellant called no evidence at his second
trial and was convicted. A further appeal was taken. The Court of Appeal
(Laycraft C.J.A., Harradence and Kerans JJ.A.) unanimously dismissed the
appeal: (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 453, 9 C.R.R. 61, 39 C.R. (3d) 281, 31 Alta.
L.R. (2d) 16, 8 D.L.R. (4th) 589, 51 A.R. 210, [1984] 3 W.W.R. 594.

 

58.              The appellant alleges that the Court of
Appeal erred in holding the evidence given by the appellant at his earlier
trial was receivable at the second trial as part of the Crown's case. The issue
before the Court may be stated in these terms: Where a court of appeal quashes
a conviction and orders a new trial, does s. 13  of the Charter  preclude
the admission at the second trial of the evidence given by the accused at his
first trial? 

 

59.              Kerans J.A., for the unanimous Court of
Appeal, held inter alia: the appellant was at the time of the second
trial a witness who had testified in a proceeding and therefore s. 13  of the Charter 
was applicable to the accused; the evidence of the accused on his first trial
was used to incriminate him on the second; no question of retrospectivity was
involved in applying s. 13  to this case. He concluded, however, that s. 13  of
the Charter  could provide no protection to the appellant because the
second trial was not ""any other proceedings"" within the meaning of
the section. I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by Kerans J.A. and
in general terms with his reasons. I am led to this conclusion, however, by a
different approach.

 

60.              The appellant contended that the second
trial was another proceeding under s. 13  of the Charter . The effect of
the section would therefore be to exclude the evidence from the second trial.
The principal argument advanced for the Crown was that s. 13  had no application
in the case at bar because the second trial was not another proceeding. It could
not therefore be applied to alter the law which has heretofore provided for the
admissibility of such evidence.

 

61.              It has long been settled that relevant out
of court statements made by a party to the proceedings would be received in
evidence against him but not generally for him. A qualification to this rule
required that if the statement had been made to a person in authority it would
be admitted only if shown to be voluntary. To protect against self‑incrimination,
the common law recognized a right to object to incriminating questions in
judicial and quasi‑judicial matters. This common law right was abolished
by s. 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E‑10. This
section provides that, where a witness objects to a question upon the ground
that the answer might tend to incriminate him or to establish liability in a
civil proceeding and if it is a question which but for the passage of s. 5  of
the Canada Evidence Act  he would not have been compellable to answer,
the answer which he was required to make could not be used or received in
evidence against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceedings. 

 

62.              Prior to the adoption of the new Canadian
constitution which included the Charter  the evidence given by the
appellant on his first trial would have been receivable as part of the Crown's
case in the second trial. Any doubts on this point were settled in this Court
in R. v. Brown (No. 2) (1963), 40 C.R. 105. This case involved an appeal
from the Court of Appeal of the Northwest Territories (1963), 40 C.R. 90 (Smith
C.J., Porter, Johnson, Parker and Kane JJ.A.) Smith C.J. writing for the
majority (Smith C.J., Porter and Kane JJ.A.), had held that when a new trial is
ordered because the first trial was a mistrial the evidence of the accused
given at the first trial is not admissible against him at his second trial. He
recognized that there was much authority for the admission in judicial
proceedings of a prior statement by an accused made under oath. He noted,
however, that none of the authorities dealt with the precise question before
us, that is, the admissibility against an accused at his second trial of the
evidence he had given at his first trial. He said, at pp. 96‑97:

 

                   A new
trial in the facts of this case to me means a fresh trial and not a trial at
which the evidence before the judge and jury consists, in part, of oral
evidence and, in part, the evidence of the accused given at the first trial.

 

                   The
evidence of the appellant given at the first trial was given when he was
charged with murder. He saw fit at that time to enter the witness‑box and
be examined and cross‑examined. He did not give evidence at the second
trial when he was charged with manslaughter. He was not a compellable witness either
at the first trial or the second trial but, nevertheless, he found admitted
against him in the second trial upon the charge of manslaughter the evidence he
had voluntarily given at the first trial when he was charged with murder. The
result, it appears to me, is that the Crown has accomplished indirectly what it
cannot do directly, namely, to compel the accused person to give evidence
against himself. I appreciate that this argument was put forth unsuccessfully
in cases such as Regina v. Erdheim, [[1896] 2 Q.B. 260]; Regina v.
Bird, [(1898), 79 L.T. 359], and Rex v. Boyle, [(1904), 20 T.L.R.
192]. But in none of these cases was the trial a new trial. 

 

He concluded that the evidence could not be received on a new trial.

 

63.              Johnson J.A., with whom Parker J.A.
agreed, dissented on this point. He considered that evidence given by an
accused upon a former occasion is admissible against him. He relied for this
proposition on Tass v. The King, [1947] S.C.R. 103, and R. v. Coote
(1873), L.R. 4 P.C. 599, and he quoted the words of Sir Robert Collier giving
judgment of the Privy Council, at p. 607, in the Coote case, where he
stated the governing rule in these terms:

 

                   From
these cases, to which others might be added, it results, in their Lordships'
opinion, that the depositions on Oath of a Witness legally taken are evidence
against him, should he be subsequently tried on a criminal charge, except so
much of them as consist of answers to questions to which he has objected as
tending to criminate him, but which he has been improperly compelled to answer.
The exception depends upon the principle `nemo tenetur seipsum accusare,'
but does not apply to answers given without objection, which are to be deemed
voluntary.

 

Johnson J.A., referring to the words quoted above, then stated the
ground of his dissent in these terms (at p. 100):

 

                   That
case, and others referred to, deal with evidence given either in other
proceedings or in proceedings prior to trial, and it is argued that those cases
do not apply where the evidence taken at a first trial is sought to be used at
a second trial of the same offence.

 

Reviewing the authorities dealing with the point, he expressed the view
that the privilege against self‑incrimination could be waived and that
when a witness voluntarily gave evidence in circumstances which did not invoke
the provisions of s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  he had waived the
privilege. Recognizing that the waived privilege could be reclaimed on his
second trial, he found it obvious that the appellant could not be compelled to
give evidence at the second trial. However, to the argument that admitting the
evidence from the first trial amounted to compelling the accused to testify, he
cited the words of Lord Campbell C.J. in R. v. Scott (1856), Dears.
& B. 47, 169 E.R. 909, at p. 59:

 

The accusation of himself
was an accomplished fact, and at the trial he was not called upon to accuse
himself. The maxim relied upon [nemo tenetur seipsum accusare] applies
to the time when the question is put, not to the use which the prosecutor seeks
to make of the answer when the answer has been given.

 

He rejected the argument that the evidence given at the first trial was
not voluntary insofar as it consisted of answers adduced in cross‑examination,
and he relied on R. v. Erdheim, [1896] 2 Q.B. 260, at p. 267, where Lord
Russell C.J. said:

 

As to the objection that
the statements were not voluntary, it was held that such an objection does not
apply to a lawful examination in the course of a judicial proceeding... 

 

 

and added (at p. 103):

 

It is difficult to see
logic in saying that although the accused may voluntarily give evidence in his
own behalf, his evidence assumes the nature of an admission or confession given
under compulsion when cross‑examination begins.

 

64.              Parker J.A. in a short judgment concurring
with Johnson J.A. added this comment (at p. 104):

 

                   The
essence of the matter is that the accused is not being called upon to testify
against himself but that, having voluntarily made a statement under oath in a
judicial proceeding, that statement may be used as evidence against him in any
other judicial proceeding in the same manner as any other voluntary statement
which he may have made. If one has given evidence under oath at a trial, one
can hardly be heard to complain when this evidence is put forward by an
opposite party in a later proceeding.

 

65.              It may be observed that this passage is
reproduced in Kaufman, The Admissibility of Confessions (3rd ed. 1979),
at p. 361. While the learned author acknowledged that it was an attractive
point of view and probably correct, he expressed concern that the Crown was
doing indirectly what it could not do directly. He noted, however, that the
dissent of Johnson J.A. had been accepted in the Supreme Court of Canada in a
very short judgment:

 

                   For the
reasons given by Mr. Justice Johnson, of the Court of Appeal for the Northwest
Territories, with whom we substantially agree, the appeal is allowed and
the conviction restored. The record is to be returned to the Court of Appeal
for the Northwest Territories to adjudicate upon the question of sentence.

 

and stated:

 

                   It
would be foolish to suggest that this judgment, brief though it is, does not
state the law as it now exists in Canada.

 

He was concerned, as is Lamer J., at the use by the court of the word
""substantially"" in its expression of agreement with Johnson J.A. In
my view that word has little, if any, significance here. Whatever qualification
it may express, the judgment involves a clear endorsement of the ratio of
Johnson J.A. and clearly states the law as it was in pre‑Charter  days.
It now remains to consider whether the Charter  has changed the law in
this respect.

 

66.              Two questions must be answered. Does
section 13 of the Charter  apply in the facts of this case and, if it
does, would it be effective to protect the appellant from the use of his
earlier evidence in his second trial? 

 

67.              I have no difficulty with the first
question. The first trial of the appellant took place before the introduction
of the Charter . Nevertheless, I agree with my brother Lamer that there
is no issue of retrospectivity in this case. All persons who come within the
terms of s. 13  of the Charter  acquired the right to its protection with
the adoption of the Charter  on April 17, 1982. The time at which the evidence
in question was given is of no significance. Any protection from s. 13  will
apply when it is sought to introduce the challenged evidence. I am also in
agreement with Lamer J. that the word ""witness"" in s. 13  includes and
applies to an accused who has given evidence in his own trial. The
determination of whether the evidence is incriminating must be made at the time
when it is tendered. I would add that I have no difficulty with the proposition
that the evidence in question here is incriminating and that the purpose of the
Crown in introducing it at the second trial as part of the Crown's case was to
incriminate the appellant.

 

68.              In order to determine whether s. 13 
protects the appellant from the use of his earlier evidence at his second trial
a general consideration of the impact of s. 13  is necessary. A comparison of s.
13  of the Charter  with s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act 
provides a useful starting point.

 

69.              Section 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act 
and s. 13  of the Charter  are set out hereunder:

 

Incriminating Questions

 

                   5. (1) ...

 

                   (2)
Where with respect to any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground
that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his
liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person,
and if but for this Act, or the Act of any provincial legislature, the witness
would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although
the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial Act,
compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in
evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding
against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in
the giving of such evidence.

 

Self‑crimination

 

                   13. A witness who testifies in any proceedings has the right not to have
any incriminating evidence so given used to incriminate that witness in any
other proceedings, except in a prosecution for perjury or for the giving of
contradictory evidence. 

 

A comparison of the two provisions shows that s. 13  of the Charter 
has indeed effected a major change in the law giving much wider protection
against self‑incrimination than s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act .
As earlier noted, the common law rule which allowed a witness to claim
privilege in respect of any evidence which would expose him to the risk of
criminal conviction or the imposition of penalties or forfeitures (see Phipson
on Evidence (13th ed. 1982), p. 314, para. 15‑36) was repealed by the
section. In place of the old rule, s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act 
requires an answer to an incriminating question but provides a safeguard
against its future use if an objection was made. Section 13  of the Charter 
provides a much wider protection. In the clearest terms it gives the right to a
witness who testifies in any proceeding not to have any incriminating evidence
so given used to incriminate him in any other proceedings. This is a protection
going far beyond that accorded by s. 5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act . It
does not depend on any objection made by the witness giving the evidence. It is
applicable and effective without invocation, and even where the witness in
question is unaware of his rights. It is not limited to a question in respect
of which a witness would have been entitled to refuse to answer at common law
and its prohibition against the use of incriminating evidence is not limited to
criminal proceedings. It confers a right against incrimination by the use of
evidence given in one proceeding in any other proceedings.

 

70.              It would follow then that this appellant
would be entitled to succeed if the new trial is another proceeding. If,
however, it is not another proceeding, but merely part of the proceedings on
one indictment brought by the Crown, then s. 13  of the Charter  on its
own terms would not apply.

 

71.              What meaning should be attributed to the
words ""other proceedings"" in s. 13  of the Charter ? The word
""proceedings"", while of common usage, is one of uncertain and
variable meaning. A search through the texts and authorities, including legal
dictionaries, does little more than confirm this proposition. The word has been
used in both singular and plural form. It has frequently been used to describe
an action or another cause or matter or a step in an action. Proceedings have
been said to be still pending ""if a final judgment is not satisfied or
performed"": see Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed. 1982), vol. 37,
p. 30, para. 24. Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed. 1979), p. 1083, offers
the same variety of definitions as do such case authorities as have been
considered. In the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Eddy v. Stewart,
[1932] 3 W.W.R. 71, in a case involving the construction of ss. 5 and 6 of the Debt
Adjustment Act, 1932 (Sask.), c. 51, and in relation to a foreclosure
action, Martin J. A. said, at p. 74: 

 

                   Counsel
for the plaintiff contended that the word ""proceeding"" in sec. 6
means ""action;"" while counsel for the defendant argued that the word
embraced each step in an action. The word ""proceeding,"" in its
derivative sense, means, according to Murray's English Dictionary, vol.
7, at p. 1407, ""the action of going onward; advance, onward movement or
course."" In its legal sense, it includes the form in which actions are
brought and defended; the manner of intervening in suits and of conducting
them; it is sometimes used as equivalent to and interchangeable with the word
""action,"" and it is also applied to any step in an action. From the
authorities it is clear that the word may be differently construed in different
Acts: Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary, vol. 3, pp. 1561 et seq.; Ratteau
v. Ball (1914) 47 N.S.R. 488, 15 D.L.R. 574‑‑Townshend, C.J.,
at p. 576.

 

                   The
meaning of the word ""proceeding,"" therefore, as used in secs. 5 and 6
of the statute, must be gathered from the context.

 

I agree with that learned judge and consider that the meaning to be
attributed to the words ""other proceedings"" in s. 13  of the Charter 
must be gathered from the context.

 

72.              The appellant contends for an
interpretation which would limit the word ""proceeding"" to a step in
the action with the result that the new trial would be another proceeding and,
therefore, s. 13  of the Charter  would prevent the admission at the
second trial of the evidence given at the first. The logical extension of this
argument would, it seems to me, mean that the judicial process would be
fragmented with the result that the preliminary hearing of an indictable
offence would also be another proceeding, evidence from which would be excluded
from the trial. The appeal would also be a separate proceeding, as would any
motions to quash or otherwise seek interlocutory relief and any evidence,
probably in affidavit form, in support of such interlocutory motions would not
be available for consideration at the trial or other fragment of the
proceedings. This would do such violence to the judicial process that it would,
in my opinion, be unreasonable to accept such a construction of the Charter .

 

73.              The respondent contends for an
interpretation which would attribute a broader meaning to the words in s. 13 
that would include all those judicial steps required by law to be taken in
effecting a lawful resolution of the issues raised by the charge between the
Crown and the accused. This would mean, of course, if accepted, that s. 13  of
the Charter  would not apply since the new trial would not be another
proceeding. 

 

74.              This, in my view, is the preferable
construction of s. 13  of the Charter . To begin with, s. 13  protects the
accused from evidence in other proceedings. The word ""other"" must
have some meaning. It must, in my view, mean proceedings other than the one in
which the evidence sought to be excluded was given. Why would the word
""other"" be employed if the protection was to be provided for all
proceedings? The use of the word ""other"" suggests a reference to
proceedings involving other issues and other parties and supports the Crown
position. Secondly, and of more importance, is the proposition that, while s.
13  of the Charter  was clearly intended to provide, and does provide, a
wider protection against self‑incrimination than that provided by s. 5(2) 
of the Canada Evidence Act , it was not nor could it be asserted in
argument that either s. 13  of the Charter  or s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  could operate to protect against self‑incrimination
respecting what was said by the accused at his own trial. Since the second
trial in the case at bar is on the same indictment, between the same parties,
and raising precisely the same issues, it cannot on a fair reading of s. 13  of
the Charter  be considered as another proceeding.

 

75.              The facts of this case illustrate the
reasonableness of this interpretation. The appellant argues that the Crown
gains an advantage by being able to use his testimony in the later trial. He
says, in effect: ""I was convicted because the trial judge did not deal
correctly with my evidence. If he had, I would have been acquitted."" The Court
of Appeal agrees to the extent that the evidence was not correctly dealt with
and quashes the conviction, sending the matter back for a new trial. The
appellant, having obtained the relief he sought, i.e. the new trial,
then seeks to insulate the jury from his former evidence although he relied
upon it at trial and it was the basis on which he procured his new trial. I
agree that he may not be called upon to give evidence at his new trial; he may
stand silent as the law provides but, in my opinion, consistent with the
general rules of evidence long applicable in such cases, and already mentioned,
the Crown is entitled in this step of the same proceedings to introduce the
past voluntary statements of the accused in evidence and s. 13  of the Charter 
does not prevent this step. The appellant, a person charged with an offence, is
entitled to a trial according to law which will lead to a judicial resolution
of all issues arising out of the charge as between him and the Crown. The
appellate procedures provided by law are designed to protect him in that right,
and where the issues arising between the Crown and the appellant on the charge
are not lawfully dealt with at a first trial the appellate court exists to
direct the new trial for the lawful resolution of the issues raised in the
proceedings. 

 

76.              Canadian courts have considered this
problem and with one exception have favoured the Crown's position on this
argument. In R. v. Wilson (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 481, Honey Co. Ct. J.
held that where an accused testified at his trial, which resulted in a
mistrial, s. 13  of the Charter  applied to prevent his evidence given at
his first trial from being admitted at his retrial. The question of the meaning
of the words ""other proceedings"" does not appear to have been argued
before him.

 

77.              In R. v. Sophonow (No. 1) (1983), 6
C.C.C. (3d) 394, Scollin J. disagreed with Honey Co. Ct. J. in Wilson, supra,
saying, at pp. 395‑96:

 

                   However,
I am not satisfied that s. 13  may properly be invoked in this case. In this
respect I part company with the view expressed in R. v. Wilson, supra.
There is no doubt that a second trial is, by its nature, a
""subsequent"" proceeding. In my view, it is not, however, an
""other"" proceeding as contemplated by s. 13 . I consider that the
sense, the justification and the thrust of s. 13  is to give generous protection
to the search for truth by guaranteeing that a witness who comes forward to
testify in one proceeding, and in the course of testifying truly, involves himself
in some incriminating conduct, is not exposed to the use of that testimony
itself in some other proceeding either then or later pending against
him, subject only to the exception provided in s. 13 . This rationale of
s. 13  has no application to the accused when, as in this case, he testifies in
his own defence. The proceedings here are proceedings on the very same
indictment against the very same accused and do not fall within the words
""any other proceedings"" as contemplated by s. 13 .

 

An appeal was taken to the Manitoba Court of Appeal (1983), 12 C.C.C.
(3d) 272, and allowed on another point, but the position taken by Scollin J. at
trial was approved by the judges of that court.

 

78.              The same view was taken by Legg J. in R.
v. Mannion (1984), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 161 in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench,
where he said, at p. 164:

 

                   It is
also my view that s. 13  of the Charter  has no application in the case at bar.
That section envisages two separate proceedings in which the evidence in one
proceeding is used in the other. This is a retrial of a charge of rape after a
new trial was ordered. [Here reference was made to R. v. Brown (No. 2)
(1963), 40 C.R. 90.]

 

                                                                    ...

 

                   This
case together with the fact that a new trial commences with the same indictment
unless otherwise ordered leads me to the conclusion that the first trial and
the second trial are one and the same proceeding. In the instant case, the
trial is proceeding on the same indictment as was used in the first trial. 

 

An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on this point but
allowed on another issue (1984), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 503. The case has been heard
and judgment reserved in this Court.

 

79.              In R. v. Yakeleya (1985), 20 C.C.C.
(3d) 193 (Ont. C.A.), Martin J.A., speaking for the court, dealt with a case
where the evidence given at the defendant's preliminary hearing was admitted on
his trial. He said (at p. 195):

 

                   We are
all of the view that the appellant's trial did not constitute ""other
proceedings"" in relation to the appellant's preliminary hearing on the
same charge. The preliminary hearing and the trial on the same charge are part
of the same proceedings: see R. v. Sophonow (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 272
at pp. 277 and 332, 11 D.L.R. (4th) 24, 29 Man. R. (2d) 1.

 

Judgment in the Court of Appeal in the case at bar was, of course, to
the same effect.

 

80.              What then, it may be asked, is the purpose
of s. 13  of the Charter ? In answer to this question we can again
refer to the law as it stood before the Charter  was adopted. Section
5(2)  of the Canada Evidence Act  and various provincial evidence acts
which were generally similar in effect provided the protection against
incrimination. The protection provided depended upon an objection to the
evidence, but where objection was not made the evidence was receivable in subsequent
proceedings against the witness who gave it. This rule applied not only to the
courts; it applied to evidence given before Royal commissions, statutory boards
and tribunals, `in bankruptcy' proceedings, and many other forms of judicial
and quasi‑judicial proceedings (see s. 2  of the Canada Evidence
Act ). There were many occasions where a witness through failure to object
even though ignorant of his rights or even where a witness, for example, in
bankruptcy matters, was compelled by law to answer the question rendered
himself vulnerable to the use of incriminating evidence in criminal proceedings
or to the use of prejudicial evidence in civil proceedings without recourse.
Many cases illustrate this problem: see Tass v. The King, supra, where a
witness called to give evidence at the preliminary hearing of another gave
evidence without an objection, which would invoke s. 5(2)  of the Canada
Evidence Act , and which was later received in evidence against him at his
own trial; R. v. Erdheim, supra, where statements made in bankruptcy
proceedings under compulsion of law were held to be admissible at a later
criminal proceeding against him; R. v. Coote, supra, where statements
made under oath upon a fire marshall's inquiry, held pursuant to statutory
power, were later admitted against the witness at his own trial for arson; R.
v. McGregor, [1967] 2 All E.R. 267 (C.A.), to similar effect. It may also
be observed that the power of provincial legislatures to give protection
against self‑incrimination did not extend to criminal matters‑‑see
Klein v. Bell, [1955] S.C.R. 309‑‑but was limited only to
civil proceedings within provincial jurisdiction. 

 

81.              There is a social interest in encouraging
people to come forward to give evidence, not only in court but on other
occasions in the tribunals and proceedings referred to above. That interest is
not served where witnesses in testifying expose themselves to the danger of
self‑incrimination because of such testimony. It is suggested that it was
a recognition of this fact, together with a recognition of the inadequacy of
the law relating to self‑incrimination and the inadequacy of provincial
powers in this respect that caused the framers of the Charter  to include
the very greatly strengthened Charter  provisions relating to self‑incrimination.
It was for this reason that s. 13  gave its protection against incrimination by
the use of the evidence given by the witness in ""other proceedings"".
It cannot, in my view, be construed to mean that protection under s. 13  of the Charter 
applies to evidence voluntarily given at a different stage in the very
proceedings which are before the Court. Section 13  of the Charter ,
however, could still have a role to play in this case. The appellant admitted
at his first trial that he was engaged in trafficking in narcotics when he met
the deceased. Section 13  would prevent the use of this evidence against the
appellant on a charge of trafficking, clearly another proceeding involving a
different charge and different issues. To say, however, that protection would
be given against the use of his first trial evidence on the second trial of
this indictment, on the footing that the second trial is another proceeding, is
to adopt an interpretation of s. 13  not dictated by its language, involving an
abandonment of long‑accepted and sound principles of evidence.

 

82.              It has been argued that to permit the
Crown to adduce at the second trial, as part of its case, the evidence given by
the accused on his first trial would be to permit the Crown to do indirectly
what it may not do directly. It is said that the Crown would be conscripting
the accused to assist in establishing the case against him and this would be to
infringe the rights conferred on the accused by s. 11 (c) and (d)
of the Charter . This argument has no force in my view. Section 11 (c)
gives the accused the right not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings
against himself in respect of the offence. There is not in this case any
compulsion involved. The appellant gave evidence voluntarily at his trial and
on the basis of that evidence obtained a new trial. I do not accept the
suggestion that appears in the judgment of Kerans J.A. that he was only
technically a voluntary witness. He had a fully‑guaranteed right to
silence. He was represented by counsel and he gave evidence. The provisions of
s. 11 (c) are not engaged in these circumstances where no compulsion
existed. The Crown is merely invoking the well‑settled rule of evidence
that past statements made by a party are ordinarily receivable in evidence
against him, and I adopt here the words of Parker J.A. in the Northwest
Territories Court of Appeal as well as those of Lord Campbell C.J. in R. v.
Scott, supra, quoted above. The appellant may not be compelled to give
evidence at his second trial but that protection, clearly provided by s. 11 (c)
of the Charter , does not extend to bar the use in evidence of earlier
voluntary statements that he has made which are clearly relevant to the issues.
By testifying at his trial he voluntarily waived his privilege of silence. It
is quite open to him to reclaim the privilege on his new trial and remain
silent, but in my view it is against all principle to say that the Charter 
right under s. 11 (c) would extend to bar the use in evidence of earlier
voluntary statements made by the accused clearly relevant to the issues. I
would add that s. 11 (d) is not in any way engaged in this case. 

 

83.              In my view then this appeal must fail. The
word ""proceedings"" in s. 13  of the Charter  means in a criminal
case all judicial steps taken upon one charge to resolve and reach a final
conclusion of the issue therein raised between the same party and the Crown.
This would include the preliminary hearing, the trial, and an appeal and a new
trial. All of these steps would be included in proceedings against the accused
and would not be ""other proceedings"" within the meaning of s. 13 . To
the suggestion that adopting this view would make admissible at a trial evidence
given by an accused on a voir dire held during the course of a trial,
there is, I think, a simple answer. The voir dire is clearly another
proceeding. Its purpose is not to resolve any issue raised in the charge but
merely to determine what may be introduced into the proceedings for that
purpose. After the voir dire the evidence found to be properly
admissible in the proceedings is admitted and thereafter forms part of the
proceedings. That which is excluded never becomes a part. The voir dire
serves this limited purpose but is clearly another proceeding. It follows then
that s. 13  of the Charter  would provide no protection against the use of
the evidence given in the first trial upon the second trial in this case.

 

84.              I would dismiss the appeal.

                   Criminal law ‑‑ Kienapple principle ‑‑
Lesser counts dismissed on rape conviction ‑‑ Whether or not
Kienapple principle properly applied.

 

                   Accused was charged and convicted on five counts
arising out of the same incident: (1) taking a woman away against her will with
intent to have illicit sexual intercourse, (2) unlawfully confining that
person, (3) indecent assault, (4) rape, and (5) carrying a weapon for the
purpose of committing the indictable offence of rape.

 

                   At trial, the complainant testified in‑chief
and on cross‑examination as to the accused's limp and his difficulty
climbing stairs. The accused then elected to testify and did nothing to disturb
the testimony with respect to his restricted mobility. The Crown, in reply,
called witnesses to contradict the essence of complain‑ ant's testimony
as to the accused's difficulties in walking. When the Crown called the
complainant in reply, she testified about a new topic completely unrelated to
any previous evidence. The evidence adduced in reply forced the accused to
enter the witness box a second time. The Crown's cross‑examination dealt
with a collateral issue and amounted to a sharp attack on accused's
credibility. Accused appealed, citing reversible error below in the conduct of
the trial, and subsidiarily citing the application of the Kienapple
principle to some of the counts. The Court of Appeal agreed there was error
below but the majority, applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code , dismissed the appeal. All convictions except that of rape were later
quashed in an addendum to the original judgment released before the formal
Order. 

 

                   Held: The appeals
should be allowed.

 

                   Dividing the prosecution's case so as to sandwich
the defence violates one of the fundamental precepts of our criminal process.
The accused must be given the opportunity to elect to remain silent or to enter
the witness box in his own defence in the full awareness of the Crown's
complete case. This did not occur here.

 

                   Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code could not be invoked here. The reviewing tribunal could not, with
anything approaching reality, retry the case to assess the worth of the
evidence remaining after the improperly adduced evidence had been extracted. The
situation resulting from the trial failed to qualify under any of the
authorities for the application of the proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii).
Since the conviction for rape was quashed and a new trial ordered by this
Court, it was unnecessary to consider the issues raised concerning the
application of the Kienapple principle for its application flowed from
the conviction for rape. It was sufficient to allow the Crown appeals for the
purpose of ordering a new trial on all five counts.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                Estey
and Lamer JJ.‑‑Tracy Evans John was charged and convicted in
Toronto by a jury on five counts, all arising out of the same incident:

 

1.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, did take away Joanne
Marie Volk, a female person, against her will with intent to have illicit
sexual intercourse with her, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

2.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, without lawful
authority, confined Joanne Marie Volk, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

3.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, indecently assaulted
Joanne Marie Volk, a female person, contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

4.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, raped Joanne Marie Volk,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

5.                ...he,
on or about the 11th day of April in the year 1981, at the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto in the Judicial District of York, carried a weapon, to
wit: a knife, for the purpose of committing the indictable offence of rape,
contrary to the Criminal Code .

 

2.                The accused appealed his convictions to
the Ontario Court of Appeal arguing reversible error below in the conduct of
the trial and, subsidiarily, that a conviction, if any, could not be entered as
regards some of the counts under the principle set out by this Court in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729. All agreed that there was error below,
but the majority, applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code ,
dismissed the appeal. Brooke J. A. dissenting, would not have applied the
proviso and would have allowed the appeal from conviction and ordered a new
trial. The judgment was released on November 17, 1983. No reference was made in
the judgment to the issue regarding multiple convictions. 

 

3.                Before the issuance of the formal Order,
the Court of Appeal released, on December 1, 1983, an addendum to the original
judgment. In this addendum, all of the convictions except the conviction for
rape were quashed on the basis of the rule against multiple convictions.

 

4.                The accused appeals to this Court his
conviction for rape while the Crown appeals the application of the Kienapple
principle as regards some of the counts. The Crown also invites this Court to
pronounce upon certain procedural aspects that arise upon an application of Kienapple.

 

5.                The issues in these appeals therefore
divide into two parts. The first part concerns the application by the majority
in the court below of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  to
confirm a conviction under s. 143 of the Code for rape. The second part
concerns the quashing by the Court of Appeal of the convictions on the other
four counts in the indictment, as a result of an application of the principle
set out in Kienapple, supra.

 

6.                The issue arising out of the application
of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  concerns the Crown's
action in calling in reply the complainant and nine other witnesses to
introduce evidence concerning the physical characteristics of the accused,
particularly his mobility and agility, notwithstanding that he had an
artificial limb from the knee down on one leg. The complainant testified in‑chief
and in cross‑examination that the accused walked with a limp and had
difficulty climbing the two flights of stairs to his dwelling. Indeed, the
complainant admitted that in the course of the journey up the stairs, there was
a possibility that she could have escaped by reason of the accused's difficulty
except that she was frightened and this was probably due to the possession of a
knife by the accused. Against the backdrop of this evidence, the accused
elected to testify and he did nothing to disturb the complainant's description
of his restricted ability to move about. Indeed, he may have emphasized the
complainant's evidence by limping to the witness stand. In reply, other
witnesses called by the Crown contradicted the essence of the complainant's
testimony as to the difficulties the accused had in walking by reason of his
artificial limb. The Crown could not have called these witnesses to contradict
its own witness, the complainant Volk. To allow the Crown to do so in reply is
doubly wrong because the effect was to force the accused to return to the
witness box. When the Crown called the complainant in reply, she testified
about a new topic which had nothing whatever to do with any evidence entered by
the accused or on behalf of the accused in his defence. She proceeded to tell
the jury about a statement alleged to have been made by the accused to her that
he ""had planned... [the offence] for a week and it could have been
anyone"". The effect of this evidence on a juror's mind would in all
likelihood be serious. It is of course impossible to reconstruct this trial by
jury so as to determine what the verdict would have been had this evidence not
been presented. This information did not fall out of the complainant
accidentally, as the very form of the Crown's question indicates an awareness
of the answer desired. Indeed, counsel for the Crown, in proper frankness, acknowledged
that this was the case. Clearly this is the situation referred to in criminal
practice as the prosecution splitting its case. The wrongs which flow from such
a practice are manifold and the practice has been prohibited from the earliest
days of our criminal law. 

 

7.                The effect of this evidence by the
complainant also forced the accused to enter the witness box for the second
time. He was required so to do firstly in order to deal with the evidence of
his agility or mobility, and secondly to meet the evidence that he had indeed
planned the offence in general for some time. The cross‑examination of
the accused by the Crown centered on his ability to ascend stairs and to play
basketball. The first related to evidence led by reply witnesses who
contradicted the evidence of the complainant on this subject and the second
related to evidence by reply witnesses who introduced a purely collateral
matter, namely the accused's ability to play basketball without using a
wheelchair. In the course of this cross‑examination the issue was
squarely put to the accused that he had been lying in his examination‑in‑chief
when he said he played basketball only with the aid of a wheelchair. The
process reduced itself to a simple sharp attack in front of the jury on the
accused's credibility on an issue wholly collateral.

 

8.                These are the consequences that flow
from a violation of one of the fundamental precepts of our criminal process,
namely the dividing of the prosecution's case so as to sandwich the defence.
This is a particularly lethal tactic where the evidence in reply raises a new
issue and attacks the accused's credibility for this is the last evidence which
the members of the jury hear prior to their deliberations. It also raises the
question as to the propriety of the Crown's conduct in the context of the
accused's right to elect to remain silent or to elect to enter the witness box
in his own defence. He must be given the opportunity of making this decision in
the full awareness of the Crown's complete case. This did not occur in these
proceedings.

 

9.                Section 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  cannot be invoked in these circumstances. The reviewing tribunal
cannot, with anything approaching reality, retry the case to assess the worth
of the residual evidence after the improperly adduced evidence has been
extracted from the record. The appellate tribunal does not have the advantage
of seeing the witnesses, and in any case, was never intended in the criminal
process to replace the jury. It is unnecessary to reopen the many authorities
in this Court on the application of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal
Code  because the situation resulting from the trial in these proceedings
fails to qualify under any of these authorities for the application of the
proviso in s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

 

10.              The accused's appeal succeeds, the
conviction for rape is quashed and a new trial ordered on that count of rape.
As the conviction for rape, the foundation upon which the convictions at trial
for the other offences were set aside and quashed under the ""Kienapple
principle"", no longer exists, it is unnecessary to address the issues
raised by the Crown appeals as regards the alleged improper application by the
Court of Appeal of the principle in Kienapple to those convictions. It
is sufficient, in this case, to allow the Crown appeals for the purpose of
ordering a new trial on all five counts.

                   Appellant and another person fled the vicinity of an
attempted break and enter on the arrival of the police. The police apprehended
appellant, positively identified him, and established his presence at the scene
of the attempted entry. The second individual was never caught, but the tire
iron that he was carrying was located nearby and found to match the nicks and
paint chips of the damaged door.

 

                   Appellant was charged with attempting to break and
enter with intent to commit an indictable offence. The trial judge acquitted
appellant but the Manitoba Court of Appeal, on a Crown appeal, quashed that
acquittal and ordered a new trial. The prevailing issue here was whether a
finding of fact could become, per se, an error of law conferring on the
Crown a right of appeal from acquittal under s. 605(1)(a), and if so,
when does that finding of fact became an error of law.

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed. 

 

                   A finding as regards intention is a finding of fact.
The total absence of a foundation for a finding of fact, however, is an error
of law. As regards an acquittal, this may only occur if there has been a
transfer to the accused by the law of the burden of proof of a given fact.
Absent a shifting of the burden of proof of a given fact upon the accused,
there is always some evidence upon which to make a finding of fact in favour of
the accused.

 

                   However wrong the Court of Appeal or this Court may
think the trial judge was in reaching his conclusion in that regard, such error
cannot be determined without passing judgment on the reasonableness of the
verdict or the sufficiency of the evidence. These are matters upon which an
appellate court has no jurisdiction on an appeal by the Crown.

 

                   It is only when the burden of proof has been shifted
(as is the case for proof of intent when a person is found on premises that he
or she has broken into), that it can be said, absent any evidence to the
contrary, that there is no evidence upon which a reasonable doubt could exist
as regards that fact, and an appeal against the ensuing acquittal raises a
question of law alone conferring on the Crown a right of appeal pursuant to s.
605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

                   The doubt here concerned both the accused's intent
to enter the premises and his intention once inside, assuming he intended to
enter. There is no onus placed on the accused as regards proof of his intent to
enter. The presumption of s. 306(2) is not triggered by an attempt to enter.
There is, however, no onus on the accused as regards his intent once inside as
would have been the case had he been found inside. Given the presumption of
innocence and the undisplaced burden of proof placed upon the Crown, there was some
evidence upon which the trial judge could rest his finding and that finding, if
in error, would be an error of fact, not of law.

Introduction

 

2.                The accused was charged with having
attempted to break and enter a Winnipeg gun shop with intent to commit therein
an indictable offence. The trial judge acquitted and, upon a Crown appeal, the
Manitoba Court of Appeal quashed the acquittal and ordered a new trial. Huband
J.A., dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal. The accused now comes to
this Court as of right.

 

3.                The prevailing issue in this appeal is:
Can and when does a finding of fact become, per se, an error of law, thereby
conferring on the Crown a right of appeal from an acquittal under
s. 605(1) (a) of the Criminal Code ?

 

The Facts

 

4.                The Court of Appeal proceeded on the
summary of the facts set out in Huband J.A.'s opinion and I propose to do the
same. They are as follows:

 

                   On the
early morning of March 10, 1982, the back door entrance of 655 Archibald
Street, a building housing the business known as Ernie's Gun Shop Ltd., was
tampered with and damaged. The silent alarm in the building was triggered and
two police cruisers arrived at the scene within minutes of each other. The
first officers who arrived disturbed two men in the vicinity of the rear
entrance of the building. One of the men ran off in a northerly direction
carrying what appeared to be a tire iron, and the second man ran off in a
southerly direction, turning east toward Archibald Street. The individual with
the tire iron was not apprehended, although a tire iron was located nearby the
next morning. Paint chips on the tire iron were the same colour as the damaged
door, and the iron itself appeared to fit into the nicks which had been created
when the door was tampered with. The individual who ran off in a southerly
direction was seen by police officers in a second police car, was followed by
them, and ultimately apprehended. He is the accused, Schuldt. 

 

                   All the
police officers involved positively identified the accused, and the print of
his footwear was matched with imprints in the snow around the back entrance of
the gun shop. After his arrest Mr. Schuldt was interrogated by the police and
made only one statement of any consequence, which was admitted in evidence. In
response to a request to use the phone the investigating officers asked him
what he wanted to use it for, and the accused replied, ""to phone
home"", to which the police officer responded, ""to call your
brother?"", to which Mr. Schuldt replied, ""He's a faster runner"".

 

5.                Before entering upon an analysis of the
trial judgment, I think it would be desirable to set out the sections that the
trial judge was called upon to apply to the facts.

 

6.                Section 306(1) (a) of the Criminal
Code  makes it an offence to ""break[s] and enter[s] a place with intent
to commit an indictable offence therein"".

 

7.                Supporting the Crown in its burden of
proving the intent for breaking and entering is s. 306(2)(a), which
enacts that:

 

                   306.. . . 

 

                   (2) For
the purposes of proceedings under this section, evidence that an accused

 

(a) broke and
entered a place is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that
he broke and entered with intent to commit an indictable offence
therein: . . .

 

8.                The charge being one of attempt, regard
must be had to s. 24:

 

                   24. (1) Every one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or
omits to do anything for the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of
an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible under the
circumstances to commit the offence.

 

                   (2) The
question whether an act or omission by a person who has an intent to commit an
offence is or is not mere preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to
constitute an attempt to commit the offence, is a question of law.

 

9.                It is common ground that what was done
to the door went beyond mere preparation. It is also common ground that the
presumption of s. 306(2) is not triggered by an attempt, and we are, therefore,
not invited to consider whether proof of a break coupled with proof of an
intent to enter would be prima facie proof of an intent to commit
therein an indictable offence. Indeed, the Crown adopted what was said in R.
v. Johnson, a British Columbia Court of Appeal decision, reported at
(1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 101, (see also St‑Jean v. The Queen (1974),
28 C.R.N.S. 1 (Que. C.A.)) Therefore, the Crown acknowledged that it had to
make its case without the help of the presumption.

 

10.              The Crown had to overcome three hurdles in
order to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt:

 

(1) that the appellant was
either directly forcing the door or, according to s. 21  of the Criminal Code ,
was a party to what was done to the door, that is, aided or abetted the other
person in forcing the door, or, formed a common intention to commit in the gun
shop an indictable offence in circumstances where he knew, or should have
known, that the carrying out of the common intention probably required breaking
and entry;

 

(2) that what was done to
the door was done with the intent to break and enter into the gun shop, and

 

(3) that the intended
break and entry was accomplished for the further intent to commit therein an
indictable offence. 

 

The Trial Judgment

 

11.              A reading of the trial judge's reasons
indicates that the Crown did not get past the first step, the applicant's
participation in the commencement of the breaking of the door. In his reasons
he says:

 

                   Now,
there is certainly no proof, and certainly it is not proved beyond a reasonable
doubt, that the accused intended anything else other than to be there. Most
suspicious circumstances I grant you: two accused persons or two persons in the
back lane, later at night, and we know, we were told although that the silent
alarm went off in the building, and there is no question that someone had been tampering
with the lock, no proof that it was this accused, however. But, of course,
being there of itself is not sufficient to sustain a conviction. As far as I am
concerned, there must be much much more evidence of intent than simply to have
been there.

 

12.              This would have been sufficient to put an
end to the matter and to enter an acquittal. He further found however, that
there was no proof as regards the purpose of the breaking and therefore no
proof as regards an intention to enter:

 

                   Now,
what proof do we have as to this accused's intentions? Firstly, on the night in
question what he was doing, and even if he‑‑he must prove his
intention, even if he were to get into the premises which were‑‑which
were damaged, perhaps it was only his friend's intention to get in. We had no
proof that it was the accused's intention to get into the premises or to get
into the gun shop, whether to steal anything or to do whatever was going to go
on in there.

 

Obviously, absent an entry, he found no evidence as regards the
ultimate purpose, namely the intent to commit an indictable offence.

 

13.              The Crown appealed. Section 605(1) (a)
of the Criminal Code  governs appeals from acquittals:

 

                   605. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose
may appeal to the court of appeal

 

(a) against a
judgment or verdict of acquittal of a trial court in proceedings by indictment
on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law alone....

 

The Court of Appeal Judgments

 

14.              The gist of the majority's (per
Hall J. A., Monnin C.J. concurring) views of the matter were briefly but
clearly expressed in the following passage in the reasons of Hall J.A.:

 

The facts as recited by my
brother Huband are more than enough from which to find or infer that the
accused, in concert with another, attempted to break and enter the gun shop
with intent to commit an indictable offence. To entertain any doubt on the
issue of intent is, in my opinion, not reasonable but fanciful and quite out of
touch with the reality of the case. There must be a factual foundation upon
which to have reasonable doubt, and it simply does not exist in the present
case. It should here be noted that the accused did not testify at his trial nor
did he adduce any evidence in his defence. 

 

Applicable to this case
are the remarks of Martland, J. in Wild v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 101.
At pp. 111‑112 he stated:

 

""In the Lemire
case ([1965] S.C.R. 174, 45 C.R. 16, [1965] 4 C.C.C. 11, 51 D.L.R. (2d) 312),
to which reference was made in the reasons of the Appellate Division, quoted
above, it was stated, in this Court, that on an appeal from a conviction, if an
appellate court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper
view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his
guilt, there is an error of law. In my opinion, that proposition applies
equally in a case in which a trial judge, in his reasons, finds that certain
specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused,
when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any
doubt as to his guilt.""

 

                   In the
present case, I do not think the evidence is capable of creating any doubt as
to the guilt of the accused.

 

                   In sum,
it was unreal and unreasonable for the learned trial judge to have had a
reasonable doubt about the intent of the accused, and that, as I have stated,
is a misapplication of that doctrine and an error in law.

 

15.              Huband J.A. in his dissenting reasons
unequivocally stated that he would have convicted had he been the trial judge.
Having emphasized the Crown's limited right of appeal, he then made an
exhaustive and most helpful review of the cases on point. He then found that he
was to be governed by this Court's decision in Lampard v. The Queen,
[1969] S.C.R. 373, where it was held that an accused's state of mind was an
issue of fact and that an error in that regard was not an error of law alone.
Consequently, he would have disallowed the Crown's appeal.

 

16.              I do not think that there was an issue
made in the courts below of the question whether a finding as regards an
accused's intention is or is not a finding of fact. The judgment of the
majority in the Court of Appeal makes no mention of that issue but focuses on
whether a finding of fact that is ""unreasonable"",
""fanciful"", or ""unreal"" is an error of law. In this Court,
the Crown seems to take the same position. The Crown's position can be
summarized in the following passage of her factum, where it is said at p. 8: 

 

                   The
Respondent respectfully submits that the Court of Appeal for Manitoba did not
err in holding that the learned trial Judge's incorrect conclusion as to the
intent of Appellant in the circumstances of this case amounted to an error of
law alone. While the evidence offered in proof of a prima facie case in
a criminal case will not necessarily result in a finding of guilt, there must
be some factual foundation on which the trial Judge can properly base a finding
of reasonable doubt.

 

17.              This Court, in Lampard, supra,
and inferentially in Wild v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R. 101, said that a
finding as regards intention is a finding of fact, and I see no reason to
reconsider that conclusion. This Court in Wild had also said that total
absence of a foundation for a finding of fact is an error of law. I agree, but
with respect, I do not agree as to the circumstances under which a finding that
there is a total absence of evidence can properly be made.

 

18.              Wild was charged with criminal negligence
causing death. It was alleged that he had recklessly driven a car while in a
state of intoxication and caused an accident resulting in the death of the
three other occupants of the car. The ground upon which the judge rested his
decision to acquit was that he had had a reasonable doubt as to whether the
accused was the driver of the car at the time of the accident. As quoted at pp.
104‑05 the sole ground upon which the Crown appealed the verdict of
acquittal was that

 

                   The
learned trial Judge misdirected himself in law in ordering an acquittal as
there was no evidence on the basis of which a reasonable doubt could arise as
to the respondent's guilt.

 

19.              Notwithstanding the fact that all of the
evidence had indicated that the accused, found pinned down behind the steering
wheel, was the driver at the time of the impact, the trial judge, in his
reasons for judgment, speculated as to the possibility that one of the other
occupants might have been the driver, as quoted at p. 104:

 

                   What
can happen to the occupants of a vehicle which comes to such a sudden stop, is,
I think, a matter for conjecture.

 

And, further on, he concluded that he was left in doubt as to whether
the accused was the driver.

 

20.              This to me was stating and applying the
wrong test to the evidence and was an error of law, and for that reason I would
have agreed in the result of the majority of this Court in that decision. On
that point, Martland J., writing for the majority, said at p. 113: 

 

                   On the
facts of this case, however, the issue to be determined was whether, in the
light of the appellant's having been pinned behind the wheel, there was any
rational conclusion, on the evidence, other than that the appellant was the
driver of the car at the time of the accident. He did not find that there was
such a rational conclusion. What he did was to conjecture that the appellant
might have been riding as a passenger in the back seat and, if so, might have
been thrown into the front seat on impact.

 

and then, at p. 114:

 

                   In the
result, it is my opinion hat the learned trial judge failed properly to apply
the rule in Hodge's case to the facts before him in that he acquitted
the appellant, not because he found that there was a rational conclusion on the
facts inconsistent with his guilt, but because there was, in his opinion, a
conjectural conclusion which he considered might be inconsistent with his
guilt.

 

I do not take issue with this passage of his judgment. However,
Martland J., at p. 111, added a reference to what he had said in R. v.
Lemire, [1965] S.C.R. 174, as follows:

 

                   In the Lemire
case ([1965] S.C.R. 174, 45 C.R. 16, [1965] 4 C.C.C. 11, 51 D.L.R. (2d) 312),
to which reference was made in the reasons of the Appellate Division, quoted
above, it was stated, in this Court, that on an appeal from a conviction, if an
appellate court allows the appeal on the ground that certain specified evidence
creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, when, on a proper
view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any doubt as to his
guilt, there is an error of law. In my opinion, that proposition applies
equally in a case in which a trial judge, in his reasons, finds that certain
specified evidence creates a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused,
when, on a proper view of the law, that evidence is not capable of creating any
doubt as to his guilt.

 

21.              This is the precise passage which was
relied upon by the Court of Appeal in this case and argued by the Crown before
this Court. Lemire was a case where the issue was the existence of
fraudulent intent on the part of the accused who had, at the suggestion of the
Attorney General, submitted false expense accounts to the government. The
purpose of that suggestion was to give him a raise in pay while avoiding having
to do the same for other government employees. Convicted at trial, the
accused's appeal was allowed by the Court of Appeal. The Crown's appeal to this
Court was allowed and the conviction restored. 

 

22.              Writing for the majority in Lemire,
Martland J. stated the passage to which he subsequently referred in Wild,
supra, and went on to say, at p. 194:

 

These facts are not in
dispute. In the reasons given in the Court below, which I have reviewed,
certain inferences have been drawn from the facts in evidence, but the
fundamental error which exists in each, and which is an error in law, is in
holding that, on the basis of those inferences, some element in the offence was
lacking.

 

                   In Belyea
and Weinraub v. The King ([1932] S.C.R. 279), this Court considered a case
in which the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario had allowed an
appeal by the Crown from an acquittal by the trial court in proceedings by
indictment. The right of appeal to the Appellate Division was limited, as is
the appellant's right to appeal to this Court in the present case, to questions
of law. It was contended by the appellants in that case that the issues before
the Appellate Division did not involve a question of law alone. Chief Justice
Anglin, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said at p. 296:

 

""The right of appeal
by the Attorney‑General, conferred by s. 1013(4), Cr. C., as
enacted by c. 11, s. 28, of the Statutes of Canada, 1930, is, no doubt,
confined to ""questions of law"". That implies, if it means anything at
all, that there can be no attack by him in the Appellate Divisional Court on
the correctness of any of the findings of fact. But we cannot regard that
provision as excluding the right of the Appellate Divisional Court, where a
conclusion of mixed law and fact, such as is the guilt or innocence of the
accused, depends, as it does here, upon the legal effect of certain findings
of fact made by the judge or the jury, as the case may be, to enquire into
the soundness of that conclusion, since we cannot regard it as anything else
but a question of law,‑‑especially where, as here, it is a clear
result of misdirection of himself in law by the learned trial judge.""

 

                   In my
opinion, the guilt of the respondent in the present appeal depends upon the
legal effect of facts found, or inferred, in the Court below. This raises
questions of law in respect of which, for the reasons already stated, I think
there was error. There is no ground not involving such questions upon which
Lemire's appeal could have been allowed. There was, therefore, a right of
appeal to this Court and the appeal should succeed.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

23.              His reliance on Belyea v. The King,
[1932] S.C.R. 279, requires an examination of that case. Belyea had been
acquitted at trial of a conspiracy to commit an offence under the Combines
Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, on the basis that ""there [was]
not sufficient evidence that the appellants participated in, or were privy to,
the subsequent admittedly illegal acts of the Windsor group...."" (p. 292) 

 

24.              As quoted by Anglin C.J. at p. 294, the
Court of Appeal entered a conviction on the grounds that ""the error in law
into which the learned judge fell was in not distinguishing between the
conspiracy itself and overt acts which, while not themselves the conspiracy,
were evidence of the existence of the conspiracy.""

 

25.              In my view, Chief Justice Anglin's
remarks, cited above, relied upon by Martland J. in Lemire, supra,
and subsequently in Wild, supra, were in answer to, and must be
understood with that context in mind, what the Chief Justice reports had been
argued by Belyea at p. 295:

 

                   If
sitting as a jury, we should have no hesitation in finding that the illegal
acts done at Windsor were a result intended by the defendants and their fellow
conspirators when they formed the organizations found to have been a
combine and a conspiracy. But we do not proceed on this ground, since to do so
would involve making a finding of fact contrary to a finding of the trial
judge.

 

                   Counsel
for the appellants argued at considerable length that the Appellate Division
had exceeded its jurisdiction in this case because it reversed the trial judge
on what counsel called a finding of fact, i.e., the innocence of the accused of
participation in the formation of an illegal combine and of conspiracy within
s. 498, Cr. C. This, it seems to us, involves a clear misconception of
the true question in issue.

 

                   Having
determined that the formation of the various organizations in question amounted
to the formation of an illegal combine, and to a conspiracy within s. 498, Cr.
C., the learned judge proceeded to deal with the questions as to who had incurred
criminal responsibility. He convicted Singer, Paddon and Ward on evidence
which, in our opinion, clearly implicated Belyea and Weinraub, in much the same
manner in which Singer and his companions were involved, in the formation of
the combine and conspiracy in question. He fell into error, however, when he
proceeded to find that it was essential to a finding of guilt of the accused,
that they should be held to have had actual knowledge of, or to have actually
participated in, the overt acts at Windsor.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

26.              It is amply clear to me that the gist of
the Court's reasons for finding an error of law is summarized in the last
sentence that I have quoted and underlined. There was in that case, in my
respectful view, an error of law.

 

27.              Therefore, it is with the greatest of
deference for the contrary view that I cannot find in Belyea, as
Martland J. did, support for the basis upon which he decided the Lemire
and the Wild appeals. I do agree with him, however, that a finding of
fact that is made in the absence of any supportive evidence is an error of law.
I must say, however, that that will happen as regards an acquittal only if
there has been a transfer to the accused by law of the burden of proof of a
given fact. 

 

28.              The footing for this statement is to be
found in the dissenting reasons of Spence J. in this Court's decision in Sunbeam
Corporation (Canada) Ltd. v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 221, and then
Cartwright C.J.'s reasons when writing for the majority of the Court in Lampard,
supra.

 

29.              Sunbeam Corporation was charged in Ontario
under the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 314, on four
counts of attempting to require or induce the maintenance of a resale price
contrary to s. 34(2) of that Act. As a result of appeals and cross appeals in
the Court of Appeal and the abandonment by the accused at the hearing in the
Court of Appeal of their appeal on counts 1 and 2, the Court of Appeal heard
and allowed the Crown's appeal on counts 3 and 4, and entered a conviction. The
Corporation then appealed to this Court. Sunbeam took the position in the
Ontario Court of Appeal and in this Court that the Crown's appeal was not on a
question of law alone, but at best on a mixed question of law and fact and that
upon such ground there lay no appeal. The prosecution's burden of proving its
case was assisted by a presumption (s. 41(2) of the Act) to the effect that
certain documents, when proved to have been in the possession of the accused,
were (1) prima facie evidence that the accused had knowledge of the
documents and their contents, and (2) that anything recorded therein as having
been done was done by its agent with the authority of the accused.

 

30.              The Crown's case relied upon certain
admissions and on the production of documents found under circumstances which
triggered the presumption. The accused Corporation's defence was put forward by
two witnesses. Neither addressed the aforementioned documents and their
testimony did not in any way attempt to rebut the prima facie evidence
of the knowledge of the accused, nor of the authority of its agent to act as he
did.

 

31.              Spence J. (Judson and Pigeon JJ.
concurring) in his dissenting reasons found that the statutory provision had
the effect of turning into a question of law alone what would otherwise have
been a finding of fact, at pp. 254‑56:

 

                   It is
contended that even if the evidence is found to be sufficient to support a
conviction, the further question of whether the guilt of the accused should be
inferred from that evidence is a question of fact and reference is made to Fraser
v. The King, [1936] S.C.R. 296, 66 C.C.C. 240, [1936] 3 D.L.R. 463, and Rose
v. The Queen, [1959] S.C.R. 441, 31 C.R. 27, 123 C.C.C. 175. Those were
cases in which facts necessary to establish the guilt of the accused had to be
inferred, in the first, from circumstantial evidence, in the other, from other
proven facts. In neither case was there a statutory provision enacting that
the proven facts would constitute prima facie evidence of the other
facts required to establish the guilt of the accused and, therefore, the making
or not making of an inference was not a question of law alone although it might
be unreasonable. However, when there is, as in this case, a statutory
presumption to be applied, once the facts necessary to give rise to it are
found by the trial judge to be established beyond reasonable doubt, the
question whether the inference should be made is no longer anything but a
question of law alone: the statute does not provide that the facts to be
inferred may be deemed to exist but that they shall be. To say
that such evidence does not bear the quality of certainty that ought to exist
in the case of a criminal charge is to ignore or contradict the statute and is,
therefore, an error in law and nothing else. 

 

                   As
against this, it is contended that the legal presumption is not a presumption
of guilt but a presumption of some facts and that the trier of the facts has to
weigh the evidence before reaching a final conclusion.

 

                   In Rose
v. The Queen, supra, Tashereau J., as he then was, said at p. 443:

 

""The trial judge
sitting without a jury was fulfilling a dual capacity. He had, therefore, to
discharge the duties attached to the functions of a judge, and also the duties
of a jury. As a judge he had to direct himself as to whether any facts had been
established by evidence from which criminal negligence may be reasonably
inferred. As a jury he had to say whether, from those facts submitted, criminal
negligence ought to be inferred. Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson,
(1877), 3 App. Cas. 193 at 197; King v. Morabito, [1949] S.C.R. 172 at
174. I think that the trial judge directed himself properly, and that when he
decided on the facts submitted to him that criminal negligence ought not to
be inferred, he was fulfilling the functions of a jury on a question of
fact.""

 

However, in that case, the
trial judge in coming to his decision that the accused should have been
acquitted was performing a function of weighing the evidence. The charge was
one of causing death by the operation of a motor vehicle, and the evidence
dealt with the conduct of the accused in driving his automobile against a red
traffic signal. The learned trial judge found that the accused was not keeping
a proper lookout but that his speed was not above the normal at the
intersection and reached the conclusion that the accused had not seen the red
light. The trial judge, weighing those facts, came to the conclusion that they
did not show the wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other
persons required for conviction of the offence charged. Therefore, the learned
trial judge had evidence one way and the other way to weigh and a conclusion to
arrive at as a result of that weighing whether such conduct showed the standard
of negligence required by the provisions of the Criminal Code . In the
present case, the learned trial judge had no such task of weighing. There was
no evidence contra; there was nothing which needed to be inferred beyond the
inference required by the section of the statute. There was a simple admission
established as prima facie evidence by the provisions of s. 41 of the Combines
Investigation Act that the accused through its agent had attempted to
induce these persons to sell at not less than the specified minimum price.
I am, therefore, of the opinion that the enunciation of the varying duties of
the judge and jury as set out above with which, with respect, I agree, do not
apply in the present case to make the learned trial judge's acquittal of the
accused a mere matter of fact.

32.              Ritchie J. wrote for the majority
(Cartwright C.J., Fauteux and Martland JJ. concurring). The following passage
at pp. 234‑35 summarizes the approach adopted by the majority:

 

                   In the
present case the trial judge accepted the evidence as contained in the letters
above referred to and thus gave full effect to s. 41(2) of the Combines
Investigation Act, but he concluded that this evidence was not sufficient
to satisfy him beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were guilty on the
3rd and 4th counts. However wrong the Court of Appeal or this Court may think
that he was in reaching this conclusion, I am of opinion, with all respect for
those who hold a different view, that this error cannot be determined without
passing judgment on the reasonableness of the verdict or the sufficiency of the
evidence, and in my view these are not matters over which the Court of Appeal
has jurisdiction under s. 584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code .

 

33.              Shortly thereafter the Lampard
decision was rendered. Lampard is a case where the finding of fact was
in relation to the intent with which Lampard had done certain acts. It is in
that case that this Court conclusively decided that a person's intention is a
question of fact. There was no onus placed upon the accused as regards proof of
his intention.

 

34.              Cartwright C.J., for the majority, said at
pp. 380‑81 that the applicable principles are to be found in Ritchie J.'s
reasons in Sunbeam:

 

                   When
the onus of establishing a certain fact lies upon a party it may be a question
of law whether there is any evidence (as distinguished from sufficient
evidence) to prove that fact. In the case at bar the onus was, of course, upon
the Crown to prove that the appellant did the acts complained of with the
guilty intention specified in the section. If the learned trial Judge erred in
finding that that onus had not been satisfied, his error was one of fact,
certainly not one of law in the strict sense. The applicable principles are
clearly set out in the reasons of my brother Ritchie giving the judgment of the
majority of this Court in the Sunbeam case, supra, and it is not
necessary to repeat them.

 

35.              Ritchie J., in Sunbeam, commenting
on a judgment of the House of Lords in Edwards (Inspector of Taxes) v.
Bairstow, [1956] A.C. 14, which had been relied upon by the Court of Appeal
in that case had said, at pp. 236‑38: 

 

                   I am
satisfied, after having read the reasons for judgment of Lord Radcliffe, that
the Bairstow case was one in which the court was required to decide
whether the facts found by the Commissioners were such as to bring the taxpayer
within the language employed in s. 237 of the English Income Tax Act, 1918,
and that the question of law upon which the House of Lords decided that case
was ""what is the meaning to be given to the words of the Income Tax Act
of `trade, manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade' ""? I
must say, with all respect, that that case does not appear to me to afford any
authority for the proposition that in an appeal against a judgment of acquittal
under s. 584(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  ""a question of law
alone"" is involved whenever a reviewing court is of opinion that the
finding of the trial judge was unreasonable and improper having regard to the
evidence.

 

                   If the
phrase ""a question of law alone"" as it occurs in that section were to
be so construed, then the result in my opinion would be not only to extend the
Attorney General's right to appeal under that section, but also to enlarge the
meaning of the phrase ""a question of law"" as it occurs in other
sections of the Criminal Code  dealing with appeals not only to the Court
of Appeal but to this Court. In my opinion such an interpretation could result
in a broadening of the scope of appellate jurisdiction under the Criminal
Code  beyond the limitations which are stipulated in the express language of
the Code itself.

 

                   The
provisions of s. 592(1)(a) of the Code provide that:

 

                   592.
(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction, the court of appeal

 

(a) may allow the
appeal where it is of the opinion that

 

                          (i) the
verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot
be supported by the evidence.

 

                          (ii) the
judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law, or

 

                          (iii) on
any ground there was a miscarriage of justice; ...

 

The italics are my own.

 

                   Parliament
has thus conferred jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal to allow an appeal
against a conviction on three separate grounds, one of which is the very ground
upon which the Court of Appeal allowed the present appeal, i.e., that ""the
verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be
supported by the evidence"". The fact that s. 592(1)(a) recognizes
this ground as being separate and distinct from ""the ground of a wrong
decision on a question of law"" appears to me to be the best kind of
evidence of the fact that Parliament did not intend the phrase ""a question
of law"" as it is used in the Code to include the question of whether the
verdict at trial was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence. It
is noteworthy that having accorded the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear
appeals against conviction on the ground that the verdict was unreasonable,
Parliament did not confer the same jurisdiction on that Court in appeals by the
Crown. No authority is needed for the proposition that appellate jurisdiction
must be expressly conferred and with all respect for those who may hold a
different view, I am of opinion that the Court of Appeal has exceeded its
jurisdiction by allowing this appeal on a ground reserved for appeals against
conviction which does not extend to appeals by the Attorney General. 

 

36.              With those principles in mind, Cartwright
C.J. went on to say, in Lampard, supra, at p. 381:

 

                   In a
criminal case (except in the rare cases in which a statutory provision
places an onus upon the accused) it can sometimes be said as a matter of
law that there is no evidence on which the Court can convict but never that
there is no evidence on which it can acquit; there is always the rebuttable
presumption of innocence.

 

(Emphasis added.)

 

37.              This passage, and the reference to the
occasional displacement of the onus onto the shoulders of the accused as an
exception, is in my view an adoption by Cartwright C.J. of the principles set out
by Ritchie J. in Sunbeam (in which he had in any event concurred), but
qualified by the exception upon which Spence J. and the minority relied in
their dissenting reasons. In other words, absent a shifting of the burden of
proof upon the accused there is always some evidence upon which to make a
finding of fact favourable to the accused, and such a finding, if in error, is
an error of fact. But when the burden of proof has been shifted (as is the case
for proof of intent when a person is found in a place which he or she has
broken into), it can be said, absent any evidence to the contrary, that there
is no evidence upon which a reasonable doubt could exist as regards the intent
of the accused, and an appeal against the ensuing acquittal raises a question
of law alone.

 

38.              I agree with Cartwright C.J.'s reading of
the majority and the minority in Sunbeam and, clear as it is, should
surely not try to improve upon it. Might I add that if and to the extent that
our judgment in Wild is taken as detracting from that statement of the
law, the views of Cartwright C.J. in Lampard, are, in my respectful
view, the proper exposition of the law.

 

39.              In the present case it is common ground
that the doubt is as regards the intent to enter the premises as well as the
accused's intention, assuming he intended to enter, once inside. There is no
onus placed on the accused as regards proof of his intent to enter. Nor is
there as regards his intent once inside, as would have been the case, however,
had he been found inside. Given the presumption of innocence and the
undisplaced burden of proof which rests with the Crown, there is, therefore,
some evidence upon which the trial judge could rest his finding and that
finding, if in error, a matter upon which I shall refrain from expressing any
views, would be an error of fact, not of law.

 

40.              I would allow the appeal, quash the Court
of Appeal's order for a new trial and restore the trial judge's acquittal.

with principles of fundamental justice ‑‑
Whether or not offence in breach of that Charter right.

 

The B.C. Motor Vehicle
Act provided for minimum periods of imprisonment for the offence of driving
on a highway or industrial road without a valid driver's licence or with a
licence under suspension. Section 94(2) of the Act, moreover, provided that
this offence was one of absolute liability in which guilt was established by
the proof of driving, whether or not the driver knew of the prohibition or
suspension. The Court of Appeal, on a reference by the provincial government,
found s. 94(2) to be of no force or effect as it was inconsistent with s. 7  of
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms : ""the right to life,
liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."" That
decision was appealed to this Court. 

 

Held: The appeal should be dismissed.

 

Per Dickson C.J. and Beetz, Chouinard, Lamer
and Le Dain JJ.: A law with the potential of convicting a person who really has
done nothing wrong offends the principles of fundamental justice and violates a
person's right to liberty under s. 7  of the Charter  if imprisonment is
available as a penalty.

 








The analysis of s. 7  was
limited to determining the scope of the words ""principles of fundamental
justice"". That phrase is not a protected right but a qualifier to the
protected right not to be deprived of ""life, liberty and security of the
person""; its function is to set the parameters of that right. Interpretation
of the term must be with reference to the protected rights but not so as to
frustrate or stultify them. An interpretation equating ""fundamental
justice"" with ""natural justice"" would not only be wrong, in that
it would strip the protected interests of most of their content, but also would
be inconsistent with the affirmative purposive expression of those rights.

 

Sections 8  to 14  address
specific deprivations of the ""right"" to life, liberty and security of
the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and as such,
violations of s. 7 . These sections are illustrative of the meaning of
""principles of fundamental justice"" in criminal or penal law. They
recognize principles given expression at common law, by international
convention and in the very entrenchment of the Charter  as essential
elements for the administration of justice founded on the dignity and worth of
the human person and the rule of law.

 

The principles of
fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and principles not only
of our judicial process but also of the other components of our legal system.
These principles are not limited to procedural guarantees, although many are of
that nature. Whether any given principle may be said to be a principle of
fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7  must rest on an analysis of the
nature, sources, rationale and essential role of that principle within
the judicial process and in our evolving legal system. The words
""principles of fundamental justice"", therefore, cannot be given any
exhaustive content or simple enumerative definition but will take on concrete
meaning as the courts address alleged violations of s. 7 .

 








The Minutes of the
Proceedings of the Special Joint Committee were admissible but without much
weight given the inherent unreliability of such speeches and statements. The
comments of a few public servants, however distinguished, could not be
determinative in light of the many actors and the role of the provinces in
arriving at the Charter . To cast the interpretation of s. 7  in terms of
the comments made at the Joint Committee Proceedings would freeze the rights,
values and freedoms expressed in the Charter  as of the moment of
adoption and deny it growth and adjustment over time. 

 

The Canadian Bill of
Rights, too, was of little assistance in construing s. 7 . The words
""principles of fundamental justice"" in s. 2(e) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights are placed explicitly in context of and qualify a
""right to a fair hearing"". Section 7  of the Charter  does not
create the same context: the words ""principles of fundamental
justice"" are placed in context of and qualify much more fundamental
rights. The distinction was important.

 

Absolute liability does not
per se violate s. 7  of the Charter . An absolute liability offence
violates s. 7  only if and to the extent that it has the potential to deprive
life, liberty or the security of the person. There is no need that imprisonment
be mandatory. The combination of imprisonment and absolute liability, however,
violates s. 7  irrespective of the nature of the offence and can only be
salvaged if the authorities demonstrate, under s. 1 , such a deprivation to be a
justified limit in a free and democratic society. Generally, no imprisonment
may be imposed for an absolute liability offence and an offence punishable by
imprisonment cannot be an absolute liability offence.

 

Public interest cannot be a
factor in determining if absolute liability offends the principles of
fundamental justice but only as a justification under s. 1 . Administrative
expediency, invoked as a justification for sacrificing s. 7  rights, should only
succeed in cases arising out of exceptional conditions such as war, natural
disasters or epidemics.

 








Section 94(2) enacts in the
clearest of terms an absolute liability offence for which conviction will
result in a person's being deprived of his liberty. Whether or not the
provision is of limited or broad effect cannot change the fact that it is in
violation of the Charter  and at best could only be considered under s.
1 . Notwithstanding the desirability of keeping bad drivers off the roads or of
punishing them, no evidence was adduced demonstrating this end or the risk of
imprisonment of a few innocent people to be a reasonable and justifiable limit
on s. 7  within the meaning of s. 1  of the Charter .

 

Per McIntyre J.: Section 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act is inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter . Fundamental
justice, as used in the Charter , involves more than natural justice,
which is largely procedural, and includes a substantive element. On any
definition of the term ""fundamental justice"", the imposition of
minimum imprisonment for an offence which may be committed unknowingly and
without intent and for which no defence can be made deprives or may deprive of
liberty and offends the principles of fundamental justice. 

 

Per Wilson J.: Section 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act violates s. 7  of the Charter  and is not saved by s. 1 .
This is because a mandatory sanction of imprisonment cannot be attached to an
absolute liability offence without offending s. 7 .

 

The phrase ""in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"" is not a
qualification on the right to life, liberty and security of the person in the
sense that it limits or modifies that right or defines its parameters. Rather
it protects the right against deprivation or impairment unless such deprivation
or impairment is effected in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 

Section 7  does not affirm a
right to the principles of fundamental justice per se. Accordingly an
absolute liability offence does not offend s. 7  unless it violates the right to
either the life, liberty or security of the person through a violation of the
principles of fundamental justice.








Section 1  of the Charter 
permits reasonable limits to be placed on the citizen's s. 7  right provided the
limits are ""prescribed by law"" and can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society. If these limits are not imposed in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice, however, they can be neither reasonable
nor justified under s. 1 . The phrase ""except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice"" restricts the government's power to
impose limits under s. 1 . A limit imposed on the s. 7  right in accordance with
the principles of fundamental justice must still meet the tests in s. 1 .

 

The courts must determine
the principles which fall under the rubric ""principles of fundamental
justice"". It would seem, however, that the phrase must include the
fundamental tenets of our justice system. The framers of the Charter 
obviously deliberately avoided the concepts of ""natural justice"" and
""due process"". There seems no good reason to restrict the principles
of fundamental justice to procedural matters in light of the reference to the
rule of law in the preamble. Indeed, no purpose is achieved by importing the
dichotomy between substance and procedure into s. 7 .

 

The principles of
sentencing, and especially that the minimum sentence required to obtain the
objectives of the system be imposed, were key to determining that s. 94(2)
offended fundamental justice. Imprisonment is the most severe sentence imposed
by law, apart from death, and is generally reserved as a last resort for
occasions when other sanctions cannot achieve the objectives of the system.
Mandatory imprisonment for an absolute liability offence committed unknowingly
and unwittingly and after the exercise of due diligence is excessive and
inhumane. Such sanction offends the principles of fundamental justice embodied
in our penal system and accordingly is inconsistent with s. 7  of the Charter .

Introduction

 

2.                A law that has the potential to
convict a person who has not really done anything wrong offends the principles
of fundamental justice and, if imprisonment is available as a penalty, such a
law then violates a person's right to liberty under s. 7 of the Charter of
Rights and Freedoms (Constitution Act, 1982 , as enacted by the Canada
Act, 1982, 1982 (U.K.), c. 11).

 

3.                In other words, absolute liability
and imprisonment cannot be combined.

 

The Facts

 

4.                On August 16, 1982, the Lieutenant‑Governor
in Council of British Columbia referred the following question to the Court of
Appeal of that province, by virtue of s. 1 of the Constitutional Question
Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 63:

 

Is s. 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, as amended by the Motor Vehicle Amendment
Act, 1982, consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ?

 

5.                On February 3, 1983, the Court of
Appeal handed down reasons in answer to the question in which it stated that s.
94(2) of the Act is inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms : (1983), 42 B.C.L.R. 364, 147 D.L.R. (3d) 539, 4 C.C.C. (3d) 243,
33 C.R. (3d) 22, 5 C.R.R. 148, 19 M.V.R. 63, [1983] 3 W.W.R. 756. The Attorney
General for British Columbia launched an appeal to this Court.

on a highway or industrial road while

 

(a) he is prohibited from driving a motor
vehicle under sections 90, 91, 92 or 92.1, or

 

(b) his driver's licence or his right to
apply for or obtain a driver's licence is suspended under section 82 or 92 as
it was before its repeal and replacement came into force pursuant to the Motor
Vehicle  Amendment Act, 1982, 

 

commits an offence and is
liable,

 

(c) on a first conviction, to a fine of not
less than $300 and not more than $2 000 and to imprisonment for not less than
7 days and not more than 6 months, and

 

(d) on a subsequent conviction, regardless of
when the contravention occurred, to a fine Of not less than $300 and not more
than $2 000 and to imprisonment for not less than 14 days and not more than one
year.

 

(2)
Subsection (1) creates an absolute liability offence in which guilt is
established by proof of driving, whether or not the defendant knew of the
prohibition or suspension.

 

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ;
Constitution Act, 1982 :

 








1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to
such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society.

 

7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty
and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

 

11. Any person charged with an offence has
the right

 

                                                                    ...

 

(d) to be presumed
innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by
an independent and impartial tribunal;

 

52. (1) The Constitution of Canada is the
supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of
the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.

 

The Judgment of the Court of Appeal of
British Columbia

 

7.                The Court was of the view that the
phrase ""principles of fundamental justice"" was not restricted to
matters of procedure, but extended to substantive law, and that the courts were
""therefore called upon, in construing the provisions of s. 7  of the
Charter , to have regard to the content of legislation"".

 








8.                Relying on the decision of this
Court in R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, the Court
of Appeal found ""that s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act is inconsistent
with the principles of fundamental justice"". They did not heed the
invitation of counsel opposing the validity of s. 94(2) to declare that, as a
result of that decision by our Court, all absolute liability offences violated
s. 7  of the Charter  and could not be salvaged under s. 1 . Quite the
contrary, the Court of Appeal said that ""there are, and will remain,
certain public welfare offences, e.g. air and water pollution offences, where
the public interest requires that the offences be absolute liability
offences"". Their finding was predicated on the following reasoning: 

 

The effect of s. 94(2) is
to transform the offence from a mens rea offence to an absolute liability
offence, hence giving the defendant no opportunity to prove that his action was
due to an honest and reasonable mistake of fact or that he acted without guilty
intent. Rather than placing the burden to establish such facts on the defendant
and thus making the offence a strict liability offence, the legislature has
seen fit to make it an absolute liability offence coupled with a mandatory term
of imprisonment.

 

9.                It can therefore be inferred with
certainty that, in the Court's view, the combination of mandatory imprisonment
and absolute liability was offensive to s. 7 . It cannot however be ascertained
from their judgment whether the violation was triggered by the requirement of
minimum imprisonment or solely by the availability of imprisonment as a
sentence.

 

Section 7 

 

1.               Introduction

 

10.              The issue in this case raises
fundamental questions of constitutional theory, including the nature and the
very legitimacy of constitutional adjudication under the Charter  as well
as the appropriateness of various techniques of constitutional interpretation.
I shall deal first with these questions of a more general and theoretical
nature as they underlie and have shaped much of the discussion surrounding s.
7 .

 

2.               The
Nature and Legitimacy of Constitutional Adjudication Under the Charter 








11.              The British Columbia Court of Appeal
has written in the present case that the Constitution Act, 1982  has
added a new dimension to the role of the courts in that the courts have now
been empowered by s. 52  to consider not only the vires of legislation
but also to measure the content of legislation against the constitutional
requirements of the Charter .

 

12.              The novel feature of the Constitution
Act, 1982 , however, is not that it has suddenly empowered courts to
consider the content of legislation. This the courts have done for a good many
years when adjudicating upon the vires of legislation. The initial
process in such adjudication has been characterized as ""a distillation of
the constitutional value represented by the challenged legislation""
(Laskin, Canadian Constitutional Law (3rd ed. rev. 1969), p. 85), and as
identifying ""the true meaning of the challenged law"" (Lederman (ed.),
The Courts and the Canadian Constitution (1964), p. 186), and ""an
abstract of the statute's content"" (Professor A. S. Abel, ""The
Neglected Logic of 91 and 92"" (1969), 19 U. of T. L.J. 487, p.
490). This process has of necessity involved a measurement of the content of
legislation against the requirements of the Constitution, albeit within the more
limited sphere of values related to the distribution of powers. 

 

13.              The truly novel features of the Constitution
Act, 1982  are that it has sanctioned the process of constitutional
adjudication and has extended its scope so as to encompass a broader range of
values. Content of legislation has always been considered in constitutional
adjudication. Content is now to be equally considered as regards new
constitutional issues. Indeed, the values subject to constitutional adjudication
now pertain to the rights of individuals as well as the distribution of
governmental powers. In short, it is the scope of constitutional adjudication
which has been altered rather than its nature, at least, as regards the right
to consider the content of legislation.

 








14.              In neither case, be it before or after
the Charter , have the courts been enabled to decide upon the
appropriateness of policies underlying legislative enactments. In both instances,
however, the courts are empowered, indeed required, to measure the content of
legislation against the guarantees of the Constitution. The words of Dickson J.
(as he then was) in Amax Potash Ltd. v. Government of Saskatchewan,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 576, at p. 590, continue to govern:

 

The Courts will not
question the wisdom of enactments ... but it is the high duty of this Court to
insure that the Legislatures do not transgress the limits of their
constitutional mandate and engage in the illegal exercise of power.

 

15.              In this respect, s. 7  is no different
than other Charter  provisions. As the Attorney General for Ontario has
noted in his factum:

 

Section 7 , like most of the
other sections in the Charter , limits the bounds of legislative action.
It is the function of the Court to determine whether the challenged legislation
has honoured those boundaries. This process necessitates judicial review of the
content of the legislation.

 

Yet, in the context of s. 7 , and in
particular, of the interpretation of ""principles of fundamental
justice"", there has prevailed in certain quarters an assumption that all
but a narrow construction of s. 7  will inexorably lead the courts to
""question the wisdom of enactments"", to adjudicate upon the merits of
public policy.

 

16.              From this have sprung warnings of the
dangers of a judicial ""super‑legislature"" beyond the reach of
Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the electorate. The Attorney
General for Ontario, in his written argument, stated that,

 








... the judiciary is
neither representative of, nor responsive to the electorate on whose behalf,
and under whose authority policies are selected and given effect in the laws of
the land. 

 

 

This is an argument which was heard
countless times prior to the entrenchment of the Charter  but which has
in truth, for better or for worse, been settled by the very coming into force
of the Constitution Act, 1982 . It ought not to be forgotten that the
historic decision to entrench the Charter  in our Constitution was taken
not by the courts but by the elected representatives of the people of Canada.
It was those representatives who extended the scope of constitutional
adjudication and entrusted the courts with this new and onerous responsibility.
Adjudication under the Charter  must be approached free of any lingering
doubts as to its legitimacy.

 

17.              The concerns with the bounds of
constitutional adjudication explain the characterization of the issue in a
narrow and restrictive fashion, i.e., whether the term ""principles
of fundamental justice"" has a substantive or merely procedural content. In
my view, the characterization of the issue in such fashion preempts an open‑minded
approach to determining the meaning of ""principles of fundamental
justice"".

 








18.              The substantive/procedural dichotomy
narrows the issue almost to an all‑or‑nothing proposition.
Moreover, it is largely bound up in the American experience with substantive
and procedural due process. It imports into the Canadian context American
concepts, terminology and jurisprudence, all of which are inextricably linked
to problems concerning the nature and legitimacy of adjudication under the U.S.
Constitution. That Constitution, it must be remembered, has no s. 52  nor has it
the internal checks and balances of ss. 1 and 33. We would, in my view, do our
own Constitution a disservice to simply allow the American debate to define the
issue for us, all the while ignoring the truly fundamental structural
differences between the two constitutions. Finally, the dichotomy creates its
own set of difficulties by the attempt to distinguish between two concepts
whose outer boundaries are not always clear and often tend to overlap. Such
difficulties can and should, when possible, be avoided.

 

19.              The overriding and legitimate concern
that courts ought not to question the wisdom of enactments, and the presumption
that the legislator could not have intended same, have to some extent distorted
the discussion surrounding the meaning of ""principles of fundamental
justice"". This has led to the spectre of a judicial ""super‑legislature""
without a full consideration of the process of constitutional adjudication and
the significance of ss. 1  and 33  of the Charter  and s. 52  of the Constitution
Act, 1982 . This in turn has also led to a narrow characterization of the
issue and to the assumption that only a procedural content to ""principles
of fundamental justice"" can prevent the courts from adjudicating upon the
merits or wisdom of enactments. If this assumption is accepted, the inevitable
corollary, with which I would have to then agree, is that the legislator
intended that the words ""principles of fundamental justice"" refer to
procedure only. 

 

20.              But I do not share that assumption.
Since way back in time and even recently the courts have developed the common
law beyond procedural safeguards without interfering with the ""merits or
wisdom"" of enactments (e.g., Kienapple v. The Queen, [1975]
1 S.C.R. 729, entrapment, non‑retrospectivity of offences, presumptions
against relaxing the burden of proof and persuasion, to give a few examples).

 








21.              The task of the Court is not to choose
between substantive or procedural content per se but to secure for
persons ""the full benefit of the Charter 's protection""
(Dickson J. (as he then was) in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] 1
S.C.R. 295, at p. 344), under s. 7 , while avoiding adjudication of the merits
of public policy. This can only be accomplished by a purposive analysis and the
articulation (to use the words in Curr v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 889,
at p. 899) of ""objective and manageable standards"" for the operation
of the section within such a framework.

 

22.              I propose therefore to approach the
interpretation of s. 7  in the manner set forth by Dickson J. in Hunter v.
Southam Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, and R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra,
and by Le Dain J. in R. v. Therens, [1985] 1 S.C.R.
613. In R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., Dickson J. wrote at p. 344:

 

In Hunter v. Southam
Inc., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, this Court expressed the view that the proper
approach to the definition of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter 
was a purposive one. The meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter 
was to be ascertained by an analysis of the purpose of such a guarantee;
it was to be understood, in other words, in the light of the interests it was
meant to protect.

 

In my
view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom
in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger
objects of the Charter  itself, to the language chosen to articulate the
specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined,
and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights
and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the Charter .
The interpretation should be, as the judgment in Southam emphasizes, a
generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of the
guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter 's
protection. 

 

 

3.               The Principles of
Fundamental Justice

 








23.              I would first note that I shared the
views of Wilson J. in her statement in Singh v. Minister of Employment and
Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at p. 205, that ""it is incumbent
upon the Court to give meaning to each of the elements, life, liberty and
security of the person, which make up the ‘right’ contained in s. 7 "". Each of these,
in my view, is a distinct though related concept to be construed as such by the
courts. It is clear that s. 7  surely protects the right not to be deprived of
one's life, liberty and security of the person when that is done in breach of
the principles of fundamental justice. The outcome of this case is dependent
upon the meaning to be given to that portion of the section which states
""and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice"". On the facts of this case it is not
necessary to decide whether the section gives any greater protection, such as
deciding whether, absent a breach of the principles of fundamental justice,
there still can be, given the way the section is structured, a violation of
one's rights to life, liberty and security of the person under s. 7 .
Furthermore, because of the fact that only depreviation of liberty was
considered in these proceedings and that no one took issue with the fact that
imprisonment is a deprivation of liberty, my analysis of s. 7  will be limited,
as was the course taken by all, below and in this Court, to determining the
scope of the words ""principles of fundamental justice"", I will not
attempt to give any further content to liberty nor address that of the words
life or security of the person.

 

24.              In the framework of a purposive
analysis, designed to ascertain the purpose of the s. 7  guarantee and ""the
interests it was meant to protect"" (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra),
it is clear to me that the interests which are meant to be protected by the words
""and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice"" of s. 7  are the life, liberty and
security of the person. The principles of fundamental justice, on the other
hand, are not a protected interest, but rather a qualifier of the right not to
be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person.

 








25.              Given that, as the Attorney General
for Ontario has acknowledged, ""when one reads the phrase ‘principles of
fundamental justice’, a single incontrovertible meaning is not
apparent"", its meaning must, in my view, be determined by reference to the
interests which those words of the section are designed to protect and the
particular role of the phrase within the section. As a qualifier, the phrase
serves to establish the parameters of the interests but it cannot be
interpreted so narrowly as to frustrate or stultify them. For the narrower the
meaning given to ""principles of fundamental justice"" the greater will
be the possibility that individuals may be deprived of these most basic rights.
This latter result is to be avoided given that the rights involved are as
fundamental as those which pertain to the life, liberty and security of the
person, the deprivation of which ""has the most severe consequences upon an
individual"" (R. v. Cadeddu (1982), 40 O.R. (2d) 128 (H.C.), at p. 139). 

 

26.              For these reasons, I am of the view
that it would be wrong to interpret the term ""fundamental justice"" as
being synonymous with natural justice as the Attorney General of British
Columbia and others have suggested. To do so would strip the protected
interests of much, if not most, of their content and leave the
""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person in a sorely
emaciated state. Such a result would be inconsistent with the broad,
affirmative language in which those rights are expressed and equally
inconsistent with the approach adopted by this Court toward the interpretation
of Charter  rights in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker,
[1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, per Estey J., and Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra.

 

27.              It would mean that the right to
liberty would be narrower than the right not to be arbitrarily detained or
imprisoned (s. 9 ), that the right to security of the person would have less
content than the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure (s.
8 ). Such an interpretation would give the specific expressions of the
""right to life, liberty and security of the person"" which are set
forth in ss. 8  to 14  greater content than the general concept from which they
originate.

 








28.              Sections 8  to 14 , in other words,
address specific deprivations of the ""right"" to life, liberty and
security of the person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and
as such, violations of s. 7 . They are designed to protect, in a specific manner
and setting, the right to life, liberty and security of the person set forth in
s. 7 . It would be incon­gruous to interpret s. 7  more narrowly than the rights
in ss. 8  to 14 . The alternative, which is to interpret all of ss. 8  to 14  in a
""narrow and technical"" manner for the sake of congruity, is out of
the question (Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, supra, at
p. 366).

 

29.              Sections 8  to 14  are illustrative of
deprivations of those rights to life, liberty and security of the person in
breach of the principles of fundamental justice. For they, in effect,
illustrate some of the parameters of the ""right"" to life, liberty and
security of the person; they are examples of instances in which the
""right"" to life, liberty and security of the person would be violated
in a manner which is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice. To put matters in a different way, ss. 7  to 14  could have been fused
into one section, with inserted between the words of s. 7  and the rest of those
sections the oft utilised provision in our statutes, ""and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing (s. 7 ) the following shall be deemed
to be in violation of a person's rights under this section"". Clearly, some
of those sections embody principles that are beyond what could be characterized
as ""procedural"". 

 

30.              Thus, ss. 8 to 14 provide an
invaluable key to the meaning of ""principles of fundamental justice"".
Many have been developed over time as presumptions of the common law, others
have found expression in the international conventions on human rights. All
have been recognized as essential elements of a system for the administration
of justice which is founded upon a belief in ""the dignity and worth of the
human person"" (preamble to the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C.
1970, App. III) and on ""the rule of law"" (preamble to the Canadian
Charter of Rights and Freedoms ).








31.              It is this common thread which, in my
view, must guide us in determining the scope and content of ""principles of
fundamental justice"". In other words, the principles of fundamental
justice are to be found in the basic tenets of our legal system. They do not
lie in the realm of general public policy but in the inherent domain of the
judiciary as guardian of the justice system. Such an approach to the
interpretation of ""principles of fundamental justice"" is consistent
with the wording and structure of s. 7 , the context of the section, i.e.,
ss. 8 to 14, and the character and larger objects of the Charter  itself.
It provides meaningful content for the s. 7  guarantee all the while avoiding
adjudication of policy matters.

 

32.              Thus, it seems to me that to replace
""fundamental justice"" with the term ""natural justice""
misses the mark entirely. It was, after all, clearly open to the legislator to
use the term natural justice, a known term of art, but such was not done. We
must, as a general rule, be loath to exchange the terms actually used with
terms so obviously avoided.

 

33.              Whatever may have been the degree of
synonymy between the two expressions in the past, (which in any event has not
been clearly demonstrated by the parties and interveners), as of the last few
decades this country has given a precise meaning to the words natural justice
for the purpose of delineating the responsibility of adjudicators (in the wide
sense of the word) in the field of administrative law.

 

34.              It is, in my view, that precise and
somewhat narrow meaning that the legislator avoided, clearly indicating thereby
a will to give greater content to the words ""principles of fundamental
justice"", the limits of which were left for the courts to develop but
within, of course, the acceptable sphere of judicial activity. 

 








4.                Proceedings
and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of
Commons on the Constitution of Canada

 

35.              A number of courts have placed
emphasis upon the Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint
Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution in the
interpretation of ""principles of fundamental justice"", e.g., Latham
v. Solicitor General of Canada, [1984] 2 F.C. 734, 39 C.R. (3d) 78; Re
Mason; Mason v. R. in Right of Canada (1983), 35 C.R. (3d) 393 (Ont.
H.C.); R. v. Holman (1982), 28 C.R. (3d) 378 (B.C. Prov. Ct.)

 

36.              In particular, the following passages
dealing with the testimony of federal civil servants from the Department of
Justice, have been relied upon:

 

Mr.
Strayer (Assistant Deputy Minister, Public Law):

 

Mr.
Chairman, it was our belief that the words ""fundamental justice""
would cover the same thing as what is called procedural due process, that is
the meaning of due process in relation to requiring fair procedure. However, it
in our view does not cover the concept of what is called substantive due
process, which would impose substantive requirements as to policy of the law in
question.

 

This
has been most clearly demonstrated in the United States in the area of
property, but also in other areas such as the right to life. The term due
process has been given the broader concept of meaning both the procedure and
substance. Natural justice or fundamental justice in our view does not go
beyond the procedural requirements of fairness.

 

                                                                    ...

 

Mr.
Strayer: The term
""fundamental justice"" appears to us to be essentially the same thing
as natural justice.








Mr. Tassé (Deputy Minister) also said of the
phrase ""principles of fundamental justice"" in testimony before the
Committee:

 

We
assume that the Court would look at that much like a Court would look at the
requirements of natural justice, and the concept of natural justice is quite
familiar to courts and they have given a good deal of specific meaning to the
concept of natural justice. We would think that the Court would find in that
phraseology principles of fundamental justice a meaning somewhat like natural
justice or inherent fairness.

 

Courts
have been developing the concept of administrative fairness in recent years and
they have been able to give a good deal of consideration, certainly to these
sorts of concepts and we would expect they could do the same with this.

 

37.              The Honourable Jean Chrétien, then
federal Minister of Justice, also indicated to the Committee that, while he
thought ""fundamental justice marginally more appropriate than natural
justice"" in s. 7 , either term was acceptable to the Government. 

 

(a) Admissibility

 

38.              The first issue which arises is
whether the Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint
Committee may even be considered admissible as extrinsic aids to the
interpretation of Charter  provisions. Such extrinsic materials were
traditionally excluded from consideration in constitutional adjudication: e.g.,
Gosselin v. The King (1903), 33 S.C.R. 255, at p. 264; Reference re
Wartime Leasehold Regulations, [1950] S.C.R. 124.

 

39.              In Reference re Upper Churchill
Water Rights Reversion Act, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 297, at p. 317, however, McIntyre
J. stated that,

 








The
general exclusionary rule formerly considered to be applicable in dealing with
the admissibility of extrinsic evidence in constitutional cases has been set
aside or at least greatly modified and relaxed.

 

40.              Indeed, in the reference Re: Anti‑Inflation
Act, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 373, Laskin C.J. stated, at p. 389:

 

...no general principle of
admissibility or inadmissibility can or ought to be propounded by this Court,
and ...the questions of resort to extrinsic evidence and what kind of extrinsic
evidence may be admitted must depend on the constitutional issues on which it
is sought adduce such evidence.

 

41.              This approach was adopted by Dickson
J. in the reference Re Residential Tenancies Act, 1979, [1981] 1 S.C.R.
714, and McIntyre J. in Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion
Act, supra, in which he stated at p. 318:

 

It will therefore be open
to the Court in a proper case to receive and consider extrinsic evidence on the
operation and effect of the legislation.

 

42.              It is to be noted, however, that
McIntyre J.'s remarks are in relation to the interpretation of the challenged
statutory enactment rather than the interpretation of the Constitution itself.
The same is true of the remarks of Laskin C.J. and Dickson J.

 

43.              With respect to the interpretation of
the Constitution, however, such extrinsic materials were considered, in at
least two cases, by this Court.

 

44.              In Re: Authority of Parliament in
relation to the Upper House, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 54, the Court stated, at p.
66:

 








It is,
we think, proper to consider the historical background which led to the
provision which was made in the Act for the creation of the Senate as a part of
the apparatus for the enactment of federal legislation. In the debates which
occurred at the Quebec Conference in 1864, considerable time was occupied in
discussing the provisions respecting the Senate. Its important purpose is
stated in the following passages in speeches delivered in the debates on
Confederation in the parliament of the province of Canada: 

 

45.              The other case is Attorney General
of Canada v. Canadian National Transportation, Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 206.
Laskin C.J., in that case, referred to the pre‑Confederation debates in
the course of interpreting ss. 91(27)  and 92(14)  of the Constitution Act,
1867  (at p. 225).

 

46.              I would adopt this approach when
interpreting the Charter . Consequently, the Minutes of the Proceedings
and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution should, in my
view, be considered.

 

(b) Weight

 

47.              Having said that, however, I
nonetheless believe that the logic underlying the reluctance to allow the use
of materials such as speeches in Parliament carries considerable force with
respect to the Minutes of the Committee as well.

 

48.              In Reference re Upper Churchill
Water Rights Reversion Act, supra, McIntyre J. wrote at p. 319;

 

... I would say that the
speeches and public declarations by prominent figures in the public and
political life of Newfoundland on this question should not be received as
evidence. They represent, no doubt, the considered views of the speakers at the
time they were made, but cannot be said to be expressions of the intent of the
Legislative Assembly.

 








49.              Professor J. E. Magnet has written in
""The Presumption of Constitutionality"" (1980), 18 Osgoode Hall
L.J. 87, at pp. 99‑100:

 

In an administrative law
setting, ""The admissibility of ... (factual) evidence (on the issue of
legislative intent) ... seems so clear as not to require authority ....""

 

The
transposition of the administrative law principle to a constitutional context
is problematic. In the administrative law cases, the issue of intent concerns
the intent of a specific person. In the constitutional cases, the issue of
intent concerns the legislature, an incorporeal body made up of hundreds of
persons. It may be said that such a body, like a corporation, is a legal
fiction and has no intention in the relevant sense. It would follow that
legislative intent, in the constitutional setting, is a hollow concept.

 

Largely
in consideration of this argument, Canadian courts have developed the rule
that, in scrutinizing legislative intent for the purpose of determining
constitutional validity, statements by members of the legislature during
passage of the challenged Act are irrelevant and inadmissible. Several
explanations of the rule have been put forward. Strayer has argued that the
rule is sound because legislative motive is irrelevant to constitutional
validity: ""The essential factual issue here is that of effect....""
More convincingly, it has been argued that, considering the way in which the
Canadian process of enactment differs from that of the United States,
""Hansard gives no convincing proof of what the government
intended...."" Moreover, by allowing ambiguities in the statute to be
resolved by statements in the legislature, ministers would be given power in
effect to legislate indirectly by making such statements. ""Cabinets
already have powers enough without having this added unto them."" 

 

50.              If speeches and declarations by
prominent figures are inherently unreliable (per McIntyre J. in Reference
re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, supra, at p. 319) and
""speeches made in the legislature at the time of enactment of the measure
are inadmissible as having little evidential weight"" (per Dickson
J. in the reference Re: Residential Tenancies Act 1979, supra, at
p. 721), the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Special Joint Committee, though
admissible, and granted somewhat more weight than speeches should not be given
too much weight. The inherent unreliability of such statements and speeches is
not altered by the mere fact that they pertain to the Charter  rather
than a statute.

 








51.              Moreover, the simple fact remains that
the Charter  is not the product of a few individual public servants,
however distinguished, but of a multiplicity of individuals who played major
roles in the negotiating, drafting and adoption of the Charter . How can
one say with any confidence that within this enormous multiplicity of actors,
without forgetting the role of the provinces, the comments of a few federal
civil servants can in any way be determinative?

 

52.              Were this Court to accord any
significant weight to this testimony, it would in effect be assuming a fact
which is nearly impossible of proof, i.e., the intention of the
legislative bodies which adopted the Charter . In view of the
indeterminate nature of the data, it would in my view be erroneous to give
these materials anything but minimal weight.

 

53.              Another danger with casting the
interpretation of s. 7  in terms of the comments made by those heard at the
Special Joint Committee Proceedings is that, in so doing, the rights, freedoms
and values embodied in the Charter  in effect become frozen in time to
the moment of adoption with little or no possibility of growth, development and
adjustment to changing societal needs. Obviously, in the present case, given
the proximity in time of the Charter debates, such a problem is
relatively minor, even though it must be noted that even at this early stage in
the life of the Charter , a host of issues and questions have been raised
which were largely unforeseen at the time of such proceedings. If the newly
planted ""living tree"" which is the Charter  is to have the
possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure
that historical materials, such as the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of
the Special Joint Committee, do not stunt its growth. As Estey J. wrote in Law
Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, supra, at pp. 366‑67: 

 








Narrow and technical
interpretation, if not modulated by a sense of the unknowns of the future, can
stunt the growth of the law and hence the community it serves. All this has
long been with us in the process of developing the institutions of government
under the B.N.A. Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867 ). With
the Constitution Act, 1982  comes a new dimension, a new yardstick of reconciliation
between the individual and the community and their respective rights, a
dimension which, like the balance of the Constitution, remains to be
interpreted and applied by the Court.

 

5. The Canadian Bill of Rights

 

54.              The appellant states that s. 7 
""is a blend of s. 1(a) and s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill
of Rights"". Considerable emphasis is then placed upon the case of Duke
v. The Queen, [1972] S.C.R. 917, in which this Court interpreted the words
""principles of fundamental justice"" in s. 2(e) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights. Fauteux C.J. noted, at p. 923:

 

Without attempting to
formulate any final definition of those words, I would take them to mean,
generally, that the tribunal which adjudicates upon his rights must act fairly,
in good faith, without bias, and in a judicial temper, and must give to him the
opportunity adequately to state his case.

 

55.              However, as Le Dain J. has written in R.
v. Therens, supra, with the implicit support of the majority, at p.
638:

 

In my
opinion the premise that the framers of the Charter  must be presumed to
have intended that the words used by it should be given the meaning which had
been given to them by judicial decisions at the time the Charter  was
enacted is not a reliable guide to its interpretation and application. By its
very nature a constitutional charter of rights and freedoms must use general
language which is capable of development and adaptation by the courts.

 

And after at pp. 638‑39:

 

Although it is clear that
in several instances, as in the case of s. 10 , the framers of the Charter 
adopted the wording of the Canadian Bill of Rights, it is also clear
that the Charter  must be regarded, because of its constitutional
character, as a new affirmation of rights and freedoms and of judicial power
and responsibility in relation to their protection.








                             . . .

In considering the
relationship of a decision under the Canadian Bill of Rights to an issue
arising under the Charter , a court cannot, in my respectful opinion,
avoid bearing in mind an evident fact of Canadian judicial history, which must
be squarely and frankly faced: that on the whole, with some notable exceptions,
the courts have felt some uncertainty or ambivalence in the application of the Canadian
Bill of Rights because it did not reflect a clear constitutional mandate to
make judicial decisions having the effect of limiting or qualifying the
traditional sovereignty of Parliament. The significance of the new
constitutional mandate for judicial review provided by the Charter  was
emphasized by this Court in its recent decisions in Law Society of Upper
Canada v. Skapinker, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 357, and Hunter v. Southam Inc.,
supra. 

 

 

56.              This view was also put forward by
Wilson J. in her judgment in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration,
supra, with which Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. concurred, at p. 209:

 

It seems to me rather that
the recent adoption of the Charter  by Parliament and nine of the ten
provinces as part of the Canadian constitutional framework has sent a clear
message to the courts that the restrictive attitude which at times
characterized their appproach to the Canadian Bill of Rights ought to be
re‑examined.

 

57.              In any event, the Duke case is
of little assistance in the interpretation of s. 7  of the Charter .
Section 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights states:

 

2. Every law of Canada shall, unless it is
expressly declared by an Act of the Parliament of Canada that it shall operate
notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, be so construed and applied
as not to abrogate, abridge or infringe or to authorize the abrogation,
abridgment or infringement of any of the rights or freedoms herein recognized
and declared, and in particular, no law of Canada shall be construed or applied
so as to

 

                                                                    ...

 








(e) deprive a person
of the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice for the determination of his rights and obligations;

 

58.              In section 2(e) of the Canadian
Bill of Rights, the words ""principles of fundamental justice""
were placed explicitly in the context of, and qualify a ""right to a fair
hearing"". Section 7  of the Charter  does not create the same
context. In section 7, the words ""principles of fundamental justice""
are placed in the context of, and qualify much more fundamental rights, the
""right to life, liberty and security of the person"". The distinction
is important.

 

Conclusion

 

59.              I have, in this judgment, undertaken a
purposive analysis of the term ""principles of fundamental justice"" in
s. 7  of the Charter  in accordance with the method established by this
Court in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., supra. Accordingly, the
point of departure for the analysis has been a consideration of the general
objectives of the Charter  in the light of the general principles of Charter 
interpretation set forth in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, supra,
and Hunter v. Southam Inc., supra. This was followed by a
detailed analysis of the language and structure of the section as well as its
immediate context within the Charter . 

 








60.              The main sources of support for the
argument that ""fundamental justice"" is simply synonymous with natural
justice have been the Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special
Joint Committee on the Constitution and the Canadian Bill of Rights
jurisprudence. In my view, neither the Minutes nor the Canadian Bill of Rights
jurisprudence are persuasive or of any great force. The historical usage of the
term ""fundamental justice"" is, on the other hand, shrouded in
ambiguity. Moreover, not any one of these arguments, taken singly or as a
whole, manages to overcome in my respectful view the textual and contextual
analyses.

 

61.              Consequently, my conclusion may be
summarized as follows:

 

62.              The term ""principles of
fundamental justice"" is not a right, but a qualifier of the right not to
be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person; its function is to set
the parameters of that right.

 

63.              Sections 8 to 14 address specific
deprivations of the ""right"" to life, liberty and security of the
person in breach of the principles of fundamental justice, and as such,
violations of s. 7 . They are therefore illustrative of the meaning, in criminal
or penal law, of ""principles of fundamental justice""; they represent
principles which have been recognized by the common law, the international
conventions and by the very fact of entrenchment in the Charter , as
essential elements of a system for the administration of justice which is
founded upon the belief in the dignity and worth of the human person and the
rule of law.

 

64.              Consequently, the principles of
fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and principles, not
only of our judicial process, but also of the other components of our legal
system.

 








65.              We should not be surprised to find
that many of the principles of fundamental justice are procedural in nature.
Our common law has largely been a law of remedies and procedures and, as
Frankfurter J. wrote in McNabb v. United States 318 U.S. 332 (1942), at
p. 347, ""the history of liberty has largely been the history of observance
of procedural safeguards"". This is not to say, however, that the
principles of fundamental justice are limited solely to procedural guarantees.
Rather, the proper approach to the determination of the principles of
fundamental justice is quite simply one in which, as Professor L. Tremblay has
written, ""future growth will be based on historical roots"" (""Section
7  of the Charter : Substantive Due Process?""(1984), 18 U.B.C.L. Rev.
201, at p. 254). 

 

66.              Whether any given principle may be
said to be a principle of fundamental justice within the meaning of s. 7  will
rest upon an analysis of the nature, sources, rationale and essential
role of that principle within the judicial process and in our legal system, as
it evolves.

 

67.              Consequently, those words cannot be
given any exhaustive content or simple enumerative definition, but will take on
concrete meaning as the courts address alleged violations of s. 7 .

 

68.              I now turn to such an analysis of the
principle of mens rea and absolute liability offences in order to determine
the question which has been put to the Court in the present Reference.

 

Absolute Liability and Fundamental
Justice in Penal Law

 

69.              It has from time immemorial been part
of our system of laws that the innocent not be punished. This principle has
long been recognized as an essential element of a system for the administration
of justice which is founded upon a belief in the dignity and worth of the human
person and on the rule of law. It is so old that its first enunciation was in
Latin actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea.

 

70.              As Glanville Williams said:








There
is no need here to go into the remote history of mens rea; suffice it to
say that the requirement of a guilty state of mind (at least for the more
serious crimes) had been developed by the time of Coke, which is as far back as
the modern lawyer needs to go. ""If one shoot at any wild fowl upon a tree,
and the arrow killeth any reasonable creature afar off, without any evil intent
in him, this is per infortunium.""

 

(Glanville Williams, Criminal Law, The
General Part, 2nd ed. (London, 1961), at p. 30.)

 

71.              One of the many judicial statements on
the subject worth mentioning is of the highest authority, per Goddard
C.J. in Harding v. Price, [1948] 1 K.B. 695, at p. 700, where he said:

 

The general rule applicable
to criminal cases is actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, and I venture to
repeat what I said in Brend v. Wood (1946), 62 T.L.R. 462, 463: `It is
of the utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a
court should always bear in mind that, unless a statute either clearly or by
necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the
court should not find a man guilty of an offence against the criminal law
unless he has a guilty mind'.

 

72.              This view has been adopted by this
Court in unmistakable terms in many cases, amongst which the better known are Beaver
v. The Queen, [1957] S.C.R. 531, and the most recent and often quoted
judgment of Dickson J. writing for the Court in R. v. City of Sault Ste.
Marie, supra. 

 








73.              This Court's decision in the latter
case is predicated upon a certain number of postulates one of which, given the
nature of the rules it elaborates, has to be to the effect that absolute
liability in penal law offends the principles of fundamental justice. Those
principles are, to use the words of Dickson J., to the effect that ""there
is a generally held revulsion against punishment of the morally innocent"".
He also stated that the argument that absolute liability ""violates
fundamental principles of penal liability"" was the most telling argument
against absolute liability and one of greater force than those advanced in support
thereof.

 

74.              In my view it is because absolute
liability offends the principles of fundamental justice that this Court created
presumptions against legislatures having intended to enact offences of a
regulatory nature falling within that category. This is not to say, however,
and to that extent I am in agreement with the Court of Appeal, that, as a
result, absolute liability per se offends s. 7  of the Charter .

 

75.              A law enacting an absolute liability
offence will violate s. 7  of the Charter  only if and to the extent that
it has the potential of depriving of life, liberty, or security of the person.

 

76.              Obviously, imprisonment (including
probation orders) deprives persons of their liberty. An offence has that
potential as of the moment it is open to the judge to impose imprisonment.
There is no need that imprisonment, as in s. 94(2), be made mandatory.

 

77.              I am therefore of the view that the
combination of imprisonment and of absolute liability violates s. 7  of the Charter 
and can only be salvaged if the authorities demonstrate under s. 1  that such a
deprivation of liberty in breach of those principles of fundamental justice is,
in a free and democratic society, under the circumstances, a justified
reasonable limit to one's rights under s. 7 .

 








78.              As no one has addressed imprisonment
as an alternative to the non‑payment of a fine, I prefer not to express
any views in relation to s. 7  as regards that eventuality as a result of a
conviction for an absolute liability offence; nor do I need to address here,
given the scope of my finding and the nature of this appeal, minimum
imprisonment, whether it offends the Charter per se or whether such
violation, if any, is dependent upon whether it be for a mens rea or
strict liability offence. Those issues were not addressed by the court below
and it would be unwise to attempt to address them here. It is sufficient and
desirable for this appeal to make the findings I have and no more, that is,
that no imprisonment may be imposed for an absolute liability offence, and,
consequently, given the question put to us, an offence punishable by
imprisonment cannot be an absolute liability offence. 

 

79.              Before considering s. 94(2) in the
light of these findings, I feel we are however compelled to go somewhat further
for the following reason. I would not want us to be taken by this conclusion as
having inferentially decided that absolute liability may not offend s. 7  as
long as imprisonment or probation orders are not available as a sentence. The
answer to that question is dependant upon the content given to the words
""security of the person"". That issue was and is a live one. Indeed,
though the question as framed focuses on absolute liability (s. 94(2)) in
relation to the whole Charter , including the right to security of the
person in s. 7 , because of the presence of mandatory imprisonment in s. 94(1) 
only deprivation of liberty was considered. As the effect of imprisonment on
the right to liberty is a foregone conclusion, a fortiori minimum
imprisonment, everyone directed their arguments when discussing s. 7  to
considering whether absolute liability violated the principles of fundamental
justice, and then subsidiarily argued pro or contra the effect of
s. 1  of the Charter .

 

80.              Counsel for those opposing the
validity of s. 94(2) took the position in this Court that absolute liability
and severe punishment, always referring to imprisonment, violated s. 7  of the Charter .
From the following passage of the judgment in the Court of Appeal it would
appear that counsel for those opposing the validity of the section took the
wider position in that Court that all absolute liability offences violated s. 7 
because of ""punishment of the morally innocent"":








In
seeking to persuade the court to that conclusion counsel opposing the validity
of s. 94(2) contended all absolute offences are now of no force and effect
because of s. 7  of the Charter  and that the provisions of s. 1  of the Charter 
should not be invoked to sustain them. In support of this submission counsel
relied upon the view expressed by Dickson J. in Sault Ste. Marie that
there was ‘a generally held revulsion against punishment of the morally innocent’. They contended
that had the Charter  been in effect when Sault Ste. Marie was decided
all absolute liability offences would have been struck down.

 

We
accept without hesitation the statement expressed by the learned justice but do
not think it necessarily follows that because of s. 7  of the Charter  this
category of offence can no longer be legislated. To the contrary, there are,
and will remain, certain public welfare offences, e.g., air and water pollution
offences, where the public interest requires that the offences be absolute
liability offences. 

 

 

81.              While I agree with the Court of
Appeal, as I have already mentioned, that absolute liability does not per se
violate s. 7  of the Charter , I am somewhat concerned with leaving
without comment the unqualified reference by the Court of Appeal to the
requirements of the ""public interest"".

 

82.              If, by reference to public interest,
it was meant that the requirements of public interest for certain types of
offences is a factor to be considered in determining whether absolute liability
offends the principles of fundamental justice, then I would respectfully
disagree; if the public interest is there referred to by the Court as a
possible justification under s. 1 of a limitation to the rights protected at s.
7 , then I do agree.

 

83.              Indeed, as I said, in penal law,
absolute liability always offends the principles of fundamental justice
irrespective of the nature of the offence; it offends s. 7  of the Charter 
if as a result, anyone is deprived of his life, liberty or security of the
person, irrespective of the requirement of public interest. In such cases it
might only be salvaged for reasons of public interest under s. 1 .

 








84.              In this latter regard, something might
be added.

 

85.              Administrative expediency, absolute
liability's main supportive argument, will undoubtedly under s. 1  be invoked
and occasionally succeed. Indeed, administrative expediency certainly has its
place in administrative law. But when administrative law chooses to call in aid
imprisonment through penal law, indeed sometimes criminal law and the added
stigma attached to a conviction, exceptional, in my view, will be the case
where the liberty or even the security of the person guaranteed under s. 7 
should be sacrificed to administrative expediency. Section 1  may, for reasons
of administrative expediency, successfully come to the rescue of an otherwise
violation of s. 7 , but only in cases arising out of exceptional conditions,
such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, epidemics, and the like.

 

86.              Of course I understand the concern of
many as regards corporate offences, specially, as was mentioned by the Court of
Appeal, in certain sensitive areas such as the preservation of our vital
environment and our natural resources. This concern might well be dispelled
were it to be decided, given the proper case, that s. 7  affords protection to
human persons only and does not extend to corporations.

 

87.              Even if it be decided that s. 7  does
extend to corporations, I think the balancing under s. 1 of the public interest
against the financial interests of a corporation would give very different
results from that of balancing public interest and the liberty or security of
the person of a human being. 

 








88.              Indeed, the public interest as regards
""air and water pollution offences"" requires that the guilty be dealt
with firmly, but the seriousness of the offence does not in my respectful view
support the proposition that the innocent human person be open to
conviction, quite the contrary.

 

Section 94(2)

 

89.              No doubt s. 94(2) enacts in the
clearest of terms an absolute liability offence, the conviction for which a
person will be deprived of his or her liberty, and little more, if anything,
need be added. However, I should not want to conclude without addressing an
argument raised by the appellant in this Court and considered by the British
Columbia Court of Appeal.

 

90.              The appellant argues that, as a result
of the case of R. v. MacDougall, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 605, s. 94(2) (the
absolute liability provision) is of limited effect. Hence, the section raises
""a false impression of a potential for wholesale injustice,"" says the
appellant. In my view, this argument is of little relevance to the
determination of this appeal. Whether the provision is of broad or of
""limited"" effect does not change its nature nor lead to a different
characterization for the purpose of determining a violation of s. 7 . The
question is whether the provision offends s. 7  of the Charter  at all,
rather than whether it does so in ""limited"" or ""wholesale""
fashion. At best, this argument may be considered under s. 1 .

 

91.              The appellant summarizes the decision
in MacDougall as establishing that ""where an accused is charged
with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was cancelled (contrary to a
provincial statute) and the revocation in question arose automatically as a
matter of law pursuant to a provincial statute, ignorance by the accused of the
fact that his licence was revoked is ignorance of law and cannot provide the
basis for an acquittal"".

 








92.              The respondent, however, distinguishes
the MacDougall case from the case at bar on two grounds. First, the
offence under consideration in MacDougall was one of strict liability
rather than absolute liability. Secondly, while MacDougall ""dealt
only with a suspension by operation of law, section 94(2) encompasses Court
imposed suspensions (section 90(2)), suspensions arising under the `old law' in
the absence of the accused, and suspensions imposed by administrative review by
the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles requiring delivery of notice (‘old’ act, Section
82(3))"". Thus, the respondent concludes that there are ""at least
three classes of morally innocent persons who are, by Section 94(2) deprived of
the opportunity to present a defence of the type outlined by Dickson J. in Regina
v. Sault Ste. Marie, (1978) 2 S.C.R. 1299 at 1326"". 

 

The defence will be
available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which,
if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all
reasonable steps to avoid the particular event.

 

93.              In the final analysis, it seems that
both the appellant and the respondent agree that s. 94 will impact upon the
right to liberty of a limited number of morally innocent persons. It creates an
absolute liability offence which effects a deprivation of liberty for a limited
number of persons. To me, that is sufficient for it to be in violation of s. 7 .

 

Section 1 

 

94.              Having found that s. 94(2) offends s.
7  of the Charter  there remains the question as to whether the appellants
have demonstrated that the section is salvaged by the operation of s. 1  of the Charter .
No evidence was adduced in the Court of Appeal or in this Court. The position
in that regard and the argument in support of the operability of s. 94(2) is as
follows in appellant's factum:








If this
Court rules that S. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act is inconsistent with S. 7 
(or S. 11 (d)) of the Charter , then it is submitted that S. 1  of the Charter  is
applicable. It is submitted that Laskin J. (as he then was) made it clear in Curr
v. The Queen, supra, that it is within the scope of judicial notice for
this Court to recognize that a statutory provision was enacted as part of a
legislative scheme aimed at reducing the human and economic cost of bad
driving. S. 94  is but part of the overall scheme laid out in the Motor Vehicle
Act by which the Legislature is attempting to get bad drivers off the road. S.
94 imposes severe penalties on those who drive while prohibited from driving
and those who drive while their driver's licence is suspended.

 

It is
submitted that if S. 94(2) is inconsistent with one of the above‑noted
provisions of the Charter , then S. 94(2) contains a ‘reasonable limit, etc.’ within the
meaning of S. 1  of the Charter .

 

95.              I do not take issue with the fact that
it is highly desirable that ""bad drivers"" be kept off the road. I do
not take issue either with the desirability of punishing severely bad drivers
who are in contempt of prohibitions against driving. The bottom line of the
question to be addressed here is: whether the Government of British Columbia
has demonstrated as justifiable that the risk of imprisonment of a few innocent
is, given the desirability of ridding the roads of British Columbia of bad
drivers, a reasonable limit in a free and democratic society. That result is to
be measured against the offence being one of strict liability open to a defence
of due diligence, the success of which does nothing more than let those few who
did nothing wrong remain free. 

 

96.              As did the Court of Appeal, I find
that this demonstration has not been satisfied, indeed, not in the least.

 

97.              In the result, I would dismiss the
appeal and answer the question in the negative, as did the Court of Appeal,
albeit for somewhat different reasons, and declare s. 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, as amended by the Motor Vehicle Amendment
Act, 1982, inconsistent with s. 7  of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms .








98.              Having come to this conclusion, I
choose, as did the Court of Appeal, not to address whether the section violates
the rights guaranteed under ss. 11 (d) and 12  of the Charter .

 

The following are the
reasons delivered by

 

99.              McIntyre
J.‑‑I agree with Lamer J. that s. 94(2) of the Motor
Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, as amended by the Motor Vehicle
Amendment Act, 1982, (1982) (B.C.), c. 36, s. 19, is inconsistent with s. 7 
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . I agree that
""fundamental justice"", as the term is used in the Charter ,
involves more than natural justice (which is largely procedural) and includes
as well a substantive element. I am also of the view that on any definition of
the term ""fundamental justice"" the imposition of minimum imprisonment
for an offence in respect of which no defence can be made, and which may be
committed unknowingly and with no wrongful intent, deprives or may deprive of
liberty and it offends the principles of fundamental justice.

 

100.            I would accordingly dismiss the appeal
and answer the constitutional question in the negative. 

 

The following are the
reasons delivered by

 

101.            Wilson
J.‑‑I agree with my colleague, Mr. Justice Lamer, that s.
94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act violates s. 7  of the Charter  and
is not saved by s. 1 . I reach that result, however, by a somewhat different
route.

 








102.            I start with a consideration of
statutory ""offences"". These are divisible into offences for which mens
rea is required and those for which it is not. Statutory offences are
subject to a presumption in favour of a mens rea requirement as a
matter of interpretation, but the courts have increasingly come to accept the
proposition that legislatures may create non mens rea offences
provided they make it clear that the actus reus itself is
prohibited. This is typically so in the case of the so‑called
""regulatory"" or ""public welfare"" offences. There is no
moral delinquency involved in these offences. They are simply designed to
regulate conduct in the public interest.

 

103.            Two questions, therefore, have to be
answered on this appeal. The first is do absolute liability offences created by
statute per se offend the Charter ? The second is, assuming
they do not, can they be attended by mandatory imprisonment or can such a
sanction only be attached to true mens rea offences? Certainly,
in the absence of the Charter , legislatures are free to create absolute
liability offences and to attach to them any sanctions they please. Does s. 7
of the Charter  circumscribe their power in this regard? 

 

1.               Absolute Liability
Offences

 

104.            Section 7 affirms the right to life,
liberty and security of the person while at the same time indicating that a
person may be deprived of such a right if the deprivation is effected ""in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"". I do not view the
latter part of the section as a qualification on the right to life, liberty and
security of the person in the sense that it limits or modifies that right or
defines its parameters. Its purpose seems to me to be the very opposite, namely
to protect the right against deprivation or impairment unless such deprivation
or impairment is effected in accordance with the principles of fundamental
justice.

 








105.            Section 7 does not, however, affirm a
right to the principles of fundamental justice per se. There must
first be found an impairment of the right to life, liberty or security of the
person. It must then be determined whether that impairment has been effected in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. If it has, it passes the
threshold test in s. 7 itself but the Court must go on to consider whether it
can be sustained under s. 1  as a limit prescribed by law on the s. 7 right
which is both reasonable and justified in a free and democratic society. If,
however, the limit on the s. 7 right has been effected through a violation of the
principles of fundamental justice, the enquiry, in my view, ends there and the
limit cannot be sustained under s. 1 . I say this because I do not believe that
a limit on the s. 7 right which has been imposed in violation of the principles
of fundamental justice can be either ""reasonable"" or
""demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"". The
requirement in s. 7 that the principles of fundamental justice be observed
seems to me to restrict the legislature's power to impose limits on the s. 7
right under s. 1 . It can only limit the s. 7 right if it does so in accordance
with the principles of fundamental justice and, even if it meets that test, it
still has to meet the tests in s. 1 . 

 








106.            Assuming that I am correct in my
analysis of s. 7  and its relationship to s. 1 , an absolute liability offence
cannot violate s. 7  unless it impairs the right to life, liberty or security of
the person. It cannot violate s. 7  because it offends the principles of fundamental
justice because they are not protected by s. 7  absent an impairment of the s. 7 
right. Leaving aside for the moment the mandatory imprisonment sanction, I
cannot find an interference with life, liberty or security of the person in s.
94 of the Motor Vehicle Act. It is true that the section prevents
citizens from driving their vehicles when their licences are suspended.
Citizens are also prevented from driving on the wrong side of the road. Indeed,
all regulatory offences impose some restriction on liberty broadly construed.
But I think it would trivialize the Charter  to sweep all those offences
into s. 7  as violations of the right to life, liberty and security of the
person even if they can be sustained under s. 1 . It would be my view,
therefore, that absolute liability offences of this type do not per se
offend s. 7  of the Charter .

 

2.               Absolute Liability Plus
Mandatory Imprisonment

 

107.            The real question, as I see it, is
whether s. 7  of the Charter  is violated by the attachment of a mandatory
imprisonment sanction to an absolute liability offence. Clearly a s. 7  right is
interfered with here in that a person convicted of such an offence
automatically loses his liberty.

 

108.            In what circumstances then may the
citizen be deprived of his right to liberty? Clearly not if he was deprived of
it through a process which was procedurally unfair. But is s. 7  limited to
that?

 

109.            I would assume that one of the reasons
for the rider attached to the right to liberty affirmed in s. 7  is to
accommodate the criminal justice system. It will be through the criminal
justice system that citizens will typically lose their liberty at the hands of
government. The system must not, therefore, cause them to lose their liberty in
violation of the principles of fundamental justice. The system must reflect
those principles and the validity of the penal provisions must be assessed in
relation to them. 

 

110.            Since s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle
Act imposes a limit prescribed by law on the s. 7  right, we must determine
whether fundamental justice is offended by attaching mandatory imprisonment to
an absolute liability offence. Given that we can have statutory non mens
rea offences, what is repugnant to fundamental justice in imprisoning
someone for their commission?








111.            At common law imprisonment was reserved
for the more serious mens rea offences. However, we are dealing
here with statutory offences and the legislation must stand unless it violates
s. 7 . We cannot, in my view, simply state as a bald proposition that absolute
liability and imprisonment cannot co‑exist in a statutory context.
Legislatures can supersede the common law. The legislature may consider it so
important to prevent a particular act from being committed that it absolutely
forbids it and, if it is committed, may subject the offender to a penalty
whether he has any mens rea or not and whether or not he had any
intention of breaking the law. Prior to the Charter  such legislation
would have been unassailable. Now it must meet the test of s. 7 . Where the
legislature has imposed a penalty in the form of mandatory imprisonment for the
commission of an absolute liability offence and has done so in clear and
unambiguous language, can the legislation survive an attack under s. 7 ? It is
suggested that such legislation cannot survive because it offends the
principles of fundamental justice and, in particular, the principle that
punishment is inappropriate in the absence of moral culpability.

 








112.            The common law distinguished sharply the
conduct of the wrongdoer from his state of mind at the time. Hence the famous
maxim referred to by my colleague‑‑actus non facit
reum nisi mens sit rea. The important thing to
note, however, is that while the maxim has always been viewed as identifying
the essential ingredients of a crime at common law, its meaning has been
subject to a process of historical and juridical development, particularly the
concept of mens rea. In the earliest beginnings of criminal liability
the mental state of the wrongdoer was not considered at all; it was enough that
he had done the fell deed: see Holdsworth, A History of English Law
(1923), vol. 2, pp. 50 et seq. At a later stage the accused's
state of mind was considered for two distinct purposes, namely (1) to determine
whether his conduct was voluntary or involuntary; and (2) to determine whether
he realized what the consequences of his conduct might be. But the first
purpose was viewed as the key one. It was considerably later in the development
of the law of criminal responsibility that the emphasis changed and an appreciation
of the consequences of his act became the central focus. The movement towards
the concept of the ""guilty mind"" was not, however, a sudden or
dramatic one. This is understandable. The judges of the day found the new rule
hard to apply because it was difficult to look into the state of a man's mind.
The ecclesiastical authorities, however, had no such problem and legal
historians seem to agree that the ecclesiastical influence was largely
responsible for moving the focus to the mental element in common law crime: see
Holdsworth, supra, p. 259. 

 

113.            The introduction of concepts of morality
into criminal responsibility inevitably led to a sharp distinction between
crimes which were mala in se and crimes which were merely mala
prohibita. Blackstone describes crimes which were mala in se
as offences against ""those rights which God and nature have
established"" (Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (17th
ed. by E. Christian, 1830)), p. 53 and crimes which were mala prohibita
as breaches of ""those laws which enjoin only positive duties, and forbid
any such things as are not mala in se... without any
intermixture of moral guilt"" (Blackstone, ibid., p. 57). This
distinction is now pretty well discredited: see Archbold's Pleading,
Evidence & Practice in Criminal Cases, 30th ed. (1938), p. 900; Allen, Legal
Duties and Other Essays in Jurisprudence (1931), p. 239. While it is
undoubtedly a fact that certain crimes evoke feelings of revulsion and
condemnation in the minds of most people, those feelings are now generally
perceived as dependent upon a number of variable factors such as environment,
education and religious prejudice and are no longer seen as providing a secure
basis for the segregation of crimes into two different categories. Quoting from
Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law, 16th ed. by J. W. C. Turner, 1952, at
pp. 22‑23:

 








Among the members of any
community at a given period, certain offences are by general agreement regarded
as especially serious and excite deep moral reprobation, whereas other
transgressions are regarded as venial and are more or less condoned, especially
when they infringe rules of law which are unpopular. It is indeed inevitable
that this apportionment of blame should be made. Yet the vague and fluctuating
line which in everyday life is drawn between the one group and the other only
marks a variation in degree; it is not a boundary which separates things
fundamentally alien in kind. Ethical reprobation of homicide, homosexuality,
libel, adultery, bigamy and slave trading, to take a few examples, is not the
same in all countries, and indeed may vary from section to section of the
people in the same country.

 

                                                                    ...

 

This
defective classification of crimes clearly formed an unsound premise from which
to draw any jurisprudential conclusion but it has an insidious attraction, and
in the form of English phrases such as ""in itself unlawful"" it has
penetrated into one or two modern judgments with vitiating effects upon the
logic and clarity of the argument. 

 

114.            Accepting that a guilty mind was an
essential ingredient of a crime at common law, it does not, of course, follow
that the same is true of a ""crime"" created by statute. I have already
referred to the presumption against absolute liability as a matter of statutory
interpretation. This undoubtedly reflects the common law approach to the nature
of crime. It is, however, only a presumption. Provided it does so in clear and
unambiguous terms the legislature is free to make a person liable for the actus
reus with or without mens rea.

 

115.            In Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law,
supra, p. 4, the author highlights the difficulty in identifying any
essential characteristics of crimes created by statute. He points out that such
crimes originate in the government policy of the day and that, so long as
crimes continue to be created by government policy, the nature of statutory
crime will elude definition. Lord Atkin adverted to the same difficulty in Proprietary
Articles Trade Association v. Attorney General for Canada, [1931] A.C. 310.
He stated at p. 324:

 








... the domain of criminal
jurisprudence can only be ascertained by examining what acts at any particular
period are declared by the State to be crimes, and the only common nature they
will be found to possess is that they are prohibited by the State and that
those who commit them are punished.

 

116.            In R. v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.,
[1971] S.C.R. 5, Ritchie J., speaking for the majority of this Court, said at
p. 13:

 

Generally
speaking, there is a presumption at common law that mens rea is
an essential ingredient of all cases that are criminal in the true sense, but a
consideration of a considerable body of case law on the subject satisfies me
that there is a wide category of offences created by statutes enacted for the
regulation of individual conduct in the interests of health, convenience,
safety and the general welfare of the public which are not subject to any such
presumption.

 

117.            There seems to be no doubt that in s. 94
of the Motor Vehicle Act the legislature of British Columbia has created
such an offence. Subsection (2) expressly precludes the application of any
presumption in favour of a mens rea requirement. However, as already
indicated, I do not believe that any principle of fundamental justice is
offended by the creation of an absolute liability offence absent an impairment
of the s. 7  right.

 

118.            Is fundamental justice offended then by
the attachment of a mandatory term of imprisonment to the s. 94 offence? Is
there something repugnant about imprisoning a person for the commission of an
absolute liability offence? Presumably no objection can be taken to attaching
penal consequences such as a fine to a validly enacted absolute liability
offence, only to penal consequences in the form of imprisonment if this gives
rise to a violation of s. 7  of the Charter . If it does, then the Court
is not only empowered, but obligated by the Constitution, to strike the section
down. 

 








119.            I have already indicated that in my view
a law which interferes with the liberty of the citizen in violation of the
principles of fundamental justice cannot be saved by s. 1  as being either
reasonable or justified. The concepts are mutually exclusive. This is not, of
course, to say that no limits can be put upon the right to life, liberty and
security of the person. They clearly can, but only if they are imposed in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice and survive the tests in
s. 1  as being reasonable and justified in a free and democratic society. Nor is
the government precluded from resort to s. 33  of the Charter  in order to
dispense with the requirements of fundamental justice when, in a case of
emergency, it seeks to impose restrictions on the s. 7  right. This, however,
will be a policy decision for which the government concerned will be
politically accountable to the people. As it is, s. 94 cannot, in my view, be
saved by s. 1  if it violates s. 7 . The sole question is whether it violates s.
7 .

 

120.            My colleague, in finding that s. 94
offends the principles of fundamental justice, has relied heavily upon the
common law which precluded punishment in the absence of a guilty mind. We are
not, however, dealing with a common law crime here. We are dealing with a
statutory offence as to which the legislature has stated in no uncertain terms
that guilt is established by proof of the act itself.

 

121.            Unlike my colleague, I do not think that
ss. 8  to 14  of the Charter  shed much light on the interpretation of the
phrase ""in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"" as
used in s. 7 . I find them very helpful as illustrating facets of the right to
life, liberty and security of the person. I am not ready at this point,
however, to equate unreasonableness or arbitrariness or tardiness as used in
some of these sections with a violation of the principles of fundamental
justice as used in s. 7 . Delay, for example, may be explained away or excused
or justified on a number of grounds under s. 1 . I prefer, therefore, to treat
these sections as self‑standing provisions, as indeed they are. 

 








122.            I approach the interpretive problem
raised by the phrase ""the principles of fundamental justice"" on the
assumption that the legislature was very familiar with the concepts of
""natural justice"" and ""due process"" and the way in which
those phrases had been judicially construed and applied. Yet they chose
neither. Instead they chose the phrase ""the principles of fundamental
justice"". What is ""fundamental justice""? We know what
""fundamental principles"" are. They are the basic, bedrock principles
that underpin a system. What would ""fundamental principles of
justice"" mean? And would it mean something different from ""principles
of fundamental justice""? I am not entirely sure. We have been left by the
legislature with a conundrum. I would conclude, however, that if the citizen is
to be guaranteed his right to life, liberty and security of the person‑‑surely
one of the most basic rights in a free and democratic society‑‑then
he certainly should not be deprived of it by means of a violation of a
fundamental tenet of our justice system.

 

123.            It has been argued very forcefully that
s. 7  is concerned only with procedural injustice but I have difficulty with
that proposition. There is absolutely nothing in the section to support such a
limited construction. Indeed, it is hard to see why one's life and liberty
should be protected against procedural injustice and not against substantive
injustice in a Charter  that opens with the declaration:

 

Whereas
Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the
rule of law:

 

and sets out the guarantee in broad and
general terms as follows:

 

1. The Canadian Charter of Rights and
Freedoms  guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to
such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a
free and democratic society.

 








I cannot think that the guaranteed right
in s. 7  which is to be subject only to limits which are reasonable and
justifiable in a free and democratic society can be taken away by the violation
of a principle considered fundamental to our justice system. Certainly the rule
of law acknowledged in the preamble as one of the foundations on which our
society is built is more than mere procedure. It will be for the courts to
determine the principles which fall under the rubric ""the principles of
fundamental justice"". Obviously not all principles of law are covered by
the phrase; only those which are basic to our system of justice. 

 

124.            I have grave doubts that the dichotomy
between substance and procedure which may have served a useful purpose in other
areas of the law such as administrative law and private international law should
be imported into s. 7  of the Charter . In many instances the line between
substance and procedure is a very narrow one. For example, the presumption of
innocence protected in s. 11(d) of the Charter may be viewed as a
substantive principle of fundamental justice but it clearly has both a
substantive and a procedural aspect. Indeed, any rebuttable presumption of fact
may be viewed as procedural, as going primarily to the allocation of the burden
of proof. Nevertheless, there is also an interest of substance to be protected
by the presumption, namely the right of an accused to be treated as innocent
until proved otherwise by the Crown. This right has both a societal and an
individual aspect and is clearly fundamental to our justice system. I see no
particular virtue in isolating its procedural from its substantive elements or
vice versa for purposes of s. 7 . A similar analysis may be made of the rule
against double jeopardy protected in s. 11(h).

 

125.            How then are we to decide whether
attaching a mandatory term of imprisonment to an absolute liability offence
created by statute offends a principle of fundamental justice? I believe we
must turn to the theory of punishment for the answer.

 








3.               Punishment and Fundamental
Justice

 

126.            It is now generally accepted among
penologists that there are five main objectives of a penal system: see Nigel
Walker, Sentencing in a Rational Society, 1969. They are:

 

(1) to protect offenders
and suspected offenders against unofficial retaliation;

 

(2) to reduce the incidence
of crime;

 

(3) to ensure that
offenders atone for their offences;

 

(4) to keep punishment to
the minimum necessary to achieve the objectives of the system; and

 

(5) to express society's
abhorrence of crime.

 

Apart from death, imprisonment is the
most severe sentence imposed by the law and is generally viewed as a last
resort i.e., as appropriate only when it can be shown that no other sanction
can achieve the objectives of the system.

 

127.            The Law Reform Commission of Canada in
its Working Paper 11, ""Imprisonment and Release"", in Studies on
Imprisonment (1976), states at p. 10:

 

Justice requires that the
sanction of imprisonment not be disproportionate to the offence, and humanity
dictates that it must not be heavier than necessary to achieve its objective. 

 








128.            Because of the absolute liability nature
of the offence created by s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act a person can
be convicted under the section even although he was unaware at the time he was
driving that his licence was suspended and was unable to find this out despite
the exercise of due diligence. While the legislature may as a matter of
government policy make this an offence, and we cannot question its wisdom in
this regard, the question is whether it can make it mandatory for the courts to
deprive a person convicted of it of his liberty without violating s. 7 . This,
in turn, depends on whether attaching a mandatory term of imprisonment to an
absolute liability offence such as this violates the principles of fundamental
justice. I believe that it does. I think the conscience of the court would be
shocked and the administration of justice brought into disrepute by such an
unreasonable and extravagant penalty. It is totally disproportionate to the
offence and quite incompatible with the objective of a penal system referred to
in paragraph (4) above.

 

129.            It is basic to any theory of punishment
that the sentence imposed bear some relationship to the offence; it must be a
""fit"" sentence proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Only
if this is so can the public be satisfied that the offender
""deserved"" the punishment he received and feel a confidence in the
fairness and rationality of the system. This is not to say that there is an
inherently appropriate relationship between a particular offence and its
punishment but rather that there is a scale of offences and punishments into
which the particular offence and punishment must fit. Obviously this cannot be
done with mathematical precision and many different factors will go into the
assessment of the seriousness of a particular offence for purposes of
determining the appropriate punishment but it does provide a workable
conventional framework for sentencing. Indeed, judges in the exercise of their
sentencing discretion have been employing such a scale for over a hundred
years.

 








130.            I believe that a mandatory term of
imprisonment for an offence committed unknowingly and unwittingly and after the
exercise of due diligence is grossly excessive and inhumane. It is not required
to reduce the incidence of the offence. It is beyond anything required to
satisfy the need for ""atonement"". And society, in my opinion, would
not be abhorred by an unintentional and unknowing violation of the section. I
believe, therefore, that such a sanction offends the principles of fundamental
justice embodied in our penal system. Section 94(2) is accordingly inconsistent
with s. 7  of the Charter  and must, to the extent of the inconsistency,
be declared of no force and effect under s. 52 . I express no view as to whether
a mandatory term of imprisonment for such an offence represents an arbitrary
imprisonment within the meaning of s. 9  of the Charter  or ""cruel
and unusual treatment or punishment"" within the meaning of s. 12  because
it is not necessary to decide those issues in order to answer the
constitutional question posed.

 

131.            I would dismiss the appeal and answer
the constitutional question in the negative.

                   Appellants were prisoners who were allegedly
involved in a hostage‑taking incident in Matsqui Institution. Criminal
charges of forcible seizure and attempted escape were laid against them. They
were transferred to Kent Institution where they were placed, on the Director's
oral instructions, in administrative dissociation or segregation, pursuant to
s. 40 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations, on the ground that it was
necessary for the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution.
The Director did not make an independent inquiry into the alleged involvement
of the appellants in the hostage‑taking incident but relied on what he
had heard from the warden of Matsqui Institution and personnel at regional
headquarters. The Segregation Review Board, which reviewed the appellants' segregation
monthly in accordance with s. 40 of the Regulations, recommended that they be
released from administrative segregation into the general prison population.
The Director refused to follow the Board's recommendation on the ground that
the appellants' release from segregation before the disposition of the criminal
charges pending against them would ""probably"" or ""possibly""
introduce an unsettling element into the prison population. The Director did
not inform the appellants of his reasons for refusing to follow the Board's
recommendation and did not give them an opportunity to be heard as to whether
he should act in accordance with the recommendation.

 

                   Appellants challenged their continued confinement in
administrative dissociation or segregation by applications for habeas corpus
with certiorari in aid. McEachern C.J.S.C. in the Supreme Court of
British Columbia held that the Court had jurisdiction to issue certiorari
in aid of habeas corpus, despite the exclusive jurisdiction by way of certiorari
of the Federal Court of Canada under s. 18  of the Federal Court Act , and
that habeas corpus would lie to determine the validity of confinement in
administrative segregation. On the merits of the applications, he held that the
continued segregation of the appellants, despite the recommendation of the
Segregation Review Board, had become unlawful because of a breach of the duty
of procedural fairness, and he ordered the release of the appellants into the
general population of the penitentiary. The British Columbia Court of Appeal
held that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to issue certiorari in aid
of habeas corpus, that the Court could on habeas corpus alone
consider affidavit evidence to determine whether there had been an absence or
excess of jurisdiction, and that habeas corpus would lie to determine
the validity of confinement in administrative segregation, but a majority of
the Court of Appeal held that the continued segregation of the appellants had
not been rendered unlawful by a breach of the duty of procedural fairness. The
appeal was accordingly allowed. 

 

                   Held: The appeal should
be allowed.

 

                   For the reasons given in R. v. Miller, [1985]
2 S.C.R. 613, the Court of Appeal correctly concluded (a) that the British
Columbia Supreme Court had jurisdiction to issue certiorari in aid of habeas
corpus; (b) that the Court could on an application for habeas corpus
alone consider affidavit evidence to determine whether there had been an
absence or excess of jurisdiction; and (c) that habeas corpus would lie
to determine the validity of the confinement of an inmate in administrative
dissociation or segregation, and if such confinement be found to be unlawful to
order his release into the general population of the institution.

 

                   The Director was under a duty of procedural fairness
in exercising the authority conferred by s. 40 of the Regulations with respect
to administrative dissociation or segregation. At common law, a duty of
procedural fairness lies on every public authority making an administrative
decision which is not of a legislative nature and which affects the rights,
privileges or interests of an individual. The duty of procedural fairness has
been held to apply in principle to disciplinary proceedings within a
penitentiary, and although administrative segregation is distinguished from
punitive or disciplinary segregation in the Regulations, the effect on the
prisoner is the same and gives rise to the duty to act fairly. The extent to
which procedural requirements are imposed in the prison setting must, however,
be approached with caution.

 

                   The original imposition of administrative
dissociation or segregation on the appellants was a lawful exercise of the
Director's discretionary authority and was not carried out unfairly. In view of
the urgent or emergency nature of the decision there could be no requirement of
prior notice and hearing. In the case of the Director's decision to continue
the appellants' segregation, despite the recommendation of the Segregation
Review Board that they be released into the general population of the
penitentiary, procedural fairness required that the Director inform the
appellants of the reasons for his intended decision and give them an
opportunity before him, however informal, to state their case for release.
These minimal requirements of procedural fairness were fully compatible with
the concern that the process of prison administration, because of its special
nature and exigencies, should not be unduly burdened or obstructed by the
imposition of unreasonable or inappropriate procedural requirements. 

 

                   As to the possible suggestion in the decision of the
majority of the Court of Appeal that the breach of the duty of procedural
fairness, if any, was not of sufficient consequence to render the continued
segregation of the appellants unlawful, the denial of a right to a fair hearing
must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a
reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different
decision. The right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent,
unqualified right which finds its essential justification in the sense of
procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative decision is
entitled to have. It is not for a court to deny that right and sense of justice
on the basis of speculation as to what the result might have been had there
been a hearing.

 

                   By his failure to afford the appellants a fair
hearing on the question whether he should act in accordance with the
recommendation of the Segregation Review Board the Director rendered the
continued segregation of the appellants unlawful. They, therefore, had a right
on habeas corpus to be released from administrative dissociation or
segregation into the general population of the penitentiary.

                   The judgment of the Court was delivered by 

 

1.                Le
Dain J.‑‑The general question in this appeal is whether
relief by way of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid is
available in a provincial superior court to obtain the release of a prisoner in
a federal penitentiary from administrative dissociation or segregation into
normal association with the general population of the penitentiary on the ground
that the segregation was imposed or continued in breach of the requirements of
procedural fairness.

 

2.                The appeal is by leave of this Court
from the judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal on March 31, 1982,
[1982] 3 W.W.R. 593, 67 C.C.C. (2d) 252, allowing an appeal from the judgment
of McEachern C.J. of the Supreme Court of British Columbia on December 30, 1980
granting relief upon applications for habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid and ordering that the appellants be released from administrative
dissociation or segregation in Kent Institution into the general population of
the penitentiary, subject to all the jurisdiction of the Director as set forth
in the Penitentiary Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P‑6, and regulations
thereunder.

 

3.                The appellants were imprisoned in
Matsqui Institution when, on July 27, 1980, they became involved in a hostage‑taking
incident in which they allegedly held a guard at knifepoint and unlawfully
confined him for five hours. Criminal charges of forcible seizure and attempted
escape were laid against the appellants, and on July 28, 1980 they were
transferred to Kent Institution, a maximum security penitentiary, where they
were placed in administrative dissociation or segregation on the oral
instructions of the warden (hereinafter referred to as the
""Director"") of the institution, pursuant to s. 40(1)(a) of the
Penitentiary Service Regulations, C.R.C. 1978, c. 1251. Section 40 reads
as follows: 

 

                   40. (1)
Where the institutional head is satisfied that

 

(a) for the
maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution, or

 

(b) in the best
interests of an inmate

 

it is necessary or
desirable that the inmate should be kept from associating with other inmates,
he may order the inmate to be dissociated accordingly, but the case of every
inmate so dissociated shall be considered, not less than once each month, by
the Classification Board for the purpose of recommending to the institutional
head whether or not the inmate should return to association with other inmates.

 

                   (2) An
inmate who has been dissociated is not considered under punishment unless he
has been sentenced as such and he shall not be deprived of any of his
privileges and amenities by reason thereof, except those privileges and
amenities that

 

(a) can only be
enjoyed in association with other inmates, or

 

(b) cannot
reasonably be granted having regard to the limitations of the dissociation area
and the necessity for the effective operation thereof.

 

4.                Administrative dissociation or
segregation, as it was called by the Director of Kent Institution in his
evidence, and as it will for convenience be referred to hereinafter, is a form
of confinement involving severe restrictions on mobility, activity and
association. It is described in the reasons for judgment of McEachern C.J.S.C.
as follows:

 

                   The
liberty and freedom of a prisoner placed in segregation is further reduced, and
solitary confinement (a term the Director does not accept) is a phrase used by
prisoners to describe segregation.

 

                   The
cells used to house prisoners in segregation are 6 feet wide, 10 feet long and
8 feet high. Access is gained through a solid door containing a small window.
There is a window on the outside wall. The cell contains a radio, a bed, and a
combination basin/toilet.

 

                   The
regular routine for these prisoners in the absence of outside visitors or
consultation with lawyers, et cetera, is to be locked in their cells for 23
hours per day, with one hour for exercise. Visitors are permitted to visit
every day Monday through Friday. Lawyers are permitted to visit as a general
rule on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Prisoners in segregation have access to a
canteen, but there are limits on what they can purchase. They are paid an
allowance (the amount was not specified) at the same grade they were paid
before being segregated. I mention these matters, because the Director makes a
point that administrative dissociation is not the same thing as what is often
called solitary confinement. 

 

5.                The segregation of the appellants was
reviewed once a month, in accordance with s. 40 of the Regulations, by a
classification board called the Segregation Review Board, which was composed of
members of the penitentiary staff. The appellants appeared before the Board. On
October 7, 1980 the Board recommended to the Director that the appellants be
returned to normal association with the general prison population. The Director
declined to follow this recommendation. In its subsequent reviews of the
appellants' case the Board maintained its favourable recommendation, but the
Director continued to hold them in segregation. At the time their applications
for habeas corpus with certiorari in aid were heard in November
1980, they had been in segregation for some four months, and the indication was
that the Director would likely continue the segregation until disposition of
the criminal charges against them.

 

6.                In his affidavits filed in response to
the appellants' applications for habeas corpus with certiorari in
aid and in his testimony on cross‑examination the Director indicated that
he had ordered the segregation of the appellants because of what he had heard
from the warden of Matsqui Institution and personnel at regional headquarters
concerning the hostage‑taking incident, and that apart from these
conversations he had not made, and he did not intend to make, an independent
inquiry into the appellants' alleged involvement in the incident. He had
decided not to follow the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board
because, while he accepted its favourable opinion of the appellants' conduct in
Kent Institution, he believed that their release from segregation before the
disposition of the criminal charges against them would result in the
""probable"" or ""possible"" introduction of an unsettling
element into the general population of the institution and was therefore not in
the interests of the maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution.
He could not point to a specific reason for holding this belief but based it on
his personal assessment of the ""dynamics"" of the institution, a
judgment which he referred to at one point as an ""instinctive
reaction"" and con­ceded at another point could be described as a ""gut
reaction"". He indicated that the primary consideration underlying his
decision was the seriousness of the hostage‑taking incident in which the
appellants were alleged to have been involved, and he could not point to any
factor that would be likely to change his decision before the question of their
involvement had been clarified by disposition of the criminal charges. It was
not for him to determine that question when it was before the courts. 

 

7.                Although the Director talked to the
appellants he did not inform them of his reasons for refusing to follow the
recommendation of the Segregation Review Board that they be released from
segregation into the general population of the institution or afford them the
opportunity of a hearing before him as to whether they should be released.

 

                                                                    II

 

8.                In their applications for habeas
corpus with certiorari in aid and their supporting affidavits the
appellants attacked the original imposition and continuation of their
administrative segregation, despite the recommendation of the Segregation
Review Board, on the ground that it was not necessary for the maintenance of
good order and discipline in the institution. At the hearing of their
applications, however, the jurisdictional issue that emerged was whether they
had been denied procedural fairness in the imposition and continuation of their
segregation. There also emerged two issues concerning the jurisdiction of the
Court to entertain an application for habeas corpus with certiorari
in aid to obtain the release of an inmate of a federal penitentiary from
administrative segregation into normal association with the general population
of the institution: (a) whether, in view of the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Federal Court of Canada under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C.
1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10, to issue certiorari against any federal board,
commission or other tribunal, the Supreme Court of British Columbia had
jurisdiction to issue certiorari in aid of habeas corpus; and (b)
whether habeas corpus will lie to challenge the validity of the
confinement of an inmate in administrative segregation and, if such confinement
be found to be unlawful, to order his release into the general population of
the institution.

 

9.                In the Supreme Court of British
Columbia, McEachern C.J. held that the Court had jurisdiction to issue certiorari
in aid of habeas corpus against a federal board, commission or other
tribunal and that habeas corpus would lie to release an inmate from
administrative segregation into the general population of a penitentiary. On
the merits, he held that while the original imposition of segregation was not
carried out with unfairness, its continuation despite the recommendation of the
Segregation Review Board that the appellants be released into the general
population of the institution was unlawful by reason of a denial of procedural
fairness. 

 

10.              The British Columbia Court of Appeal
(Nemetz C.J. and Macdonald and Anderson JJ.A.) were unanimously of the view,
for reasons given by Anderson J.A., that the Supreme Court of British Columbia
had jurisdiction to issue certiorari in aid of habeas corpus;
that in any event a court could, on an application for habeas corpus
alone, consider affidavit evidence in determining whether there had been an
absence or excess of jurisdiction in ordering a detention; and that habeas
corpus would lie to challenge the validity of confinement in administrative
segregation and to order the release of an inmate from such segregation, if
found unlawful, into the general population of the penitentiary. They were
further agreed that in exercising the authority conferred by s. 40 of the
regulations with respect to administrative segregation the Director had a duty
of procedural fairness, but a majority of the Court (Nemetz C.J.B.C. and
Macdonald J.A.), Anderson J.A. dissenting, held that there had not been a
breach of that duty. Nemetz C.J.B.C. held that if there had been a breach of
the duty of procedural fairness it was not of sufficient substance to amount to
an excess of jurisdiction. On this ground the appeal was allowed and the
judgment of McEachern C.J.S.C. ordering the release of the appellants into the
general population of the penitentiary set aside.

 

11.              The appellants appeal from the judgment of
the Court of Appeal on the question whether there was a breach of the duty of
procedural fairness in the continuation of their segregation despite the
recommendation of the Segregation Review Board. While supporting the conclusion
of the majority of the Court of Appeal on this issue, the respondent contends
that the Supreme Court of British Columbia did not have jurisdiction to issue certiorari
in aid of habeas corpus and that habeas corpus will not lie to obtain
the release of an inmate of a penitentiary from administrative segregation into
the general population of the institution.

 

12.              It should be noted that at the time the
appeal was heard by the British Columbia Court of Appeal the appellants had
been released from Kent Institution. The court was of the view, however, that
the appeal should be heard because of the general importance of the issues
raised. This Court has proceeded on the same basis. 

 

                                                                   III

 

13.              For the reasons given in R. v. Miller,
[1985] 2 S.C.R. 613, which was heard at the same time as this appeal, I agree
with the conclusions of the British Columbia Court of Appeal expressed in the
reasons of Anderson J.A., with whom Nemetz C.J. and Macdonald J.A. concurred,
on the three issues concerning the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Supreme
Court: (a) that the Court had jurisdiction to issue certiorari in aid of
habeas corpus; (b) that the Court could on an application for habeas
corpus alone consider affidavit evidence to determine whether there had
been an absence or excess of jurisdiction; and (c) that habeas corpus
will lie to determine the validity of the confinement of an inmate in
administrative segregation, and if such confinement be found to be unlawful, to
order his release into the general inmate population of the institution. There
is no significant difference, in so far as the last question is concerned,
between confinement in administrative dissociation or segregation, pursuant to s.
40(1) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations, and confinement in a
special handling unit, as in Miller, supra. Both are
significantly more restrictive and severe forms of detention than that
experienced by the general inmate population. Indeed, as indi­cated in the
reasons for judgment in Miller, supra, Commissioner's Directive
274 of December 1, 1980 provides that phase 1 of confinement in a special
handling unit shall consist of a period of assessment in administrative
segregation.

 

                                                                   IV

 

14.              There can be no doubt, as was held by
McEachern C.J.S.C. and the Court of Appeal, that the Director was under a duty
of procedural fairness in exercising the authority conferred by s. 40 of the
Regulations with respect to administrative dissociation or segregation. This
Court has affirmed that there is, as a general common law principle, a duty of
procedural fairness lying on every public authority making an administrative
decision which is not of a legislative nature and which affects the rights,
privileges or interests of an individual: Nicholson v. Haldimand‑Norfolk
Regional Board of Commissioners of Police, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 311; Martineau
v. Matsqui Institution Disciplinary Board (No. 2), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602; Attorney
General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735. In Martineau
(No. 2), supra, the Court held that the duty of procedural fairness
applied in principle to disciplinary proceedings within a penitentiary.
Although administrative segregation is distinguished from punitive or
disciplinary segregation under s. 40 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations,
its effect on the inmate in either case is the same and is such as to give rise
to a duty to act fairly. 

 

15.              The question, of course, is what the duty
of procedural fairness may reasonably require of an authority in the way of
specific procedural rights in a particular legislative and administrative
context and what should be considered to be a breach of fairness in particular
circumstances. The caution with which this question must be approached in the
context of prison administration was emphasized by this Court in Martineau
(No. 2), supra. Pigeon J., with whom Martland, Ritchie, Beetz, Estey
and Pratte JJ. concurred, said at p. 637:

 

                   I must,
however, stress that the Order issued by Mahoney J. deals only with the
jurisdiction of the Trial Division, not with the actual availability of the
relief in the circumstances of the case. This is subject to the exercise of
judicial discretion and in this respect it will be essential that the
requirements of prison discipline be borne in mind, just as it is essential
that the requirements of the effective administration of criminal justice be
borne in mind when dealing with applications for certiorari before
trial, as pointed out in Attorney General of Quebec v. Cohen ([1979] 2
S.C.R. 305). It is specially important that the remedy be granted only in cases
of serious injustice and that proper care be taken to prevent such proceedings
from being used to delay deserved punishment so long that it is made
ineffective, if not altogether avoided.

 

Dickson J. (as he then was), with whom Laskin C.J. and McIntyre J.
concurred, expressed a similar caution at p. 630 as follows:

 

                   It
should be emphasized that it is not every breach of prison rules of procedure
which will bring intervention by the courts. The very nature of a prison
institution requires officers to make ""on the spot"" disciplinary
decisions and the power of judicial review must be exercised with restraint.
Interference will not be justified in the case of trivial or merely technical
incidents. The question is not whether there has been a breach of the prison
rules, but whether there has been a breach of the duty to act fairly in all the
circumstances. The rules are of some importance in determining this latter
question, as an indication of the views of prison authorities as to the degree
of procedural protection to be extended to inmates.

 

The same caution was emphasized by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Hull
Prison Board of Visitors, ex parte St Germain, [1979] 1 All E.R. 701, which
was referred to by Pigeon and Dickson JJ. in Martineau (No. 2), supra,
and in which Megaw L.J. said at p. 713 concerning the judicial review of prison
disciplinary decisions: 

 

It is certainly not any
breach of any procedural rule which would justify or require interference by
the courts. Such interference, in my judgment, would only be required, and
would only be justified, if there were some failure to act fairly, having regard
to all relevant circumstances, and such unfairness could reasonably be regarded
as having caused a substantial, as distinct from a trivial or merely technical,
injustice which was capable of remedy.

 

                                                                    V

 

16.              Although McEachern C.J.S.C. severely
criticized the imposition of administrative segregation by oral instructions
that are not followed as soon as possible by written notice with reasons for
the decision, he held, as I have indicated, that the original imposition of
administrative segregation in this case was a lawful exercise of the Director's
discretionary authority under s. 40(1) of Penitentiary Service Regulations,
and that it was not carried out unfairly. That conclusion was not seriously
challenged on the appeal, and, indeed, it would not appear to be open to
challenge. Because of the apparently urgent or emergency nature of the decision
to impose segregation in the particular circumstances of the case, there could
be no requirement of prior notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
decision.

 

17.              The procedural unfairness found by
McEachern C.J.S.C. was in continuing the administrative segregation of the
appellants, despite the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board that
they be released into the general population of the penitentiary, without
giving them notice of the reasons for refusing to follow that recommendation
and an opportunity to be heard, including a chance to present their side of the
hostage‑taking incident. McEachern C.J.S.C. also held that there was an
appearance of unfairness in the apparently closed mind of the Director on the
question of whether the segregation should be continued despite the favourable
recommendation of the Board, and even a suggestion that the segregation was
being continued in an attempt to force the appellants to plead guilty to the
criminal charges pending against them. He said that the Director was required
to make an independent inquiry into the circumstances of the hostage‑taking
incident, to examine the appellants' files and to ascertain whether the
continuation of the segregation was impairing their ability to instruct
counsel, as they claimed. The heart of his conclusion on the issue of
procedural fairness is contained in the following statement: 

 

The Director had
jurisdiction to disregard the recommendation of the Review Board, but to do so
with fairness, it seems to me, the Petitioners ought to have been informed of
the reasons of the Director for continued segregation, and they should have
been given a fair opportunity to answer the case against them.

 

18.              In the Court of Appeal Nemetz C.J. said
that he disagreed with the opinion of McEachern C.J.S.C. that the Director had
a duty to make further inquiry into the hostage‑taking incident and to
allow the prisoners an opportunity to be heard on their alleged involvement in
the incident. After referring to the necessity, emphasized in the decision of
this Court in Inuit Tapirisat, supra, of considering the
legislative scheme as a whole, he said:

 

                   This
decision assists me in analyzing the case at bar. Although the director's
function is essentially administrative in nature, he is given broad powers
under s. 40 of the regulations. He is not burdened with any standards or
guidelines in the exercise of his power to order that inmate be dissociated.
Procedural standards have not been imposed or implied. He must have enough
latitude to respond to the requirements of prison security as he sees fit. This
is especially so in cases of violence such as hostage‑taking.

 

After quoting the passages from the judgments of Pigeon and Dickson JJ.
in Martineau (No. 2), supra, which have been quoted above,
concerning the caution which must be adopted towards the imposition of
procedural requirements in the prison setting, Nemetz C.J.B.C. concluded on the
issue of fairness as follows:

 

                   Section
40(1) gives the director a broad discretionary power. In arriving at his
decision as to whether a prisoner is to be dissociated from the others in the
prison, he must be satisfied that it is for the maintenance of good order and
discipline or in the best interests of an inmate.

 

                   It is
my view that his testimony shows that it was the former concern that caused him
to disregard the classification board's recommendation for the month of
October. Was he justified in doing so? I think he was. The seriousness of the
incident and the circumstances surrounding it, as well as the situation in his
prison generally, played an important part in his determination. The
classification board's view related primarily to the assessment of the
behaviour of the two prisoners while in dissociation. However, the director had
to also consider his responsibilities in regard to the proper operation and
security of the whole institution. In my view, unless mala fides or unfairness
can be shown, his assessment should prevail. No mala fides has been shown. Any
procedural unfairness, if it exists, is not of sufficient substance to cause me
to conclude that the director acted outside of his jurisdiction. 

 

19.              Macdonald J.A. was of the view that there
had not been a denial of procedural fairness because the appellants knew the
considerations underlying the imposition and continuation of administrative
segregation in their case. He said:

 

                   With
great respect, I cannot find procedural unfairness in the circumstances here.
The petitioners would know that they were in dissociation at Kent because of
the incident at the Matsqui Institution in which they were alleged to have
taken a guard hostage at knifepoint. When they first appeared before the
Classification Board in July, they were expressly informed that they had been
placed in dissociation because of that incident. Now, there are many factors
favourable to the petitioners. They weighed with the Classification Board and
resulted in the recommendation in October that they be returned to the general
prison population. But they did not prevail with the director. He did not
decide in accordance with the recommendation. It was not a case of a decision
made under the influence, or possible influence, of material unknown to the two
inmates. The director was extensively cross‑examined as to his reasons.
He pointed out that the Classification Board was concerned with the two
individuals, whereas his responsibility was the operation of the whole
institution. He said that he was concerned about the seriousness of the incident
in which the two men had been involved; the effect of the unresolved
allegations and the situation generally on the inmate population, including the
violent element; and the factor of deterrence. Weighing the factors, the
director decided upon continued dissociation. I can find no procedural
unfairness. I think the essence of the complaints here is with respect to the
decision itself rather than the circumstances in which it was made. I am of the
opinion that the director acted within his jurisdiction.

 

20.              Anderson J.A., dissenting on the question
of procedural fairness, expressed himself as in agreement with the reasons of
McEachern C.J.S.C. After referring to the cautions expressed in Martineau
(No. 2), supra, concerning the application of procedural
requirements in a prison setting, he said:

 

... while the procedural
protection available to the respondent was limited in the way described by all
members of the Supreme Court in Martineau, supra, I have concluded that
McEachern C.J.S.C. was correct in holding that the director did not observe
even the most minimal standards of procedural fairness. While the respondent
was not entitled to a full hearing or to confront witnesses or to counsel, at
the very least he ought to have been given an opportunity to make
representations as to why he should no longer be kept in solitary confinement.
I cannot do better than repeat what McEachern C.J.S.C. said in his reasons for
judgment in respect of this issue:

 

                   ""The
director had jurisdiction to disregard the recommendation of the review board,
but to do so with fairness, it seems to me, the petitioners ought to have been
informed of the reasons of the director for continued segregation, and they
should have been given a fair opportunity to answer the case against them. They
should not have had to make out their case to a mind that was closed or almost
closed against them. To continue their segregation in the face of the
recommendation of the review board in the particular circumstances of this case
raises a reasonable apprehension that they should plead guilty which, by itself
is enough to cast a pervasive appearance of unfairness over these cases. In
addition, although a decision based upon a policy (such as one for prisoners
who are awaiting trial or for prisoners who have taken a hostage) may be
perfectly lawful, fairness requires timely reconsideration of the particular
circumstances of each prisoner and individual whose residual rights and
privileges are adversely being affected."" 

 

                                                                   VI

 

21.              The issue then is what did procedural
fairness require of the Director in exercising his authority, pursuant to s. 40
of the Penitentiary Service Regulations, to continue the administrative
dissociation or segregation of the appellants, despite the recommendation of
the Board, if he was satisfied that it was necessary or desirable for the
maintenance of good order and discipline in the institution. I agree with
McEachern C.J.S.C. and Anderson J.A. that because of the serious effect of the
Director's decision on the appellants, procedural fairness required that he
inform them of the reasons for his intended decision and give them an
opportunity, however informal, to make representations to him concerning these
reasons and the general question whether it was necessary or desirable to
continue their segregation for the maintenance of good order and discipline in
the institution. With great respect, I do not think it is an answer to the
requirement of notice and hearing by the Director, as suggested by Macdonald
J.A., that the appellants knew as a result of their appearance before the
Segregation Review Board why they had been placed in segregation. They were
entitled to know why the Director did not intend to act in accordance with the recommendation
of the Board and to have an opportunity before him to state their case for
release into the general population of the institution. I do not think the
Director was required to make an independent inquiry into the alleged
involvement of the appellants in the hostage‑taking incident. He
could rely on the information he had received concerning the incident from the
warden of Matsqui Institution and the personnel at regional headquarters. At
the same time, he had a duty to hear and consider what the appellants had to
say concerning their alleged involvement in the incident, as well as anything
else that could be relevant to the question whether their release from
segregation might introduce an unsettling element into the general inmate
population and thus have an adverse effect on the maintenance of good order and
discipline in the institution. 

 

22.              These were in my opinion the minimal or
essential requirements of procedural fairness in the circumstances, and they
are fully compatible with the concern that the process of prison
administration, because of its special nature and exigencies, should not be
unduly burdened or obstructed by the imposition of unreasonable or
inappropriate procedural requirements. There is nothing to suggest that the
requirement of notice and hearing by the Director, where he does not intend to
act in accordance with a recommendation by the Segregation Review Board for the
release of an inmate from segregation, would impose an undue burden on prison administration
or create a risk to security.

 

23.              There is the question, suggested by the
reasons for judgment of Nemetz C.J.B.C., whether the breach of the duty to act
fairly in this case should be held not to have resulted in an excess or loss of
jurisdiction and to have made the continuing segregation of the appellants
unlawful because, having regard to the merits of the substantive issue, it did
not result in a substantial injustice, or to use the words of Nemetz C.J.B.C.,
was not of ""sufficient substance"". Both Nemetz C.J.B.C. and Macdonald
J.A. considered the substantive issue of whether the appellants should be
released from segregation and appeared to conclude that the Director's reasons
for refusing to follow the recommendation of the Segregation Review Board were
reasonable and fair. It is a possible implication of their approach that they
were of the view that given the Director's reasons for refusing to follow the
recommendation of the Board a hearing by him of the appellants would not serve
any useful purpose. Certainly a failure to afford a fair hearing, which is the
very essence of the duty to act fairly, can never of itself be regarded as not
of ""sufficient substance"" unless it be because of its perceived
effect on the result or, in other words, the actual prejudice caused by it. If
this be a correct view of the implications of the approach of the majority of
the British Columbia Court of Appeal to the issue of procedural fairness in
this case, I find it necessary to affirm that the denial of a right to a fair
hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to
a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different
decision. The right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent,
unqualified right which finds its essential justification in the sense of
procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative decision is
entitled to have. It is not for a court to deny that right and sense of justice
on the basis of speculation as to what the result might have been had there
been a hearing.

 

24.              For these reasons I am of the opinion that
by his failure to afford the appellants a fair hearing on the question whether
he should act in accordance with the recommendation of the Segregation Review
Board that they be released from administrative segregation into the general
population of the institution, the Director rendered the continued segregation
of the appellants unlawful. They, therefore, had a right on habeas corpus
to be released from administrative dissociation or segregation into the general
population of the penitentiary. I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside
the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of McEachern
C.J.S.C.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ALBERTA

Criminal law—Information—Failure to give
sufficient details to identify transactions—Information quashed—Mandamus—Whether
defect can be cured by the supplying of particulars—Whether information can be
amended—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 510, 729, 732—Aeronautics
Act, R.S.C 1970, c. A-3 as amended, ss. 16, 17—Air Regulations, C.R.C. 1978, c.
2, s. 700.

The respondents were charged with 32 summary
conviction offences relating to the breaches of the Aeronautics Act  and
the regulations issued thereunder. Following appellant’s refusal to provide
particulars, respondents, prior to plea, made an application to quash the
information containing those counts. A Provincial Court judge allowed the motion ruling that it did not satisfy the
requirements of s. 510(3)  of the Criminal Code . He also ruled that
this was not a case where particulars should be ordered. The Court of Queen’s
Bench and the Court of Appeal upheld the quashing and dismissed appellant’s
application for writs of mandamus and certiorari. Appellant at no time
during the proceedings sought an order for particulars or made a motion to
amend the information.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

The information was ab initio vitiated
for want of sufficient details as required by s. 510(3) of the Code and
was not remediable in the present circumstances. Under Part XXIV of the Criminal
Code —summary convictions—an information that fails to comply with

[Page 486]

either s. 510(1)  or (3) , if objected to
prior to plea, must be quashed and cannot be salvaged by particulars or by
amendment.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Alberta Court of Appeal[2],
dismissing a Crown’s appeal from the decision of Lomas J., dismissing an
application for mandamus. Appeal dismissed.

I.G. Whitehall, Q.C., and D.J. Rennie,
for the appellant.

Aleck H. Trawick, for the respondents.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—Can particulars or an amendment salvage
an information in a summary conviction matter which is found, upon motion to
quash taken before plea, to be vitiated for want of sufficient details as
required by s. 510(3)  of the Criminal Code ? That is the
issue before this Court.

The Facts

In January 1981, an information was laid against
the respondents containing 32 counts, 16 alleging breaches of the Aeronautics
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. A-3, and 16 others, breaches of the regulations issued
thereunder.

The counts alleging breaches of the Aeronautics
Act  were all in this form, save variations as regards the dates:

AND FURTHER THAT on or between the 27th day
of March, A.D. 1980 and the 29th day of March, A.D. 1980, at or near the City
of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, did unlawfully operate a commercial air
service without holding a valid and subsisting licence issued under Section 16 
of the Aeronautics Act , Revised Statutes of Canada 1970, C. A-3, contrary to
Section 17(1) of the said Act, and did thereby commit an offence under the said
Section 17 ;

[Page 488]

The 16 counts alleging breaches of the
regulations were in this form, dates also varying:

AND FURTHER THAT on or between the 27th day of
March, A.D. 1980 and the 29th day of March, A.D. 1980, at or near the City of
Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, did unlawfully operate a commercial air
service in Canada, while not holding a valid and subsisting certificate issued
by the Minister certifying that the holder thereof is adequately equipped and
able to conduct a safe operation as an air carrier, contrary to Section 700 of
the Consolidated Regulations of Canada 1978, C. 2 (formerly the Air
Regulations) as amended;

Counsel for the respondents was given access to
and reviewed documentation in the possession of the R.C.M.P. with respect to
the charges. He made an informal request for particulars of the commercial air
services and customers to which the information referred. Counsel for the
appellant ultimately decided not to furnish particulars voluntarily and
indicated that he would oppose an application for particulars. Rather than
making such an application, the respondents, relying on ss. 732(1) and 510(3)
of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, brought a motion to quash
the information. Appellant did not suggest the ordering of particulars, and did
not move to amend the information.

Statutory Provisions

Criminal Code 

Section 729:

729. (1)
Sections 510 and 512 apply, mutatis mutandis, to informations in respect
of proceedings as defined in this Part.

(2) The summary conviction court may, if it
is satisfied that it is necessary for a fair trial, order that a particular,
further describing any matter relevant to the proceedings, be furnished to the
defendant.

Section 510(1), (2), (3):

510. (1)
Each count in an indictment shall in general apply to a single transaction and
shall contain and is sufficient if it contains in substance a statement that
the accused committed an indictable offence therein specified.

[Page 489]

(2) The statement referred to in
subsection (1) may be

(a) in popular language
without technical averments or allegations of matters that are not essential to
be proved,

(b) in the words of the
enactment that describes the offence or declares the matters charged to be an
indictable offence, or

(c) in words that are
sufficient to give to the accused notice of the offence with which he is
charged.

(3) A count shall contain sufficient detail
of the circumstances of the alleged offence to give to the accused reasonable
information with respect to the act or omission to be proved against him and to
identify the transaction referred to, but otherwise the absence or
insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count.

Section 732:

732. (1) An
objection to an information for a defect apparent on its face shall be taken by
motion to quash the information before the defendant has pleaded, and
thereafter only by leave of the summary conviction court before which the trial
takes place.

(2) A summary conviction court may, upon
the trial of an information, amend the information or a particular that is
furnished under section 729, to make the information or particular conform
to the evidence if there appears to be a variance between the evidence and

(a) the charge in the
information, or

(b) the charge in the
information

(i) as amended, or

(ii) as it would have been if amended in
conformity with any particular that has been furnished pursuant to
section 729.

(3) A summary conviction court may, at any
stage of the trial, amend the information as may be necessary if it appears

(a) that the information has
been laid

(i) under another Act of the Parliament of
Canada instead of this Act, or

(ii) under this Act instead of another Act
of the Parliament of Canada; or

(b) that the information

(i) fails to state or states defectively
anything that is requisite to constitute the offence,

[Page 490]

(ii) does not negative an exception that
should be negatived, or

(iii) is in any way defective in substance,

and the matters to be alleged in the
proposed amendment are disclosed by the evidence taken on the trial; or

(c) that the information is in any
way defective in form.

(4) A variance between the information and
the evidence taken on the trial is not material with respect to

(a) the time when the offence
is alleged to have been committed, if it is proved that the information was
laid within the prescribed period of limitation, or

(b) the place where the
subject-matter of the proceedings is alleged to have arisen, if it is proved
that it arose within the territorial jurisdiction of the summary conviction
court that holds the trial.

(5) The summary conviction court shall, in
considering whether or not an amendment should be made, consider

(a) the evidence taken on the
trial, if any,

(b) the circumstances of the
case,

(c) whether the defendant has been
misled or prejudiced in his defence by a variance, error or omission mentioned
in subsection (2) or (3), and

(d) whether, having regard to
the merits of the case, the proposed amendment can be made without injustice
being done.

(6) Where in the opinion of the summary
conviction court the defendant has been misled or prejudiced in his defence by
an error or omission in the information, the summary conviction court may
adjourn the trial and may make such an order with respect to the payment of
costs resulting from the necessity of amendment as it considers desirable.

The Judgments

Provincial Court of Alberta: Murray Prov. Ct.
J.

The Court held that the counts in the
information did not contain details of the circumstances of the alleged
offences sufficient to give the respondents reasonable information with respect
to the acts or omissions to be proved against them and to

[Page 491]

identify the transactions to which the counts of
the information referred and that, accordingly, the minimal requirements of
s. 510(3) had not been met.

The Court found that there was nothing in the
circumstances surrounding the information which would enlighten the respondents
as to the nature of the case to be met and that the respondents had not been
tardy in putting forward the defence that the information was inadequate.
Murray Prov. Ct. J. was of the view that it would be improper to compel the
respondents to plead to an illegal information and that this was not a case
where particulars should be ordered. Accordingly, the information was quashed.

Court of Queens Bench of Alberta

The Crown thereupon applied to Lomas J. for
remedy by way of mandamus and certiorari. Both writs were denied, for
reasons which were not made known to this Court.

Court of Appeal of Alberta

The Court relied on the judgment of Rinfret J.
in Brodie v. The King, [1936] S.C.R. 188, to the effect that an
indictment must provide concrete facts which would identify the particular act
which is charged and thereby give the accused notice of it. The Court of Appeal
agreed with the courts below that these requirements had not been met, and that
the information was “bad in law and not merely defective”. Accordingly this was
not, said the Court, a case where the information could be cured by the
supplying of particulars and it was proper to quash the information.

First I would like to deal very briefly with the
question of whether the counts in the information meet the requirements of
s. 510(3).

Respondents in their factum, arguing that the
information did not meet those requirements, expressed their views as follows:

[Page 492]

The information at bar is in the express
words of the language contained in S. 17 of the Aeronautics Act, R.C.S.
(1970) c. A-3 and s. 700 of the Regulations thereunder. In each instance,
the gravamen of the offence is the operation of a “commercial air service”
without the requisite licence or certificate. Regard must be had to
s. 9(1)  of the Aeronautics Act , which defines “commercial air
service” as “any use of aircraft in or over Canada for hire or reward”. “Hire
or reward” is defined as “any payment, consideration, gratuity or benefit
directly or indirectly charged, demanded, received or collected by any person
for the use of an aircraft”.

The operation of a “commercial air service”
within the meaning of s. 9(1)  of the Aeronautics Act  could
therefore relate to a multitude of activities or usages of aircraft in Canada,
for example the use of an aircraft to haul passengers or freight, the use of an
aircraft as a demonstrator by a dealer or manufacturer, or indeed even the use
of the aircraft in a photo session for the purposes of advertisement of another
product such as liquor or cigarettes. The statute under which the Information
at bar has been laid casts a broad net and the prohibition is directed at many
diverse and unrelated uses of aircraft in Canada which by the language of
s. 9(1)  are deemed to be the operation of a “commercial air service.”

I find this to be an accurate description of the
situation faced by the respondents. In agreement with what has been
specifically found by at least two of the three courts below (one expressed no
views), I am of the view that the information is ab initio vitiated for
want of sufficient details as required under s. 510(3).

The remaining and real issue in this case is as
follows: does a judge who has, upon a motion to quash made before plea, made a
finding that a count in an information is vitiated for want of sufficient
details as required under s. 510(3) of the Code, have a discretion
to order particulars, or to amend the count, or must the count be quashed? One
should recall that in this case no particulars were asked for nor were
particulars volunteered in court by the parties; neither did the Crown move to
amend. I should nevertheless not want to narrow the issues to the point of
leaving unanswered the question as to what could or should the judge have

[Page 493]

done had he been asked. In fact, I would find it
difficult to deal with the matter without answering those questions and have
therefore, framed the issue so as to encompass those aspects. I should however
make two observations: first, we are dealing with a summary conviction offence,
and what I say should be read in the light of the differences between ss. 516
and 529 governing amendments and particulars for indictable offences, and ss.
729 and 732 governing summary convictions; secondly, the motion to quash is one
taken before plea.

With great hesitation I have come to the
conclusion that Parliament has not given the trial judge any other alternative
but to quash the information, irrespective of whether or not particulars are
offered and of whether or not the prosecution moves to amend under s. 732.

My hesitation in reading the law as such is due
to the fact that it appears to me that Parliament needed not go so far in
ensuring the furtherance of the policy considerations which are recognized as
having inspired our various laws governing the charging process in criminal
law. A judge’s jurisdiction to interfere with the liberty of a citizen is
dependent upon the citizen becoming an accused. That will happen only if and
when he is charged with an offence known to the law. This is enacted by
s. 510(1). When accused, the citizen shall then be treated fairly. This
requires that he must be able clearly to identify what he is alleged to have
done wrong so that he may prepare his case adequately, and that at the outset
of his trial or thereafter once the trial is over and at some other court, he
must be able to argue that he has already been acquitted or convicted of the
offence or that he comes within the protective principles set out in Kienapple
v. The Queen, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729.

It therefore appeared to me, and still does,
that a judge when faced with a motion to quash for a

[Page 494]

count vitiated by virtue of s. 510(3), as
in this case, should be empowered (and normally should exercise such a power)
to order particulars. This course of action would meet all of the policy
considerations I have set out and would have the added advantage of getting on
with matters instead of seeing the information being laid anew (when possible)
and having further delays imported into the process. Be that as it may, that is
not the law and I can find no way of interpreting the law as such, short of
usurping Parliament’s prerogatives. I come to this conclusion for three
reasons: Parliament’s changes to the Code following this Court’s
decision in Brodie v. The King, supra; the fact that particulars have
never been considered as a proper means to cure vitiated informations for
defects of substance; and the wording of s. 729.

Section 510 is substantially the same as its
predecessor sections (ss. 852 and 853 of R.S.C. 1927, c. 36; R.S.C. 1906,
c. 146; and s. 611 of 1892 (Can.), c. 29) in force at the time of the Brodie
decision, except for s. 510(3) which then read as follows:

853. Every
count of an indictment shall contain so much detail of the circumstances of the
alleged offence as is sufficient to give the accused reasonable information as
to the act or omission to be proved against him, and to identify the transaction
referred to: Provided that the absence or insufficiency of such details
shall not vitiate the count.

(Emphasis added.)

The difference it will be noted is quite
substantial and is found in the last lines of the subsection: “Provided
that the absence or insufficiency of such details shall not vitiate the
count” whereas, s. 510(3) introduced in the new Code of 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, (as s. 492(3)) states “but otherwise the absence or
insufficiency of details does not vitiate the count”. (Emphasis added).
As of 1953-54, defects under s. 510(3) vitiated counts.

[Page 495]

Before commenting on the Brodie decision
and the effect of the changes to the Code in 1953-54, a review of the
law and of the cases prior to Brodie is in order as it will assist in
understanding the limitations to reconsider Brodie put upon this Court
by the 1953-54 amendments; also, when considering whether s. 729(2) (the
ordering of particulars) can be used to salvage a vitiated information.

The Code of 1892 enacted, as regards
charges, their contents and their quashing for want thereof, substantially the
same sections as those in force at the time of Brodie in 1936.
Though the sections appear to be different for informations, the courts at
the time dealt with defects in informations in the same way they had when
considering defects in indictments; apart from the inherent differences
resulting from the absence of any preliminary proceedings or evidence adduced
prior to arraignment in the case of summary convictions, the courts had as many
exigencies as to their content. (See, for example, R. v. King (1893), 25
N.S.R. 488; R. v. France (1898), 1 C.C.C. 321; Riopelle v. Desrosiers
(1900), 3 Q.P.R. 195; Re Fisher (1905), 9 C.C.C. 451; R. v.
Limerick, Ex parte Staples (1922), 39 C.C.C. 351; R. v. Jordan (1925),
44 C.C.C. 23; R. v. Henderson, Ex parte Brindle (1926), 45 C.C.C. 310).
That had also been the case in England, as appears from what is said in Saunders’
Practice of Magistrates’ Courts, 6th ed., 1902, at p. 41:

The information should give an exact and a
legal description of the offence, and it should contain the same certainty as
an indictment: (Ex parte Pain, 5 B. & C. 251; Re Elmy and Sawyer,
1 Ad. & Ell. 843; R. v. Marsh, 4 D. & R. 267; Cotterill
v. Lemprière, 24 Q.B. Div. 634; 62 L.T. Rep. 695.) Facts must be stated in
a direct and positive manner: (Rex v. Bradley, 19 Mod. 155; Rex v.
Fuller, 1 Ld. Raym. 509; Rex v. Pereira, 2 Ad. & Ell. 375); and
not be in the alternative: Rex v. Middlehurst, 1 Burr. 399; R. v.
Morley, 1 You. & Jer. 22; R. v. Marshall, 1 Mod. c. 158).

[Page 496]

The wording of the relevant sections in the
Code was similar to the equivalent sections in England in the Summary
Jurisdiction Act, 1879 (U.K.), 42-43 Vict., c. 49, s. 39. Section
39(1) of that Act, the forerunner of our s. 510(2), read as follows:

39. …

1. The description of any offence in the
words of the Act, or any order, byelaw, regulation, or other document creating
the offence, or in similar words, shall be sufficient in law; and

. .
.

That section had been perceived by some
(see Saunders, supra, at p. 42) as a relaxation of the common law
requirements for a valid information, which requirements had survived through
the courts notwithstanding statute law, which provided that (Summary
Jurisdiction Act, 1848 (U.K.), 11-12 Vict., c. 43, s. 1):

… no objection shall be taken or allowed to
any information, complaint, or summons, for any alleged defect therein in
substance or in form, or for any variance between such information, complaint,
or summons and the evidence adduced on the part of the informant or complainant
at the hearing of such information or complaint as hereinafter mentioned; but
if any such variance shall appear to the justice or justices present and acting
at such hearing to be such that the party so summoned and appearing has been
thereby deceived or misled, it shall be lawful for such justice or justices,
upon such terms as he or they shall think fit, to adjourn the hearing of the
case to some future day.

The clearest authority illustrating the English
judges’ resistance to statutory changes to the common law, relatively
contemporary to the introduction into Canada of the Code, is found in Smith
v. Moody, [1903] 1 K.B. 56, where Lord Alverstone C.J., dealing with a
defect in a charge governed by the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, supra, said
(at p. 60):

I was at first inclined to think that the
defect was cured by s. 39 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, which
provides that “the description of any offence in the words of the Act …
creating the offence, or in similar

[Page 497]

words, shall be sufficient in law”; but on
further considering the question, which is undoubtedly one of importance, it
seems to me that it could not have been intended by that section to do
away with the old rule of criminal practice which requires that fair
information and reasonable particularity as to the nature of the offence must
be given in indictments and convictions. All that is meant by s. 39 is
that the offence itself need only be described in the words of the statute
creating it.

In Canada, the courts split. One group of cases
(to mention but a few: R. v. France, supra; Re Effie Brady (1913), 21
C.C.C. 123; R. v. Armstrong (1916), 26 C.C.C. 151; R. v. Trainor (1916),
27 C.C.C. 232; Hatem v. The King (1927), 49 C.C.C. 164), appears to have
recognized codification for what it meant; the others (see amongst others: R.
v. Beckwith (1903), 7 C.C.C. 450; R. v. Goodfellow (1906), 10 C.C.C.
424; R. v. Bainbridge (1917), 30 C.C.C. 214; R. v. Desjardins (1919),
45 C.C.C. 100; R. v. Limerick, Ex parte Staples, supra; R. v. Jordan, supra)
treated the Code as Lord Alverstone had the 1879 Statute. This
latter group, in my view, overlooked an important difference between Canadian
and English law: the proviso in s. 611(4) of our 1892 Code (at the
time of Brodie, s. 853):

… Provided that the absence or
insufficiency of such details shall not vitiate the count.

The first group was of the view that the lack of
such “details of the circumstances” did not go to substance and therefore could
be cured by particulars or through amendment. The others, because they
considered such “details” as part of the substance of the information, found
that their lack in an information was fatal thereto.

Of particular importance, however, is the fact
that all agreed that defects of substance raised before plea by motion to quash
could not be cured, through particulars nor through amendment, notwithstanding,
as regards indictments, the text of s. 629 of the 1892 Code which
conferred wide powers to amend at that stage “any defect apparent on the face”
of an indictment. These words were inter-

[Page 498]

preted as referring to defects other than of
substance. (See R. v. Cameron (1898), 2 C.C.C. 173; R. v. Weir (No.
2) (1899), 3 C.C.C. 155; R. v. Weir (No. 5) (1900), 3 C.C.C. 499; R.
v. Desjardins, supra, and Taschereau’s Criminal Code, Carswell Co.,
1893, pp. 704 et seq.; contra: R. v. Hazen (1893), 20 O.A.R. 633; Ead
v. The King (1908), 40 S.C.R. 272 and R. v. Kerr (1922), 53 O.L.R.
228).

The courts agreed generally as to the effects
and as to the limitations to possible cures for a defect of substance; but they
really parted ways in determining when a defect was one of substance.

This Court in the Brodie decision came
down on the side of those who followed Lord Alverstone C.J., in Smith.

The charge preferred in Brodie was as
follows:

The Attorney-General of the province of
Quebec charges that: during the months of September and October in the year of
our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirty‑three, at the city of
Quebec, in the district of Quebec, and elsewhere in the province of Quebec,
George H. Brodie, of Toronto, and G.C. Barrett, of Belleville, Ontario, were
party to a seditious conspiracy, in conspiring together and with one W.F.
Greenwood, W.G. Brown, Mrs. Charles Alton and Mrs. A.M. Rose and also
with other persons unknown, thereby committing the crime of seditious
conspiracy.

This charge had been unsuccessfully challenged
by motion to quash. The accused were found guilty and the Court of Appeal for
Quebec upheld the conviction. That decision was then appealed to this Court.
Rinfret J. (as he then was) speaking for the Court, referred to s. 852
(now s. 510(1) and (2)) in the following terms, at pp. 193-94:

If section 852 be analysed, it will be
noticed the imperative requirement (“shall contain”) is that there must be a
statement that the accused has committed an indictable offence; and such
offence must be “specified.” It will be sufficient if the substance of the
offence is stated; but every count must contain such statement “in

[Page 499]

substance.” In our view, this does not mean
merely classifying or characterizing the offence; it calls for the necessity of
specifying time, place and matter (Compare dictum of Channel, J., in Smith
v. Moody, [1903] 1 K.B. 56, at 63), of stating the facts alleged to
constitute the indictable offence.

The manner of stating the matter is of no
absolute importance, in view of subsections 2 and 3. The statement may be
made in popular language, without any technical averments or allegations; or it
may be in the words of the enactment describing the offence or declaring the
matter charged to be an indictable offence; but we think the latter parts of
subsections 2 and 3 are indicative of the intention of Parliament: the
statement must contain the allegations of matter “essential to be proved,” and
must be in “words sufficient to give the accused notice of the offence with
which he is charged.” Those are the very words of the section; and they were
put there to embody the spirit of the legislation, one of its main objects
being that the accused may have a fair trial and consequently that the
indictment shall, in itself, identify with reasonable precision the act or acts
with which he is charged, in order that he may be advised of the particular
offence alleged against him and prepare his defence accordingly.

What Parliament intended by using the words
“a statement *** (of) some indictable offence therein specified,” in
subsection 1 of section 852 is, to our mind, clearly illustrated by
the “examples of the manner of stating offences” given in Form 64, referred to
in subsection 4 of section 852.

Under the Interpretation Act (Ch. 1
of R.S.C., 1927), by force of sec. 31 (d):

wherever forms are prescribed, slight
deviations therefrom, not affecting the substance or calculated to mislead,
shall not invalidate them;

which obviously means that any substantial
deviation might be sufficient to invalidate the form used. Now, a perusal of
the examples given in Form 64 will be sufficient to indicate that in no case is
the manner of stating offences limited to the mere naming of them, but in each
case the act charged against the accused, though described in the words
of the enactment, is identified by specifying the time, the place and the
matter. We think the examples in Form 64 are referred to for the purpose of
indicating that they ought to be followed in substance. It is not sufficient
in a count to charge an indictable offence in the abstract. Concrete facts of a

[Page 500]

nature to identify the particular act
which is charged and to give the accused notice of it are necessary ingredients
of the indictment.

(Emphasis added.)

I pause here to mention the striking resemblance
between the underlined portions of his remarks and the wording of s. 853
(now s. 510(3)).

He then said, at p. 195:

As a matter of fact, this requirement of an
indictment is further embodied in sec. 853  of the Criminal Code , which
enacts that

Every count *** shall contain so much
detail of the circumstances of the alleged offence as is sufficient to give to
the accused reasonable information as to the act or omission to be proved
against him and to identify the transaction referred to.

Such is the rule of the Criminal Code .

Of course, it is qualified by the proviso

that the absence or insufficiency of such
details shall not vitiate the count,

and it must be granted that these words are
very strong. It should be noticed, however, that the proviso, as well as the
section itself, relates only to the “absence or insufficiency of details.”
It does not detract from the obligation resulting from sec. 852 that the
substance of the offence should be stated in the indictment.

He dealt with the charge, at p. 198:

Applying the above principles to the
present appeal, it follows that the indictment must be found insufficient. It
is not the case where an offence is imperfectly stated; it is a case where
essential averments were wholly omitted. The so-called indictment contains
defects in matters of substance. To use the apt words of counsel for the
appellants: “it does not describe the offence in such a way as to lift it from
the general to the particular.”

Finally he concluded the matter as follows, at
p. 199:

These averments were omitted and these
necessary ingredients were lacking in the indictment preferred against the
appellants. Their absence constitutes defects in matters of substance; and we
are of opinion that these defects were not cured by the so-called incomplete
par-

[Page 501]

ticulars verbally given by the Crown when,
at the outset of the trial, objection was taken to the indictment by counsel
for the accused. The Crown, it may be added, in the argument before us did not
rely on these particulars, and took the stand that the indictment was
sufficient as it stood. Nor can we accede to the argument that, in the
circumstances, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually
occurred and that we should exercise the powers given to us by sec. 1014 
of the Criminal Code . In our view, it was a substantial wrong towards the
appellants to have compelled them to plead to an illegal indictment.

The motion to quash the indictment made by
the accused at the beginning of the trial, and before pleading, ought to have
been granted. The appeal will, therefore, be allowed. The indictment and the
conviction must be quashed, the Crown being at liberty to prefer a fresh
indictment, if so advised.

Of significance in Brodie is the import
to s. 852(1) of the “details” described in s. 853 , and, the resulting
extension by the Court of the vitiating effect given to their absence in a
charge.

Brodie did not
settle much if one considers the thirty odd cases reported on point between
1936 and 1953. Evidently that decision’s disregard for the proviso set out in
s. 853  left it open to some courts to distinguish Brodie. As a
result, the two groups I referred to earlier carried on much the same, the only
difference being the opportunity for some to refer to Brodie for added
support, and the need for others to distinguish that decision. (See amongst
others: R. v. Griss, [1936] O.R. 604; R. v. Safeway Stores Ltd.
(No. 1), [1938] 2 W.W.R. 479; R. v. Container Materials Ltd., [1939]
4 D.L.R. 387; R. v. Imperial Tobacco Co. (1939), 72 C.C.C. 388; R. v.
Adduono, [1940] O.R. 184; R. v. Madill (No. 2), [1943] 1 W.W.R. 371;
R. v. Langlois (1944), 83 C.C.C. 124; R. v. McNab (1945), 61
B.C.R. 74; R. v. Rycer (1946), 2 C.R. 388; R. v. Hing Lee Yen (1947),
3 C.R. 352; R. v. Annunziello (1948), 6 C.R. 330; R. v. Brooks, [1951]
O.W.N. 513; MacDonald v. The Queen (1952), 14 C.R. 387; R. v. Steele (1952),
14 C.R. 285).

[Page 502]

This is probably what brought about action by
Parliament. Parliament made two changes to the law in this area in the Code of
1953-54.

First Change: The Proviso

Consolidating ss. 852 and 853, Parliament changed
the proviso of s. 853 as aforementioned by deleting the wording to which
the Court in Brodie, in my respectful view, did not give sufficient
heed, and substituting the wording we find today, wording which in my view
supports (ex post facto) the Brodie judgment. As a result
insufficiencies under s. 510(3) were as of then and are still today of the same
effect as those under s. 510(1). They vitiate, and the charge is no less
vitiated under s. 510(3) than under s. 510(1). That put an end to the
controversy on that point, as witness the decisions that followed the new Code
(see amongst others: Re Kipling’s Prohibition Application; Re
Juvenile Delinquents Act (1961), 36 W.W.R. 273; Shumiatcher v.
Attorney General of Saskatchewan (1962), 38 C.R. 411; R. v. Wixalbrown (1963),
41 C.R. 113; R. v. Harrison (1964), 45 C.R. 54; Taylor v. Gotfried (1964),
43 C.R. 307; R. v. Otterbein (1967), 50 C.R. 285; R. v. Hipke (1967),
59 W.W.R. 653; R. v. McAuslane (No. 2) (1972), 18 C.R.N.S. 9; Re
Regina and Marcoux (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 222; R. v. Tremblay, [1974]
R.L. 373; R. v. Cruz (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 255).

Second Change: The Power to Amend

The Brodie decision, no amendment having
been sought in that case, did not deal with the power to amend defects of
substance. Added to that is the fact that the courts had read down, in varying
degrees, the existing power to amend to cure a count defective because of “an
omission to state or a defective statement of anything requisite to constitute
the offence …” (s. 889(2) Code of 1927). Furthermore, as mentioned
earlier, defects of substance were not curable. Parliament made them curable,
but only if, and only to the extent that the amendment could find support in
the evidence adduced at trial. Such is still the case today, and I cannot find
any support when reading s. 732, for the proposition that prior to there
being any evidence there can be an amendment for anything but

[Page 503]

a defect of form (s. 732(3)(c)) or one to
correct an erroneous reference to the relevant act allegedly breached (s.
732(3)(a)).

As regards particulars, the only change made to
the relevant sections was to extend to all matters the giving of
particulars. Very eloquent is the fact that the precise words (the words
“further describing”), upon which Brodie rested its finding that
particulars could not cure defects of substance, were not deleted or modified.
(See also, on the use of particulars: R. v. Sinclair (1906), 12 C.C.C.
20; R. v. Desjardins, supra; R. v. Buck (1932), 57 C.C.C. 290; R. v.
McNab, supra; R. v. Rycer, supra, dissent of O’Halloran J.A.; R. v.
Gotfried, sub nom. Taylor v. Gotfried, supra, reasons of Freedman J.A.; R.
v. Otterbein, supra; R. v. Klein, [1968] 4 C.C.C. (2d) 209; R. v. Aulik (1968),
64 W.W.R. 65; R. v. Stiopu (1982), 70 C.C.C. (2d) 464; contra: R. v.
McNicoll (1967), 50 C.R. 305 (obiter) and, to some extent R.
v. Toronto Magistrates, ex parte Bassett, [1967] 1 C.C.C. 251, and R. v.
Ostrove (1967), 60 W.W.R. 267.)

Brodie had
commented on those limitations to the availability of particulars and denied
them any curative effect when substance was involved, even when given formally.
Indeed, the judgment referred to a passage from the remarks of Mulock C.J.O. in
R. v. Buck, supra, one might assume with approval given what was said
afterwards, (though such approval is not mentioned), where he said, at
p. 293:

The true function of particulars is to give
further information to the accused of that which it is intended to prove
against him, so that he may have a fair trial. It is not intended to be in
effect the supplementing of a

[Page 504]

defective indictment by supplying that
which ought to have appeared in the indictment itself. This is very plain from
the reading of s. 859 of the Code.

Rinfret J. then went on to say, at p. 197:

That this is the correct interpretation of
sec. 855 is strengthened, in our view, by comparison with sec. 859
enumerating the cases in which particulars may be ordered.

Subsection (d) of
sec. 859 deals with the charge of selling, or exhibiting, an obscene book,
pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing. If the court is satisfied that it is
necessary for a fair trial, it may order the prosecutor to furnish particulars
stating what passages in the book, pamphlet, newspaper or other printing or
writing are relied on in support of the charge. Which presupposes that the
book, pamphlet, newspaper, printing or writing has already been referred to in
the charge.

This is made still clearer in
subsections (e), (f) and (g) relating
to “any document or words the subject of a charge”; to “means by which any
offence was committed”; or to “any person, place or thing referred to in any
indictment.” Each of these subsections begins by the words: “further
describing,” which obviously contemplates indictments already describing the
document or words the subject of a charge, the means by which any offence was
committed, but requiring a “further” description which, in the view of the
Court, “is necessary for a fair trial.”

As for the “person, place or thing” dealt
with in subsection (g), the point is made doubly clear, since the
subsection speaks of a “person, place or thing (already) referred to in
any indictment”; and it is stated that a particular may be ordered “further
describing” them.

The evident relation between the matters
dealt with in subsections (d), (e), (f) and (g)
of sec. 855 and the corresponding subsections of sec. 859
is, we think, illuminating on the subject-matter of the present discussion.
Clearly the result flowing from the two sections read together is: that
some statement of the particular circumstances of the offence charged is
assumed to be already contained in the count; that there may be omissions
which, on account of sec. 855, are not sufficient to make the count
objectionable; that the count will not be deemed insufficient by reason only of
those omissions; and that if the court is satisfied that it is necessary for a

[Page 505]

fair trial, it may order particulars to
describe further, or with more precision the matters in question.

The limited change, in the light of this
context, to the section dealing with particulars is striking. Defects of
substance were and remain not curable through particulars, and I am unable to
distinguish between informations vitiated in their substance under
s. 510(1) and those under s. 510(3) in order to find cure through
particulars for the latter.

Appellant seeks support in three decisions. The
first is R. v. Otterbein, supra. As in the present case, a motion to
quash before plea was made for a failure to comply with s. 492(3) (now
s. 510(3)). Fraser J. having found such a defect said, at p. 292:

Having regard to the wording of
s. 492(3) and to the cases referred to it seems clear that the proviso at
the end of subs. (3) does not excuse failure to comply with the earlier part of
that subsection. Having regard to the same cases and to the wording of
s. 492(6) it seems equally clear that it is no answer to a motion to
quash brought at this stage to say that the defendant could demand or move for
particulars under s. 701(2).

(Emphasis added.)

Then, in obiter, he said of amendments:

While the question does not arise on this
application it would seem to me that, when objection was taken to the
sufficiency of the information, there was nothing to prevent it being amended
under the provisions of s. 704, had counsel for the Crown made an
application for that purpose. In this connection I refer to the judgment of
Schroeder J. (now J.A.), in Regina v. Peacock, [1954] O.W.N. 169, 18
C.R. 95, 108 C.C.C. 129. I do not in any way rest my judgment herein on the
opinion expressed in this paragraph.

It goes without saying that Fraser J. is clearly
against appellant’s position as regards particulars. As for his obiter remarks
concerning amendments, the text of s. 704 (now s. 732) makes it clear
that,

[Page 506]

except for defects of form or under
s. 732(3)(a), amendments can only be made if, and to the extent
that the matters to be alleged in the amendment “are disclosed by the evidence
taken on the trial”.

The second case referred to by appellant is R.
v. Miron (1974), 28 C.R.N.S. 261, a decision of the Ontario Court of
Appeal. That is a case where an amendment was made in the course of the trial.
With regard to such an amendment the Court of Appeal said, at p. 262:

We are of the opinion that as originally drawn
this indictment did not comply with s. 510(3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C
1970, c. C-34. The Crown’s case was not that the appellants had agreed to rob
someone not yet selected; it was that an agreement had been reached to rob a
specific person. However, under the authority of Regina v. Denis, [1969]
2 O.R. 205, [1970] 1 C.C.C. 86, and under the terms of s. 529(3) of the
Code, we think that the trial Judge had authority to amend the indictment, and
he did amend it so as to cure the defect.

The reference to the Denis decision makes it
clear that the amendment was made after plea and was supported by the evidence
adduced. Indeed, in Denis the amendment was made at the end of the Crown’s
case. Again I fail to see any support here for the appellant.

The appellant refers us also to R. v. Bengert
(No. 5) (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 481. That is a case where the motion to
quash was presented some five months into the evidence. The Court said, at
p. 506:

We think that the power of the Court to
make an amendment under the provision of s. 529(3) is greater than the
power of amendment which the Court had under the pre‑1955 Code. A
“defect in substance” must relate to a matter “essential to be proved”. That
being so, the Court has the power to amend an indictment which is defective in
substance, that is, an indictment which would be void if the Brodie case
was applicable. Moreover, we think that this approach is the “modern

[Page 507]

approach” to indictments as set out in such
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada as R. v. Major (1976), 27
C.C.C. (2d) 239n, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 826, 40 C.R.N.S. 298; R. v. Côté (1977),
33 C.C.C. (2d) 353, 73 D.L.R. (3d) 752, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 8, and R. v. City of
Sault Ste. Marie (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 353, 85 D.L.R. (3d) 161, 3 C.R.
(3d) 30, [[1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299].

Then went on to say, at p. 507:

In view of the fact, however, that we have
concluded that the indictment in this case does conform to the requirements of
s. 510 we do not find it necessary to determine the extent of the Court’s
powers under s. 529(3)(b)(iii) or (c).

Added to the fact that the Court’s comments on
s. 529(3) were obiter, I find nothing there to support what
appellant advances in this case.

Finally, appellant invites us to take a
“remedial approach” when interpreting s. 732(3) and find that the words “a
summary conviction court may, at any stage of the trial, amend the information
…” include “before plea”. “The remedial approach”, says appellant, relying on Sisko
v. Attorney General of British Columbia (1977), 8 C.R. (3d) 372, and Re
Lakeview Motors Ltd. v. The Queen (1982), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 475, “holds that a
trial commences at different times for different purposes” and that for
purposes of amendment of defects in a charge, a trial commences before plea.

With respect for the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, I cannot agree. I readily would adopt a flexible approach to the
definition of the word “trial” were it not for the fact that amendments under
s. 732(3)(b) are conditional to their subject matter having been
“disclosed by the evidence taken on the trial”. Whatever be the scope we give
under the section to the word “trial”, the amendment cannot be made before
that evidence is adduced.

To sum up, I am of the view that under Part XXIV
of the Code, an information that fails to comply with either
s. 510(1) or (3), if objected to

[Page 508]

prior to plea, must be quashed and cannot be
salvaged by particulars or by amendment.

Before dismissing, as a result, this appeal, I
should like to make a few comments on the vehicle the Crown chose for redress.
The Crown sought mandamus. Neither in the Court of Queen’s Bench nor in the
Court of Appeal of Alberta was an objection taken to that vehicle on the
grounds that the proper remedy was that of a stated case. Nor was the matter in
any way raised by the courts or counsel below or by counsel in this Court. This
is understandable having regard to the law as it now stands in Alberta (see R.
v. Canadian Pacific Ltd. (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 14).

Given the wording of s. 762 and the

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF
APPEAL FOR ONTARIO

Criminal Law — Attempted murder — Mens rea — Whether
requisite mens rea restricted to intent to kill or recklessly cause bodily harm
known to likely cause death — Whether s. 24 in combination with construc­tive
murder sections can form basis for attempted murder — Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970, c. C-34, ss. 24(1), 212 (a)(i),(ii), 213(d).

Respondent, who wanted to speak with his estranged
wife, broke into an apartment building with a loaded sawed-off shotgun. Kurely,
the man with whom his wife had been living, went to investigate the sound of
break­ing glass and threw the chair he was carrying at respondent when he saw
him climbing the stairs. The gun discharged, missing Kurely, and a struggle
followed. Shortly after his arrest, respondent stated to police that he
""had him [Kurely] by the throat and I would have killed him."" The
trial judge found respondent had broken into the apartment building with the
intent to use the shotgun to force his wife to leave and convicted him of
attempted murder. The Court of Appeal over-turned that conviction and ordered a
new trial. At issue here is whether the mens rea in attempted murder is
limited to an intention to cause death or to cause bodily harm knowing it to be
likely to cause death, or whether the mens rea required extended to the
intention to do some action constituting murder as defined by ss. 212 or 213 of
the Code.

Held (Ritchie J. dissenting): The appeal
should be dismissed.



 



* The Chief Justice took no part in the judgment.

[Page 226]

Per Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIntyre, Chouinard, Lamer
and Wilson JJ.: The mens rea for attempted murder is the specific intent
to kill and a mental state falling short of that level, while it might lead to
convic­tion for other offences, cannot lead to a conviction for an attempt. The completed offence of murder involves
kill­ing and any intention to complete that offence must include the intention
to kill. An attempt to murder should have no lesser intent. Nothing illogical
arises from the fact that in certain circumstances a lesser intent will suffice
for a conviction for murder. A person cannot intend to commit the unintentional
killings described in ss. 212 and 213 of the Code. Any illogic lies
in the statutory characterization of unintentional killing as murder.

The
crime of attempt developed as, and remains, an offence separate and distinct
from murder. While the Crown must still prove both mens rea and actus
reus, the mens rea is the more important element. The intent to
commit the desired offence is a basic element of the offence
of attempt, and indeed, may be the sole criminal element in the offence given that an attempt may be complete without
completion of the offence intended.

[Page 227]

Clayton C. Ruby and
Michael Code, for the respondent.

The following are the reasons delivered by

RITCHIE J. (dissenting)—I am unable to distin­guish
this case from that of Lajoie v. The
Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 399, which is a unanimous judg­ment of this
Court and by which I feel bound.

I would therefore allow this appeal.

The judgment of Dickson, Beetz, Estey, McIn­tyre,
Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson JJ. was deliv­ered by

MCINTYRE J.—This appeal
involves consider­ation of the mental element required for proof of the crime
of attempted murder, the subject of this Court's earlier judgment in Lajoie v. The Queen, [1974] S.C.R. 399.

At the date of the events which give rise to this appeal the
respondent had been married some twenty-five years. His wife had left the
matrimoni­al home and was living with one Kurely. The respondent was depressed
and had been drinking to excess on the date in question. He telephoned his wife
at Kurely's residence and told her he was afraid that their twenty-three year
old son was about to commit suicide and asked her to meet him. She refused to
cooperate. Later the same evening the respondent broke into a friend's home
while its owners were absent and took away three shotguns. He sawed off the
barrel of one, loaded it, and taking some extra ammunition with him went to
Kurely's apartment building and gained entry by breaking the glass in the front
door. On hearing the noise caused by the breaking glass, Kurely came from his
bedroom to investigate, carrying a chair with a jacket hanging on it. He saw
the respondent, carrying the shotgun, ascending the stairs to the second floor.
He threw the chair and jacket, hitting the respondent. The gun went off. The
blast missed Kurely by some three feet but put a hole in the jacket which had
been on the chair. A struggle followed in which Kurely appears to have wrested
the gun from the respondent. When the police arrived, having been called during

[Page 228]

the course of the fight between the two men, Kurely was on the
floor with his head partly under a bed and with the respondent upon him
striking him weakly.

Shortly after his arrest the respondent stated to the police:

I just went over to see
my wife. I had phoned her earlier. I broke the window and went in. Then
I heard what sounded like a gun go off. You
are lucky you got there when you did.
I had him by the throat and I would have killed him.

According to the respondent's account of events,
the gun was discharged accidentally, although under tests conducted by the
police the weapon was not found to be prone to accidental discharge.

The respondent was charged with a number of
offences arising out of this affair but only one, that of attempted murder, is
involved in this appeal. It was contained in the first count of the information
and was in these terms:

... did attempt to murder Michael KURELY by discharging a sawed-off shotgun at him contrary to s.
222  of the Criminal Code  of Canada.

He elected trial by judge alone and was
convicted. The conviction was quashed in the Court of Appeal and a new trial
directed. This appeal is taken by leave of this Court.

The trial judge disposed of the other charges
against the respondent and made a finding that he had broken into Kurely's
apartment building with intent to use the shotgun to force his wife to leave.
He said:

I turn now to the very real point of the charge of attempted
murder, and having made the finding I have of the break and enter at the house
at 108 6th Street, with intent to commit an
indictable offence, wither [sic] forceable
confinement or worse. Forceable confinement if you accept the evidence
of the Accused, I feel prob­ably worse than that.

He then referred to s. 213 (d) of the Criminal Code  which
is in these terms:

[Page 229]

213. Culpable homicide is murder where a person causes the death of a human being while committing
or attempting to commit ... kidnapping
and forcible confinement ... breaking and entering ... whether or not
the person means to cause death to any human being and whether or not he knows
that death is likely to be caused to any human being, if

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon his
person

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit
the offence, or

(ii) during or at the time of his flight after committing or
attempting to commit the offence,

and the death ensues as a consequence.

Noting that breaking and entering with intent to
commit an indictable offence is one of the offences named in the section, he
convicted the respondent of attempted murder on the basis that the respond­ent
had carried and used a weapon in the course of a breaking and entry with intent
to effect forceable confinement of his wife.

The judgment of the Court of Appeal (MacKin­non
A.C.J.O., Dubin and Lacourcière JJ.A.) was written by MacKinnon A.C.J.O. He
accepted the submission by counsel for Ancio that the findings of fact which
formed the basis of the conviction were that the respondent committed the
offence of breaking and entering Kurely's residence and that he had in his
possession a weapon during the commission of the offence. He then considered
whether these findings of fact in the absence of any finding of an intent to
kill or cause bodily harm were sufficient to support a conviction for attempted
murder by the interaction of ss. 24(1)  and 213 (d) of the Criminal Code , and said:

There is no question in the instant appeal that the trial
judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant intended to
break and enter the Kurrelli [sic] premises and intended to have in his possession
the sawed-off shotgun. The appellant was charged with the offence of attempted murder and the
""offence"" referred to in s. 24(1)  is the offence of
""attempted murder"" and not the offence of break and enter while
carrying a weapon on his person. If death
had ensued in the instant case it would have been constructive murder,
but from

[Page 230]

the standpoint of an attempt, can there be an intention to
attempt an unintentional act without more?

and further:

In the law of attempts it is the mens rea which is fundamental and in the circumstances of this case
there must be the intention either to
mean to cause death or in the case of attempted murder, as now
established by R. v. Lajoie, meaning
to cause the victim bodily harm knowing it is likely to cause his death, and
reckless whether death ensues or not. The trial judge, according­ly in this
case, had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt (or a jury if one is
present) that the Crown has established the required intent under s. 212(a)(i)
or 212(a)(ii).

He then went on to hold that while there was
evidence before the trial judge from which he could have drawn the necessary
inferences regard­ing the intent to kill or cause bodily harm likely to cause
death, he had not done so, and as a result had not made the findings necessary
to support the conviction. Accordingly, the conviction was quashed and a new
trial was ordered.

The Crown contended in this Court that the Court of Appeal was in
error in holding that the mens rea in
attempted murder was limited to an intention to cause death (s. 212(a)(i)), or
an inten­tion to cause bodily harm knowing it to be likely to cause death and
being reckless whether death ensues (s. 212(a)(ii)).
The Crown's position was stated in its factum in these
words:

... the intention for attempted murder is not restricted to
an actual intention to kill or an intention to cause grievous bodily harm that
one knows is likely to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not,
but extends to an intention to do that
which constitutes the commission of the offence of murder as defined in
sections 212 and 213 of the Criminal Code. It is the Crown's position that
Section 24 and Section 213(d) in combination can form the basis for a
conviction of attempted murder. [Emphasis is mine.]

The respondent supported the judgment of the Court of Appeal
which followed the judgment of

[Page 231]

this Court in R. v. Lajoie, supra. In
that case it was held that a conviction for attempted murder could be sustained
where the Crown had shown on the part of the accused either an intent to kill
the potential victim or an intent to cause bodily harm which he knows is likely
to cause death and is reckless whether death ensues or not. Although reference
was made in Lajoie to the possibility of committing attempted murder as
defined in s. 213 (see concluding sentence on page 408), the respondent
and the Court of Appeal in the case at bar adopted the view that this was
merely obiter and MacKinnon A.C.J.O. disposed of the matter in these
words:

To interpret the quoted statement broadly
is not necessary to the decision in R. v. Lajoie. I do not read the judgment of the Court to
require us to give it the consequences I have recited. The essential
issue determined by R. v. Lajoie was that there can be a finding of an attempt to murder when it
is proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused meant to cause the victim
bodily harm which he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not.

The respondent submitted that the Crown's posi­tion,
that s. 213 (d) coupled with s. 24(1) 
described a further intent sufficient to warrant a
conviction for attempted murder, should not be accepted because there was no
authority to extend the con­cept of a constructive intent further than Lajoie
had taken it. While contending on the facts of this case that he was not
obliged to go further, he argued that in reason and logic a specific intent to
kill should be the only intent sufficient to ground a conviction for attempted
murder. It was said that the effect of the Crown's argument in extending the
concept of an attempt to s. 213 (d)
of the Criminal Code  would be to justify a
conviction for attempted murder in the absence of any mental element with
respect to the causing of death which would be to ignore the words of s. 24(1)  specifical­ly
requiring an intent to commit the offence in question.

[Page 232]

Lying at the heart
of the controversy which arises in this case is the judgment of this Court in Lajoie, supra. In that case the appellant shot a
taxi-driver while attempting a robbery. The victim was struck by a bullet while
fleeing the scene but did not die. The appellant was charged with vari­ous
offences, one of which was attempted murder. At trial the judge instructed the
jury that in order to convict the appellant upon the attempted murder charge
they had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that in shooting at the victim
the accused had the intent to kill him. He declined to act on the Crown's
request to charge the jury to the effect that, if they were not satisfied on
the question of the intent to kill, a conviction of attempted murder could also
rest upon proof of an intent to cause the appellant bodily harm, knowing it to
be likely to cause death and being reckless whether death ensued or not. The
appellant was found guilty of the lesser offence of discharging a firearm with
intent to endanger life.

On appeal the Crown
succeeded and a new trial was ordered. The majority, Branca J.A. and Nemetz
J.A. (as he then was) were of the view that the mental element or intent
required for an attempted murder was not limited to the intent to kill but
included as well those mental elements described in s. 212(a)(i) and (ii).
Branca J.A. said, at pp. 394-95 ([1971] 5 W.W.R. 385):

I am of opinion that in a charge of attempted murder, when the evidence discloses an intent to
commit murder as defined in the Code and the accused does or omits to do an
act for the purpose of carrying out that intention, he is
guilty of an attempt to commit that crime whether or not it was possible in the
circumstances to commit it. If
the evidence discloses any of the intentions referred to in ss. 201(a) (i) or 201(a)(ii)
or 201(c) or 202(a)(i)(ii) or
202(d)(i)(ii) the accused person may be found guilty of attempted murder.

Nemetz J.A. expressed agreement
with the reasons of Branca J.A. and after referring to certain of the

[Page 233]

authorities which have dealt
with this question concluded his reasons by saying, at p. 399:

It was ably argued by Mr. Lecovin, counsel for the
respondent, that the word ""attempt"" relates, in the first place, to
an endeavour to commit a crime, and accord­ingly there cannot be an attempt
unless the respondent was trying to commit the crime — in this case, to kill. I cannot accept this submission. I do not go so far as to suggest
that a trial judge must, in every case of attempted murder, charge on the
indirect intent found in s. 201(a)(ii). In some special set of circumstances it
may be inappropriate to charge on the indirect intent found in this subsection.
(I do not find it necessary, in this case, to consider subss. (b) and (c) of s.
201.)

However, upon the facts in this case I have
no doubt that the indirect intent described in s. 201(a)(ii) should have been
drawn to the jury's attention in order that the jurymen could consider whether,
in the circumstances, the accused meant to cause the victim bodily harm that
he, the accused, knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether death
ensued or not.

Taggart J.A. dissented. He
recognized that there was authority which would support the positions taken by
both parties to the appeal, and he dealt with the leading cases and reached the
conclusion that to obtain a conviction for attempted murder the Crown must
prove that the accused intended to kill the victim.

In the Supreme Court
of Canada the appeal was dismissed. Martland J. wrote the judgment of the Court
and after a brief statement of the facts stated the question in issue, at p. 401, in these words:

The question of law, which is in issue in this appeal, as a
result of the dissent of Taggart J.A. in the Court of Appeal, is as to whether
the learned trial judge should have directed the jury that the intent, which
must be established to support a charge of attempted murder, is proven if the
jury is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the appellant meant to cause
bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not. Branca J.A. and Nemetz J.A. were of the opinion that the
learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury in this way. Taggart
J.A. took the opposite view.

[Page 234]

He recognized that there was conflicting authority upon the
question, but he expressed agreement with the majority of the Court of
Appeal and he said, at p. 405:

Section 210 of the Code provides that every
one who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable
offence and is liable to imprisonment for life. Murder may be committed if the
accused means to cause death, but it may also be committed if he means to cause
bodily harm knowing that it is likely to cause death and is reckless whether
death ensues or not. If it can be established that the accused tried to cause
bodily harm to another of a kind which he knew was likely to cause death, and
that he was reckless as to whether or not death would ensue, then, under the
wording of s. 210, if death did not ensue an attempt to commit murder has been
proved.

He supported this conclusion by referring to the difference
between s. 264  of the Criminal Code  of
1927, which was in these terms:

264. Every one is guilty of an indictable
offence and liable to imprisonment for life, who, with intent to commit murder,

(a) administers any poison or other
destructive thing to any person, or causes any poison or destructive thing to
be so administered or taken, or attempts to administer it, or attempts to cause
it to be so administered or taken; or

(b) by any means whatever wounds or causes
any griev­ous bodily harm to any person; or

(c) shoots at any person, or, by drawing a
trigger or in any other manner, attempts to discharge at any person any kind of
loaded arms; or

(d) attempts to drown, suffocate, or strangle any person; or

(e) destroys or damages any building by the explosion of any
explosive substance; or

(f) sets fire to any ship or vessel or any part thereof, or
any part of the tackle, apparel or furniture thereof, or to any goods or
chattels being therein; or

(g) casts away or destroys any vessel; or

(f) by any other means attempts to commit murder. 

and s. 210 of the 1953-54 Code, now s. 222 :

[Page 235]

210. Every one who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable offence and is
liable to imprisonment for life.

He observed that s. 264  of the Criminal Code  in its opening sentence included the words
""who, with intent to commit murder"" and that these words were omitted
and replaced with ""who attempts … to commit murder"" in the revision
which resulted in the enactment of s. 210 . He concluded that
it was the presence of the words ""with intent to commit murder"" in
the former section 264  that led the court to conclude in R. v. Flannery, [1923] 3 W.W.R. 97, 40 C.C.C. 263, that only a specific
intent to kill would suffice to found a conviction for attempted murder and
that it was that intent which was considered to be essential by Lord Goddard in
Whybrow cited infra. In his view the omission of those
words in the enactment of s. 210  justified a construction of s. 24  which would
admit of a conviction for attempted murder without a specific intent to kill.

He then referred to the decision of this Court
in R. v. Trinneer, [1970] S.C.R. 638, which con­cerned the
application of s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code  and which involved consideration of the words ""the
commission of the offence"" as they appear in s. 21(2) . The relevance of
the Trinneer case was explained
on the basis that the Court had there decided that the words ""the
commission of the offence"" meant commission in any of the ways
contemplated by the Code and
not merely its commission in the form of an intentional killing. He said, at p.
408:

Similarly, in my opinion, when s. 24(1)  refers to ""an
intent to commit an offence"", in relation to murder it means an intention to commit that offence in any
of the ways provided for in the Code whether under s. 201 (now 212) or
under s. 202 (now 213).

There is no doubt that prior to this Court's judgment in Lajoie there was much uncertainty on
this issue caused by the differing views expressed by the courts on the matter.
In his dissenting reasons in Lajoie in
the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Taggart J.A. illustrated this point by
referring to many of the cases, including R. v.

[Page 236]

Flannery, supra;
R. v. Whybrow (1951), 35 Cr. App.
R. 141; R. v. Ménard, [1960] Que.
Q.B. 398n, 130 C.C.C.
242; Tousignant v. The Queen, [1960] Que.
Q.B. 767n, 130 C.C.C.
285, all of which supported his dissenting conclusion that the
specific intent to kill was required in order to justify a conviction on a
charge of attempted murder. He referred as well to R. v. Walker, [1963] Que.
Q.B. 578n, [1964] 2
C.C.C. 217; and R. v. Ritchie, [1970] 5 C.C.C. 336, which
adopted the other view and would support a conviction for attempted murder upon
proof of any of the intents specified in s. 212 
of the Criminal Code .

In R. v. Flannery Stuart
J.A., speaking for the Alberta Court of Appeal (Clarke J.A. dissented in part,
but on another point), held in a case involv­ing a charge of attempted murder
that the intent to kill must be shown to ground a conviction. The Crown had
argued that if the accused meant to cause bodily injury which he knew to be
likely to cause death, and was reckless whether it did or not, the necessary intent
for a conviction was present. This proposition was rejected and, at pp. 265-66, Stuart J. said:

The contention was that the accused evidently did intend to cause Mary Steele a bodily injury which
was known to him to be likely to cause death and was reckless whether
death ensued or not, and that, therefore,
there was evidence of an intent to murder, the act described in the section amounting to murder. But the fallacy of this reasoning is this, that it is
simply because the actual intent to
kill may be absent that sub-sec. (b) is thought necessary at all. If
that intent exists then clause (a) covers
the case. Parliament evidently thought that even though the actual
intent to kill might not be shown, yet if the offender intends to cause and
does cause an injury which be knows to be likely to cause death and doesn't care whether it does or not
and death actually results, the offence should be treated as murder. But where death has not in fact resulted
and the charge is of an intention to murder coupled with acts apparently done for the purpose of carrying out that intention, i.e., of an ""attempt"" to
murder, as is indicated in the
marginal words of the Cr. Code R.S.C. 1906, ch.

[Page 237]

146, then we are of opinion that the actual intent to kill
must be shown. In other words the accused is deprived of the benefit of an
absence of actual intent to kill only where he has actually killed and has
intended to do an injury which he knows is likely to kill and is reckless
whether it does so or not. Where, luckily for him, the injured person does not
die then we thought and so decided that the actual intent to kill must be
shown. The obscurity or difficulty probably arises from the use in sec. 264 of
the words ""intent to commit murder"" instead of the words ""intent
to cause death."" The word ""murder"" being used, which, by virtue
of sec. 259 covers a number of different sets of facts and is, therefore,
pregnant with legal significance, one is in danger of being led to include in
the meaning of the word as used in sec. 264  everything that is to be found in
the defini­tion of murder given in all the clauses of sec. 259. But if this
method of interpretation were followed then reading 259 and 264 together we
would have the expression ""with the
intention to mean to cause to a person (not killed in fact) an
injury which, &c.""

This was obviously not intended by Parliament and I think
the expression ""with intention to commit murder"" must refer to that
simple ordinary type of murder which is covered by clause (a) of sec. 259,
namely, where ""the offender means to cause the death of the person
killed.""

In Whybrow Lord Goddard, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal, in a
case where the trial judge had instructed the jury that:

If you are satisfied beyond all reasonable
doubt that on that evening of the 30th April he did connect up this wire in
such a way that it would pass the domestic supply in the skirting of the
bedroom along the wire to the socket in the cupboard, which in turn was
connected with the soap dish, and if you are further satisfied that in doing
that he intended to kill his wife or to do her grievous bodily harm, then he
would be guilty of attempted murder.

said, at p. 148:

There is no question that that was a misdirection, and the
jury should have been told that the essence of the offence was the intent to
murder as it was presented by the prosecution and as it had been dealt with
throughout the case.

[Page 238]

This case has frequently been cited as a concise statement of the
law of England on this point.

In Tousignant
the Quebec Court of Appeal followed their earlier judgment in Ménard and approved of the Whybrow decision. There were three
separate judgments written but all supported the proposition that an intent to
kill was a neces­sary element which must be shown by the Crown to procure a
conviction for attempted murder. The position taken by the court on this point
is summa­rized in the words of Hyde J., at p. 287:

All murder involves homicide and there can be no attempt to murder without an attempt to kill.
Basically, murder is committed when a person ""means to cause
death"" and does so (s. 201). By para. (c) of s. 201 the intent to cause death is replaced by the
commission of an act, for an unlawful
object, ""that he knows or ought to know is likely to cause
death"" so that when death occurs the
assailant is presumed to have intended it even though he may have desired ""to effect his
object without causing death or bodily harm to any human being"".
Without such express provision such a homicide, although culpable, would not
amount to murder.

R. v. Owens, [1970] 2 C.C.C. 38 (B.C.C.A.), supports the proposition that the
specific intent to kill must be shown in attempted murder, as does the English
case of R. v. Loughlin, [1959] Crim.
L.R. 518 (C.C.A.)

The opposing view to that expressed in the cases cited above
finds expression in R. v. Walker in
the Quebec Court of Appeal, R. v. Ritchie in
the Ontario Court of Appeal and, particularly, in Lajoie in this Court. In R.
v. Walker the accused was charged with attempted murder. He had been
the driver of the car in which his companions arrived at the scene of the crime
and attempted to make their escape after the commission of the robbery. In the
pursuit which followed one of the accused's companions fired several shots from
the moving car and wounded one of the pursuing officers. The appellant Walker
was charged with attempted murder. His guilt depended upon proof of a common
unlawful purpose under s. 21(2)  of the Criminal
Code . The trial judge directed the

[Page 239]

jury that to convict they would
have to find that the unlawful purpose which was shared by the accused was to
shoot some person. The court held (Rinfret J.A. dissenting) that if the accused
and his companions formed an intention in common to commit armed robbery and to
drive away with the proceeds they were all guilty as parties to any offence,
such as attempted murder committed by one of them, if he knew or should have
known that it would be a probable consequence of carrying out the intention. It
was therefore possible upon such a direction that a conviction for attempted
murder could be recorded without a specific intent to kill. Rinfret J.A. in a
dissenting opinion adopted the view expressed in Ménard and Tousignant
and concluded that the appeal should have been allowed, because the
specific intent to kill had not been demonstrated and accordingly a conviction
for attempted murder could not be made.

In R. v. Ritchie the
Ontario Court of Appeal (Schroeder, McGillivray and Evans JJ.A.) held that a
conviction of attempted murder would prop­erly be made if the jury were
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused meant to cause death and
was reckless whether death ensued or not. Schroeder J.A., who wrote the
judgment of the court, chose between the opposing lines of authority with these
words, at p. 343:

The trend in modern criminal law is towards the expansion of
the concept of mens rea to
include reckless­ness as well as intention, and that is clearly exemplified in
ss. 201  and 202  of the Criminal Code . It is not easy to discern the
logic which underlies the view that the mental element required for an attempt
is that of a direct intention to bring about the actus reus of the crime
intended. I adopt the opinion expressed in R. v. Walker, cited supra,
and R. v. McLennan, cited supra, in preference to the
opinions expressed in the other cases which have been cited. I am free to do so
since I am unaware of any Ontario decision in which the principle relied upon
by appellant's counsel was adopted and applied.

[Page 240]

A great deal of the confusion surrounding the nature of the
intent required to found a conviction for attempted murder may well stem from
an assumption that murder and attempted murder are related offences which must
share the same mental elements. A brief review of the historical development of
the law relating to the two offences demonstrates that the crime of attempt
developed as a separate and distinct offence from the offence of murder.

In very early times murder was simply the kill­ing
of a human being. The law was concerned with the injury done to the family of
the deceased and the compensation which should follow. The conse­quence of the
killing was the important feature and the intent or mens rea was of little if any significance. Special mental elements
were recog­nized in statutes as early as the thirteenth century, and by the
fourteenth century the concept of malice aforethought had developed (see 13
Rich­ard 2, Stat. 2, c. 1). Thus two elements came to be recognized in murder:
the killing, and the malice aforethought, which in modern times has come to
mean the necessary intent or intents.

As the common law developed, the mental ele­ment
required for the commission of murder expanded to include both constructive
intent and knowledge of the likelihood of death as a result of a person's acts,
with recklessness as to whether death ensued or not. Murder was thus defined in
the Criminal Code  when it was
enacted in 1892 in ss. 227  and 228  in these words:

227. Culpable homicide is murder in each of the following cases:

(a) If the offender means to cause the death of the person
killed;

(b) If the offender means to cause to the person killed any bodily injury which is known to the offender
to be likely to cause death, and is reckless whether death ensues or not;

(c) If the offender means to cause death or, being so reckless as aforesaid, means to cause such bodily
injury as aforesaid to one person,
and by accident or mistake kills another person, though he does not mean
to hurt the person killed;

[Page 241]

(d) If the offender, for any unlawful object, does an act
which he knows or ought to have known to be likely to cause death, and thereby
kills any person, though he may have desired that his object should be effected
without hurting any one.

228. Culpable homicide is also murder in
each of the following cases, whether the offender means or not death to ensue,
or knows or not that death is likely to ensue:

(a) If he means to inflict grievous bodily injury for the
purpose of facilitating the commission of any of the offences in this section
mentioned, or the flight of the offender upon the commission or attempted
commission thereof, and death ensues from such injury; or

(b) If he administers any stupefying or overpowering thing
for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from the effects
thereof; or

(c) If he by any means wilfully stops the breath of any
person for either of the purposes aforesaid, and death ensues from such
stopping of the breath.

2. The following are the offences in this section referred
to: —Treason and the other offences mentioned in Part IV. of this Act, piracy
and offences deemed to be piracy, escape or rescue from prison or lawful
custody, resisting lawful apprehension, murder, rape, forcible abduction,
robbery, burglary, arson.

In s. 228 as originally enacted there was no provi­sion
equivalent to s. 213(d) of the present Code. The
`use of weapon' provision was
enacted in 1947 in s. 7 of
an Act to Amend the Criminal
Code, 1947 (Can.), c. 55. Section 260 of
the 1927 Code was amended by
adding subs. (d):

(d) If he uses or has upon his person any
weapon during or at the time of the commission or attempted commission by him
of any of the offences in this section mentioned or the flight of the offender
upon the com­mission or attempted commission thereof, and death ensues as a
consequence of its use.

which provision
appears as s. 213 (d) in
the present Code in this form:

(d) he uses a weapon or has it upon his
person

(i) during or at the time he commits or attempts to commit
the offence, or

[Page 242]

(ii) during or at the time of his flight
after committing or attempting to commit the offence.

I would first observe that ss. 212 and 213 of
the present Criminal Code  prescribe
the various mental elements which, if accompanied by a kill­ing, may amount to
murder. It is trite to say then that murder may be a killing with intent to
kill and it may also be a killing with a variety of other intents which involve
no intent to kill.

The offence of attempts developed much later
than the offence of murder. In early times an attempt to commit an offence was
not itself a crime. It was considered that in the absence of a guilty act
intention alone was not punishable. The modern offence of attempting the
commission of a crime is said to have its origins in the Court of Star Chamber.
An early venture into this field is found in The Case of Duels (1615), 2 St. Tr. 1033, which involved
proceedings against one William Priest for sending a written challenge to duel
and one Richard Wright for carrying it and a stick that was to be the measure
of the length of the weapons to be employed. It was asserted by Sir Francis
Bacon, then Attorney General, at p. 1041, that:

For the Capacity of this Court, I take this
to be a ground infallible: that wheresoever
an offence is capital, or matter of felony, though it be not acted,
there the combination or practice tending to that offence is pun­ishable in this court as a high misdemeanor. So
practice to impoison, though it took no effect; waylaying to murder, though it took no effect; and the like;
have been adjudged heinous misdemeanors punishable in this court. Nay,
inceptions and preparations in inferior crimes,
that are not capital, as suborning and preparing of witnesses that were never deposed, or deposed nothing
material, have likewise been censured in this court, as appeareth by the decree
in Garnon's Case.

[Page 243]

The court in its
decree gave effect to the Attorney General's submission saying, in part, at p.
1046:

And the court with one consent did declare
their opin­ions: That by the ancient law of
the land, all inceptions, preparations, and combinations to execute
unlawful acts, though they never be performed, as they be not to be punished capitally, except it be in case of
treason, and some other particular cases of statute law, so yet they are punishable as misdemeanors and contemps: and
that this court was proper for offences of such nature.

The practice of the
Court of Star Chamber in this respect became
firmly established in that court (see Hall, General
Principles of Criminal Law (2nd ed., 1960), p. 565 et seq., and was in time adopted in the Court of
King's Bench. It has been said that the origin
of the doctrine of crimi­nal attempt as it is known in the common law was Lord
Mansfield's judgment in R. v. Scofield (1784), Cald. Mag. Rep. 397. Scofield
was charged in an indictment with ""wickedly,
unlaw­fully and maliciously intending devising and con­triving to feloniously
set fire to, burn and consume a certain house"". Lord Mansfield said, at p.
402-03:

The next question is, Whether an act done in pursu­ance of
an intent to commit an act, which, if compleat­ed, would be a misdemeanor only,
can itself be a misdemeanor? It was objected, that an attempt
to commit a misdeameanor was no offence: but no authority for this is cited;
and there are many on the other side: as the case cited; of The King v. Johnson, the King v. Sutton, which was an indictment
for having in custody and possession stamps with
intent to impress septres on sixpences, etc. And
there the court say ""lading wool is lawful, but, if it be with an intent to transport it, that makes it
an offence. Here the intent is the offence; and the having in his custody, an
act that is the evidence of that intent."" But in the case of the wool, the
transport­ing of it was only a misdemeanor,
yet an act done to that end was held indictable. In the King v. Taylor, the Court granted an
information as for a nuisance for keeping great quantities of gunpowder to the
endanger­ing of the church and houses where
the defendant lived. There is also the case cited of the King v. Samuel Vaughan, which is founded
upon the same principle as that of the King v.
Plympton; where it was holden that to bribe a
corporator by money or promises to vote at

[Page 244]

corporation elections is an offence, for
which an infor­mation will lie: the case of
Vaughan was that of offering a bribe
for an office, and if received, and the office procured, neither party would
have been guilty of more than a misdemeanor:
and it is laid down by the Court in the case of the King v. Langley that words directly
tending to a breach of the peace, are indictable.

There was a distinction made at the bar between an act done
with an intent to commit a felony and an act done with an intent to commit a
misdemeanor. In the degrees of guilt there is
great difference in the eye of the law,
but not in the description of the offence. So long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not
punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law
judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and,
if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself
would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes
criminal and punishable. The case cited of the King v. Sutton is an express authority. We are therefore of
opinion that the indictment is good.

Whether Scofield was the starting point for the common law doctrine is doubted by Hall (op.
cit., pp. 569-70) but
the question seems to have been settled in R. v. Higgins (1801), 2 East 5, 102 E.R. 269, where it was said, at E.R. 274, by Grose J.:

First, as to the offence
itself, it must be admitted that an attempt to commit a felony is in
many cases at least a misdemeanor;

Any doubt remaining regarding
the existence of the offence of attempted murder in England was set to rest by the
enactment in 1861 of 24 and
25 Victoria, c. 100, ss. 11-15. These sections made it a felony to
attempt the commission of murder in the various ways described.

[Page 245]

In Canada the common law
offence of attempt was codified in the 1892 Criminal Code  as s. 64  which
appeared in these terms:

64. Every one who, having an intent to
commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accom­plishing his
object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence
intended whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such
offence or not.

2. The question whether an act done or
omitted with intent to commit an offence is or is not only preparation for the
commission of that offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to commit
it, is a question of law.

A minor amendment in 1953-54
(Can.), c. 51, changed
the section to its present form in s. 24:

24. (1) Every one who,
having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits to do anything for
the purpose of carrying out his intention is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence whether or not it was possible
under the circumstances to commit the offence.

(2) The question whether an act or omission
by a person who has an intent to commit an offence is or is not mere
preparation to commit the offence, and too remote to constitute an attempt to
commit the offence, is a question of law.

The section has therefore
covered the law of attempt in general since the codification of the
law in 1892. In addition, particular provision has been made in the Criminal Code  for the offence of attempted murder. In the 1892 Code, s. 232 provided:

232. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to imprisonment for life, who does any of the following
things with intent to commit murder; that is to say—

(a.) administers any poison or other destructive thing to
any person, or causes any such poison or destructive thing to be so
administered or taken, or attempts to administer it, or attempts to cause it to
be so adminis­tered or taken; or

(b.) by any means whatever wounds or causes any grievous
bodily harm to any person; or

(c.) shoots at any person, or, by drawing a trigger or in
any other manner, attempts to discharge at any person any kind of loaded arms;
or

[Page 246]

(d.) attempts
to drown, suffocate, or strangle any person; or

(e.) destroys or damages any building by the explosion of
any explosive substance; or

(f.) sets fire to any ship or vessel or any part thereof, or
any part of the tackle, apparel or furniture thereof, or to any goods or
chattels being therein; or

(g.) casts away or destroys any vessel; or

(h.) by any other means attempts to commit murder. In the
1906 and 1927 Codes s. 264 provided :

264. Every one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
to imprisonment for life, who, with intent to commit murder,

(a) administers any poison or other destructive thing to any
person, or causes any poison or destructive thing to be so administered or
taken, or attempts to administer it, or attempts to cause it to be so
administered or taken; or

(b) by any means whatever wounds or causes any grievous
bodily harm to any person; or

(c) shoots at any person, or, by drawing a trigger or in any
other manner, attempts to discharge at any person any kind of loaded arms; or

(d) attempts
to drown, suffocate, or strangle any person; or

(e) destroys or damages any building by the explo­sion of
any explosive substance; or

(f) sets fire to any ship or vessel or any part of the
tackle, apparel or furniture thereof, or to any goods or chattels being
therein; or

(g) casts away or destroys any vessel; or

(h) by any other means attempts to commit murder.

And in the 1953-54 Code, s. 210 dealt with the matter in these words:

210. Everyone who attempts by any means to commit murder is
guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for life.

This section appears as s. 222  in
the present Code. (I have been greatly assisted in this review by the
very helpful summary of the subject written by

[Page 247]

Laidlaw J.A. in R. v. Cline (1956), 115 C.C.C.
18.)

It is clear from the
foregoing that in common law and under the criminal law of Canada crimi­nal
attempt is itself an offence separate and dis­tinct from the crime alleged to
be attempted. As with any other crime, the Crown must prove a mens rea, that is, the intent to commit the offence in
question and the actus
reus, that is, some
step towards the commission of the offence attempted going beyond mere acts of
preparation. Of the two elements the more significant is the mens rea. In R. v. Cline, supra, Laidlaw J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, said, at p. 27:

Criminal intention alone is insufficient to establish a criminal attempt. There must be mens rea and also an act us reus. But it is to be observed that whereas in most crimes it is the actus reus which
the law endeavours to prevent, and the mens rea is only a necessary
element of the offence, in a criminal attempt
the mens rea is of primary importance and the actus
reus is the necessary element.

and in Russell on Crime (12th ed.), vol. 1, p. 175, it is said:

Since the mischief contained in an attempt depends upon the
nature of the crime intended, the criminality lies much more in the intention
than in the acts done.

This proposition was
accepted by Lord Goddard in Whybrow, supra, at
p. 147, where he stated that ""the intent becomes the principal ingredient
of the crime"".

The common law recognition of
the fundamen­tal importance of intent in the crime of attempt is carried
forward into the Criminal Code . A reading of s. 24 of the Code and
all its predecessors since the enactment of the first Code in
1892 confirms that the intent to commit the desired offence is a basic element
of the offence of attempt. Indeed, because the crime of attempt may be complete
without the actual commission of any other offence and even without the
performance of any act unlawful in itself, it is abundantly clear that

[Page 248]

the criminal element
of the offence of attempt may lie solely in the intent. As noted by Glanville
Williams, Criminal Law; The General Part (2nd ed., 1961), part 207, p. 642, in discussing
attempts:

An actus reus ... need not be a crime apart from the state of mind. It need not even be a tort or a moral wrong, or a social mischief.

The question now arises: What
is the intent required for an attempt to commit murder? As has been indicated
earlier, the Crown's position is that the intent required for a conviction on a
charge of attempt to murder is the intent to do that which will, if death is
caused, constitute the commission of murder as defined in ss. 212 and 213 of
the Code, so that a combination
of ss. 24  and 213 (d) can form the basis for a conviction of attempted murder.
The respondent, on the other hand, argues that although the authorities
presently limit the intent to that which would constitute murder as defined in
s. 212 of the Code, logic and principle dictate that the intent should
be limited to the specific intent to kill described in s. 212 (a)(i).

While it is clear from ss. 212  and
213  of the Criminal Code 
that an unintentional killing can be
murder, it is equally clear that whatever mental elements may be involved and
whatever means may be employed there cannot be a murder without a killing. Section 24 of the Code defines,
in part, the offence of attempt as ""having an intent to commit an
offence"". As Estey J. observed in R. v. Quinton, [1947] S.C.R. 234, at pp. 235-36, in referring to
the then s. 72  (now s. 24 ):

This section requires that one to be guilty
of an attempt must intend to commit the
completed offence and to have done some act toward the accomplishment of
that objective.

The completed offence of murder
involves a kill­ing. The intention to commit the complete offence

[Page 249]

of murder must
therefore include an intention to kill. I find it impossible to conclude that a
person may intend to commit the unintentional killings described in ss. 212 and
213 of the Code. I am then of the view that the mens rea for an
attempted murder cannot be less than the specific intent to kill.

As I have said
earlier, there is a division of opinion upon this point and strong arguments
have been raised in favour of the Crown's position that a ""lesser
intent"", such as that provided in s. 212 (a)(ii) or even no intent at all
relating to the causing of death as provided in s. 213 (d), may suffice
to found a conviction for attempted murder. This view is supported in Lajoie. In
my view, with the utmost respect for those who differ, the sections of the Criminal
Code  relied on in that case do not support that position.

As noted above,
Martland J.'s analysis of the intent required to found a conviction for
attempted murder is based primarily on the change in word­ing of s. 222. In
my opinion, emphasis on the amendment of this section is unwarranted for two
reasons. Firstly, s. 222 does not define or create the offence of
attempted murder. The scheme of the Criminal Code  in relation to
attempts has been the same from its inception. One section defines the offence
of attempts generally (s. 72 , now s. 24 ). Another sets out the penalties
for attempts (s. 57 , now s. 421 ), and a third creates a separate penalty for
attempted murder (s. 264 , s. 210  in Lajoie, now s. 222 ). Rather
than defining or creat­ing an offence, s. 222  merely fixes a penalty for
a specific attempt. Despite the categorization of the various means of
committing murder set out in the old s. 264 , there is no essential
difference between the old and the new sections in this respect.

Secondly, the
elimination of the words ""with intent to commit murder"" from s. 264
is not

[Page 250]

significant, Section
24 defines an attempt as ""hav­ing an intent to commit an offence"".
Because s. 24 is a general section it is necessary to `read in' the offence in
question. The offence of attempted murder then is defined as ""having an
intent to commit murder"". This does not differ from the old s. 264
reference to ""with intent to commit murder"", which Martland J.
acknowledged was inter­preted, in R. v.
Flannery, to require
the specific intent to kill.

Martland J. placed
further emphasis on s. 222  of the Criminal Code  by relying on the words ""attempts by any means"" to support his
conclusion that murder may be attempted in any of the ""ways"" set out
in ss. 212  and 213 . In my view, the reference to ""any means"" in s.
222  refers to ways in which a murder could be accomplished, such as by
poisoning, shooting, or stabbing. The earlier version of s. 222  (s. 232  in
1892, s. 264  in 1906) listed the various methods by which a killing could be
effected, but the illustrations were replaced in the 1953-54 revision with a
general reference to murder ""by any means"". In any event, ss. 212  and
213  have nothing to do with the means of killing. They are concerned solely
with describing the mental elements which will suffice to make a completed
killing murder. The fact that certain mental elements, other than an intent to
kill, may lead to a conviction for murder where there has been a killing does
not mean that anything less than an intent to kill will suffice for an attempt
at murder.

It was argued, and
it has been suggested in some of the cases and academic writings on the
question, that it is illogical to insist upon a higher degree of mens rea for attempted murder, while accepting a lower
degree amounting to recklessness for murder. I see no merit in this argument.
The intent to kill is the highest intent in murder and

[Page 251]

there is no reason
in logic why an attempt to murder, aimed at the completion of the full crime of
murder, should have any lesser intent. If there is any illogic in this matter,
it is in the statutory characterization of unintentional killing as murder. The
mens rea for attempted murder is, in my view, the specific intent to
kill. A mental state falling short of that level may well lead to convic­tion
for other offences, for example, one or other of the various aggravated
assaults, but not to a conviction for an attempt at murder. For these reasons,
it is my view that Lajoie should no longer be followed.

I would accordingly
dismiss the Crown's appeal and confirm the Court of Appeal's order for a new
trial.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Transferred
intent—Murder—Accused failed to kill intended victim but mistakenly killed two
others—Jury charged that accused liable to conviction for first degree
murder—Whether or not jury properly charged—Whether or not “planned and
deliberate” in s. 214 relates to intended or actual victims—Criminal Code,
R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, ss. 205, 212(b), 214(2).

Appellant had planned to kill his wife but in
carrying out his plan killed his two young children instead. The trial judge
charged the jury that appellant could be convicted of the first degree murder
of his children if the jury were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
appellant had planned to kill his wife. The issue here is whether the Ontario
Court of Appeal erred in law in holding that the trial judge had correctly
charged the jury.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Ritchie,
Dickson, Estey, Mclntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: Planning and deliberation
with the relation to the killing of a specific person makes the offence first
degree murder when in the course of carrying out the plan the accused in fact
kills someone else.

The question of liability for first degree
murder is one of statutory interpretation and does not depend on the doctrine
of “transferred intent”. Section 214(2) does not create a separate substantive
offence of first degree murder; it classifies for sentencing purposes the
substantive offence of murder as defined by ss. 212 and 213. Under s. 212(b)
it is murder when a person, meaning to cause the death of a human being, by
accident or mistake causes the death of another human being. Section 214(2)
classifies as first degree, a murder committed in any of the relevant ways
specified in the Code, if that murder was planned and deliberate. The
element of

[Page 209]

planning and deliberation required by s.
214(2) relates to the specific mens rea of the applicable section—in the
present case, under s. 212(b), to the intention to cause death to the
wife. When s. 214(2) is combined with s. 212(b) the identity and
character of any victim is entirely irrelevant. This conclusion also accords
with the policy rationale underlying s. 214(2) which imposes a harsher
penalty because of the added moral culpability to a murder that is planned and
deliberate. This added culpability relates to planning and deliberation with
regard to the taking of a human life and not with regard to the identity of the
victim.

Per Wilson J.:
Murder is in the first degree when “it” is planned and deliberate. Under s.
212(b) an intent to murder one person is sufficient mens rea if,
by accident or mistake, the accused kills another. Planning and deliberating
the murder of the intended victim and killing by accident or mistake another
person is therefore sufficient to make the killing of the unintended victim
planned and deliberate.

(2d) 220, applied; R. v. Gross (1913), 23 Cox C.C. 455, referred to; Ancio

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 588, 63 C.C.C. (2d) 418, dismissing an appeal
from convictions of two counts of first degree murder pronounced by Callaghan
J. Appeal dismissed.

Gerald Kluwak, for the appellant.

David Watt, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of Ritchie, Dickson, Estey,
Mclntyre, Chouinard and Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—Murder is first degree murder when it
is planned and deliberate. The appellant Rolf Arthur Droste planned, and
deliberated upon, the killing of his wife. In the course of carrying out that
plan he caused the death of his two young children, Rolf Maurice Droste and
Monique Jean Droste. His wife survived. The case is here by leave of this Court
upon the following question:

[Page 210]

Did the Court of Appeal for the Province of
Ontario err in law in holding that the learned trial Judge had correctly
charged the jury that, if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the Appellant herein had planned and deliberated to kill his wife, then he
could be convicted of the first degree murder of his children, Rolf Maurice
Droste and Monique Jean Droste.

I The Facts

Mr. Droste, his wife and two children were
invited to a birthday party at the house of friends. The morning of the day
upon which the party was to be held Mr. Droste went to a gas station. He filled
the gas tank of the car. At the same time he filled five gallon container with
gasoline. Later, he cleaned the back seat of the car using gas from the five
gallon container. He testified that the seat was oily, some snowmobile parts
having been placed on it at an earlier date. He reactivated the seat belts in
the rear seat of the vehicle. Shortly after noon Mr. Droste, his wife and
the children left for the party; the children were strapped in the back seat by
the seat belts. Mrs. Droste noticed the smell of gasoline when she entered the
vehicle. En route, as the vehicle was approaching a bridge, flames began
to shoot up between the two front seats. Mr. Droste attempted to extinguish
them with his right hand. Mrs. Droste testified that her husband then took
a screwdriver from under his seat and began hitting her on the left side of the
head, at the same time yelling at her to let go the steering wheel. The vehicle
crashed into the bridge abutment. Mr. Droste fell forward on the steering wheel
and was temporarily incapacitated. Mrs. Droste got out through the door on the
driver’s side as the passenger door would not open; she helped her husband out
of the vehicle. Mr. and Mrs. Droste tried to get the children out of the
back seat of the car but were unable to do so. The children died from asphyxia
due to smoke inhalation.

Crown evidence was to the effect that four
gallons of gasoline had been used out of the five gallon container found in the
trunk of the car. In the opinion of the Crown’s experts the fire did not

[Page 211]

start in the engine; it was caused by an
accelerant used in the interior of the vehicle.

The Crown adduced other damning evidence. A
co-worker of Mr. Droste testified that Droste had been telling him of various
plans to kill Mrs. Droste. The final plan involved crashing a motor vehicle
into a tree, starting a fire inside the vehicle and leaving Mrs. Droste to die.
Other co-workers gave evidence that Droste told them he was going to kill his
wife. There was evidence that Mr. Droste was sexually involved with a married
woman at the time of the occurrence and that he desired to collect the proceeds
of an insurance policy recently placed on the life of Mrs. Droste.

Mr. Droste was indicted on two charges, namely,
first degree murder of each child. The trial judge instructed the jury that if
they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Droste had planned and
deliberated to kill his wife, then he could be convicted of the first degree
murder of his children.

In the absence of the jury he explained to
counsel the basis of his charge:

I am relying primarily on the wording of
214(2). There is no reference therein which would restrict the applicability to
the intended victim, and I realize it is arguable, but it seems to me if a
murder is established under 212(b) the planning and deliberation may relate to
the murder of an intended victim whereas the actus rea [sic] relates
to the unintended victim, otherwise you would never have first degree murder in
circumstances where all the components are proven with reference to A and the
unintended victim B, is killed.

I am also of the view that this approach is
consistent with the doctrine of transferred malice as outlined in Glanville
Williams; The Criminal Law, the General part 2nd Edition, pages 125 to 137. It
is a difficult problem and I appreciate the submission, but in putting the
charge together I concluded that the element of planning and deliberation could
be in relation to an intended victim when the charge was laid under 212(b).

[Page 212]

The jury returned a verdict of guilty on each
charge. Mr. Droste appealed and the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the trial judge had
correctly charged the jury. The sole question in this appeal is whether the
Court of Appeal was correct in so holding.

II The Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario

Martin J.A. delivered judgment for a
unanimous Court. After reciting the facts, he referred to the submission of
counsel for Mr. Droste, renewed in this Court, that a conviction for first
degree murder cannot be supported on the basis that the accused planned and
deliberated the killing of his wife and by accident or mistake caused the death
of his children; that ss. 212 (b) and 214(2)  of the Criminal Code  cannot
be combined to found a conviction for first degree murder and that the trial
judge had erred in failing so to instruct the jury. Counsel contended that the
death of the victim must be planned and deliberate.

Section 212 (b) reads:

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

…

(b) where a person, meaning to cause
death to a human being or meaning to cause him bodily harm that he knows is
likely to cause his death, and being reckless whether death ensues or not, by
accident or mistake causes death to another human being, notwithstanding that
he does not mean to cause death or bodily harm to that human being;…

Section 214(2)  reads:

214. …

(2) Murder is first degree murder when it is
planned and deliberate.

The conclusion of the Court of Appeal on the
point under discussion will be found in the following passage:

We think that the trial judge correctly
instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the appellant’s intention to kill his wife was planned and deliberate and that
in the course of the

[Page 213]

carrying out that intention he caused the
death of the children by accident or mistake, that the resulting murder
constituted first degree murder.

Section 214(2)  provides that “murder” is
first degree murder when “it” is planned and deliberate. Where murder as
defined by s. 212 (b) is committed and that murder is planned and deliberate the
murder is first degree murder even though the planned and deliberate intention
to kill took effect on a person other than the intended victim.

The Court considered the law to be correctly
stated by Professor Mewett in the following passage from an article entitled First
Degree Murder (1978-79), 21 Crim. L.Q. 82, at p. 83:

Section 212 (b) does not seem to
cause problems, at least where it applies by virtue of meaning to cause someone
else’s death. Since it is the murder that has to be planned and deliberate and
since the effect of s. 212 (b) is merely to enact that an intent to
murder A is sufficient mens rea if by accident or mistake, the accused
kills B, then it would seem that planning and deliberating the murder of A and
by accident or mistake killing B would make the “murder” of B (for so it is
defined in s. 212 (b)) planned and deliberate.

The Court continued:

We are also of the view that the
transferrence of a planned and deliberate intention to kill one person to the
actual victim is in accord with the general principles of the criminal law.
Clearly, the moral culpability of one who intends to kill one person, preceded
by planning and deliberation, but who by accident or mistake kills another
person, is the same as if he had succeeded in killing his intended victim. As
Rothman, J., said in Charest v. Beaudoin J.S.P. (1980), 18 C.R. (3d) 58
at 62-3:

An accused may deliberate for months,
weighing the advantages and consequences of killing his intended victim, “A”.
He may do a great deal of planning: recruiting an accomplice, selecting a
weapon, keeping “A” under surveillance and finally choosing his moment to do
the killing. If by some mischance—poor marksmanship or the sudden emergence of
another person—he kills “B” instead of “A”, surely his planning and
deliberation is no less than it would have been if he had killed “A”. All of
the same ingredients of planning and deliberation remain unchanged. The only
change is in the identity of the person whose

[Page 214]

death is caused, and this, it seems to me, is
entirely irrelevant to the question of whether the murder was planned and
deliberate.

Any other conclusion would, in my opinion,
be logically ludicrous and absurd in its consequences. Parliament could hardly
have intended to punish premeditated murder less severely where an accused
kills a perfect stranger than it would otherwise punish an accused for the same
premeditation if he had managed to kill his intended victim.

In short I conclude that a murder that is
planned and deliberate does not cease to be planned and deliberate because a
mistake is made in the victim. In my opinion, s. 214(2)  is applicable to
murders committed under s. 212 (b).

Finally, the Court cited R. v. Gross (1913),
23 Cox C.C. 455. In that case Darling J. referred to the legal principle “laid
down over and over again” that if a person feloniously fires at another in such
circumstances as could make the killing of that person murder, but by accident
hits and kills a third person whom he never intended to hit at all, that is
murder. Darling J. went on to say that if the firing at the person intended to be
hit would be manslaughter (as, for example, provocation operating on the mind
of the accused), then, if the bullet strikes a third person who is not intended
to be hit, the killing of that person equally would be manslaughter and not
murder. Martin J.A. in the present case concluded, by a parity of reasoning,
that an intention which is aggravated by the fact that it is planned and
deliberate is transferred from the contemplated victim to the actual victim.

III The Argument of Counsel for the Appellant

Counsel submits that, as it is the murder
which must be planned and deliberate, the elements of “planning and
deliberation” stated in s. 214(2)  must be with respect to all the components
charged in the indictment, and found to have been committed. He further submits
that a murder cannot be planned and deliberate where the person who committed
the offence did not intend to cause the death of, or to cause grievous bodily
harm to, the victim.

Counsel argues that the Criminal Code  creates
a step-by-step procedure to be followed in deter-

[Page 215]

mining whether a homicide offence has been
committed: the determination of whether a murder is “planned and deliberate”
only occurs after it has been determined that what has been committed is
a murder and it is only the murder that has actually been committed which can
be planned and deliberate according to s. 214(2) .

In a subsidiary submission counsel says that the
interpretation placed upon s. 214(2)  by the Ontario Court of Appeal results in
transferring the planning and deliberation directed towards the wife of the
appellant (the intended victim) to the children of the appellant (the actual
victims) and this interpretation is not in accord with the doctrine of
transferred intent as stated by the common law, nor by the rules of statutory
interpretation in determining the application of this doctrine to s. 214(2) .

The nub of the argument is this. Mr. Droste was
not charged with murder in the abstract; he was charged and convicted of
murdering his children. The killing of the children was neither planned nor
deliberate. Section 214(2)  requires, as a matter of law, that the planning and
deliberation relate to or fasten on the victim whose death is actually caused.
A killing that is by definition accidental (s. 212 (b)) cannot be, at the
same time, deliberate.

In my view this submission involves misplaced
analogies to the doctrine of transferred intent and a misreading of the
statutory scheme of the Criminal Code  with regard to homicide, and is,
as well, incompatible with the policy considerations obviously underlying s.
214(2) .

IV Transferred Intent

Much of the appellant’s argument recalls the
controversy surrounding the English common law concept of “transferred malice”
or, more precisely, “transferred intent”. Professor Glanville Williams Criminal
Law, The General Part (2nd ed.), at p. 126, describes the operation of this
concept as follows:

Transferred intention (transferred malice)
occurs when an injury intended for one falls on another by

[Page 216]

accident. In other words, if the defendant
intends a particular consequence, he is guilty of a crime of intention even
though his act takes effect upon an object (whether person or property) that
was not intended. His “malice” (i.e. his intention) is by a legal
fiction transferred from the one object to the other. The defendant is then
treated for legal purposes as though he had intended to hit the object that he
did hit, though in fact he did not have the intent, nor even was reckless as to
it.

The authors of Smith and Hogan, Criminal Law (4th
ed.), formulate the doctrine in these terms at p. 59:

If D, with the mens rea of a
particular crime, does an act which causes the actus reus of
the same crime, he is guilty, even though the result, in some respects, is an
unintended one.

The essence of the dispute as to the rationality
of the doctrine of “transferred intent” is latent in these constrasting
formulations.

The literature on transferred intent
distinguishes between two kinds of situations in which the “wrong victim”
suffers harm at the hands of the accused. The first, sometimes called error
in objecto involves a mistake by the perpetrator as to the identity of the
victim. A gunman aims at and shoots a pedestrian on the street; the assailant
thought the pedestrian was X, but in fact he is Y. There is little controversy
that this sort of mistake as to the identity of the victim in no way affects
the fact that the perpetrator has committed an intentional crime. It is the
second “wrong victim” situation, sometimes called aberratio ictus, or
more poetically, “a mistake of the bullet” that has led to the controversy
surrounding the doctrine of transferred intent. In this second situation the
perpetrator aims at X but by chance or lack of skill hits Y. The
appropriateness of assessing criminal liability as though the bullet had found
its intended mark depends heavily upon one’s evaluation of the importance of
the identity of the victim as an element of the offence in question. The
authors of Smith and Hogan Criminal Law, supra, at pp. 60-61 present
Professor Williams’ critique of the doctrine as applied to murder, and their
response, as follows:

[Page 217]

Williams regards the doctrine of
transferred malice as a “rather arbitrary exception to normal principles”. He
rejects the argument that “the result is not unintended, for the
intention was to kill, and the result is a killing”. He writes:

“This argument. sounds plausible only
because part of the real intention is omitted. Although the result in the sense
of a killing was intended, the result in the sense of a killing of P was not
intended. After all the accused is not indicted for killing in the abstract; he
is indicted for killing P; and it should therefore, on a strict view, be
necessary to establish mens rea in relation to the killing of P.”

The answer to this, it is submitted, is
that D’s act is unintentional only in a respect which is immaterial. The test
of materiality in a difference of result is whether it affects the existence of
the actus reus
which D intended. Thus it would be immaterial that
D intended to shoot P in the heart but, because of a quite unexpected movement
by P, shot him (unintentionally) in the head. The actus reus of
murder is the killing of a human being—any human being—under the Queen’s
Peace, and his identity is irrelevant.

In Canada, liability for the killing of an “unintended victim” is not the
result of the operation of the doctrine of transferred intent. It is the result
of the explicit terms of s. 212 (b) which, it will be recalled, provides:

212.
Culpable homicide is murder

…

(b) where a person, meaning to
cause death to a human being or meaning to cause him bodily harm that he
knows is likely to cause his death, and being reckless whether death ensues or
not, by accident or mistake causes death to another human being,
notwithstanding that he does not mean to cause death or bodily harm to that
human being;. [Emphasis added]

It will be noted that the wording of this
section imposes liability for murder both in situations of error in
objecto (mistake) and in situations of aberratio ictus (accident).
The jury found that Mr. Droste, meaning to cause the death of a human
being (Mrs. Droste) by accident caused the death of another human being (each
of the children). He is therefore guilty of murder pursuant to s. 212 (b)
and the debate between Professor Wil-

[Page 218]

liams and Professors Smith and Hogan can have no
relevance to this finding. The next question is whether, as counsel contends,
it can have relevance to the issue of whether Mr. Droste is guilty of
first degree murder.

The majority decision of this Court in Ancio
v. The Queen, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 25, released concurrently herewith,
illustrates the proposition that where the Criminal Code  creates a
separate substantive offence related to murder, it is the mens rea for
that separate offence and not necessarily the mental states enumerated in ss.
212  and 213  that determines liability. For attempted murder, the requisite mens
rea is an intention to kill. A lesser intention, even if sufficient to
impose liability for murder if death does result, will not suffice to impose
liability for attempted murder if death does not ensue. It might appear
possible to argue by parity of reasoning that s. 214(2)  creates the separate
substantive offence of first degree murder and that part of the mens rea for
this offence is planning and deliberation with regard to the identity of the
victim. If this analogy to the reasoning in Ancio were correct, then in
order to establish Mr. Droste’s liability for first degree murder the Crown would
have to demonstrate planning and deliberation in relation to the deaths of the
children. In the event, however, this analogy is not correct. Even if s. 214(2) 
did create a separate substantive offence of first degree murder—which it does
not—I would incline to Professors Smith and Hogan’s analysis and to the
conclusion of Martin J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal that the identity of
the victim would not be an essential element of such an offence. Such
speculation is, however, unnecessary since this Court’s decision in R. v.
Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 24, does make it clear that s. 214  does not create
a separate substantive offence of first degree murder, but rather constitutes a
characterization, for purposes of sentencing, of the substantive offence of murder
as outlined in the various parts of ss. 212  and 213 . There is therefore no
possibility of a distinct mens rea for first degree murder nor can there
be a question of transferring any such intent from the planned to the actual
victim. The issue of whether what Mr. Droste was found to have done consti-

[Page 219]

tutes first degree murder affords no parallel to
the issue in Ancio, nor does it depend on the applicability or
appropriateness of the doctrine of transferred intent. It is a relatively
straightforward issue of statutory interpretation.

V Statutory Interpretation

The appellant’s argument depends in large
measure on the purported contradiction in the notion “planning and
deliberating” upon an “unintentional” killing. This conceptualization of what
underlies finding Mr. Droste guilty of first degree murder does not accord with
the scheme of the Criminal Code  with regard to homicide.

According to s. 205 of the Code, a person
commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, by any means, he causes the death
of a human being. Mr. Droste committed homicide by causing the death of his
children. Homicide is culpable or not culpable. Culpable homicide is murder or
manslaughter or infanticide. As outlined earlier, s. 212 (b), when
stripped of non‑essentials, provides that culpable homicide is murder
where a person (Mr. Droste), meaning to cause death of a human being (Mrs.
Droste), by accident causes death to another human being (each of his
children), notwithstanding that he does not mean to cause death or bodily harm
to that human being. For purposes of the Criminal Code , then, what Mr.
Droste did was not “unintentional”. The argument of the appellant, as I
understand it, would truncate s. 212 (b) by writing one of its vital
components out of the section. Mr. Droste was not charged with the accidental
killing of his children. He was charged with meaning to cause the death of Mrs.
Droste and by accident or mistake causing the death of the children. Causing
death by accident normally results in acquittal or, at most, a conviction for
manslaughter. When such a killing is accompanied by an intention to cause death
to another human being s. 212 (b) dictates that the homicide is not
manslaughter but murder, i.e. intentional killing.

[Page 220]

There is no question that on the jury’s findings
Mr. Droste is guilty of murder under s. 212 (b). Is he, pursuant to s.
214(2) , guilty of first degree murder? Subsections (1), (2) and (7) of
s. 214 provide sequentially that (a) murder is first degree or second
degree murder; (b) murder is first degree murder when it is planned and
deliberate; (c) all murder that is not first degree murder is second degree
murder. The appellant’s submissions appear to require treating ss. 212 (b)
and 214(2)  as describing different substantive offences embodying different
mental elements. “Planning and deliberation” would thus become part of the
mental element for the substantive offence under s. 214(2) , an element which,
on the appellant’s submission, would have to be proven with regard to the
actual killing committed, i.e. the killing of the children.

The majority judgment of this Court in R. v.
Farrant, supra, makes it impossible for the appellant to succeed on this
argument. On pages 140-42 of that judgment the following passages appear:

Section 214, however, is not the section
which sets out the elements of the offence of murder. This is done in ss. 212 
and 213 . Section 214 does not create a distinct and independent substantive
offence of first degree constructive murder pursuant to forcible confinement.
The section is subservient to ss. 212  and 213 ; it classifies for sentencing
purposes, the offences in s. 212  and 213  as either first or second degree
murder. The importance of the distinction between first and second degree
murder is that first degree murder carries with it a mandatory life sentence
without eligibility for parole for twenty‑five years (s. 218, s. 669(a)).
A conviction for second degree murder also carries with it a mandatory life
sentence, but parole may be granted after 10 years of imprisonment unless the
jury recommends a greater number of years.

…

The distinction between first and second
degree murder in s. 214 is not based upon intent; it is based upon 1) the
presence of planning and deliberation (s. 212(2)); 2) the

[Page 221]

identity of the victim (s. 214(4)); or 3)
the nature of the offence being committed at the time of the murder (s.
214(5)). The primary and essential determination for a jury to make is whether
murder has been committed, either under s. 212  or, where the evidence warrants
it, under s. 213. Considerations of the distinctions between first and second
degree murder are irrelevant in making this preliminary determination. Once the
offence has been found, it is then classified.

To argue that s. 214 is controlling in a situation
such as the present one is to confuse the sections which set out the elements
of the offence of murder with the classification process provided in s. 214.
The classification in s. 214 functions within the context of sentencing and is
not determinative of the substantive offence of murder.

The same point had been made in R. v. Woods
and Gruener (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 220, at p. 229, by Howland C.J.O.
delivering the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal:

Section 214 is a classification section. It
does not create new substantive offences of first degree murder and second
degree murder. It starts from the premise that murder within ss. 212  or 213  has
been committed and specifies that the additional elements which will determine
whether the offence is first degree murder or second degree murder. There are
four situations in which the murder will constitute first degree murder:

(1)   When it is planned and deliberate within s-ss. (2) and (3).

…

It is clear, then, that first degree murder and
second degree murder are not different offences. The substantive offence is
murder. The characterization of murder as being in the first degree or in the
second degree is for sentencing purposes only. There is no question of
transferring the intent to cause a s. 212 (b) offence to the actus reus of
first degree murder, nor is it a case of transferring the intent to commit
first degree murder upon victim A to the actus reus of
committing murder against victim B. I repeat, the substantive offence involved
is murder under s. 212 (b). The mens rea for that offence is
intending the death or grievous bodily harm likely to cause death, to person A.
The actus reus
for this offence is causing the death of person

[Page 222]

B. Once these elements have been established, an
accused is guilty of murder. Section 214(2)  specifies one of several situations
in which murder is murder in the first degree, namely, where “it” is planned
and deliberate. The “it” refers to murder, committed in any of the relevant
ways specified by the Code, including s. 212(b). This means that
the element of planning and deliberation must be related to the specific mens
rea of the applicable section, which in the present case is, as I have just
mentioned, intending to cause death to person A. There may be some mental states
specified in ss. 212 or 213 which are incompatible with planning and
deliberation, but this mens rea is not one of them.

VI Policy Considerations

The rationale behind s. 214(2)  is that
there is an added moral culpability to a murder that is planned and deliberate
which justifies a harsher sentence. This added culpability is present by virtue
of the planning and deliberation with relation to the taking of a human life,
not with relation to the identity of the intended victim. A mistake or accident
as to the victim is not a mitigating factor. The legal evaluation of the
magnitude of the crime should not be affected by the fact that the accused is a
poor marksman, hitting and killing B rather than A. The point is quaintly, but
cogently, made in Foster’s Crown Cases (3rd ed., 1809), Discourse II,
“Of Homicide”, at p. 262.

…where the injury intended against A. proceeded
from a wicked, murderous, or mischievous motive, the party is answerable for
all of the consequences of the action, if death ensueth from it, though it had
not it’s effect upon the person whom he intended to destroy. The malitia I
have already explained, the heart regardless of social duty and deliberately
bent upon mischief, and consequently the guilt of the party is just the same in
the one case as in the other.

When s. 214(2) is combined with s. 212(b)
the identity and character of any victim is entirely irrelevant. The
requirement of planning and deliberation is a requirement that relates to the
inten-

[Page 223]

tion to take a human life and not to the
identity of the victim.

VII Conclusion

In the result, whether one approaches the
question on an analysis of the relationship of s. 214(2) to the substantive
offence in s. 212(b), or on the basis of the underlying policy rationale
of s. 214(2), or, even if it were relevant, on the basis of transferred
intent, one arrives at precisely the same conclusion: planning and deliberation
with relation to the killing of a specific person makes the offence first
degree murder when in the course of carrying out the plan the accused in fact
kills someone else.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J.—I have had the advantage of reading
the reasons for judgment of my colleague, Mr. Justice Dickson, and I agree with
his conclusion that the appeal in this case must be dismissed. Because my
colleague relies heavily on the judgment of the majority of this Court in R.
v. Farrant, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 24, with which I disagreed, I wish to record my
own reason for dismissing the appeal.

I would respectfully adopt the following passage
from the reasons of Martin J.A. speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal in
this case (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 588, at p. 592:

We think that the trial judge correctly
instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
the appellant’s intention to kill his wife was planned and deliberate and that
in the course of carrying out that intention he caused the death of the
children by accident or mistake, that the resulting murder constituted first
degree murder.

Section 214(2) provides that “murder” is
first degree murder when “it” is planned and deliberate. Where murder as
defined by s. 212(b) is committed and that murder is planned and
deliberate the murder is first degree murder even though the planned and
deliberate intention to kill took effect on a person other than the intended
victim.

As we have indicated, we are satisfied that
a conviction for first degree murder may be supported on the

[Page 224]

basis of a combination of s. 212(b) and
214(2) and we are unable to accept the submission of Mr. Kluwak that in order
to constitute first degree murder under s. 214(2) the planning and deliberation
must be with respect to the person actually killed. We think the law is
correctly stated by Professor Mewett in an article entitled First Degree Murder
(1978-79), 21 Crim. L.Q. 82 at 83, where he states:

Section 212(b) does not seem to cause
problems, at least where it applies by virtue of meaning to cause someone
else’s death. Since it is the murder that has to be planned and deliberate and
since the effect of s. 212(b) is merely to enact that an intent to
murder A is sufficient mens rea if by accident or mistake, the accused
kills B, then it would seem that planning and deliberating the murder of A and
by accident or mistake killing B would make the “murder” of B (for so it is
defined by s. 212 (b)) planned and deliberate.

It seems to me that this reasoning is
dispositive of the present appeal and on that basis therefore I would dismiss
it.

Appeal dismissed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
BRITISH COLUMBIA

Criminal law—Juvenile delinquents—Identification
of criminal—Juvenile charged with a delinquency relating to an indictable
offence under the Criminal Code —Fingerprinting—Police officer using reasonable
force—Whether fingerprinting lawful—Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.
J-3—Identification of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-1, s. 2.

The issue in this appeal is whether the use
of reasonable force by a peace officer to obtain fingerprints from a juvenile
charged under the Juvenile Delinquents Act with a delinquency relating
to an indictable offence under the Criminal Code  is authorized by
s. 2  of the Identification of Criminals Act . That
section provides that reasonable force may be used to fingerprint “any
person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable
offence”. The question was raised as a preliminary question of law in a civil
action for assault brought on behalf of the appellant Philip Brown against the
respondents. The Supreme Court of British Columbia answered in the negative but
the decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal.

Held: The
appeal should be dismissed.

Per Dickson,
Beetz, Mclntyre and Chouinard JJ.: The question should be answered in the
affirmative. The expression “indictable offence” in s. 2(1)  of the Identification
of Criminals Act  clearly includes an indictable offence that is a violation
of the Criminal Code  when it is punishable under the Code and, in
the absence of any expressed legislative intent to the contrary, the same
expression does not exclude the same violation when that violation is
punishable under the Juvenile Delin-

[Page 193]

quents Act. A
finding of delinquency relating to an indictable offence under the Code is
a conviction of an indictable offence within the meaning of s. 2(1) of the
Act. Therefore, if the appellant could be convicted of an indictable offence
within the meaning of that subsection, he could be “charged” with it.

Per Wilson J.:
The Juvenile Delinquents Act provides a limited form of immunity for
juveniles from criminal prosecution. This does not mean, however, that the acts
themselves cease to have a criminal character. Here, the 16-year old appellant
was capable of committing an indictable offence and the fact that he was
charged with a delinquency rather than with an indictable offence under
s. 9 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act did not relieve his act of its
character as an indictable offence. For the purposes of s. 2  of the Identification
of Criminals Act  appellant could be said to be charged with an indictable
offence and the respondents were therefore entitled to use reasonable force in
securing his fingerprints.

respondent Williams.

The judgment of Dickson, Beetz, Mclntyre and
Chouinard JJ. was delivered by

CHOUINARD J.—In issue in this appeal is the
following question:

Is a Peace Officer in whose lawful custody
is a juvenile charged with a delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act which
relates to an indictable offence under

[Page 194]

the Criminal Code  authorized by the Identification
of Criminals Act  or by common law or otherwise to use reasonable force in
taking the fingerprints of the said juvenile, where the juvenile does not
consent to the taking of fingerprints?

This question is set out in an order of the
Supreme Court of British Columbia which directed that it be determined before
trial of the appellant’s action against the respondents in damages for assault.

The facts are not in dispute and are succinctly
recited in a statement agreed upon by the parties:

STATEMENT
OF FACTS

1. The Plaintiff, Philip Brown, is a male
born October 27, 1963, and therefore was 16 years of age and a child
pursuant to the Juvenile Delinquents Act on March 19, 1980, the relevant
time in this action.

2. The Defendant, Vern R. Baugh, is a
member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, holding rank of Sargeant,
stationed at Kelowna, B.C.

3. The Defendant, Allan Williams, is the
Attorney-General of the Province of British Columbia, and as such was charged
with the responsibility under the Police Act, R.S.B.C. 1974, Chapter 64,
as amended on March 19, 1980.

4. On March 19, 1980, the Plaintiff was
properly arrested and charged with a delinquency under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, to wit: unlawfully having in his possession a motor
vehicle of a value exceeding $200.00, the property of Inland Gas Company Ltd.,
knowing that the said motor vehicle was obtained by the commission of an
offence punishable by indictment; which relates to an indictable offence under
the Criminal Code .

5. Sargeant Baugh requested fingerprints
from the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff was allowed legal counsel, after which the
juvenile denied his consent to fingerprints.

6. Pursuant to instructions from the
Defendant, the Attorney-General of British Columbia, Sargeant Baugh proceeded
to take the fingerprints of the Plaintiff, which he so took in good faith and
with reasonable care using no more force than was reasonably necessary for that
purpose.

7. That at all material times the Plaintiff
was in lawful custody.

[Page 195]

The appellant relies on the interpretation of
the Identification of Criminals Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-1 and the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3.

Two points are made by the respondents: the use
of reasonable force to obtain fingerprints from a juvenile is authorized by the
Identification of Criminals Act ; alternatively, such use of reasonable
force for that purpose is authorized by the common law.

Subsections (1) and (2) of s. 2  of the
Identification of Criminals Act  read:

2. (1) Any
person in lawful custody, charged with, or under conviction of an indictable
offence, or who has been apprehended under the Extradition Act  or the Fugitive
Offenders Act, may be subjected, by or under the direction of those in
whose custody he is, to the measurements, processes and operations practised
under the system for the identification of criminals commonly known as the
Bertillon Signaletic System, or to any measurements, processes or operations
sanctioned by the Governor in Council having the like object in view.

(2) Such force may be used as is necessary
to the effectual carrying out and application of such measurements, processes
and operations.

Chief Justice McEachern of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia held that a juvenile charged with a delinquency under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act is not a person charged with an indictable offence within
the meaning of s. 2  of the Identification of Criminals Act . To
reach that conclusion, Chief Justice McEachern relied on both the judgment of
the Supreme Court and that of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R.
v. A.N., respectively reported at [1977] 5 W.W.R. 549 and (1978), 39 C.C.C.
(2d) 329. He also relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward
Island in R. v. D.G. (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 157.

Chief Justice McEachern further held that the
common law does not authorize the use of force to take fingerprints. He
therefore answered the question in the negative.

[Page 196]

Reversing, the Court of Appeal for British
Columbia concluded “…that a juvenile charged with a delinquency which is also
an offence punishable by indictment is a person charged with an indictable
offence within the meaning and for the purposes of the Identification of
Criminals Act ”.

The Court of Appeal consequently answered the
question in the affirmative on that basis. As a result it became unnecessary to
deal with the common law point and the Court did not “comment on any common law
right to fingerprint without the consent of the juvenile suspect”.

On the statutory point, the Court of Appeal had
this to say:

We are supported in our conclusion by
consideration of the intent of the Parliament of Canada. In enacting the Identification
of Criminals Act , the criterion established by Parliament for determining
the applicability of this statutory power was not the age of the accused but
the seriousness of the crime allegedly committed—indictable offences and
offences under certain specified statutes. That Parliament was concerned
primarily with the nature of the crime rather than the age of the accused is
consistent with the limitation of s. 44(1) of the Young Offenders Act, Bill
C-61, 1980-81, that no fingerprints of a young person who is accused of
committing an offence shall be taken except in circumstances in which an adult
may, under the Identification of Criminals Act , be fingerprinted. In
other words age, as a test of applicability, defers to the magnitude of the
crime.

The Court of Appeal also relied on the unanimous
judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Clark (1977), 35
C.C.C. (2d) 319 and on the majority judgment of this Court in Morris v. The
Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 405. This latter judgment on which both respondents
relied heavily in their argument on the statutory point is, in my view,
determinative of the issue in this case.

The facts in Morris are summarized in the
headnote as follows:

Appellant, aged 19, was found guilty by the
Court of Queen’s Bench, Criminal Side, for the district of Montreal, consisting
of a judge and jury, on a charge of breaking and entering with intent (s. 306  Cr.C .).
He appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground that the trial judge erred by
allowing evidence of the cross-

[Page 197]

examination of appellant, in which he
contradicted the evidence he had given in chief and admitted having been found
guilty, under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, of offences, under the Criminal
Code . The Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction; hence the appeal to this
Court.

The main issue is stated by Pratte J. who wrote
the majority judgment of this Court, at p. 425:

Such being the case, I now come to consider
the main issue in the appeal which is as to whether the cross-examination of
the appellant upon his record as a juvenile was admissible in evidence under
s. 12 of the Canada Evidence Act or under s. 593  Cr.C . The
trial judge allowed the cross-examination under both provisions and his
decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.

The majority in that case confirmed the judgment
of the Court of Appeal with respect to both s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act  and s. 593  of the Criminal Code .

The majority reasons with respect to s. 593 
Cr.C . are of no assistance here. We are not concerned with the adducing
of evidence of previous convictions or of other evidence in answer to evidence
of his good character adduced by the accused, nor with the question whether the
evidence adduced by the accused constituted evidence of his good character, on
which the s. 593  issue turned in Morris. For the purposes of this
appeal, it will therefore be sufficient to consider the judgment of this Court
in Morris only as it relates to s. 12 of the Canada Evidence
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10.

Subsection (1) of this section reads:

12. (1) A
witness may be questioned as to whether he has been convicted of any offence,
and upon being so questioned, if he either denies the fact or refuses to
answer, the opposite party may prove such conviction.

In Morris, two grounds were relied upon
in support of the proposition that s. 12 did not authorize the questioning
of an accused as to his previous delinquencies, namely (i) a delinquency is not
an offence within the meaning of this expression as used in s. 12; and
(ii) a finding of delin-

[Page 198]

quency is not to be construed as a conviction
for the purposes of s. 12.

With respect to the meaning of the word
“offence” Pratte J., for the majority, made the following comments at pp. 425
to 427:

As to the first ground, it should first be
observed that the word “delinquency” which is described as an offence in ss. 3
and 22(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act embraces within its meaning
two categories of acts; the first category includes acts that are in violation
of “any provision of the Criminal Code  or of any federal or provincial
statute, or of any by-law or ordinance of any municipality” (Juvenile
Delinquents Act, s. 2(1)), or as Fauteux J. put it in Attorney General
of British Columbia v. Smith, [1967] S.C.R. 702, at p. 710, that are
“punishable breaches of the public law, whether defined by Parliament or the
Legislatures”; the second category includes sexual immorality or other similar
form of vice which, while not illegal in the case of adults, should be
repressed in the case of juveniles.

Leaving aside the delinquencies of the
second category that I have mentioned above, the Juvenile Delinquents Act does
not prescribe any special rule of human conduct for juveniles; the Criminal
Code  and the other statutes referred to above are applicable to juveniles
and non-juveniles alike. Essentially, the Juvenile Delinquents Act does
not create any offence; the offence results from the violation of another
statute which, in the case at bar, is the Criminal Code . But, when the
offence is committed by a juvenile, a particular method of enforcement is
prescribed: the usual type of penalty imposed in criminal matters, i.e. imprisonment
or fine, intended to act as a deterrent of wrongful action, is generally
replaced by various courses of action left at the discretion of the Court and
designed to provide the child with such care, education and protection as he
requires in order to rehabilitate himself and mature into a law-abiding
citizen. The Act “provides a special procedure for the discipline and treatment
of children outside of the ordinary criminal courts, although their delinquencies
may be offences under the Criminal Code ” (per Laskin J.A., as he then
was, in R. v. Horsburgh, [1966] 1 O.R. 739, at pp. 756 and 757). In Attorney
General of British Columbia v. Smith, supra, Fauteux J., as he then was,
speaking for the Court, rightly pointed out at p. 708 that: “The primary
legal effect of the Juvenile Delinquents Act,…, is the effective
substitution, in the case of juveniles, of the provisions of the Act to the
enforcement provisions of the Criminal Code  or” of any other relevant statute.

[Page 199]

In Morris, the delinquencies adjudged
against the accused all consisted in violations of the Criminal Code , some
of which at least were indictable offences.

Stating the question to be answered, Pratte J.
wrote, at p. 428:

The question that stands up for
determination is therefore quite narrow: it is whether the word “offence” as
used in s. 12(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act  includes a delinquency
consisting in a violation of the Criminal Code  which is enforceable
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act rather than the Code itself.

And, on the same page, he concluded:

In brief, the expression “any offence” in
s. 12(1)  clearly includes an offence that is a violation of the Criminal
Code  when it is punishable under the Code; in the absence of any expressed
legislative intent to the contrary, I cannot logically bring myself to the view
that the same expression excludes the same violation when it is punishable
under the Juvenile Delinquents Act which, like the Code, is
“genuine legislation in relation to criminal law”.

The question as to whether the word “offence”
included delinquencies other than violations of the Criminal Code  was
left open. Pratte J. wrote at p. 428:

I express no opinion as to whether the
meaning of the word “offence” as used in s. 12(1)  of the Canada
Evidence Act  should otherwise be restricted so as to exclude certain kinds
of delinquencies.

But the Court clearly decided that “offence”
included delinquencies consisting in violations of the Criminal Code .

As was held in Morris and is equally
applicable here “…the Juvenile Delinquents Act does not create any
offence; the offence results from the violation of another statute which, in
the case at bar, is the Criminal Code ”. The mere fact that because the
appellant is a juvenile the special procedure provided for by the Juvenile
Delinquents Act is substituted to the enforcement provisions of the Criminal
Code , does not alter the nature of the offence. To paraphrase the reasons
of Pratte J. in Morris, the expression “indictable offence” in s. 2(1) 
of the Identification of Criminals Act  clearly includes an indictable
offence that is a violation of the Criminal Code  when it is

[Page 200]

punishable under the Code; in the absence
of any expressed legislative intent to the contrary, I cannot logically bring
myself to the view that the same expression excludes the same violation when it
is punishable under the Juvenile Delinquents Act which, like the Code,
is “genuine legislation in relation to criminal law”.

There remains the question whether a juvenile
charged with a delinquency consisting in an indictable offence can be said to
be a person “charged” with an indictable offence within the meaning of
s. 2(1)  of the Identification of Criminals Act . The disposition by
this Court of the second ground in Morris is, in my view, decisive. As
put by Pratte J. at p. 429:

The second ground advanced by the appellant
is that a finding of delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act is
not to be construed as a conviction for the purposes of s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act ; therefore, a person who has been found guilty of delinquency
could not be said to have been “convicted”. This submission of the appellant is
based on the fact that a Juvenile Court is, under the Act, empowered to adjudge
a child to have committed a delinquency and not to convict a child of
having committed a delinquency.

On that ground, Pratte J. concluded at
p. 431:

In my opinion, therefore, the power of the
juvenile court to adjudge guilt is equivalent to the power of an ordinary
criminal court to convict and I cannot see any essential difference between the
power to adjudge a person guilty of an offence and the power to convict a
person of the same offence. With respect, I find no merit in the submission of
the appellant that a finding of delinquency should not be construed as a
conviction for the purposes of s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act .

For the same reasons, it must be concluded in
the case at bar that a finding of delinquency which relates to an indictable
offence under the Criminal Code  is, within the meaning of s. 2(1) 
of the Identification of Criminals Act , a conviction of an indictable
offence. It necessarily follows that if the appellant could be convicted of an
indictable offence within the meaning of that subsection, he could be “charged”
with it.

The appellant has sought to distinguish Morris
as regards both the interpretation of the expression

[Page 201]

“any offence” and the interpretation of the word
“conviction” in s. 12(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act .

As to the expression “any offence” the appellant
submitted:

This Court in Morris was concerned
with the interpretation of section 12(1)  of the Canada Evidence Act , and
therefore, the Court was primarily concerned with the expression “any offence”
in section 12(1) . It is not contended in the case at bar that a
delinquency is not an “offence”; the words in section 3 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act make it clear that a delinquency is an offence. The
question for this Court is whether the delinquency is an “indictable offence”,
as the words are used in the Identification of Criminals Act , and
whether a child charged with a delinquency is “charged with an indictable
offence”.

This submission might have merit if the basis
for the decision in Morris were as suggested by the appellant. But, with
respect, such is not the case. The expression “any offence” was interpreted in
that case as it relates to violations of the Criminal Code  and only to
such violations. The question whether it would, under the Canada Evidence
Act , include other categories of delinquencies was expressly left open. It
is perhaps not inconceivable that the Court could have held that the
expression, without more, was broad enough to include a delinquency which is an
“offence” within the meaning of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. But that
is not what the Court did. It held that it includes a delinquency which
consists in a violation of the Criminal Code . A violation of the Criminal
Code  necessarily includes indictable offences as well as summary conviction
offences. Indeed some of the violations of the Criminal Code  of which
the accused in Morris had been previously convicted consisted in
indictable offences. Hence the applicability of the interpretation of the
expression “any offence” in Morris to the expression “indictable offence”
in the Identification of Criminals Act .

As to the word “conviction” the appellant
submitted:

The other question considered by the
Supreme Court of Canada in Morris is the meaning of the word “con-

[Page 202]

viction” in section 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act , and the Court held that the power to adjudge guilt under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act was “equivalent” to the power of an ordinary Court to
convict, and held that the meaning of the word “conviction” within the Canada
Evidence Act  could be expanded to include an adjudgment under the Juvenile
Delinquents Act. In assessing the bearing that Morris should have on
the question at bar, it must be remembered that the question arose in Morris
as a question of credibility, and hence not one to be decided on technical
interpretations. It is also of critical importance that in Morris, the
Court was concerned with interpretation of evidentiary statutes which should be
interpreted more widely than a statute such as the Identification of
Criminals Act . It is perhaps of interest that Mr. Justice Pratte
states at p. 429:

The word “conviction” is not a term of art
that is applicable only to Criminal Code  offences punishable in the
manner provided in the Code. When used in a statute, its meaning varies
depending on the context in which it is found; it may or may not include the
imposition of a penalty.

I do not find this submission persuasive. I fail
to see how interpreting the same provisions of the Juvenile Delinquents Act,
this Court could determine that a juvenile can be “convicted” of violations
of the Criminal Code , including indictable offences, when the Canada
Evidence Act  is being considered and could no longer be “convicted” of the
same violations when the statute being considered is the Identification of
Criminals Act . In either case, it is the Juvenile Delinquents Act which
is being interpreted, the same adjudgment of delinquency which is said to be a
“conviction”.

The appellant further submitted with regard to
the word “conviction”:

It is also to be noted that the majority
decision in Morris relies also upon an alternative ground that the
cross-examination in that case was admissible pursuant to section 593  of
the Criminal Code  and a general right of cross-examination, and that
therefore the majority decision in Morris may not be determinative of
this issue.

[Page 203]

That the majority decision did consider the
alternative ground based on s. 593  Cr.C . does not alter its
conclusion on the ground based on s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act . It
is to be noted further that in view of its conclusion on s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act , it was unnecessary for the Court to consider s. 593  of
the Criminal Code  and the majority judgment so indicates at p. 437.

In view of my conclusion on the statutory point
it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the common law point.

For these reasons I would answer the question in
the affirmative.

I would accordingly dismiss the appeal with
costs.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J.—It seems to me that the underlying
issue which must be addressed in this appeal is whether the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3, merely prescribes a different
procedure for dealing with juvenile offenders or whether it in fact changes the
character of the act so that it is no longer an indictable offence but only a
delinquency.

This issue was addressed in the very context we
have before us, namely in connection with the right of the police to
fingerprint juveniles, in the case of R. v. D.G. (1978), 45 C.C.C. (2d)
157. McQuaid J. in that case approached the issue on the basis of a purely
grammatical interpretation of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. He found
that a juvenile could not be “charged with” or “convicted of” an “indictable
offence” unless the Crown took steps under s. 9 of the Act to have the
juvenile tried as an adult. He reinforced his conclusion with three lines of
argument. First, since s. 5(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act provides
that trials under the Act are to be summary proceedings and s. 27(1)(a)
of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, defines indictable
offences as offences which may be prosecuted by indictment, a “delinquency”
does not fit into the definition of an indictable offence found in the Interpretation
Act. Secondly, since s. 3(2) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act states
that a child adjudged to have committed a

[Page 204]

delinquency “shall be dealt with, not as an
offender, but as one in a condition of delinquency”, he cannot be
considered to have been convicted of a crime. And third, the Juvenile
Delinquents Act, and particularly s. 3, is not merely a mechanism by
which a different form of procedure is adopted in the prosecution of children
for criminal offences, but is legislation which characterizes what would, if
committed by an adult, be a criminal offence as a mere delinquency when
committed by a child.

The problem, it seems to me, with the
interpretive approach taken by McQuaid J. is that he is dealing with two
statutes as if they addressed each other when in fact they do not. What he was
called upon to do was interpret the words “charged with or under conviction of
an indictable offence” in s. 2(1) of the Identification of Criminals
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-1. This Act was passed by Parliament in 1898 (1898
(Can.), c. 54) and the relevant wording has remained unchanged since that time.
The Juvenile Delinquents Act dates back to 1908 (1908 (Can.), c. 40)
and, while it has been amended from time to time, the provisions with which we
are concerned have been in existence, albeit in somewhat different form, since
the original Act was passed. I think it is fair to say that when Parliament
originally passed the Identification of Criminals Act  it did not
contemplate a distinction between juvenile and adult offenders. There is
nothing in the Juvenile Delinquents Act which speaks directly to the
relationship between it and the Identification of Criminals Act  and the
relationship is one which must be determined therefore by inference from the
words of the two pieces of legislation. In such circumstances it seems to me
that the Court should take a broad rather than a narrow view of both pieces of
legislation and not refine too much on the use of certain expressions at the
expense of the policy reflected in the legislation as a whole. I believe that the
third issue addressed by McQuaid J. is the crucial one. Does the Juvenile
Delinquents Act change the character

[Page 205]

of the act when committed by a juvenile so that
it is no longer an indictable offence but only a delinquency?

It seems to me that where the courts have
addressed this question they have concluded that for the purposes of the
application of other statutes the acts of juveniles who offend the Criminal
Code  are indeed criminal offences. The two leading cases are the majority
decision of this Court in Morris v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 405, and
the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Clark (1977), 35
C.C.C. (2d) 319.

In Morris the issue was the relationship
between the Juvenile Delinquents Act and the Canada Evidence Act  and,
in particular, whether adjudications of delinquency could be characterized as
“convictions” or “offences” within the meaning of s. 12 of the latter Act.
Spence J., in dissent, adopted the view that they were not, relying principally
on ss. 3, 20 and 38 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. Writing for the
majority Pratte J. came to the opposite conclusion. For him the fact that no
specific inclusion of “delinquencies” was made in s. 12  of the Canada
Evidence Act  was not conclusive of whether delinquencies arising out of
violations of the Criminal Code  were covered by the term “offences” in
that Act. Pratte J. appears to have considered both the purposes of the two
pieces of legislation and the breadth of meaning which could be ascribed to the
words used in each Act. Having decided that the words “offences” and
“convictions” in s. 12  of the Canada Evidence Act  were sufficiently
broad to encompass adjudications of delinquency and that it was consonant with
the purpose of each Act that a broad meaning of the words be adopted, he
proceeded to do so.

With respect I do not find the decision in Morris
particularly helpful on the essential issue as I have stated it. That issue
is, however, specifically addressed in Clark, supra. In that case the
question was whether the appellant, who had been convicted of possession of
stolen goods knowing that the goods were obtained from the commission of an
offence punishable by indictment under

[Page 206]

s. 312(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , could
succeed on the ground that his 15-year old brother, who had stolen the goods in
question, had not committed “an offence punishable by indictment”. Arnup J.A.
drew a distinction between the capacity to commit an offence and an immunity
from prosecution for the offence. He reasoned that the Juvenile
Delinquents Act provided a limited form of immunity from criminal
prosecution of juveniles. This did not, however, mean that the acts themselves
ceased to have a criminal character.

Arnup J.A. also rejected the argument that since
s. 5 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act mandated summary procedure in
the case of a juvenile offender, an offence committed by him could not be an
offence “punishable by indictment”. He drew no distinction between “an
indictable offence” and “an offence punishable by indictment” and he noted that
the character of the offence was not changed by the method in which the Crown
elected to proceed on it. In other words, where the Crown has an option to
proceed summarily or by way of indictment and it chooses the former course, the
offence is still one “punishable by indictment”. Thus it appeared to him that
the fact that the Crown did not elect to proceed against a juvenile delinquent
under the provisions of s. 9(1) of the Juvenile Delinquents Act did
not mean that the delinquency lost its character as an indictable offence.

Applying the reasoning of Arnup J.A. to this
case, it appears to me that the 16-year old appellant was capable of
committing an indictable offence. The fact that he was charged with a
delinquency rather than with an indictable offence under s. 9 of the Juvenile
Delinquents Act did not relieve his act of its character as an indictable
offence. For purposes of s. 2  of the Identification of Criminals Act  therefore
it could be said that the appellant was charged with an indictable offence.
Since the other prerequisites of the Act were met the respondents were entitled
pursuant to the Act to use reasonable force in securing the appellant’s
fingerprints.

[Page 207]

For these reasons I agree with my colleague,
Mr. Justice Chouinard, that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

Criminal law—Procedure—Preliminary
inquiry—Preferring indictment—Additional offences disclosed by evidence at
preliminary inquiry—Power of agent of Attorney General to prefer indictment on
additional offences—Criminal Code, R.S.C 1970, c. C-34, ss. 496, 504, 505, 507
(as amended by 1974-75-76 (Can.),
c. 93, s. 63).

At the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry,
the presiding provincial court judge committed the appellant for trial on the
two counts for which he was charged and declined the Crown’s request to commit
him on two additional offences disclosed by the evidence. Later, the Crown
counsel preferred an indictment containing four counts under s. 507(2)  of the Criminal
Code . Two counts corresponded to those for which appellant had been
committed and the additional two to offences disclosed from evidence taken at
the preliminary inquiry and arising from the same transaction. The Ontario
Court of Appeal upheld an Ontario Supreme Court decision to dismiss appellant’s
application to quash the two additional counts. This appeal is to determine
whether an agent of the Attorney General had authority pursuant to s. 507(2) of
the Code to prefer the two additional counts which arose out of the
evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

Held (Dickson
and Wilson JJ. dissenting): The appeal should be dismissed.

Per Ritchie,
Estey and Lamer JJ.: The agent of the Attorney General had the power to prefer
an indictment including counts other than those charged but revealed by the
evidence at a preliminary inquiry. Such power is found in s. 507(2)  of the Criminal
Code  and was first introduced into the Code in 1907 as s. 873A . The
1969 amendments adding subs. (3), while curtailing the gen-

[Page 132]

eral power to prefer, did not take away that
power. Save a few minor exceptions and Nova Scotia, the following principles govern the preferment of indictments in
jury trials:

(A) The Attorney General or anyone with the
written consent of a judge of the court may prefer an indictment for any
offence irrespective of whether a preliminary inquiry has been held, and if so,
whether the accused was discharged or committed for that or any other offence.

(B) Anyone else empowered under s. 507(2)  to
prefer indictments can do so only if the following conditions have been met:
(1) a preliminary inquiry has been held; (2) the accused has been committed for
trial on at least one of the charges inquired into by the justice; and (3) the
count of the indictment must be for an offence for which the accused was
committed or for an offence disclosed in the evidence introduced at the
preliminary inquiry, and which is not an offence for which the accused was
discharged.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 441, 35 O.R. (2d) 124, affirming a judgment of
Galligan J. (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 126, 34 O.R. (2d) 185, dismissing
appellant’s motion to quash counts in an indictment. Appeal dismissed, Dickson
and Wilson JJ. dissenting.

David Smye, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

[Page 133]

The judgment of Ritchie, Estey and Lamer JJ. was
delivered by

LAMER J.—Appellant applied to Galligan J. of the
Supreme Court of Ontario seeking to quash some of the counts of an indictment
that had been preferred against him to the General Sessions of the Peace at
Hamilton. Galligan J. dismissed the application, and the accused’s appeal to
the Ontario Court of Appeal was also unsuccessful. His appeal to this Court is
by leave.

The Facts

An information was sworn containing two counts
charging the accused with break and entry with intent to commit an indictable
offence therein contrary to s. 306(1) (a) of the Criminal Code , and
impersonating a police officer contrary to s. 361 (a) of the Criminal
Code . The accused elected trial by judge and jury.

At the preliminary inquiry the accused was
committed for trial on both counts. The presiding Provincial Court Judge,
applying this Court’s decision in R. v. Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985,
declined a request from Crown counsel to commit for trial in respect of two
additional offences. It is conceded that these two additional allegations arose
out of the same transaction as that concerning the counts for which accused had
been committed. It is also conceded that there was evidence led at the
preliminary inquiry from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably have
convicted the appellant for those requested additional counts. Finally,
appellant is not arguing that the evidence in support of those additional
counts was of no relevance to the two counts for which he was committed by the
Provincial Court Judge.

Crown counsel, acting as an agent of the
Attorney General, preferred an indictment under s. 507  of the Criminal
Code  containing four counts: two of which corresponded to the two counts on
the information and for which the accused had been

[Page 134]

committed (the wording of one of those was in
the indictment somewhat different than that in the information); and the other
two for offences disclosed from evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing.

The accused had originally sought in the Supreme
Court, to quash not only the two additional counts but also one of the two for
which he had been committed, an order of prohibition against the conduct of a
trial on these counts, and an order of mandamus to compel the quashing of these
counts. In his appeal to this Court the accused has abandoned his challenge to
the count of the indictment for which he had been committed and is now seeking
to quash only the two added counts.

The Issue

Could the agent of the Attorney General prefer
an indictment pursuant to s. 507(2)  of the Criminal Code  of Canada
containing counts which alleged offences, the commission of which were
disclosed by the evidence taken at a preliminary inquiry but which were not the
subject of a charge at the preliminary inquiry, in addition to those counts
alleged in the offences contained in the information which were the subject of
the preliminary inquiry and for which the accused was committed to stand trial
at the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry?

Section 507  reads as follows:

507. (1) In
the Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia and in the Yukon
Territory and Northwest Territories it is not necessary to prefer a bill of
indictment before a grand jury, but it is sufficient if the trial of an accused
is commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence with which
he is charged.

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, or by any person with
the written consent of a judge of the court or of the Attorney General or, in
any province to which this section applies, by order of the court.

[Page 135]

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

The governing section for preferring a
charge in the case of a trial before a judge of Part XVI is s. 496:

496. (1)
Where an accused elects under section 464, 484, or 492 to be tried by a
judge without a jury, an indictment in Form 4 shall be preferred by the
Attorney General or his agent, or by any person who has written consent of the
Attorney General, and in the Province of British Columbia may be preferred by
the clerk of the peace.

(2) An indictment that is preferred under
subsection (1) may contain any number of counts, and there may be joined
in the same indictment

(a) counts relating to offences in
respect of which the accused elected to be tried by a judge without a jury and
for which the accused was committed for trial, whether or not the offences were
included in one information, and

(b) counts relating to offences
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or
in substitution for any offence for which the accused was committed for trial.

(3) An indictment that is preferred under
subsection (1) may include an offence that is not referred to in paragraph
(2)(a) or (b) if the accused consents, and that offence may be
dealt with, tried and determined and punished in all respects as if the offence
were one in respect of which the accused had been committed for trial, but if
that offence was committed wholly in a province other than that in which the
accused is before the court, subsection 434(3) applies.

Appellant’s position

The appellant’s argument is, in the result, that
the preferment for an additional charge is governed by subs. 3(a) of s.
507  and that only the Attorney General himself and not his agent, short of the
agent’s obtaining the Court’s consent, could

[Page 136]

prefer the indictment. His position is that one
must read the words “a preliminary inquiry has (not) been held” as meaning an
inquiry pursuant to an information which contains the count or counts
subsequently found in the indictment. He says that s. 507  is a comprehensive
procedure for preferring indictments in provinces where there is no grand jury,
that s. 507(2)  applies only when a preliminary has been held upon the offence
charged in the information followed by a committal and that, if no preliminary
was held or if it resulted in a discharge, it is s. 507(3) which governs the
situation. His supportive arguments are twofold. He first argues that the power
to add counts in one indictment preferred to a petit jury never existed in
provinces where there is no grand jury; his second argument is that, in any
event, this power, if it did exist, was taken away in 1969 when the Code was
amended to include what is now s. 507(3).

The Crown’s position

The Crown says that the plain meaning of the
words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held” makes the limitation found in
s. 507(3) to the general power to prefer before a petit jury inapplicable where
there has been a preliminary inquiry at which evidence, relevant to the offence
charged and sufficient to support a prima facie case on all of the
charges contained in the indictment was properly adduced by the Crown, and
where a committal results.

The Court of Appeal

The Court of Appeal for Ontario (1981), 64
C.C.C. (2d) 441, 35 O.R. (2d) 124, adopting the obiter view of
Lacourcière J.A. in R. v. Dwyer and Lauzon (1978), 42 C.C.C. (2d) 83,
and the reasoning adopted by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in R.
v. G. & P. International News Ltd. and Judd (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 169,
which was subsequently followed by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.
Philbin and Henderson, [1978] 1

[Page 137]

W.W.R. 122, agreed with the Crown’s
interpretation of the section.

I am of the view that the power to prefer counts
other than those charged but revealed by the evidence at a preliminary is found
in s. 507(2)  since its introduction in 1907 as s. 873A.

I am also of the view that the 1969 amendments,
while curtailing the general power to prefer, did not take away that power.

The Power Always Existed

A historical review of the relevant
sections shows that s. 507(3) was enacted by Parliament when it realized
that what had started out as an exceptional procedure had gradually become the
general rule and that control by the courts and greater direct political
accountability through the Attorney General’s personal involvement were
desirable when by-passing the holding of an inquiry or when overlooking a
discharge; and this was so even when there was to be a preferment before a
grand jury.

Prior to codification, anyone could, under the
common law, prefer an indictment before a grand jury except for certain
offences (perjury, subornation of perjury, conspiracy, obtaining money by false
pretences, keeping a gambling house, keeping a disorderly house, indecent
assault (Vexatious Indictments Act, 1859 (U.K.), 22 & 23 Vict., c.
17) and libel (Newspaper Libel and Registration Act, 1881 (U.K.), 44
& 45 Vict., c. 60, s. 6)). For these offences there was a statutory
requirement that the person either be bound over to prosecute by a magistrate
following a preliminary inquiry or that he be given permission to prefer before
the grand jury by a judge or by the Attorney General. By-passing the grand jury
could only be done by a criminal information preferred before the petit jury by
the Attorney General, the Solicitor General and the Master of the Crown Office,
and, in any event, such a procedure was limited to mis-

[Page 138]

demeanours. The system of preferment of
indictments and that of criminal informations was greatly criticized by Stephen
(see Stephen, History of the Criminal Law of England (1883), vol. 1, pp.
293 et seq.). Some of his views appear to have been accommodated in our
first Code of 1892.

The Canadian system required the finding of a
true bill by a grand jury. At the time, criminal informations, though not
abolished till 1953, were no longer being authorized (see R. v. Wilson (1878),
43 U.C.Q.B. 583). The preferment of a bill of indictment, was governed by
s. 641 of the Code of 1892:

641. Any one
who is bound over to prosecute any person, whether committed for trial or not,
may prefer a bill of indictment for the charge on which the accused has been
committed, or in respect of which the prosecutor is so bound over, or for any
charge founded upon the facts or evidence disclosed on the depositions taken
before the justice. The accused may at any time before he is given in charge to
the jury apply to the court to quash any count in the indictment on the ground
that it is not founded on such facts or evidence, and the court shall quash
such count if satisfied that it is not so founded. And if at any time during
the trial it appears to the court that any count is not so founded, and that
injustice has been or is likely to be done to the accused in consequence of
such count remaining in the indictment, the court may then quash such count and
discharge the jury from finding any verdict upon it.

2. The Attorney-General or any one by his direction
or any one with the written consent of a judge of any court of criminal
jurisdiction or of the Attorney-General, may prefer a bill of indictment for
any offence before the grand jury of any court specified in such consent; and
any person may prefer any bill of indictment before any court of criminal
jurisdiction by order of such court.

3. It shall not be necessary to state such
consent or order in the indictment. An objection to an indictment for want of
such consent or order must be taken by motion to quash the indictment before
the accused person is given in charge.

[Page 139]

4. Save as aforesaid no bill of indictment
shall after the commencement of this Act be preferred in any province of Canada.

A bill of indictment could be preferred with or
without a preliminary inquiry into the matter, but, if no preliminary had been
held, only the Attorney General, or someone by his direction or that of the
Court or the consent of the Court could prefer before the grand jury. The main
change in the system was that prosecutors other than those aforementioned had
to go through a preliminary inquiry and then could prefer before the grand
jury, for offences: 1) for which the accused had been committed, if bound over
to do so; 2) for which he had been discharged but only if the prosecuting
person had requested to be bound over to prosecute same; 3) which were founded
upon the facts disclosed on the depositions taken before the justice in the
course of the preliminary inquiry.

As for speedy trials, (roughly today’s trials
before a judge of Part XVI) the charging process was governed by the following
sections: 765, 767 and 773, ss. 767(2) and 773 being those relevant to this
appeal:

767. …

2. If the prisoner demands a trial by jury
the judge shall remand him to gaol; but if he consents to be tried by the judge
without a jury the county solicitor, clerk of the peace or other prosecuting
officer shall prefer the charge against him for which he has been committed for
trial, and if, upon being arraigned upon the charge, the prisoner pleads
guilty, the prosecuting officer shall draw upon a record as nearly as may be in
one of the forms MM or NN in schedule one to this Act, such plea shall be
entered on the record, and the judge shall pass the sentence of the law on such
prisoner, which shall have the same force and effect as if passed by any court
having jurisdiction to try the offence in the ordinary way.

773. The
county attorney or clerk of the peace or other prosecuting officer may, with
the consent of the judge, prefer against the prisoner a charge or charges for
any offence or offences for which he may be tried under the provisions of this
part other than the charge or

[Page 140]

charges for which he has been committed to
gaol for trial, although such charge or charges do not appear or are not
mentioned in the depositions upon which the prisoner was so committed.

(Emphasis added.)

We need not here consider summary trials.

The Code of 1892 was setting up a new
system whereby the normal process was the holding of a preliminary before a
justice or a magistrate.

Generally speaking, by-passing the grand jury,
(though theoretically possible through criminal informations) occurred only
when and as a result of an accused consenting to be tried for certain
indictable offences under Part LIV (speedy trials).

By-passing the preliminary inquiry required the
Attorney General’s direction or consent or that of the court. But, of
importance, once a preliminary had been held, except for speedy trials, binding
over was sufficient to overcome the effect of a judge’s discharge. Furthermore,
as for offences not charged but revealed by the evidence adduced at the
preliminary the rule did not even require committal. Committal would seem to be
a restriction for speedy trials, but is only the result of the nature of that
process. Speedy trials could only be offered to those who were going to be
tried, and committal was not referred to in the governing sections as a
restriction but mentioned as an inevitable prerequisite. The letter of the
ancestor section to today’s s. 496 would appear at first sight to be
giving a much wider charging power. But it did not, as a matter of practice
operate in that way and was quite in line with the rule for jury trials.
Indeed, the judge when consenting to additional charges was expected to
exercise his discretion in a way that would protect the accused who had
consented to the process and relinquished his right to

[Page 141]

a jury trial on the charge for which he had been
committed.

Comments in Tremeear’s Criminal Code (2nd
ed., 1908), on s. 834, the successor to s. 773 of the Code of 1892,
support this view. At pages 668-69:

Preferring another charge.]—Notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 834, a judge should
not, against the wish of a prisoner, give his consent, at the trial before him,
under the speedy trials clauses without a jury, to any other charge being
preferred than that upon which the prisoner was committed for trial, unless it
is clear that, while it may be more formally or differently expressed, it is
substantially the same charge as the one on which he was committed for trial.
R. v. Carriere (1902), 6 Can.
Cr. Cas. 5, 14 Man. R. 52.

In order to have the right to prefer such
other charge, the prisoner must have been committed or admitted to bail and
subsequently placed and held in custody, on the charge of having committed an
indictable offence, for which he had the right to demand a speedy trial without
a jury, he must have been brought and must be legally before the judge of
sessions, he must have consented to waive his right to a trial by jury and have
consented to take a speedy trial without one. The object of this provision is
to permit, during the course of a speedy trial, the prosecuting officer to
prefer the same charge in another form, to substitute a charge for an attempt
to commit an offence when the charge is for the complete commission of the
offence, or to substitute a charge for the commission of an offence which is a
lesser one than the offence for which the prisoner was committed for trial, but
which is included in its commission, even though it should not be stated as
described in the depositions. The other charge must not be a totally distinct
charge nor be wholly disconnected with the charge for which the committal or
the admission to bail for trial was made. It must be cognate to the one for
which the prisoner was committed or bailed. R. v. Wener (1903), 6 Can. Cr. Cas. 406 (Que.). When the charge
has been drawn without sufficient accuracy, a proper and appropriate charge may
be substituted and preferred. This gives a reasonable application to the
provisions contained in sec. 834, which must preclude

[Page 142]

any other interpretation. Regina v. Lonar,
25 N.S.R., p. 124; Regina v. Smith, 25 N.S.R., p. 138, and Regina v. Morgan, 2
B.C.R., p. 829. The prisoner need not necessarily be tried for an offence in
the language of the commitment or of the recognizance, but he may be tried on
any form of charge in which the offence can properly be described, although not
so mentioned in the depositions. R. v. Wener (1903), 6 Can. Cr. Cas. 406; Cornwall v. Regina, 33
U.C.Q.B. 119.

In case of a substitution of another charge
for which the law permits a heavier punishment the prisoner’s consent should be
distinctly obtained, not to the substitution, but to the waiving of the right
of trial by jury. Goodman v. R. (1883), 3 Ont. R. 18.

Where a man consents to waive his right to
a jury, and to be tried summarily by the judge on a charge which on its face
would only warrant an imprisonment for less than a year, he ought not by any
implication to be held as assenting to waive such right as to any charge that
the law may allow to be substituted therefor which might render him liable to a
larger punishment, and his assent to be summarily tried on the substituted charge
should be obtained and recorded. Ibid.

The consent of the judge must be obtained
before the “other charge” is preferred. R. v. Cohon, 6 Can. Cr. Cas. 386 (N.S.).

After a committal for trial at the instance
of the Crown upon a charge of manslaughter and arraignment thereon under the
speedy trials clauses and election of the accused for speedy trial without a
jury, the proceedings in the county court judge’s criminal court will not be
stayed at the instance of the Crown to enable a charge of murder to be substituted.
The King v. Telford, 8 Can. Cr. Cas. 223.

After an election for speedy trial without
a jury, leave should not be granted to add other charges substantially
different from those upon which his election was made, unless the accused is
willing to elect speedy trial in respect also of such additional charges. R. v.
Douglas (1906), 12 Can. Cr.
Cas. 120 (Man.).

The grand jury system was generally awkward and
unfair to victims or other informants who had initiated a prosecution and were
bound over. Awk-

[Page 143]

ward because public officers interested in the
prosecution of crime had to either get a consent from the Attorney General or
the Court, or lay an information. Unfair to them because, when laying an
information before a justice, they were considered as being on the same footing
as a private informant, were subject to being bound over and personally risk
the consequences of a grand jury not finding a true bill or the consequences of
an acquittal subsequent to a true bill. (See R. v. St. Louis (1897),
1 C.C.C. 141). Furthermore, it was unfair to the victims of crimes who
prosecuted: “The fact that the attorney-general and the Crown prosecutors take
charge of a case when it is transmitted to the proper Court and it is a public
one and therefore submit the indictment to the Grand Jury and conduct the case
before the Petit Jury, does not relieve the prosecutor from his liability to
pay such costs on the happening of any of the events just enumerated.” (See R.
v. St. Louis, supra, per Wurtele J., at p. 147). Added to that was the
fact that “The preferring of an indictment by an agent of the Attorney-General
acting under a general appointment to attend to all criminal cases at a session
of the Court without having obtained the special direction of the Attorney-General
or an order or consent under Cr. Code, sec. 641, is not a
compliance with Cr. Code, sec. 641, requiring the indictment to be
preferred by the person bound over by recognizance to prefer the same, and, if
the latter fails to appear, the indictment should be quashed.” (The summary of
the decision of Weatherbe J., Graham E.J., and Henry J. in R. v. Hamilton (1898),
2 C.C.C. 178, (C.A.N.S.))

Parliament in 1900, one might assume in reaction
to this latter decision of the Court of Appeal for Nova Scotia, amended s. 641
of the Code by enacting 63-64 Vict., c. 46, s. 641, which added a
paragraph:

[Page 144]

641. …

2. The counsel acting on behalf of the
Crown at any court of criminal jurisdiction may prefer against any person who
has been committed for trial at such court a bill of indictment for the charge
on which the accused has been so committed or for any charge founded on the
facts or evidence disclosed in the depositions taken before the justice.

Crown counsel could therefore prefer the
indictment in the stead of the person bound over or, more important, when no
one was bound over following the committal. There was however a limitation, the
requirement that there had to be a committal. In the case of a discharge, only
the person bound over at his request could prefer the indictment, save of
course a specific preferment under s. 641(3).

To summarize one sees that, by 1900, under the
grand jury system the holding of a preliminary inquiry resulting in a committal
was the rule and could be avoided or a discharge subsequent thereto could be
overlooked only subject to either the control of the courts or to personal
accountability on the part of a private citizen being open to forfeiture of his
security, the payment of costs and even damages, or subject to control by the
Attorney General. But on the other hand, once a preliminary had resulted in a
committal, the system was lax as to what charges could be preferred, the only
prerequisite (even for speedy trials as a matter of judicial practice) being
that it be for a charge “founded on the facts or evidence disclosed in the
depositions”.

The Revised Statutes of Canada of 1906 brought
no change to the system, save a rearrangement and renumbering of the relevant
sections. But in 1907, by the enactment of s. 873A (6 & 7 Ed. VII, c.
8) there was introduced for the first time as an exception for the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta what has now become the system for all provinces save
Nova Scotia.

873A. In the
provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, it shall not be necessary to
prefer any bill of indictment

[Page 145]

before a grand jury, but it shall be
sufficient that the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence be
commenced by a formal charge in writing setting forth as in an indictment the
offence with which he is charged.

2. Such charge may be preferred by the
Attorney General or an agent of the Attorney General, or by any person with the
written consent of the judge of the court or of the Attorney General, or by
order of the court.

This was at the time an exceptional mode of
prosecution. There needed not be any preferment before a grand jury. These two
new provinces had already known the system as having been part of the Northwest Territories where there was no
grand jury. Preliminary inquiries were held but this was not always the rule,
as appears from the remarks of Johnstone J. then of the Supreme Court of
Saskatchewan, sitting en banc in 1909 in the case of R. v. Duff (No.
2) (1909), 15 C.C.C. 454, where he said, at p. 465:

It has been of common occurrence in this
Province in the past, and in the Territories forming the Provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta for
years before the foundation of these Provinces, to commence the prosecution of
persons for criminal offences without first having had a preliminary hearing
before a justice of the peace.

The list of persons at s. 873A does not include
“counsel acting on behalf of the Crown”. The persons therein listed are
practically the same persons, when adding to them the agents of the attorneys
general, that could by-pass the holding of a preliminary inquiry or a
discharge.

Nevertheless, following the introduction of s.
873A into the Code there was great uncertainty as to whether a
preliminary could be by-passed in view of the fact that there was no grand
jury. In 1910, this Court, Idington J. dissenting, on a reference Re
Criminal Code (1910), 43 S.C.R. 434, found in the affirmative. Every judge
clearly states in his reasons that the finding, because made on a reference,
was not binding and that furthermore the Court had not had the benefit of
adversarial argument. Idington J. predicated his dissent essen-

[Page 146]

tially on two arguments: first, that as regards
s. 873A, there was open to the Court two interpretations, one of which
permitting to read into that section the requirement for a preliminary
inquiry. This is what I understand from his remarks, at p. 450:

It seems to me the question cannot be
answered as if beyond doubt, and when answered here and thus ex parte can
bind no one.

But I am quite sure of one thing relative
to the administration of justice, and that is that no one entrusted therewith
or any part thereof should ever jeopardize or prejudice by the adoption of a
doubtful course of procedure, when a safer one was at hand, either the administration
of justice or the standing, reputation or freedom of another for a single hour.

I therefore answer the first question,
‘yes,’ and each of the others, ‘no.’

His other argument was more textual. It seized
onto the words of s. 873A “the trial of any person charged with a criminal
offence be commenced by a formal charge”. His reasoning went as follows, at pp.
448-49:

With some changes in 1869 the law stood as
above indicated till the Criminal Code  was enacted in 1892.

Section 641 thereof expressly prohibited
indictments being preferred unless there had been the preliminary examination
followed by a prosecutor being bound over or a committal; or the
Attorney-General or any one by his direction or a judge permitted.

This was again amended by 63 & 64 Vict.
ch. 46, and again by the Revised Statutes of Canada and stood as it now stands
in the Criminal Code  sections 870  to 873  inclusive.

These sections are plain. They
require, except in specified cases left to the discretion of an
Attorney-General or a judge of a court of record or of criminal jurisdiction,
preliminary proceedings.

The amendment section 873 (a)
does not in the slightest degree imply any intention to repeal them beyond the
obvious necessity arising from the substitution of the officers above named for
the discharge of the functions of the grand jury relative to placing a man on
his trial.

[Page 147]

It deals only with the case of “the
trial of any person charged with a criminal offence.” How charged? Is it
confined to those who have been judicially so charged, by virtue of the
provisions of the law for committing the accused for trial?

How can it mean aught else? The word
“charged” is the apt one to designate a person accused and in charge. Doubtless
it has another meaning but it may well be argued that it is in this restricted
sense that the Act applies it.

(Emphasis added.)

The majority’s view was that the system those
Territories had known prior to their becoming provinces would continue. Though
they did not expressly say so one might assume that they felt that the fact
those Territories had become provinces did not change the need for an
exceptional mode of prosecution in that part of the country. Also, they said
that the text of s. 873A was clear, unambiguous and expressed clearly what
Parliament had intended. But the Court so insisted on the fact that the
decision was in no way binding that I cannot but think that the uncertainty the
reference was intended to dispel remained. Nevertheless, Parliament did not
speak out on that aspect of the matter till 1953. In the meantime however, by
amendments in 1909, 1925 and in 1943, the charging power in the case of speedy
trials was gradually modified.

By 1944 the Criminal Code  provided:

827. …

2. If the prisoner has been brought before
the prosecuting officer, and consents to be tried by the judge, without a jury,
the trial shall proceed on the day named by the judge in the manner provided by
the next following subsection.

(3) In such case or if the prisoner has
been brought before the judge and consents to be tried by him without a jury,
the prosecuting officer shall prefer a formal statement in writing, setting
forth as separate counts therein the charge or charges against him for which he
has been committed for trial and any charge or charges founded on the facts or
evidence disclosed in the depositions and any charge or charges preferred
against him pursuant to the provisions of section eight hundred and
thirty-four.

[Page 148]

834. The
prosecuting officer may, with the consent of the judge, prefer against the
prisoner a charge for any offence for which he may be tried under the
provisions of this Part other than the charge for which he has been committed
to jail for trial or bound over, although such charge does not appear or is not
mentioned in the depositions upon which the prisoner was committed or is for a
wholly distinct and unconnected offence: Provided that the prisoner shall not
be tried under this Part or upon any such additional charge unless with his
consent obtained as hereinbefore provided.

2. Any such charge may thereupon be dealt
with, prosecuted and disposed of, and the prisoner may be remanded, held for
trial or admitted to bail thereon, in all respects as if such charge had been
the one upon which the prisoner was committed for trial.

Following a committal, no longer was the judge’s
and the accused’s consent required as regards offences revealed at the
preliminary. The criterion of the case law for the judge giving his consent had
been enacted. By 1944, the special intervention, consent or direction of the
attorney general or his agent or of the court was only required to by-pass a
preliminary or to overcome a discharge so as to go directly to trial with a
jury in petit jury provinces or to the grand jury in others. If a preliminary
had been held and resulted in a committal “a prosecuting officer” could, in
speedy trials, charge additionally or in the stead of the offence the object of
the committal for any offence revealed by the evidence. On the other hand, the
powers of the agent of the Attorney General (as all others listed in today’s s.
507(2) ) were unlimited for jury trials but limited to those of a “prosecuting
officer” in speedy trials: the offence charged had to be disclosed in the
evidence taken at the preliminary. The limitation to the Attorney General’s and
his agent’s wide powers to indict in the case of jury trials when charging in
speedy trials is understandable in the light of two facts: the Attorney General
could always avoid a speedy trial by ordering a trial by jury (see R. v.
King (1956), 114 C.C.C. 125; that power recognized by the courts was
eventually enacted by 1968-69 (Can.), c. 38,

[Page 149]

s. 43, and is today s. 498 of the Code);
furthermore, this was only fair to the accused, who has relinquished his right
to a jury trial on the assumption that he would be tried for an offence related
to the events that were investigated and disclosed to him at the preliminary
inquiry.

In the new Code of 1953, Parliament
modified the wording of the section, by then s. 489, and replaced the words
“the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence” upon which Idington
J. rested in part his dissenting views by the words “the trial of an accused”.

489. (1) In
the provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia
and in the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories it is not necessary to
prefer a bill of indictment before a grand jury, but it is sufficient if the
trial of an accused is commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the
offence with which he is charged.

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, by the Deputy Attorney
General, or by any person with the written consent of a judge of the court or
of the Attorney General or, in any province to which this section applies,
by order of the court.

By then other provinces, namely Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia, that had formerly been
grand jury provinces, had joined Saskatchewan and Alberta in a
non grand jury system. The considerations that could explain and justify for Alberta and Saskatchewan such an exceptional system at the outset were no longer valid for
those two provinces and in any event could surely not be invoked as regards
these newcomers. Yet Parliament did not speak out, except to take out of the Code
most of the footing of the argument of Idington J. Curiously, Parliament
specifically abrogated in 1953 what had since long disappeared, the laying of
criminal informations. Yet,

[Page 150]

this is precisely for all practical purposes
what could be done under s. 489, and even more so as it applied to all
indictable offences and not only to misdemeanours as was the case for criminal
informations. Be that as it may, I cannot read down, as suggested by appellant,
the unambiguous language of s. 489 of the 1953 Code that Parliament
could well have modified had it intended to express its disagreement with the
views of the majority of this Court in Re Criminal Code.

At the time of the 1969 amendments, there was no
restriction on the power enjoyed by those persons listed at today’s s. 507(2) 
to indict directly in jury trials. Furthermore, the restriction to their powers
to indict was only for trials before a judge of Part XVI, and, though requiring
that a preliminary had been held, that there be a committal, and that the count
be one related to offences disclosed in the evidence, clearly did not require
that a preliminary have been held and a committal have ensued for each count
found in the indictment.

The 1969 Amendments

But there was an anomaly. As I said, at the
outset the exceptional mode of prosecuting instituted in 1907 had become the
rule. Also, there was a controversy between the courts of various provinces as
to whether, having chosen to proceed by resorting to a preliminary inquiry, an
attorney general could under the section shortcircuit the process before
the magistrate’s decision, or overrule his discharge by indicting directly.
(For a review of the case law on the point, see Culliton CJ.S. in R. v.
Sommervill (1963), 40 C.R. 384). Even those courts acknowledging that the
attorney general was so empowered expressed concern over the fact that it
should exist and expressed the feeling that in any event that it should be only
in exceptional circumstances that the attorney general disregard a finding of
the judiciary resulting in

[Page 151]

a discharge, and indict notwithstanding. This
was further aggravated by the fact that gradually most prosecutions were being
handled by full time Crown attorneys who were usually agents of the attorney
general and that the attorney general was more and more remote from the taking
of such a delicate decision and that as a result his political accountability
was not sufficiently being triggered. Furthermore, a review of the cases in the
1960’s reveals conflicting attitudes from one province to another and in a few
jurisdictions, what some might consider an abuse of the power by the Crown
Attorneys acting as agents of the attorney general. (See, as illustrations, R.
v. Biernacki (1962), 37 C.R. 226; R. v. Beaudry, [1967] 1 C.C.C.
272).

In 1969, Idington J.’s policy arguments, though
not his conclusions, finally prevailed. I am referring to those expressed when
he said, at pp. 449-50:

I am satisfied from the practice of such a
thing, though possible in law, never having been attempted, it was of set
purpose to bring about a definite preliminary examination, as the key-note of
criminal prosecution save where an Attorney-General or judge directed
otherwise.

The result was in the plainest possible
case the hearing had to be repeated before a magistrate to ensure committal for
trial.

The policy of the law that there should be
a preliminary examination was thus clearly settled and so settled in order that
on grounds of humanity and justice that examination might, as so often happens,
enable one accused, without perhaps the slightest foundation, by
cross-examination of his accusers or by his own explanations to dispel the
false appearances against him and save him the pain and indignity of being
improperly placed on his trial.

The differences between that and the system
of placing a man on his trial without being given such opportunity is most
radical. The tendency in the one method is towards a humane administration of
justice and in the other towards the vicious reverse thereof.

(Emphasis added.)

[Page 152]

His views were predicated, and with respect I
should say rightly so, on the need to afford an accused a mechanism to “dispel
the false appearances against him” and avoid a trial by ensuring that he be
given an opportunity to cross-examine and be heard and offer his own evidence,
and that a decision to deprive the accused of same or to override a justice’s
discharge be taken by the Attorney General himself with full knowledge
of the circumstances, a decision for which he would be politically accountable.

This is what in my view was enacted by
Parliament by the addition of subs. (3) to s. 489:

489. …

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

The effect of this amendment is to put all those
listed in s. 507(2) , except the Attorney General (or save judicial
intervention), as regards jury trials in the position they were already in when
preferring charges before a judge of Part XVI. While the amendment to s. 507  is
the result of the two policy considerations I have already alluded to, its
drafting reflects the interaction of two facts: the very general power enjoyed
until then by those listed at s. 507(2)  as regards jury trials, and the
relatively limited scope of the powers to charge enjoyed by them and others
when acting before a judge of Part XVI. The draftsmen proceeded by subtraction
rather than by rewriting s. 507(2)  along the lines of s. 496(2)(b).
Questionable as that may be, I cannot find any further curtailment to the very
general power to indict such as to require that the preliminary inquiry be held
for each specific charge contained in the indictment. What Idington J. was
thinking of, an opportunity to cross-examine, to be heard and put the Crown’s
case to the test, is accommodated by the fact that, an inquiry having to be
held, any count in the indictment will necessarily be related to the charge
investigated at the preliminary under the evidenti-

[Page 153]

ary rules of relevancy, and by the requirement
that there be a committal for that charge.

Cory J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal in
the present case, put the matter as follows:

The question of relevancy and thus the
admissibility of evidence relating to a charge other than that contained in the
information will always constitute a serious problem for the Crown. The
question of relevancy will also act as a safeguard for the accused and ensure
that he has had full opportunity to investigate. The issue will only arise in
those cases where the additional counts disclosed by the evidence form an
integral part of the offence with which the accused is charged, in other words,
they are really a part of the same transaction. The acts upon which these
counts are based will be so closely interwoven with the offence facing the
accused on the preliminary inquiry that they will be a part of the res
gestae. Thus the evidence will be admissible on the preliminary hearing as
an essential part of the history of events pertaining to the charge under
investigation.

Appellant in his factum and in oral argument
before this Court relied greatly on what this Court said in R. v. Chabot,
supra. The issue in that case was inter alia, as stated by my
brother Dickson, as follows, at p. 1000:

How wide is the scope of a provincial court
judge’s power to commit for trial at a preliminary inquiry? Can the judge
commit for any charge disclosed by the evidence at the hearing? Alternatively,
can he commit only for charges that are ‘related’ to the charge specified in
the information? Can he commit only for the actual offence charged in the
information or an included offence?

and concluded at p. 1009:

I conclude, therefore, that a justice
conducting a preliminary inquiry may inquire into, and commit only on, the
charge specified in the information or informations. This includes any
‘included offences’ since

[Page 154]

included offences necessarily form part of
the original charge: s. 589(1)  of the Criminal Code .

One of his reasons in support of this conclusion
followed, at pp. 1008-09:

Had Parliament wished to confer on a magistrate
the power to commit an accused for any offence disclosed by the evidence, it
could easily have done so in clear terms. The failure to specify such a power
in s. 475 is not due to inadvertence. Later sections dealing with the
power of the Crown to prefer an indictment expressly contemplate such power. In
s. 496(2)(b), for example, it is provided that the attorney general, in
certain circumstances, may prefer an indictment which includes counts “relating
to offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry…”. A
similar provision is included in s. 504, which deals with procedure before a
court constituted with a grand jury. Parliament clearly adverted to a power
such as is argued for by the Crown in the present case. Parliament chose expressly
to provide such power in ss. 496 and 504. No such power was intended under s.
475.

These remarks must be read in the light of those
preceding where he said, at p. 1002:

It is critical, as it seems to me, to
commence the inquiry with an analysis of the provisions of the Code. If
the power to commit for trial on offences other than those specified in the
information exists, such power must be found in the Code, either
expressly or by necessary implication. This is evident from the opinion of
Mr. Justice Ritchie in Doyle v. The Queen, supra, at p. 602, where
he stated:

Whatever inherent powers may be possessed
by a superior court judge in controlling the process of his own Court, it is my
opinion that the powers and functions of a magistrate acting under the Criminal
Code  are circumscribed by the provisions of that statute and must be found
to have been thereby conferred either expressly or by necessary implication.

It is conceded by the Crown that nowhere is
a power to commit for a greater offence expressly conferred by the Code. The
question therefore becomes, is it manifest that Parliament conferred such
power by necessary implication?

(Emphasis added.)

Appellant seeks support from these remarks now
and says that the letter of s. 507(2)  does not and never did expressly confer
the power to prefer for

[Page 155]

additional charges and that Parliament could
well have done so as it did for trials before judges sitting under Part XVI of
the Code and for the preferment of indictments before grand juries in Nova Scotia.

As I have already said, s. 507  was, until the
introduction in 1969 of s. 507(3), as clear and unambiguous as was s. 873A in
1907 and s. 489 in 1953, and to all mentioned at s. 507(2)  it granted
expressly, given the unqualified broad language of s. 507(1), the power to
indict for any offence irrespective of a preliminary inquiry having been held
or the result thereof.

By saying that, if the power ever existed,
it was taken away in 1969 by the addition of s. 507(3), it is the
appellant who is arguing, as the Crown did unsuccessfully in Chabot, that
it is manifest that Parliament took the power away by “necessary implication”
by reading into the words of s. 507(3)(a) (as was the Crown in Chabot
by reading in words into the words of s. 475 of the Code) “a
preliminary inquiry has not been held.” the additional words “into each of the
offences charged in the indictment.”

Furthermore, the amendment of 1969 could not so
curtail the general power that existed under subss. (1) and (2) of s. 507  as
such would be giving to the words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held” a
different meaning under s. 507(3) than that under subs. (4) of s. 505, infra,
notwithstanding the fact that both sections using identical language
were introduced at the same time. On the other hand, if appellant’s suggested
meaning were given to both sections, we are led into an absurdity. Indeed,
dealing with this latter hypothesis, giving to those words the meaning
suggested by appellant in both sections would lead to an absurdity as regards
s. 504.

Section 504 reads:

504. The
prosecutor may prefer, before a court constituted with a grand jury, a bill of
indictment against

[Page 156]

any person who has been committed for trial
at that court in respect of

(a) the charge on which that person
was committed for trial, or

(b) any charge founded on the facts
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry.

Section 505 reads:

505. (1) A
bill of indictment may be preferred

(a) by the Attorney General or
anyone by his direction, before the grand jury of any court constituted with a
grand jury,

(b) by anyone who has the written
consent of the Attorney General, or the written consent of a judge of a court
constituted with a grand jury, before the grand jury of the court specified in
the consent, or

(c) by order of a court constituted
with a grand jury, before the grand jury of that court.

(2) No reference is necessary in an
indictment to a consent that is given or an order that is made under this
section.

(3) No objection shall be taken to an
indictment for want of a consent or order required by this section unless
it is taken by motion to quash the indictment before the accused is given in
charge to the jury.

(4) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

a bill of indictment shall not be preferred
except with the written consent of a judge of a court constituted with a grand
jury, before the grand jury of the court specified in the consent, or by the
Attorney General before the grand jury of any court constituted with a grand
jury.

Parliament could not have intended to abolish
under s. 505(4) the power it had conferred upon the prosecutor under s. 504(b).

To summarize, and to relate my conclusion as
regards s. 507(2)  to s. 507(1)  and (3) : except in Nova Scotia (and save a few
exceptions, such as, to illustrate a prosecution under s. 124) the preferment
of indictments in jury trials is governed as follows:

[Page 157]

1. The Attorney General or anyone with the
written consent of a judge of the court may prefer an indictment for any
offence irrespective of whether a preliminary inquiry has been held, and if so,
whether the accused was discharged or committed for that or any other offence.

2. Anyone else empowered under s. 507(2)  to
prefer indictments can do so only if the following conditions have been met:

1) A preliminary inquiry has been held;

2) The accused has been committed for trial on
at least one of the charges inquired into by the justice;

3) The count of the indictment must be for

a) an offence for which the accused was
committed, or

b) for an offence disclosed in the evidence
introduced at the preliminary inquiry, and which is not an offence for which
the accused was discharged.

I would dismiss the appeal.

The reasons of Dickson and Wilson JJ. were
delivered by

DICKSON J. (dissenting)—The question is
whether the provisions of s. 507 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c.
C-34, permit an agent of the Attorney General to prefer an indictment
containing counts alleging offences additional to those with which an accused
has been charged, and committed to trial, at a preliminary inquiry. Though
essentially a question of statutory interpretation the ramifications extend to
basic issues concerning the nature and purpose of a preliminary inquiry.

I The Facts

On April 2, 1980 the appellant Rodger David McKibbon appeared before Bennett
Prov.Ct.J. on charges of breaking and entering with intent to commit an
indictable offence contrary to

[Page 158]

s. 306(1) (a) of the Criminal Code  and
with impersonating a police officer, contrary to s. 361 (a).
Following a preliminary inquiry, McKibbon was committed for trial on both
charges. Counsel for the Crown requested that the appellant be committed for
trial on two additional counts which he maintained were disclosed by the
evidence at the preliminary inquiry, namely breaking and entering a dwelling
place and committing therein an indictable offence contrary to s. 306(1) (b)
and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace contrary
to s. 85 . The presiding judge following the decision of this Court in R. v.
Chabot, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 985, refused to commit for the additional offences.

On April 18, 1980 the Assistant Crown Attorney
for the Judicial District of Hamilton-Wentworth purported to prefer an
indictment on all four counts, the two for which McKibbon had been committed
for trial and the two on which the judge presiding at the preliminary inquiry
had declined to commit. McKibbon subsequently brought an application before
Galligan J. to quash the two additional counts as improperly preferred.
Galligan J. (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 126, 34 O.R. (2d) 185, dismissed the
application and his decision was confirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal
(Brooke, Weatherston and Cory JJ.A.) now reported sub nom. Re McKibbon and
The Queen (1981), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 441, 35 O.R. (2d) 124. In this decision
Cory J.A. held that where a preliminary inquiry results in an accused being
committed for trial, the Crown prosecutor may, without the personal
intervention of the Attorney General, prefer an indictment which includes
counts with which the accused was not originally charged but which were
disclosed in the evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

[Page 159]

II The Effect of R. v. Chabot

Much of the argument before this Court dealt
with the implications for this case of the decision in R. v. Chabot, supra. In
the Chabot case this Court unanimously held that the judge presiding at
a preliminary inquiry has no power to commit a person for trial for any
offences (except for included offences) other than those with which that person
was charge at the beginning of the preliminary inquiry. The Court held that in
view of the principle in Doyle v. The Queen, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597, any
power of committal would have to be found either expressly or by necessary
implication in the provisions of the Criminal Code . None of the
sections of the Code cited by the Crown was capable of supporting a
power to commit for offences with which the accused had not been charged at the
preliminary inquiry, even if such offences were disclosed by the evidence. At
pages 1008-09 of the judgment the following was said about the presiding
judge’s purported power to commit in such circumstances:

Had Parliament wished to confer on a
magistrate the power to commit an accused for any offence disclosed by the
evidence, it could easily have done so in clear terms. The failure to specify
such a power in s. 475 is not due to inadvertence. Later sections dealing
with the power of the Crown to prefer an indictment expressly contemplate such
power. In s. 496(2)(b), for example, it is provided that the attorney
general, in certain circumstances, may prefer an indictment which includes
counts “relating to offences disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary
inquiry…”. A similar provision is included in s. 504, which deals with
procedure before a court constituted with a grand jury. Parliament clearly
adverted to a power such as is argued for by the Crown in the present case.
Parliament chose expressly to provide such power in ss. 496 and 504. No such
power was intended under s. 475.

The appellant seeks to extend this reasoning to
the present case. In Chabot the issue was a judge’s power to commit.
Here it is a Crown prosecutor’s power to prefer an indictment. According to the
appellant, however, the principles are the same. If the Crown prosecutor is to
be authorized to prefer

[Page 160]

an indictment alleging offences other than those
for which a preliminary inquiry has been held, that power must appear either
explicitly or by necessary implication in the Criminal Code . Where the
trial is to take place before a judge sitting without a jury or before a judge
and jury in a jurisdiction where indictments are preferred before a grand jury,
the Criminal Code  explicitly grants the Crown prosecutor the powers in
dispute in the present case. As Chabot points out the relevant
sections are ss. 496  and 504 . Section 496  deals with a trial to be
held before a judge sitting without a jury:

496. (1)
Where an accused elects under section 464, 484 or 492 to be tried by a
judge without a jury, an indictment in Form 4 shall be preferred by the
Attorney General or his agent, or by any person who has the written consent
of the Attorney General, and in the Province of British Columbia may be
preferred by the clerk of the peace.

(2) An indictment that is preferred
under subsection (1) may contain any number of counts, and there may be
joined in the same indictment

(a) counts relating to offences in
respect of which the accused elected to be tried by a judge without a jury and
for which the accused was committed for trial, whether or not the offences were
included in one information, and

(b) counts relating to offences
disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry, in addition to or
in substitution for any offence for which the accused was committed for trial.

(Emphasis added.)

Where an accused elects to be tried by a judge
and jury in a grand jury jurisdiction (currently Nova
 Scotia is the only such jurisdiction) powers such as
those in issue are specified in s. 504:

504. The
prosecutor may prefer, before a court constituted with a grand jury, a bill of
indictment against any person who has been committed for trial at that court in
respect of

[Page 161]

(a) the charge on which that person
was committed for trial, or

(b) any charge founded on the
facts disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry.

(Emphasis added.)

In the present case the appellant elected trial
by judge and jury in a jurisdiction in which indictments are not preferred
before a grand jury. The relevant section of the Criminal Code  in
such a situation is s. 507 . According to the appellant, unlike ss. 496  and 504 ,
but like the sections of the Code cited by the Crown in Chabot, s.
507 contains no mention of the power being claimed:

507. (1) In
the Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, Quebec,
Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia and in the Yukon
Territory and Northwest Territories it is not necessary to prefer a bill of
indictment before a grand jury, but it is sufficient if the trial of an accused
is commenced by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence with which
he is charged.

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, or by any person with
the written consent of a judge of the court or of the Attorney General or, in
any province to which this section applies, by order of the court.

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

In the absence of the explicit authorization
found in ss. 496 and 504, the appellant contends, the Crown prosecutor in a
non-grand jury jurisdiction, should, like the presiding judge in Chabot,
not be held to possess the powers claimed for him.

In the Ontario Court of Appeal, Cory J.A.
pointed out a flaw in this argument. It was his opinion that the Crown
prosecutor’s purported

[Page 162]

power of indictment, though not specified in the
detail found in ss. 496 and 504 was nevertheless included in the general power
granted by s. 507. Section 507(2)  provides:

(2) An indictment under subsection (1)
may be preferred by the Attorney General or his agent, or by any person with
the written consent of a judge of the court or of the Attorney General or, in
any province to which this section applies, by order of the court.

In the opinion of Cory J.A. this section, when
combined with s. 507(1) which provides that it is sufficient if the trial of an
accused is commenced “by an indictment in writing setting forth the offence
with which he is charged”, constituted adequate specific authorization within
the Criminal Code  for a Crown prosecutor to prefer an indictment in a
situation such as the present. In his opinion, the only remaining issue was
whether s. 507(3)  limited this wide power.

The conclusion of Cory J.A. as to the width of
s. 507(1)  and (2)  echoes the majority view in Re Criminal Code (1910),
43 S.C.R. 434. In that reference this Court was asked its opinion as to whether
the predecessor of s. 507(1)  and (2)  (s. 873A of the 1906 Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906,
c. 146 as amended by 1907 (Can.), 6 & 7 Ed. VII, c. 8, s. 2) permitted an
agent of the Attorney General to prefer an indictment in the absence of a prior
preliminary inquiry. The majority of the Court had no difficulty in finding a
power to prefer an indictment (even where no preliminary inquiry had been held)
in the following words of s. 873A, substantially still present in s. 507(1):

… it shall be sufficient that the trial of
any person charged with a criminal offence be commenced by a formal charge in
writing setting forth as in an indictment the offence with which he is charged.

It is true that each member of the majority in Re
Criminal Code, supra, emphasized that the opinions in that reference had no
binding force, and it is also true that the case was the occasion

[Page 163]

for a powerful and eloquent dissent by Idington
J. which concluded that no such power was to be found in the words in question.
Nevertheless, most judicial opinion has endorsed the majority view, especially
in view of the fact that in 1953 (1953-54 (Can.), c. 51, s. 489(1)) Parliament
deleted the words “the trial of any person charged with a criminal offence”
upon which Idington J. based much of his dissent, and substituted the phrase
“trial of an accused”.

Assuming that this preponderant judicial opinion
is correct, then the words of s. 507(1)  and (2)  standing alone would provide
more than ample authorization for the Crown prosecutor to prefer the indictment
now in issue. In that case, the only question, as Cory J.A. points out, is
whether s. 507(3) limits the wide powers granted in subss. (1) and (2) so as
nevertheless to prohibit what the Crown prosecutor purported to do.

III “Where a preliminary inquiry has not been
held”

Section 507 was amended in 1969 by the
addition of subs. (3):

(3) Notwithstanding anything in this
section, where

(a) a preliminary inquiry has not
been held, or

(b) a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged,

an indictment under subsection (1)
shall not be preferred except with the written consent of a judge of the court,
or by the Attorney General.

(Emphasis added.)

There is no question that this provision limits
the wide powers otherwise apparently conferred by s. 507(1)  and (2) . Does it
limit them sufficiently to apply to the present case? The answer depends on the
meaning of the words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held”. The appellant
claims that these words contemplate a preliminary inquiry on the specific
charges for which the indictment is sought to be preferred; otherwise “a
preliminary inquiry has not been held”. The Crown says that

[Page 164]

this is reading too much into the phrase and so
long as the charges in question arise following a preliminary inquiry, even if
that inquiry is into charges other than those for which the indictment is
sought to be preferred, it cannot be said that “a preliminary inquiry has not
been held”.

Cory J.A. agreed with the Crown’s contention,
citing in support, inter alia, R. v. G. & P. International News Ltd. and
Judd (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 169 (B.C.C.A.), R. v. Philbin and Henderson,
[1978] 1 W.W.R. 122 (Alta. C.A.) and R. v. Dwyer and Lauzon (1978),
42 C.C.C. (2d) 83 (Ont. C.A.), reversed on other grounds [1980] 1 S.C.R. 481.
The appellant’s submission, on the other hand, harks back to lower court
judgments, inter alia R. v. Dwyer (1976), 38 C.R.N.S. 129 (Ont. H.C.)
and R. v. Cormier (unreported, Ont. H.C.).

Counsel for the Crown argues that the
appellant’s interpretation of the phrase is essentially similar to the
unsuccessful argument by the Crown in Chabot, namely that a meaning
absent from the express words of the section is to be read into it “by
necessary implication” and is to be preferred to the plain meaning of the words
in question. I do not think the Crown can succeed on this argument. In my view
the reading proposed by the appellant does not depart from the plain meaning of
the words in question and it is, with respect, more likely than the Crown’s
reading.

A preliminary inquiry cannot be held in the
abstract. It is a proceeding designed to investigate specific charges in order
to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to commit an accused for
trial on those charges. It begins with a reading of the charges in question and
ends with the presiding judge’s decision whether or not to commit on any or all
of those charges. This means that if the preliminary inquiry does not pass
through all these stages, if it is commenced but not completed, then “a
preliminary inquiry has not been held” within the meaning of s. 507(3)(a)
(Re Stewart and The Queen No. 2 (1977), 35 C.C.C.

[Page 165]

(2d) 281 (Ont. C.A.)). In
other words “a preliminary inquiry has not been held” absent a conclusion about
the specific offence with which the accused has been charged.
Section 507(3) refers to “an indictment under subsection (1)”, that
is “an indictment in writing setting forth the offence with which [the accused]
is charged”. I agree with Goodman J. (as he then was) in R. v. Dwyer, supra,
that this is strong evidence that s. 507(3)(a) contemplates a
preliminary inquiry into each and every charge with reference to which an
indictment is sought to be preferred. In my view, as a purely textual issue,
based only on the wording of s. 507, the appellant’s reading is preferable to
that of the Crown.

The Crown, however, presents additional
arguments essentially to the effect that even if the appellant’s reading is a
possible one when s. 507 is looked at in isolation, when one considers the
wider context of the Criminal Code  provisions relating to the preferment
of indictments, the appellant’s reading becomes logically and pragmatically
insupportable.

The phrase “where a preliminary inquiry has not been
held” appears not only in s. 507 but also in s. 505 dealing with indictments
before a court constituted with a grand jury. If in s. 507 this phrase
contemplates a preliminary inquiry into the specific charges in question then
it must have the same meaning in s. 505. But this, the Crown contends, leads to
a logical absurdity.

In order to understand the Crown’s contention on
this point it is useful to place side by side the Criminal Code  provisions
dealing respectively with indictments in grand jury and non‑grand jury
jurisdictions.

(Emphasis added.)

In the sections dealing with indictments
before a grand jury the phrase currently in issue appears in s. 505(4)(a).
If one looks only at s. 505, there is nothing inherently implausible about
reading “where a preliminary inquiry has not been held” in the manner suggested
by the appellant. The problem arises when one considers the effect of such a
reading on s. 504. Where there has been a committal, s. 504 explicitly
authorizes the prosecutor in a grand jury jurisdiction to prefer an indictment
on charges disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry. This is,
of course, precisely the power claimed for the Crown prosecutor in non-grand
jury jurisdictions in the present case, a power which the appellant claims is
specifically negated by s. 507(3). If section 505(4) has—as it must—the
same meaning and effect as s. 507(3), then the result, says the respondent,
will be that s. 504 gives the Crown prosecutor a power which s. 505(4)
immediately takes away. This, he says, would be an absurd result and one which
points to the impossibility of reading “where a preliminary inquiry has not
been held” in the manner proposed by the appellant.

If this were indeed the effect of the
appellant’s reading it would be a telling, and perhaps decisive, factor against
it. In my view, however, it does not have this effect.

Subsection 505(4) provides that its
restrictions apply “notwithstanding anything in this section”. Its
effect is to modify the general powers of preferment articulated in s. 505(1)(a-c).
It has no effect on the powers granted the “prosecutor” in s. 504, which is a
separate and distinct provision from

[Page 168]

s. 505. The relationship between these two
sections is somewhat obscured by the fact that s. 504 precedes s.
505. This sequence is, however, of no particular significance. When the
predecessor of s. 504 was enacted in 1900 (63-64 Vict., c. 46) as s. 641(2) of
the then Criminal Code  it followed some of the provisions now
contained in s. 505  and preceded others. Over the course of time the original
provisions relating to the preferment of indictments have been amended, split
up, renumbered and rearranged. Their present sequence is more fortuitous than
deliberate and does not reflect their logical relationship. If one considers
the logical sequence of ss. 504  and 505  rather than their numerical
arrangement, it will be seen that s. 505 (1-3) sets out the general principles
governing the preferment of an indictment before a court constituted with a
grand jury. Subsection (4), which contains the phrase in issue, imposes a
general restriction on the powers of preferment set out in subs. (1) by
restricting who may prefer an indictment where no preliminary inquiry into the
charge in question has been held or where such a preliminary inquiry has been
held and the accused has been discharged. Section 504  then lays out an
exception to the restriction contained in s. 505(4) (a). Where the
accused has been committed for trial on a charge for which a preliminary
inquiry has been held, and where this preliminary inquiry discloses evidence of
further offences, then despite the fact that a preliminary inquiry into these
charges has not been held within the meaning of s. 505(4) (a), s. 504 
nevertheless authorizes the Crown prosecutor to add to the indictment counts
relating to these additional offences.

On this reading it becomes possible both to give
the phrase in issue its more probable meaning and to avoid any contradiction
between ss. 504 and 505. Admittedly this reading does result in different
powers being given a prosecutor in grand jury jurisdictions from those accorded
in non-grand jury jurisdictions. This, however, is objectionable

[Page 169]

from neither an historical nor a policy point of
view. The majority in Re Criminal Code, supra, was of the opinion that
it was possible to bypass the preliminary inquiry in non-grand jury
jurisdictions in a way that was impossible before a court constituted with a
grand jury. This is an indication that almost from the beginning the
predecessors of ss. 504 and 505 on the one hand, and s. 507 on the other, were
conceptualized as capable of leading to dramatically different procedural results.
Further, the limited exception embodied in s. 504 to the general rule
prohibiting a prosecutor from preferring an indictment where no preliminary
inquiry has been held into the charges in question can be justified in a grand
jury jurisdiction in a way that it could not be where there is no grand jury.
The deliberations of the grand jury will afford an opportunity for the
sufficiency of the charges in question to be tested before the accused is made
to stand his trial, an opportunity which would be totally missing were a
similar power to be granted to a prosecutor in a non-grand jury jurisdiction.

On the basis of this analysis there seems little
justification for the Crown’s contention that the reading proposed by the
appellant is unacceptable from the point of view of either logic or policy. On
the contrary, on closer examination it would seem that it is the reading
proposed by the Crown that exhibits the infelicities purported by the Crown to
mar the appellant’s reading.

The Crown contends that a preliminary inquiry
has been held within the meaning of ss. 505(4) and 507(3) even if the
ostensible subject of the preliminary inquiry is a charge other than and in
addition to the one for which the indictment is sought to be preferred. This
reading leads to startling results when it is applied to s. 507(3)(b).
If, for example, a preliminary inquiry were held on the basis of an information
alleging three different offences and the inquiry ended with the accused

[Page 170]

being committed on two counts and being
discharged on the third, then on a consistent application of the Crown’s
proposed reading, the situation would be one where “a preliminary inquiry has
been held and the accused has been discharged”. It would therefore fall
directly within the terms of s. 507(3)(b) and therefore, despite the
committal, an indictment could not be preferred except by the Attorney General
or with the written consent of the court. This would clearly be an absurd
result but it is difficult to see how it could be avoided on the Crown’s
reading of what constitutes a situation “where a preliminary inquiry has been
held”.

There are further problems with the Crown’s
interpretation. If the Crown’s submission is correct and in this case s. 507
authorizes a prosecutor to add to an indictment counts relating to offences
disclosed in the evidence on a preliminary inquiry into other charges, then it
of course follows that the similar wording in s. 505 has the same effect. But
this is also precisely what s. 504 authorizes. This fact leads to one of two
very problematic conclusions as to the effect of s. 504. One possibility is
that s. 504 merely confirms a power that the Crown prosecutor already has by
virtue of s. 505. In that case s. 504 constitutes a totally redundant
provision, a highly unlikely possibility with regard to a section of the Criminal
Code . The other perhaps more likely possibility is that since the powers
given the prosecutor in s. 504  are cast in narrower terms than those which the
Crown says are given by s. 505 , s. 504  modifies and constricts the ampler
provisions of s. 505 . This gives s. 504  some purpose within the Criminal
Code  but it results in a situation in which the powers to indict of a Crown
prosecutor are narrower in a grand jury jurisdiction than they are in jurisdictions
where there is no grand jury (where there is no equivalent to s. 504  to
constrict the powers the Crown says are granted by s. 507 ). From a policy point
of view this is an unlikely result since it results in less protection
for the accused precisely in the jurisdiction where he also does not have the
added safeguard of a grand jury to test the sufficiency of the charges in
question. This surprising

[Page 171]

consequence also has the effect of undermining
the Crown’s argument that its interpretation is superior since it results in a
uniformity of procedure in grand jury and non-grand jury jurisdictions. It
would appear that it is the Crown’s interpretation that is logically and
pragmatically unsupportable.

IV The Effects of the Powers Claimed by the
Crown

On the basis of the preceding analysis it is my
firm view that as a question of statutory interpretation the words “where a
preliminary inquiry has not been held” must refer to a preliminary inquiry with
reference to the specific charge for which an indictment is sought to be
preferred. I am glad to come to this conclusion because in my view it produces
a result that is both truer to the purpose of a preliminary inquiry and more
equitable to the accused.

The function of a preliminary inquiry is to
allow the sufficiency of the case for the Crown to be tested and if the case
does not persuade the presiding judge that the accused is “probably guilty”, to
spare the accused the expense, anxiety and humiliation of a criminal trial. Its
purpose therefore is to benefit the accused and to provide him with a
preliminary opportunity to clear himself of the charges against him without
having to go to trial. Its purpose is not to serve as an investigatory
tool to allow the Crown to strengthen or broaden its case.

Does the power contended for by the Crown accord
with the purposes of a preliminary inquiry? In the argument before this Court,
as in the decision in the Ontario Court of Appeal, the question at issue was
treated as though it were confined to the powers of a Crown prosecutor to add
to an indictment counts alleging offences disclosed by the evidence at the
preliminary inquiry where an accused has already been committed for trial fol-

[Page 172]

lowing a preliminary inquiry on other charges.
That indeed is what the Crown prosecutor purported to do in the case before us,
and it is on the basis of this understanding of the issue that Cory J.A. was
able to dismiss the possibility of a Crown prosecutor taking unfair advantage
of the power in issue. Basing himself on the statement in Chabot, supra, that
the rules of evidence relating to relevancy apply to preliminary hearings as
well as trials, it was his opinion that the scope afforded to a Crown
prosecutor for adding counts to an indictment was very narrow:

The question of relevancy and thus the
admissibility of evidence relating to a charge other than that contained in the
information will always constitute a serious problem for the Crown. The
question of relevancy will also act as a safeguard for the accused and ensure
that he has had full opportunity to investigate. The issue will only arise in
those cases where the additional counts disclosed by the evidence form an
integral part of the offence with which the accused is charged, in other words,
they are really part of the same transaction. The acts upon which these counts
are based will be so closely interwoven with the offence facing the accused on
the preliminary inquiry that they will be a part of the res gestae. Thus
the evidence will be admissible on the preliminary hearing as an essential part
of the history of events pretaining to the charge under investigation.

I cannot agree that the power claimed for the
Crown prosecutor can logically be restricted in this way. Whatever the limits
on the authority claimed for the Crown in the present case, the arguments
advanced in support of this purported power are capable of sustaining a much
broader claim. Assuming the majority opinion in Re Criminal Code, supra, to
be correct, then standing by themselves s. 507(1)  and (2)  would authorize an
agent of the Attorney General to prefer an indictment on any charge whether or
not there has been a preliminary inquiry on the charge in question or any other
charge. The only limitations on this power are those contained in s. 507(3),
and these on the Crown’s interpretation amount only to a requirement that (a) a
preliminary inquiry leading to a committal on some charge has been held
and (b) the accused has not been discharged with reference

[Page 173]

to the offence for which the indictment is
sought to be preferred. This is a considerably wider power to indict than that
contemplated by Cory J.A. If, in a grand jury jurisdiction the Crown
prosecutor’s power to indict is restricted in the way described by Cory
J.A. it is the result of the operation of s. 504, a section which has no
equivalent in the provisions applicable to non‑grand jury provinces.

It might be suggested that the words in s.
507(3) operate as the requisite restriction. The essence of such a submission
would be that while it is not necessary to hold a preliminary hearing into the
precise offence for which the indictment is sought to be preferred in order to
satisfy the requirement that a preliminary inquiry be held, this requirement
does at least make it necessary that a preliminary hearing be held into
“related charges” so that additional charges would be based on evidence adduced
at the preliminary inquiry.

An essentially similar argument was advanced in Chabot
with reference to the purported power of the presiding judge at a
preliminary inquiry to commit an accused for trial on charges “related” to
those that formed the subject matter of the preliminary inquiry. That argument
was rejected in Chabot. I can see no more basis for it in the language
of s. 507 than there was in the language of the sections in issue in Chabot.

I am very far from impugning the integrity or
sense of decency of Crown prosecutors in Canada, but in my view acceding to the
Crown’s submissions in this case would open, at least as a theoretical consequence,
the possibility of preliminary inquiries being used to bolster and widen rather
than to test the Crown’s case, for “fishing expeditions” rather than to allow
the accused to rebut the accusations against him.

Putting aside any fanciful flights of imagination
as to potential prosecutorial abuses of the wide

[Page 174]

powers latent in the Crown’s interpretation of
s. 507, it is plain that simply knowing that any evidence he gives can lead to
additional charges being preferred against him will have a chilling effect on
an accused’s willingness to testify himself, or to ask others to testify on his
behalf, at a preliminary inquiry. Furthermore, since he cannot know in advance
the nature of possible additional charges against him, his ability to rebut
these charges will be crucially weakened. Finally, as regards such additional
offences, the preliminary inquiry cannot be at all to the benefit of the
accused. With regard to alleged offences that form the subject of the
preliminary inquiry, it is possible for the presiding judge to dismiss the
charges and the accused is thereafter protected by the provisions of s. 507(3)(b).
No such conclusion is possible in relation to any additional offences or to
offences “disclosed by the evidence”. Where no charges have been laid, they
cannot be dismissed. Under such conditions the preliminary inquiry can only
benefit the Crown.

Finally, it should be noted that while granting
the powers claimed on behalf of the Crown could cause substantial inequity to
an accused, rejecting these claims would seem to have little deleterious effect
on the Crown’s ability to make its case or on the administration of justice.
All that is really being asked of the Crown prosecutor is that he know the
nature of his case before he embarks on the preliminary inquiry. In special
circumstances such as where it would be unjust to witnesses to compel them to
repeat at a second inquiry testimony of a particularly distressing or traumatic
character, s. 507(3) does allow for an indictment to be preferred even absent a
preliminary inquiry, with the consent of the court, or as is more usual, by the
Attorney General himself. This provision is capable of dealing sensibly with
unusual or exceptional cases without turning the preferring of indictments on
charges for which a preliminary inquiry has not been held, into an ordinary
part of criminal procedure.

[Page 175]

V Conclusion

In Re Criminal Code, supra, at p. 450,
Idington J. said as follows:

… I am quite sure of one thing relative to
the administration of justice, and that is that no one entrusted therewith or
any part thereof should ever jeopardize or prejudice by the adoption of a
doubtful course of procedure, when a safer one was at hand, either the
administration of justice or the standing reputation or freedom of another for
a single hour.

In my view, the course of procedure proposed by
the Crown in this case is more than just “doubtful”. It is based on an
interpretation of s. 507 that is logically and practically the less acceptable
of the two alternatives. It would place in the hand of the Crown prosecutor a
power not in accord with the purpose of a preliminary inquiry, inherently
inequitable to the accused and potentially open to abuse. For all these reasons
I prefer the “safer course” advocated on behalf of the appellant.

I would allow the appeal. The two additional
counts in the indictment should be quashed as improperly preferred.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
QUEBEC

Criminal law—Parties to an
offence—Murder—Charge to the jury—Instructions excluding s. 21  from the
consideration of the jury—Error in law—Criminal Code , ss. 21  and 218 .

Following a fight involving respondent and
several other persons on an Indian Reserve in Restigouche, respondent was
accused of second degree murder under ss. 218  and 21  of the Criminal Code . He
was acquitted at trial and a Crown appeal to the Quebec Court of Appeal was
dismissed. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court to determine whether the
trial judge had erred in his charge to the jury as to the applicability of
s. 21 of the Code.

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial directed.

The words employed by the trial judge in his
charge to the jury dealing with the applicability of s. 21  of the Criminal
Code  could convey no other meaning to a jury than that s. 21 , dealing
with parties to offences other than those who actually commit them, did no
apply in this case. However, there was evidence upon which a properly
instructed jury could have found that respondent was a party to the unlawful
killing and could therefore have been convicted. Given the evidence, it was a
fatal error in law to exclude consideration of s. 21(1) of the Code from
the jury. It did not matter that only one person was charged. Where there is
evidence that more than one person participated in the commission of an
offence, it is appropriate to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of
s. 21(1) of the Code.

R. v. Sparrow (1979),
51 C.C.C. (2d) 443, approved.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Quebec Court of
Appeal, rendered on February 22, 1982, dismissing an appeal from a verdict of
acquittal by a judge and a jury. Appeal allowed.

[Page 75]

Michel Babin and Gilles Fournier, for the
appellant.

Lucien Grenier, Q.C., for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

MCINTYRE J.—The respondent was charged with
second degree murder in an indictment which read:

That at Restigouche, on or about June the 15th 1979, did illegally commit a second
degree murder on the person of Brennan Arsenault, committing thereby an
indictable offence under the article 218  and 21  of the Criminal Code  of Canada
as amended to date.

He was acquitted at trial and a Crown appeal to
the Court of Appeal was dismissed. This appeal is by leave granted March 15,
1982.

The respondent Eugene Isaac and the deceased
Brennan Arsenault (also known as Brian) lived on an Indian reserve at
Restigouche. At the time of the killing the Isaacs and the Arsenaults were not
on good terms. This was at least partly due to a feud between one Delphis
Wysote, another resident of the reserve and a sometime friend of the
Arsenaults, and members of the respondent’s family. Some months before the
killing Delphis had stabbed Isaac’s brother who retaliated a week later by
firing a rifle at Delphis. Both were convicted and imprisoned.

Around midnight on June 14, 1979 a minor scuffle occurred involving the deceased
and the respondent in which the deceased “played with” the respondent’s hat.
Talbert Isaac, the respondent’s brother, chased the deceased and his brother
away, terminating the incident. Several witnesses said that the respondent had
not reacted angrily or aggressively on that occasion and it does not appear to
have been serious.

At approximately 2:00 a.m. on June 15, the respondent and
his sister visited the deceased’s home. The respondent’s brother, Donald, and
his friend, Murray Barnaby, either accompanied them or arrived at the Arsenault’s
house shortly after. Elizabeth Hewitt, a sister of the deceased, and her
brother, Lloyd Arsenault, were downstairs in the

[Page 76]

house drinking. The deceased, who had been
drinking a good deal that day, was sitting at the dining room table asleep.
According to the respondent, he was offered a beer. Then an argument began
involving Lloyd Arsenault and Delphis Wysote which led to an invitation by the
respondent to Lloyd Arsenault to come outside and fight. The assembled company
went outside, including the deceased who had awakened. What then occurred is
best described by the respondent in an extract from a statement he made to the
police which was admitted in evidence. It is reproduced hereunder in the form
in which it is recorded in the transcript.

So me and Murray, my sister to Arsenault’s
place. Leona entered in Elizabeth’s house with me at the same time. Ten (10) minutes after, Lloyd
Arsenault started arguying with me. Delphis put is nose in our business. I said
to Lloyd: “If you want to fight why don’t you come outside.” So we went outside
me and Lloyd and as soon I grabged Lloyd Brian Arsenault jumped in my back. So
I threw Brian off my back on the ground. The I got on top of him and started
punching on his face with my fist about five (5) times. So I left him there. At
the same time, Murray Barnaby was trying to get after Lloyd Arsenault. After, I
grabbed Lloyd. I did not fight long with him because Donald Isaac came and we
both fighting with him.

And at that time, Murray was punching Brian on his face. So Mercer came out and me and
Donald were fighting with Lloyd. So he came toward us and started yelling, and
we stopped fighting. And Elizabeth Arsenault was on the porch.

Donald was arguing with Mercer, he sent him
back in the house and he went in. He just jumped in the house and came out. And
we all took off and started running towards my brother’s house, Reggie. We all
are hiding in the basement. After five (5) minutes, we have been there, Carmen
told us to leave and we went at my father’s house.

The police put some questions to the respondent
and the questions and answers were given in evidence. They are set out
hereunder:

Q. Did you use to go at Arsenault’s case?

A. No.

Q. Why did you go there?

A. Because my sister wanted us to go.

[Page 77]

Q. Who was in the house when you got in?

A. Delphis Wysote, Elizabeth Arsenault,
Brian Arsenault, Lloyd Arsenault and Murray were standing right besides the
door.

Q. Why did stay there?

A. Because they offered me to have a beer.

Q. During the arguing did you mention the
name of your brother Leonard?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you say about him?

A. Because Lloyd told that he already tried
to bet me.

Q. Lloyd told that…

A. …

A. Lloyd told that he already tried to beat
him up on the street. And Delphis said that he already take care of… I told to
Delphis: You have already cut him up before.

Q. How come Donald got involved in that
fight?

A. Probably to help me.

Q. When did you see him first?

A. When he was going home by the driveway
of Reggie Isaac towards my brother’s place.

Q. When you saw him was it during the
fight?

A. During the fiht, yea.

Q. Did you see someone with something in
his hand during the fight?

A. No I was to busy to fight with Lloyd.

Moments after the melee outside the house
commenced, Elizabeth Hewitt’s husband, Mercer Hewitt, who had been upstairs in
bed, arrived on the scene, stopped the fight and discovered that Brian
Arsenault was dead.

The medical evidence given by the pathologist
who conducted an autopsy on the deceased was that death was caused by a heavy
blow or blows to the front part of the head with some kind of blunt object such
as a fist or a large piece of wood. The damage was severe. The skull was
fractured in the left frontal region, the brain had been pushed back and there
was extensive cerebral hemorrhaging. Under cross-examination by defence
counsel, Dr. Bachand admitted that death could have been caused by a
single hard blow but said it was unlikely to have been caused by injury to the
back

[Page 78]

of the head. According to the medical evidence,
all of the major head wounds sustained by the deceased occurred while he was
still alive. The evidence of heavy drinking on the deceased’s part was
confirmed by his blood alcohol reading of 222 milligrams per 100 millilitres of
blood. In his charge to the jury the trial judge adequately dealt with the
elements of murder and manslaughter and the significance of drunkenness on the
part of an accused in relation to those offences. This part of his charge was
not challenged in this Court. The basis of the Crown’s challenge to the verdict
is that portion of the charge on the applicability of s. 21(1)  and
s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code . After reading the
subsections and giving hypothetical examples of their application, he told
the jury:

It is my responsibility to tell you that
the first part of article twenty-one (21) cannot apply in, to this case,
provided you can draw from the evidence that the accused and his companions had
the intent of going at Arsenault’s place and start a fight. They had no
intention of killing anybody. It was then their common purpose in engaging in a
fight. Not to kill anybody.

So, the first part of article 21  applies
only to a charge which may be laid down in this case, a charge of assault with
intent to cause bodily harm which is not the charge here in this case.

The second part of article twenty-one (21)
does not apply either. I’ll tell you why. If somebody starts to fight, there is
a possibility that somebody might be killed, but it is not a probability. The
article says that the commission of an offence will be the probable consequence
of carrying out a common purpose.

When there is only a possibility that an
offence may be committed, the article does not apply. It is only where there is
a probability. In this case, the common purpose of the three (3) purposes [sic]
were only in engaging in a fight and not to kill anybody and I don’t think you
can draw from the evidence that there was a probability that man might be
killed in—during the fight.

So, this part of article twenty-one (21)
does not apply either.

After deliberating for some time, the jury
returned and requested more instruction on the crime of

[Page 79]

manslaughter. The judge re-directed the jury and
said in part:

In order to find the accused guilty of
manslaughter, you have to come to the conclusion that the Crown has proven all
the elements of the murder, except the element on intent to kill a human being.

That is to say that one, the death of the
victim was caused by violence, two, that the death of the victim was the
consequence of the blows given by the accused and not by someone else, three,
that the wounds inflicted to the victim are these blows that caused the death
of the victim.

On these three elements, you have to come
to the conclusion that each and everyone of them has been proven beyond
reasonable doubt. If you have a doubt on one of these elements, the crime of
manslaughter has not been proven, but if you come to the conclusion that all of
these elements have been proven beyond reasonable doubt, then, you have a crime
of manslaughter.

The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal
from the acquittal of the respondent. While each of the three members of the
Court wrote separate reasons for judgment, they were in agreement that the
charge to the jury, although perhaps not perfect, did not contain such errors
as to warrant a direction for a retrial. They also considered that the points
raised by the Crown related to questions of fact or, at best, mixed fact and
law and not law alone. Monet J.A. further expressed the view that the trial
judge had not, as asserted by the Crown, withdrawn consideration of s. 21 
from the jury’s consideration, but had merely given his opinion on the facts as
he was entitled to do.

In this Court the Crown contended that there was
sufficient evidence to go to the jury as to whether the respondent was a party
to the unlawful killing within the meaning of s. 21(1)  and s. 21(2) 
of the Criminal Code . The trial judge erred, therefore, in directing the
jury to disregard the provisions of s. 21 of the Code. It was
asserted that the issue raised was one of law, not mixed fact and law. If the
jury had been properly instructed, they would have had no other choice than to
convict the

[Page 80]

respondent of at least manslaughter. The
respondent contended that the comments of the judge, referred to above, were
mere expressions of his opinion that s. 21  could be inapplicable depending
on the jury’s view of the facts. The Court of Appeal did not err in considering
that the issues raised by the Crown were matters of mixed law and fact. It was
further contended that in any event on the evidence there was no occasion to
charge under s. 21 of the Code.

At the outset I must observe that I cannot
accept the argument that the words employed by the trial judge in dealing with
the applicability of s. 21  of the Criminal Code  amounted only to an
expression of opinion as to the facts. In my opinion, the words appearing in
the record could convey no other meaning to a jury than that s. 21 ,
dealing with parties to offences other than those who actually commit them,
could not be applied in this case. This meaning could only have been reinforced
by the later remarks made in response to the request for further instructions
in which the trial judge said that in order to convict the jury had to be
satisfied that “the death of the victim was the consequence of the blows given
by the accused and not by someone else”. I am therefore of the view that the
Crown’s assertion that consideration of s. 21 of the Code was
removed from the jury is well-founded.

What then was the consequence of this direction
with respect to s. 21  of the Criminal Code ? A brief reference to
the evidence is necessary to find the answer. It is perfectly clear that there
was evidence upon which a jury could have found that an offence was committed,
an unlawful killing, which could have been murder or manslaughter. There was as
well evidence from which a jury could have concluded that both the respondent
and Barnaby participated in the assault which caused the death and in doing so
assisted each other, Barnaby engaging Lloyd Arsenault while the respondent
pummelled the deceased and later joining the attack on the deceased while the
respondent “grabbed Lloyd”. There was nothing, however, in

[Page 81]

the evidence of those who participated in the
fighting or in the medical evidence to enable the jury to say whose blow or
blows caused the death. The inescapable conclusion from the medical evidence,
however, would have been that the injuries received by the deceased resulted in
his death, all having been suffered before death. It follows then that a
properly instructed jury could have found on the evidence that the respondent
and Barnaby were parties to the unlawful killing and could therefore have been
convicted. It was in these circumstances a fatal error to exclude consideration
of s. 21(1) of the Code from the jury.

I do not overlook the fact that only the
respondent was charged in the indictment and that the record is silent as to
charges that may have been brought against the other participants. Nonetheless,
where there is evidence that more than one person participated in the
commission of a crime, even though only one is charged, a direction under
s. 21  of the Criminal Code  may be necessary. I note the words of
Martin J.A. in R. v. Sparrow (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 443, at
p. 458, where, speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal (Martin,
Lacourcière and Thorson JJ.A.), he said:

I am of the view that it is also
appropriate, where an accused is being tried alone and there is evidence that
more than one person was involved in the commission of the offence, to direct
the jury with respect to the provisions of s. 21 of the Code, even
though the identity of the other participant or participants is unknown, and
even though the precise part played by each participant may be uncertain.

I adopt those words as a correct statement of
the law.

It was also contended that the trial judge erred
in excluding consideration of s. 21(2)  of the Criminal Code  from
the jury. I do not propose, however, to deal further with the matter since a
new trial must, in any event, be directed because of the error with respect to
s. 21(1) of the Code. A decision as to the applicability of
s. 21(2)  must await a new trial and will be based upon the state of the
evidence then adduced.

[Page 82]

I might observe that in this Court counsel for
the respondent conceded, while contending that there was no evidence to warrant
a charge to the jury under s. 21 of the Code, that if sufficient
evidence had existed it would have been error in law to exclude that
section from the jury.

The Crown seeks a new trial on a charge of
manslaughter only. I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial on a charge
of manslaughter.

Appeal allowed.

ON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR
ONTARIO.

excluding exculpatory evidence—Whether s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code applicable
to uphold conviction—Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C‑34, s.
613(1)(b)(iii).

Statutes—Amendments—Legislation enacted

R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, s. 36(d).

Appellant was charged with the first degree
murder of his 8 year old stepdaughter and tried by a judge with a jury. The
Crown’s case was based entirely on circumstantial evidence. Although considered
at the preliminary inquiry, the testimony of two witnesses that related to a
telephone conversation between them and the accused’s wife or somebody
purporting to be his wife was not admitted at trial. This evidence would have
explained why the accused knew of the circumstances of the victim’s death prior
to the discovery of the body—the most incriminating evidence adduced against
him. The accused’s wife was not called as a witness. In his address to the
jury, the Crown explained that the prosecution is prohibited by law from
calling the accused’s wife to give evidence and the trial judge did not comment
that statement. Appellant was convicted. On appeal, the Court of Appeal found
that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence confirming part of the
accused’s testimony but, considering that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice had occurred in view of the overwhelming evidence of the accused’s
guilt, applied the proviso of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code  and
upheld the conviction. The Court held also that the Crown’s remark did not
constitute a comment within the meaning of s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence
Act  and could not reasonably have been interpreted by the jury as a
suggestion that an innocent accused would

[Page 312]

have called his wife to confirm his
testimony. Appellant’s appeal to this Court was on three grounds: (1) this was
not a proper case to apply s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code; (2) the
trial judge’s silence in respect of the Crown’s remark resulted in an endorsement
of the statement and was in effect a misdirection in law to the jury and (3)
the Crown’s remark was a comment forbidden by s. 4(5)  of the Canada Evidence
Act .

Held: The
appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered.

The trial judge erred in refusing to admit
testimony corroborating the accused’s explanation as to how the victim had been
killed and s. 613(1)(b)(iii) of the Code could not apply to
uphold the verdict. The onus was upon the Crown to satisfy the Court that the
verdict “would necessarily have been the same if the errors had not occurred”.
Such determination is generally made upon a reading of the evidence put to the
jury. But when the error of law is the preclusion of exculpatory evidence, the
determination must be made with regard to the entirety of the evidence and in
light of the effect the excluded evidence could possibly have had on the
evidence that did go to the jury. Any reasonable effect that the excluded
evidence could have had on the jury should, in applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii),
enure to the benefit of the accused. Here, if admitted, the excluded evidence
would have tended to negate the inference that the accused had to be on the
scene at the time of the crime to have known the circumstances of the victim’s
death—the very inference the jury was concerned about. Without that inference,
the evidence put to the jury, while sufficient to support a conviction, would
not have made an acquittal unreasonable.

The problems raised by the Crown’s remark
will not arise at the new trial: as the victim was under 14 years old, the
accused’s wife is a competent and compellable witness for the prosecution
without the accused’s consent. This new rule of evidence, which was introduced
by s. 4(3.1)  of the Canada Evidence Act , is merely procedural and,
in accordance with s. 36(d) of the Interpretation Act, will be
applicable at the new trial.

APPEAL from a judgment of the Ontario Court
of Appeal (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 289, dismissing appellant’s appeal from his
conviction on a charge of first degree murder. Appeal allowed and new trial
ordered.

R.J. Climie, for the appellant.

David H. Doherty, for the respondent.

The judgment of the Court was delivered by

LAMER J.—The appellant was indicted of the first
degree murder of his stepdaughter and, on November 18, 1978, was convicted by a
jury in the County of Brant, Ontario. His
appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful but required the application of
the proviso of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) of the Criminal Code . Leave
to appeal to this Court was granted at large.

A factual overview

On February 15, 1978, the appellant’s 8-year old
stepdaughter Tricia disappeared from her school yard before classes had begun.
On February 19, 1978, her body
was found on the bank of a nearby river. She had been killed by some nineteen
blows to the head. A tan coloured hatchet sheath was found twenty-eight inches
from the body. Medical evidence indicated that the injuries could have been
inflicted by a hatchet. The killing was estimated to have taken place on the
day of her disappearance.

The Crown’s case against the appellant was based
entirely on circumstantial evidence relating to:

1) motive, that is, Wildman’s enmity toward his
wife and to a lesser degree Tricia;

2) opportunity;

3) identification of a man and child by a Mrs.
Jean Coubrough;

4) a hatchet, owned by Wildman at one time;

[Page 314]

5) Wildman’s surreptitious disposal of his
clothing on February 15, 1978; and

6) false statements made to the police by
Wildman after the investigation started on February 15th.

Finally, and, in my view, if unexplained, fatal
to the accused, was the fact that he made statements indicating that he had
knowledge of the cause of death, the nature and location of the injuries and of
the kind of weapon used prior to that information being released by the police,
indeed, even prior to the discovery of the body and prior to the police
themselves becoming aware of those circumstances.

I will return to the facts and deal more
thoroughly with them when disposing of the ground of appeal upon which this
appeal should in my view succeed.

At the trial the set of events giving rise to
the three grounds of appeal in this Court were twofold: one relating to
Wildman’s wife not having testified, the other to a ruling on evidence.

First set of events

The accused’s wife was not called as a witness
by either the Crown or by the defence. When addressing the jury, Crown counsel
advised the jury as follows:

You are, however, bound by the law, what
his Lordship says, and anything I say that sounds like law—and if I am not
correct, I’m sure his Lordship will correct me.

One of the points that you have heard a lot
of evidence about a woman by the name of Joyce Wildman, who is the wife of the
accused. You probably wondered why you haven’t heard from Joyce Wildman. Well,
I tell you as a point of law that the prosecution is prohibited by law from
calling Joyce Wildman to give evidence.

(Emphasis added.)

The trial judge did not correct that statement
of the law, which the appellant takes to be incorrect.

As a result, appellant raises two grounds:

[Page 315]

1) that the judge’s silence resulted in an
endorsement of the statement and was therefore in effect a misdirection in law
to the jury;

2) Crown counsel’s submission was a comment
forbidden by s. 4(5) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10.

Second set of events

The appellant was denied the right to adduce,
through cross-examination, evidence that purportedly would have explained his
very incriminating knowledge of the circumstances of the death prior to the
discovery of the body. The Court of Appeal having found this ruling wrong in
law then applied the proviso of s. 613(1) (b)(iii).

3) Appellant raises as a third ground that this
was not a proper case for the application of the proviso.

The Court of Appeal

Many grounds were raised by appellant in the
Court of Appeal of Ontario (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 289, including one of the
three raised in this Court, the one relating to the denial of the right to
adduce evidence in regard to the accused’s knowledge of the circumstances of
death. As I said, the Court of Appeal agreed with appellant that the trial
judge had erred in excluding this evidence (as did the Crown at the trial and
in this Court), but agreed with the Crown that, no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice having been occasioned thereby, it was a proper case to
invoke the provisions of s. 613(1) (b)(iii). The test the Court of Appeal
purported to apply was as follows (at p. 304):

Before invoking s. 613(1) (b)(iii) we
must be satisfied that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, would inevitably
have found a verdict of guilty even if the Mclsaacs had given their testimony: MacDonald
v. The Queen, (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 1 at p. 12, 75 D.L.R. (3d) 107,
[1977] 2 S.C.R. 832 at p. 848.

The other two grounds in this Court, resulting
from the Crown’s comments as to Mrs. Wildman’s

[Page 316]

compellability were raised by the Court of
Appeal proprio motu, and were disposed of as follows (at p. 295):

Whether or not the appellant’s wife was a
competent and compellable witness for the prosecution is a question of some
difficulty which was not argued at the trial. Consequently, there was no ruling
by the trial Judge upon which this Court is able to voice an opinion and the
question is one which in our view should be reserved until it arises squarely
for decision. In any case, we do not agree with Mr. Carter’s suggestion that it
is possible to construe the trial Judge’s failure to correct Crown counsel as a
tacit acceptance by him of the correctness of Crown counsel’s statement of the
law.

With respect to Mr. Carter’s second
submission, we do not think that Crown counsel’s remarks constituted a comment,
within the meaning of s. 4(5), on the failure of the appellant’s wife to
testify. In the particular circumstances of this case the remarks were in the
nature of an explanation by Crown counsel, in light of his understanding of the
law of evidence, for his failure to call Mrs. Wildman. Unlike in R. v. Cooper
(No. 2) (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 140, 51 D.L.R. (3d) 221, 5 O.R. (2d) 118,
and R. v. Arneson (1930), 54 C.C.C. 330, [1930] 3 W.W.R. 163, 25
Alta. L.R. 125, Crown counsel’s remarks in the present case could not
reasonably have been interpreted by the jury as a suggestion that an innocent
accused would have called his wife to confirm his testimony. As in the case of Avon v. The
Queen (1971), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 357, 21 D.L.R. (3d) 442, [1971] S.C.R. 650,
where the Supreme Court of Canada was concerned with somewhat similar remarks
by a trial Judge, the language used here was a “statement” explaining the
prosecution’s inability to call an accused’s spouse rather than a “comment”
disparaging the accused’s ability to use his wife’s imposed silence to cloak
his guilt. None the less, we are of the view that Crown counsel’s remarks came
perilously close to contravening s. 4(5) and that it would have been preferable
if they had not been made. Again, however, if it were necessary, we would apply
the provisions of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)of the Code.

[Page 317]

The third ground (the exclusion of evidence
and s. 613(1) (b)(iii))

This ground should, with respect, have succeeded
in the Court of Appeal and resulted in the ordering of a new trial. There is
here no disagreement as to the commission of an error by the trial judge; nor
does anyone take issue with the test the Court of Appeal said must be met in
order to apply s. 613(1) (b)(iii). Where we part is as regards the proper
application of the test to the facts of this case, a matter this Court has
declared, for policy reasons, to be a question of law (see Mahoney v. The
Queen, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 834).

As announced earlier, I now return to the
evidence in this case.

Motive

The appellant and Joyce Wildman married in
October 1973 when he was 21 and she was 19. At that time Tricia Paquette was 4
years old. She is the natural daughter of Joyce Wildman, but not of John
Wildman. Mrs. Wildman had agreed that John would adopt Tricia after their
marriage, but later reneged on this promise. Two children were born to the
marriage.

All agree that the marriage was a turbulent one.
There were numerous fights and on a few occasions the police had to be called
in. They separated on numerous occasions. John Wildman attributed this to his
wife’s alcoholism. Donna Dumont, the sister of Joyce Wildman, attributed the
separation to John Wildman’s lack of affection for Tricia Paquette and to Mr.
Wildman being a thief.

There is substantial evidence of various events,
some disproving these assertions, others supportive thereof. I have read the
evidence and I am satisfied that there is evidence supportive of the fact that
appellant’s animosity towards his wife, whether understandable or not, could in
turn be supportive of a motive for his killing Tricia. There is also evidence
that he threatened his wife’s life and that of a social worker.

[Page 318]

In June of 1977, when the police were called
because of a dispute over the custody of the two younger girls, he said “if
Joyce gets the two babies, I will get Tricia”. John Wildman testified that he
used the expression “get Tricia” in the sense of getting custody of her, just
as, when referring to the two babies, he used the expression “gets the two
babies”. The officer who heard this comment took it at the time to have been
said in relation to custody. Four witnesses testified that Wildman acted in an
appropriate fatherly manner towards Tricia.

Opportunity

There is no need to consider the evidence in any
detail. The accused attempted to establish an alibi, but was not successful.
Tricia disappeared from school shortly before 9 a.m. on February 15th. The appellant’s
first recorded contact with anyone that morning was between 10:15 and 10:45 a.m. when he spoke to his landlady while in
his apartment. Tests established that a person could have walked from the
school yard to where Tricia’s body was found and from there to appellant’s
apartment in fifty minutes.

Identification and the disposal of the
clothing

Mrs. Jean Coubrough lived at 94 Grand Street. The back of her property
ran to the embankment overlooking the river about 270 feet from where the body
was found. On February 15, between 9 and 10 a.m., Mrs. Coubrough saw a man and
a child walking down the railroad tracks. The man, she said, walked with a
purpose and the child struggled along six feet behind. The child was wearing a
blue ski jacket matching the description of the one Tricia was wearing on that
day. It is common ground that the man and the child Mrs. Coubrough saw
would have been in her field of vision for about 22 to 25 seconds. She
described the man as being about 5 feet 3 inches tall, and of the same height
but somewhat slimmer than the accused she saw in court. The accused, it was
established, had gained 10 pounds while in jail. He was wearing a black
knee-length coat, a black hat, but no gloves though it was a very cold morning.

[Page 319]

The hat was what she called “an airman’s hat”
turned up in the middle. She saw no glasses on the man, but only saw a profile
of the man’s face.

Joyce Smoke, a social worker who had been
“handling” the Wildman family, said she was accustomed to seeing John Wildman
wear a black hat and a black coat. But, as regards the hat, she was
contradicted by her secretary Miss Carvel, and by several other witnesses who
said Mr. Wildman did not wear a hat. Mr. Mclsaac said that on February 14 the
appellant was wearing a long brown leather coat and tan cowboy boots. Wildman
testified he had lost his gloves the night of February 14. He also testified he
had put his coat and boots in the garbage on Monday, February 13, and put the
garbage out on Wednesday, February 15. This happened about two hours after
Tricia went missing. He explained this as the result of a call he received from
his wife on February 13.

Q. After—sorry. During this telephone
discussion that you had with your wife, was the question of a pair of boots and
a coat discussed?

A. Yes, sir, they were.

Q. And at that time did you indicate to
your wife, what if anything you were going to do with them?

A. Yes, I told her I was going to throw
them in the garbage.

Q. Why was that?

A. Well, she had bought me the boots about
six months earlier and she bought me the coat for Christmas, and I was to be
indebted for life for them.

Q. What do you mean by that?

A. Well, such things as, there was no
heater in her bathroom at 481 Colborne.

Q. Yes?

A. And there wasn’t any in mine at 25 Duke.

Q. Yes?

A. But I had an electric heater, so she
wanted that. And I said, “Well, I need it”; she says, “Well─

Q. Well, don’t tell us what she said: you
argued over that?

[Page 320]

A. Yes, she said that I should give it to
her because she had bought my coat and boots.

Q. And was it in that discussion you said
you would throw them away?

…

And he was seen putting garbage in front of the
neighbour’s house, which he explained as follows:

Q. All right. Do you recall when you put
those into a garbage bag?

A. On Monday night.

Q. Before or after you talked to Joyce?

A. Well, after; I mean, I hadn’t decided to
throw them out until after I had talked to her.

Q. There has been some evidence that you
took the garbage bag, I guess westerly towards the store, and put a garbage
bag, I think one door down from your place?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. Why did you do that?

A. Because I’m lazy.

Q. What was in it?

A. Garbage.

Q. Okay. Well, why—if you are so lazy—walk
one door down and put the garbage out?

A. No—well, we had a problem with dogs
ripping garbage apart.

Q. Yes?

A. Now this had—this bag had dirty diapers,
bad foodstuffs: like when my wife had left, she left the fridge open and the
food in there had gone bad.

Q. Yes?

A. This was all in that bag. I merely took
it to the next door neighbour’s house to leave it there; if the dogs tore it
apart, I wouldn’t have to clean it up.

Q. All right. About what time was that,
that you took

your garbage out?

A. I would say about 11.30, quarter to twelve.

The boots and coat, according to him, were put
out in front of his residence while the other garbage bags went to the
neighbour’s. There was also

[Page 321]

some evidence, though not conclusive, that
Wildman, due to a diabetic condition would, after walking some distance,
develop a limp. Mrs. Coubrough did not see the man limp.

The hatchet

The injuries to Tricia’s head could have been
caused by a hatchet. A sheath was found 28 inches from the body. A hatchet was
located in the water 200 feet from the body. Near the location of the hatchet, on
the river’s embankment, was a bloodstained garbage bag; the blood was not
inconsistent with Tricia’s. The hatchet fitted snugly into the sheath. Wildman
had owned a hatchet and a sheath which he sold to one Daniel Curry. The hatchet
disappeared from Curry’s apartment sometime between the middle of January and
February 23, 1978. The appellant was at Curry’s apartment on February 9, 1978 and could have stolen it as he
was left alone for some time. I do not intend to canvass the evidence in
detail. Many witnesses were heard who had seen Wildman’s or Curry’s hatchet.
Curry said it had a long black handle, and had “Stainless”, stamped on it. The
hatchet found in the river had “Fuller 16 Forged” stamped on it. One Paul Bell
said that Curry’s hatchet had “Fuller 16 Forged” stamped on it. Witnesses when
looking at the sheath, the markings, the handle, or the colour of the hatchet
found near the body and comparing it with their recollection of the one owned
by Wildman or by Curry or borrowed from either of them, either concluded that
the hatchets were different or, at best, similar, but none could affirm that
they were identical let alone the same one. The additional cuts in the sheath
and the difference of colour of the hatchet and the sheath found on the scene of
the crime that might have misled some of the witnesses could be explained by
the forensic testing done on them. But in the end, one could summarize the
extensive evidence surrounding the hatchet’s possible identification by saying
that the hatchets and sheaths were somewhat similar, but no more.

[Page 322]

The false statements

When questioned by the police as to why he would
have put garbage in front of the neighbour’s house, the appellant denied having
done so, nor did he mention his disposing of the coat and boots. An expert
witness said that the killer’s coat and boots would normally have been
bloodstained. Generally speaking, Wildman gave various differing versions as
regards the boots, the coat, and the garbage bags, the hatchet, and, through
various statements to the police and to others, such as his landlord McIsaac,
and Dan Curry, he appears to have given them the run-around intentionally, was
very uncooperative and, as a result, his conduct must be regarded as highly
suspect.

On this evidence, standing alone, one could not
say that a verdict of guilty would have been unreasonable; nor could one
consider likewise unreasonable a jury entertaining a reasonable doubt and
acquitting. There is strong circumstantial evidence upon which a jury could be
satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, but I would be unable to say that it was
overwhelming, as said the Court of Appeal.

What justified the Court of Appeal in finding,
as they did, the evidence overwhelming was the result of the following
additional evidence.

Tricia disappeared on February 15 and her body
was discovered four days later on February 19. Prior to the 19th no one could
be sure that Tricia was dead, whether death was self‑inflicted or
involved another person, was accidental or intentional, the nature and location
of the wounds inflicted, the instrument, if any, used or probably used to
inflict the wounds. Yet, on February 16 Wildman phoned a Mr. Beyer, his divorce
lawyer, and told him “that his wife had accused him of killing Tricia with an
axe”.

After the discovery of Tricia’s body on the
19th, the police, because of the sheath found 28 inches

[Page 323]

from the body, started looking for a hatchet. On
that day a press release by the police said that “she had been battered with a
blunt instrument”. On that evening the police interrogated Wildman about a
hatchet.

On the 20th Wildman said to a witness that
“someone put an axe in Tricia’s head”. It was only on February 23 that the
police revealed with precision the nature of the wounds, and only on February
28 the use of a hatchet.

On February 19, 23 and 25, the appellant
mentioned to various persons that “Tricia had been killed with an axe”. His
knowledge of the circumstances of the crime on the 19th, 23rd and 25th is not
unexplained. He was questioned with insistance by the police on the 19th about
a hatchet and the police press release referred to Tricia having been battered
with a blunt instrument. It would not be unreasonable for Wildman to suspect
that the police were of the view that the blunt instrument was a hatchet and
that some of the wounds, if not all, would be to the head, since Tricia had
been “battered” to death. But what needed explanation was his statement to his
lawyer on the 16th. Whoever knew those details on that date had to either have participated
or witnessed the crime, or have received the information from someone who had.
In his testimony he attempted to explain this knowledge; Wildman testified as
follows:

Q. Prior to that question of a hatchet
being discussed between you and Detective Sergeant Stephenson, had any other
police officer told you about a hatchet, or asked you about a hatchet?

A. No, sir.

Q. Had any other person?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. When?

A. On Thursday, the day after Tricia
disappeared.

He was not questioned any further about this
person because of a ruling the trial judge had made in the course of the
Crown’s case.

[Page 324]

The ruling

In the course of cross-examining Mrs. Beverly
McIsaac and Mr. Ronald McIsaac, the attorney for the defence was denied the
right to elicit the contents of a conversation which took place over the phone
at the McIsaacs’ on February 16. Wildman was at the McIsaacs’ when the phone
rang. Mrs. McIsaac answered and she identified the voice as being that of
Mrs. Wildman. Mrs. Wildman accused her, Mr. McIsaac and John Wildman of
“murdering Tricia with a hatchet”. Mr. McIsaac got on the phone and would have
corroborated the conversation, though uncertain as to the identity of the voice
because he had not, as his wife had many times previously, ever spoken to Mrs.
Wildman on the phone. The McIsaacs’ had been examined on the matter at the
preliminary inquiry.

Mrs. McIsaac:

Q. I understand, Mrs. McIsaac, that on
Thursday night—that would be the day after Tricia Paquette disappeared, I
understand that you received a phone call from someone who identified herself
as Joyce Wildman. Am I correct?

A. Yes.

Q. The phone call went to your apartment
and you answered it?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you agree with me that, whoever
made that phone call indicated to you, or sorry, that they accused you and Ron
and John Wildman of murdering Tricia Paquette with a hatchet?

A. That is right. They did.

Q. That is the day after Tricia
disappeared?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you, prior to that day, ever talk on
the telephone with Joyce Wildman?

A. She would phone and start arguing with
us and kept calling us murderers and that.

And, later on:

Q. If I might go back to the telephone call
you received from someone who said she was Joyce Wildman, on Thursday, during
that telephone conversation, did your husband speak to that person?

[Page 325]

A. I answered the phone and my husband got
the phone and she called him a murderer and John and I murderers.

Q. Did John talk to that person on the
telephone or was it just you and your husband?

A. Just my husband and I.

Q. When she said that you and Ron and John
had murdered Tricia with an axe or hatchet, do you remember which it was she
said? An axe or hatchet?

A. It was a hatchet, I think.

Q. When she said that, do you remember what
you

said to her?

A. I just told her no, we didn’t… have
anything to do with it.

Q. Up to that point, was that the first
time that you can remember any mention being made of a hatchet, either on the
radio or in the newspaper or T.V.?

A. It seemed to me that that person knew
about the hatchet before anyone else did.

Q. Was that the first time that the hatchet
was

brought to your attention?

A. Yes.

Mr. McIsaac:

Q. I understand, Mr. McIsaac, that, on the
Thursday after Tricia was missing, that you received a phone call from a person
who told you they were Joyce Wildman; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And in that phone conversation, this
woman, who said she was Joyce Wildman, accused you and your wife and John
Wildman of killing Patricia with a hatchet?

A. That is right.

Q. I suggest to you that you took the phone
from your wife and discussed that, or heard that same accusation from the
person who said she was Joyce Wildman; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Up to that point, after Tricia had been
missing, had you received any information from the newspaper or radio or T.V.?

A. Yes.

Q. Just a moment. Was there any
information, from those sources, that there was a hatchet involved in killing
Tricia, or was the phone call the first time that the hatchet was brought to
your attention?

[Page 326]

A. Yes, it was the first time.

Q. When you talked to that person on the
phone, who said she was Joyce Wildman, did it appear they had been drinking or
could you tell?

A. I couldn’t tell.

Q. From the time you became John Wildman’s
landlord, you had a number of times to see and talk to Joyce Wildman?

A. Yes.

Q. She came to John’s apartment a number of
times?

A. Yes.

Q. Did the voice on the telephone, on
Thursday night, accusing you of killing Tricia with a hatchet, did that sound
to you like Joyce Wildman’s voice?

A. I really couldn’t say because I never
talked to her on the phone before.

All agree that proof of the conversation was
admissible and that the trial judge erred in disallowing it. The result is
twofold. It left unexplained the most incriminating evidence adduced against
Wildman. It also deprived him of the right to put before the jury the fact
that, for some reason, his wife, or somebody purporting to be his wife, knew
before the body was discovered that Tricia was dead, that she had been murdered
and that the instrument used was a hatchet!

The importance of this evidence to the defence
was directly proportional to the incriminating effect the evidence it sought to
explain had against the accused. Unexplained, that knowledge by the accused was
very incriminating and, as I said before, made the circumstantial evidence
“overwhelming” as said the Court of Appeal.

Witness the fact that the Crown, when addressing
the jury, stressed at some length the fact that Wildman had incriminating
knowledge of the circumstances of her death.

Witness also what the trial judge said in his
charge:

Mr. Beyer was called by the defence, and he
was acting for Wildman. In cross‑examination by Mr. Swan-

[Page 327]

son he said that the accused spoke to
him—and I do not recall whether it was on the telephone or in person—on
February the 16th—no, he said he had a call from Wildman and that Wildman said
that his wife was accusing him of killing Tricia with an axe. That is Thursday
the 16th. The child’s body had not yet been found.

The accused, as a result of the exclusion of Mr.
and Mrs. McIsaacs’ testimony on that point, was the only one left asserting the
existence of this accusation by his wife on the phone.

The trial judge told the jury:

You alone are the judges of the facts. You
will have to judge whether that was said and how Joyce could know. Did she tell
this to John or accuse him of this? You have to judge, did Mr. Beyer hear that,
or is it correctly reported by him, and you may think that Mr. Beyer has no
interest in this matter.

The Crown then asks for you to consider
Guillemette’s evidence. About three days before the body was found—no, I will
deal with this aspect of it in a moment.

If you do not accept the evidence that
Joyce told him on Thursday, February the 16th, that Tricia was killed with an
axe, how could he know? The Crown says that the only person or persons who
could know were the person or persons who in fact used that axe to kill Tricia.
You will recall that the gentleman who owned the hairdressing establishment was
called, and he said that Joyce was working there from fairly early in the
morning on Wednesday the 15th until 4.00 o’clock in the afternoon.

If you accept his evidence, then Joyce was
not at the river that morning with Tricia.

The jury’s request is very eloquent as regards
the importance of the evidence of the knowledge and, as a corollary, the
damaging effect of excluding its explanation.

After four hours of deliberation the jury
returned and asked the judge the following:

FOREMAN OF THE JURY: We would like the details
of the timing relative to the January 20th events concerning the receptionist
at the Children’s Aid Society, of Joyce Smoke, Detective White, and Mr.
Wildman’s personal recollection of that time period.

[Page 328]

We would like to re-hear the testimony of
the solicitor, Mr. Beyer.

His LORDSHIP: The whole of it?

THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Your lordship, we
feel it is relatively short and we would like to hear what he has to say.

As regards Mr. Beyer’s testimony, the judge
read his personal notes to the jury, and said:

Now, if you are not satisfied with that,
would you like to hear the tape?

FOREMAN OF THE JURY: Sir, I would like to
hear, I would like to hear the last portion of the tape pertaining to the
discussion re the remarks attributed to Mrs. Wildman, made to Mr. Beyer by Mr.
Wildman regarding the hatchet.

His LORDSHIP: All right.

After hearing the tape, the jury retired and
came back an hour and a half later with a verdict of guilty.

Mr. Beyer’s testimony was crucial and in fact
fatal to the accused. The judge put the matter quite properly when he told the
jury that if they did not accept the accused’s (sole) evidence that Joyce had
told him “that Tricia was killed with an axe, how could he know?”

The judge was quite right in this. And the
inference to be drawn from this knowledge of the accused would then be that he
had to have been there.

The proviso of s. 613(1) (b)(iii)

As regards resort by a Court of Appeal to the
proviso of s. 613(1) (b)(iii) the law has been clearly laid down by this
Court in Colpitis v. The Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739. Cartwright
J.’s formulation of the test was as follows, at p. 744:

…once error in law has been found to have
occurred at the trial, the onus resting upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court
that the verdict would necessarily have been the same if such error had not
occurred. The satisfaction of this onus is a condition precedent to the right
of the Appellate Court to apply the terms of the subsection at all. The Court
is not bound to apply the subsection merely because this onus is discharged.

[Page 329]

Under our system of law a man on trial for
his life is entitled to the verdict of a jury which has been accurately and
adequately instructed as to the law. The construction of s. 592(1)(b)(iii)
contended for by the Crown in this case would transfer from the jury to the
Court of Appeal the question whether the evidence established the guilt of the
accused beyond a reasonable doubt. To adapt the words of Lord Herschell in Makin
v. Attorney General for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57 at
70, the judges would in truth be substituted for the jury, the verdict would
become theirs and theirs alone, and would be arrived at upon a perusal of the
evidence without any opportunity of seeing the demeanour of the witnesses and
weighing the evidence with the assistance which this affords.

The determination as to whether the verdict
“would necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred” is
generally made upon a reading of the evidence put to the jury.

But when the error of law is the preclusion of
exculpatory evidence, then the determination must be made with regard to the
entirety of the evidence, that evidence having been included, and in the light
of the effect the excluded evidence could, within reason, possibly have had on
the evidence that did go to the jury. Any reasonable effect that excluded
evidence could have had on the jury should, in applying s. 613(1) (b)(iii),
enure to the benefit of the accused. When the excluded evidence is, as in this
case, of a certain importance and might reasonably have had an effect on the
jury then, even assuming we in this Court would have nevertheless convicted, I
find it difficult to be satisfied that the jury would have necessarily agreed
with us. Any reasonable, possible effect of that excluded evidence on the jury
should enure to the benefit of Wildman.

The effect of the McIsaacs’ testimony would have
been to corroborate the accused’s explanation and thereby to tend to negate the
inference that the accused had to have been there—the very inference that the
jury was concerned about. Had that evidence been adduced, it would have then
been open to the jury not to entertain the inference and, as a result, we would
then be left with evidence which, as I have already stated, while sufficient to
support a conviction, would not make an acquittal unreasonable; therefore the
Crown has

[Page 330]

not, in my respectful view, met the onus of
satisfying me “that the verdict would necessarily have been the same”, had the
defence been allowed, as was its right, to adduce the evidence of the telephone
conversation of February 16 (see Colpitts v. The Queen, supra).
I would, therefore, on this ground allow the appeal, and order a new trial.

The other grounds

The other two grounds for appeal can be disposed
of together. Being of the view that a new trial should be ordered, I would
normally, in order to avoid any further appeal arising out of those grounds,
deal with the matter as to whether the spouse would, at the trial be a
compellable witness under the circumstances of this case and, if not, whether
and to what extent comment could be made by the Crown as to why she was not
called to testify. But those problems will not arise at the new trial in view
of the introduction to s. 4 of the Canada Evidence Act supra, of subs.
(3.1), which covers the situation as follows:

(3.1) The wife or husband of a person
charged with an offence against any of sections 203 , 204 , 218 , 219 , 220 , 222 ,
223 , 245 , 245.1 , 245.2  or 245.3  of the Criminal Code  where the
complainant or victim is under the age of fourteen years is a competent and
compellable witness for the prosecution without the consent of the person
charged.

The new trial will be governed by that section.

Indeed s. 36(d) of the Interpretation
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, states that:

36. Where an
enactment (in this section called the “former enactment”) is repealed and
another enactment (in this section called the “new enactment”) is substituted
therefor,

…

(d) the procedure established
by the new enactment shall be followed as far as it can be adapted thereto in
the recovery or enforcement of penalties and forfeitures incurred, and in the
enforcement of rights, existing or accruing under the former enactment or in a
proceeding in relation to matters that have happened before the repeal;

[Page 331]

This is an enactment of the common law rule that
there is no vested right in procedure along with a limitation to the effect
that the following of the new procedure must be feasible (see R. v. Ali,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 221). Therefore, a new procedure applies to pending suits
without breaching the “rule of interpretation to the effect that statutes
ought, if possible, to be interpreted so as to respect vested rights” (see E.A.
Driedger, “The Retrospective Operation of Statutes”, Legal Essays in Honour
of Arthur Moxon, University of Toronto Press, 1953, pp. 5 et seq.)
Section 36(J) of the Interpretation Act uses procedure in a wide
sense and that expression includes the rules of evidence. On the point, Phipson
on Evidence, 13th ed., 1982, at p. 1:

Law is commonly divided into substantive
law, which defines rights, duties and liabilities; and adjective law, which
defines the procedure, pleading and proof by which the substantive law is
applied in practice.

The rules of procedure regulate the general
conduct of litigation; the object of pleading is to ascertain for the guidance
of the parties and the court the material facts in issue in each particular
case; proof is the establishment of such facts by proper legal means to the
satisfaction of the court, and in this sense includes disproof. The
first-mentioned term is, however, often used to include the other two.

(Emphasis added.)

Some rules of evidence must nevertheless be
excluded for they are not merely procedural, they create rights and not merely
expectations and, as such, are not only adjectival but of a substantive nature.
Such has been found to be the case for rules or laws creating presumptions
arising out of certain facts. (See, for example, as regards the presumption of
advancement in questions of ownership of property as between husband and wife, Bingeman
v. McLaughlin, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 548.) P. Roubier, in Le
droit transitoire, 2nd ed., Paris, Dalloz et Sirey, 1960, at p. 237,
rationalizes their exclusion because, says he, [TRANSLATION] “As these rules
are independent of the existence of an issue, they are not affected by the fact
that there is

[Page 332]

litigation in progress”. Such is also the case
of the lawyer-client privilege resulting from a person’s right to the
confidentiality of his lawyer, irrespective of whether there is litigation,
(see Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 860). The courts,
for obvious reasons of logic, have not excluded under new laws, for want of
certain new prerequisites to its admissibility, evidence which had complied
with the prerequisites of the previous. R. v. Ali, supra, is an
illustration of this approach, using the proviso “as far as it can be adapted
thereto” of s. 36(d) of the Interpretation Act. (For a more
thorough review of the case law on the matter, see Pierre-André Côté, Interprétation
des lois (1982), at pp. 155 et seq.) But such is not the case as
regards a spouse’s incompetence to testify.

Spouses do not have a substantive right to the
confidentiality as to what either was seen doing by the other or to the
confidentiality of what was to the other communicated by either.

The incompetence and uncompellability of s. 4  of
the Canada Evidence Act , supra, is not the result of a
substantive right to confidentiality and is merely procedural.

If a new trial ensues, Mrs. Wildman will be a
competent and compellable witness for the prosecution without the consent of
the accused.

To conclude, I would allow the appeal, quash the
conviction and order a new trial.

Appeal allowed and new trial ordered.

Following the seizure of their cannabis cargo
by the police in Canadian waters, appellants were charged with importing
cannabis into Canada and with
possession for the purpose of trafficking. At trial, the accused advanced the
defence of necessity claiming that they did not plan to import into Canada as their destination was Alaska but that, following a series of
mechanical problems aggravated by deteriorating weather, they had decided for
the safety of ship and crew to seek refuge on the Canadian shoreline to repair
the vessel. The vessel found a sheltered cove but grounded amidships on a rock.
The defence tendered evidence that the captain, fearing he was going to
capsize, ordered the men to offload the cargo. When the police arrived on the
scene

[Page 233]

most of the marihuana was onshore. The
accused also relied upon a “botanical defence” arguing that the Crown had
failed to prove that the ship’s cargo was “Cannabis sativa L.” as
provided for in the schedule to the Narcotic Control Act. The trial
judge, however, withdrew the botanical defence from the jury. The appellants
were acquitted. The Court of Appeal set aside the acquittal and ordered a new
trial holding that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant the Crown’s
application to call rebuttal evidence with respect to the condition of the
vessel. The Court also held that the trial judge was correct in withdrawing the
botanical defence from the jury.

Held: The
appeals should be dismissed.

Per Ritchie,
Dickson, Chouinard and Lamer JJ.: The defence of necessity is available in
Canada and should be recognized as an excuse operating by virtue of
s. 7(3)  of the Criminal Code . The essential criteria for the
operation of the defence is the moral involuntariness of the wrongful action
measured on the basis of society’s expectation of appropriate and normal
resistance to pressure. The defence only applies in circumstances of imminent
risk where the action was taken to avoid a direct and immediate peril. The act
in question may only be characterized as involuntary where it was inevitable,
unavoidable, and where no reasonable opportunity for an alternative course of
action that did not involve a breach of the law was available to the accused.
As well the harm inflicted by the violation of the law must be less than the
harm the accused sought to avoid. Where it was contemplated or ought to have
been contemplated by the accused that his actions would likely give rise to an
emergency requiring the breach of the law it may not be open to him to claim
his response was involuntary; mere negligence or involvement in criminal or
immoral activity when the emergency arose, however, will not disentitle an
accused from relying upon the defence. Finally, where sufficient evidence is
placed before the Court to raise the issue of necessity the onus falls upon the
Crown to meet the defence and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
accused’s act was voluntary; the accused bears no burden of proof. In this
case, the trial judge was correct in instructing the jury upon necessity,
however, he erred in his directions to them. Although he adequately charged the
jury upon the majority of issues pertinent to the proper test for neces-

[Page 234]

sity he did not direct their attention to the
issue of the availability of a reasonable legal alternative. This error goes to
the heart of the defence and justifies a new trial.

The trial judge was correct in withdrawing
the appellants’ botanical defence from the jury as the phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” in the Narcotic Control Act was meant to embrace all
forms of marihuana. In keeping with the doctrine of contemporanea expositio the
meaning to be given to this phrase is the meaning the botanical community
ascribed to it when the Act became law in 1961. At that time, botanists were
virtually unanimous in holding that cannabis (marihuana) consisted only of one
species and that the plants which some botanists referred to as “Cannabis
indica Lam.” and “Cannabis ruderalis Jan.” were merely subspecies of
“Cannabis sativa L.”. Where the legislature has deliberately chosen a
specific scientific or technical term to represent an equally specific and
particular class of things, it would do violence to Parliament’s intent to give
a new meaning to that term whenever the taxonomic consensus among members of
the relevant scientific fraternity has shifted.

Since a new trial must be ordered there is no
need to decide whether the trial judge erred in refusing to allow the Crown to
tender rebuttal evidence.

Per Wilson J.:
The defence of necessity must be grounded either on excuse or on justification.
The only way in which the defence of necessity can be applied as an excuse is
where the accused’s act is done in the interest of self-preservation. Such an
act must be characterized not by the voluntariness of the act but by its
unpunishable nature. As such, the act may be exempted from culpability if it
arose in a life-threatening situation of necessity. Where, however, a defence
by way of excuse is premised on compassion for the accused or on a perceived
failure to achieve a desired instrumental end of punishment, the judicial
response must be to fashion an appropriate sentence but to reject the defence
as such.

[Page 235]

Where necessity is invoked as a
justification, the accused must show that he operated under a conflicting legal
duty which made his seemingly wrongful act right. Such justification must be
premised on a right or duty recognized by law. This excludes conduct attempted
to be justified on the ground of an ethical duty internal to the conscience of
the accused as well as conduct sought to be justified on the basis of a perceived
maximization of social utility resulting from it. Rather, the conduct must stem
from the accused’s duty to satisfy his legal obligations and to respect the
principle of the universality of rights. The justification therefore does not
depend on the immediacy or “normative involuntariness” of the accused’s act.
Finally, the justification is not established simply by showing a conflict of
legal duties. Since the defence rests on the rightfulness of the accused’s
choice of one over the other, the rule of proportionality is central to the
evaluation of the justification.

The judgment of Ritchie, Dickson, Chouinard and
Lamer JJ. was delivered by

DICKSON J.—In this case we consider (i) a
recurring legal problem, the “necessity” defence; (ii) what is commonly known
as the “botanical” or “cannabis species” defence.

I Facts

The appellants are drug smugglers. At trial,
they led evidence that in early 1979 three of the appellants were employed,
with sixteen crew members, to deliver, by ship (the Samarkanda) a load
of cannabis (marihuana) worth $6,000,000 or $7,000,000 from a point in
international waters off the coast of Colombia, South America, to a drop point
in international waters 200 miles off the

[Page 237]

coast of Alaska. The ship left Tumaco, Colombia, empty with a port clearance document stating the
destination to be Juneau, Alaska. For three weeks the ship remained in international waters off the
coast of Colombia. While there,
a DC-6 aircraft made four trips, dropping into the water shrimp nets with a
total of 634 bales of cannabis which were retrieved by the ship’s longboats.

A “communications” package was also dropped from
a light aircraft, giving instructions for a rendez-vous with another vessel,
the Julia “B”, which was to pick up the cargo of cannabis from the Samarkanda
in international waters off the coast of Alaska. En route, according to the defence evidence, the vessel
began to encounter a series of problems; engine breakdowns, overheating
generators and malfunctioning navigation devices, aggravated by deteriorating
weather. In the meantime the fourth appellant, Nelson, part owner of the
illicit cargo, and three other persons left Seattle in a small boat, the Whitecap, intending to rendez‑vous
with the Samarkanda at the drop point in Alaska. The problems of the Samarkanda intensified as fuel was
consumed. The vessel became lighter, the intakes in the hull for sea water,
used as a coolant, lost suction and took in air instead, causing the generators
to overheat. At this point the vessel was 180 miles from the Canadian coastline.
The weather worsened. There were eight-to-ten-foot swells and a rising wind. It
was finally decided for the safety of ship and crew to seek refuge on the
Canadian shoreline for the purpose of making temporary repairs. The Whitecap
found a sheltered cove on the west coast of Vancouver Island, “No Name
Bay”. The Samarkanda followed the Whitecap into the Bay but later
grounded amidships on a rock because the depth sounder was not working. The
tide ran out. The vessel listed severely to starboard, to the extent that the
Captain, fearing the vessel was going to capsize, ordered the men to offload
the

[Page 238]

cargo. That is a brief summary of the defence
evidence.

Early on the morning of May 22, 1979 police officers entered No Name Bay
in a marked police boat with siren sounding. The Samarkanda and the Whitecap
were arrested, as were all the appellants except Perka and Nelson, the same
morning. The vessels and 33.49 tons of cannabis marihuana were seized by the
police officers.

Charged with importing cannabis into Canada and with possession for the purpose
of trafficking, the appellants claimed they did not plan to import into Canada or to leave their cargo of cannabis
in Canada. They had planned to
make repairs and leave. Expert witnesses on marine matters called by the
defence testified that the decision to come ashore was, in the opinion of one
witness, expedient and prudent and in the opinion of another, essential. At
trial, counsel for the Crown alleged that the evidence of the ship’s distress
was a recent fabrication. Crown counsel relied on the circumstances under which
the appellants were arrested to belie the “necessity” defence; when the police
arrived on the scene most of the marihuana was already onshore, along with
plastic ground sheets, battery operated lights, liquor, food, clothing, camp
stoves, and sleeping bags. Nevertheless, the jury believed the appellants and
acquitted them.

The acquittal was reversed on appeal. After the
close of the case for the accused at trial, the Crown had applied to call
rebuttal evidence with respect to the condition of the vessel. The trial judge
refused the Crown’s application. He held that the defence evidence relating to
the happenings in the engine room should not have caught the prosecution by
surprise and in the circumstances, the conditions for calling rebuttal evidence
had not been met. At trial the defence also relied upon a “botanical defence”
arguing that the Crown had failed to prove that the ship’s cargo was “cannabis
sativa L.”, as provided for in the Schedule to the Narcotic Control Act,
R.S.C. 1970, c. N-1. Thus

[Page 239]

the appellants had committed no offence. The
trial judge withdrew the botanical defence from the jury. On appeal by the
Crown, the Court of Appeal, in allowing the appeal, held that the trial judge
had erred in refusing to grant leave to the Crown to call rebuttal evidence
and, on the cross-appeal held that the judge was correct in withdrawing the
botanical defence from the jury.

The appellants have now appealed to this Court.
In addition to claiming that the Court of Appeal erred in reversing the trial
judge on the rebuttal issue, the appellants contend that the Court of Appeal
applied the wrong standard in ordering a new trial. The appellants also contend
that the botanical defence should have been left with the jury. The Crown, of
course, takes the opposite position on each of these questions and has raised
one of its own: whether the trial judge erred in charging the jury with respect
to the necessity defence. Because the appellants raised a preliminary objection
to this Court even addressing this last issue, I will deal with it first.

The appellants argue that this Court should not
consider the Crown’s contentions with respect to the necessity defence because
the Court of Appeal decided that the defence was available and the jury could
properly be instructed on it. Accordingly, the appellants contend the Crown’s
argument with respect to the defence of necessity is really in the nature of a
cross‑appeal. Since the Crown does not have an appeal as of right to this
Court and since leave has not been granted, the appellants say this Court does
not have jurisdiction to decide the issues raised by the “cross-appeal”.

[Page 240]

In both civil and criminal matters it is open to
a respondent to advance any argument to sustain the judgment below, and he is
not limited to appellants’ points of law. A party cannot, however, raise an
entirely new argument which has not been raised below and in relation to which
it might have been necessary to adduce evidence at trial. See Brown v. Dean,
[1910] A.C. 373; Dormuth v. Untereiner, [1964] S.C.R. 122; The
SS. “Tordenskjold” v. The SS. “Euphemia” (1908), 41 S.C.R. 154; Dairy
Foods, Inc. v. Co-opérative Agricole de Granby, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 651. That
is not the case here. The necessity defence was raised and fully argued in both
courts below. Therefore, if we regard the Crown’s submission as an argument to
sustain the judgment below, this Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to hear and
decide the issue. Even if we regard the Crown’s submission with regard to
necessity as seeking to vary the decision of the court below, the Rules of
the Supreme Court of Canada, Rule 29(1), would still give this Court the
power to treat the whole case as open:

29. (1) If a respondent intends at the
hearing of an appeal to argue that the decision of the court below should be
varied, he shall, within thirty days after the service of the notice of appeal
or within such time as a Judge allows, give notice of such intention to all parties
who may be affected thereby. The omission to give such notice shall not in
any way limit the power of the Court to treat the whole case as open but
may, in the discretion of the Court, be a ground for an adjournment of the
hearing.

(Emphasis added.)

In the event, at the hearing of the appeal the
Court did treat the whole case as open and ruled that the Court would address
the merits of the Crown’s contentions with respect to the necessity defence.
That I now propose to do.

[Page 241]

II The Necessity Defence

a) History and Background

From earliest times it has been maintained that
in some situations the force of circumstances makes it unrealistic and unjust
to attach criminal liability to actions which, on their face, violate the law.
Aristotle, in the Nicomachean Ethics, Book III, 1110a (trans. D. Ross,
1975, at p. 49), discusses the jettisoning of cargo from a ship in
distress and remarks that “any sensible man does so” to secure the safety of
himself and his crew. Pollard, arguing for the defendant in the case of Reniger
v. Fogossa (1551), 1 Plowd. 1 at p. 18, maintained:

…in every Law there are some Things which
when they happen a Man may break the Words of the Law, and yet not break the
Law itself; and such Things are exempted out of the Penalty of the Law, and the
Law privileges them although they are done against the Letter of it, for
breaking the Words of the Law is not breaking the Law, so as the Intent of the
Law is not broken. And therefore the Words of the Law of Nature, of the Law of
this Realm, and of other Realms, and of the Law of God will also yield and give
Way to some Acts and things done against the Words of the same Laws, and that
is, where the Words of them are broken to avoid greater Inconveniences, or
through Necessity, or by Compulsion…

In Leviathan (Pelican ed. 1968), at
p. 157, Hobbes writes:

If a man by the terrour of present death,
be compelled to doe a fact against the Law, he is totally Excused; because no
Law can oblige a man to abandon his own preservation. And supposing such a Law
were obligatory: yet a man would reason thus, if I doe it not, I die presently:
if I doe it, I die afterwards; therefore by doing it, there is time of life
gained; Nature therefore compells him to the fact.

To much the same purpose Kant, in The Metaphysical
Elements of Justice (trans. Ladd, 1965), discussing the actions of a person
who, to save his own life sacrifices that of another, says at p. 41:

[Page 242]

A penal law applying to such a situation
could never have the effect intended, for the threat of an evil that is still
uncertain (being condemned to death by a judge) cannot outweigh the fear of an
evil that is certain (being drowned). Hence, we must judge that, although an
act of self-preservation through violence is not inculpable, it still is unpunishable…

In those jurisdictions in which such a general
principle has been recognized or codified it is most often referred to by the
term “necessity”. Classic and harrowing instances which have been cited to
illustrate the arguments both for and against this principle include the mother
who steals food for her starving child, the shipwrecked mariners who resort to
cannibalism (R. v. Dudley and Stephens (1884), 14 Q.B.D. 273) or
throw passengers overboard to lighten a sinking lifeboat (United States v. Holmes,
26 Fed. Cas. 360 (1842)), and the more mundane case of the motorist
who exceeds the speed limit taking an injured person to the hospital.

In the United States a general defence of necessity has been recognized in the statutory
law of a number of states and has found its way into the Model Penal Code of
the American Law Institute. Attempts have been made, with mixed success, in
American jurisdictions to apply the defence to multifarious types of conduct,
including cases involving prison escapes, United States v. Bailey, 444
U.S. 394 (1980); social protests and civil disobedience, United States v.
Moylan, 417 F.2d 1002 (4th Cir. 1969), certiorari denied 397 U.S.
910; United States v. Cullen, 454 F.2d 386 (7th Cir. 1971); and
unorthodox medical treatments, United States v. Randall, 104 Daily Wash.
L. Rep. 2249 (D.C. Super. Ct.
1976); United States
v. Richardson, 588 F.2d 1235 (9th Cir. 1978).

In England, opinion as to the existence of a general defence of necessity has
varied. Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Law (abridged edition of
Wm. Hardcastle Browne, edited by Bernard C. Gavit, 1941) mentioned two
principles capable of being read as underlying such a defence. In Book 4, chap.
2, at p. 761, he says:

[Page 243]

As punishments are only inflicted for the
abuse of that free will, which God has given to man, it is just that a man
should be excused for those acts, which are done through unavoidable force and
compulsion.

Then under the rubric “Choice Between Two Evils”
he writes:

Choice Between Two Evils. This species of necessity is the result of reason and reflection
and obliges a man to do an act, which, without such obligation, would be
criminal. This occurs, when a man has his choice of two evils set before him,
and chooses the less pernicious one. He rejects the greater evil and chooses
the less. As where a man is bound to arrest another for a capital offence, and
being resisted, kills the offender, rather than permit him to escape.

Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of
England (1883), vol. II, p. 108, refers to compulsion by necessity as
one of the curiosities of the law, “a subject on which the law of England is so
vague that, if cases raising the question should ever occur the judges would
practically be able to lay down any rule which they considered expedient”. At
page 110 he concedes it just possible to imagine cases in which the expedience
of breaking the law would be so overwhelmingly great that people might be
justified in doing so but says that “these cases cannot be defined beforehand, and
must be adjudicated upon by a jury afterwards”.

Later English commentators have had even more
doubts on the matter. Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed. 1976), vol. 11, para. 26,
has this to say on the subject:

26. Necessity. Although there are cases in which it is not criminal for a person
to cause harm to the person or property of another, there is no general rule
giving rise to a defence of necessity, and it seems that, outside the specific
cases mentioned, it is no defence to a crime to show that its commission was
necessary in order to avoid a greater evil to the defendant or to others.

While Glanville Williams (“The Defence of
Necessity”, (1953) 6 C.L.P. 216) has been able to assert “with some assurance”
that the defence of necessity is recognized by English law, the authors

[Page 244]

of Smith & Hogan, Criminal Law (4th
ed. 1978) at pp. 193-94 state that “the better view appears to be that a
general defence of necessity is not recognized by the English courts at the
present time”.

A Working Party of the English Law Commission
proposed to resolve this uncertainty by recognizing a general defence of
necessity, but one that was carefully circumscribed to prevent its being
invoked in extravagant and inappropriate cases. The English Law Commission,
however, rejected the Working Party proposal and instead made two
counterproposals (Law Com. No. 83, Part IV) which recognized the possibility of
the existence of a defence of necessity at common law but clearly disapproved
of its principles. The Commission proposed:

First, that no attempt should be made to
establish the defence by legislation. Secondly, that the proposed Act should
expressly abolish any such defence as may exist at common law.

In Canada the existence and the extent of a general defence of necessity was
discussed by this Court in Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R.
616. As to whether or not the defence exists at all I had occasion to say at
p. 678:

On the authorities it is manifestly
difficult to be categorical and state that there is a law of necessity,
paramount over other laws, relieving obedience from the letter of the law. If
it does exist, it can go no further than to justify non-compliance in urgent
situations of clear and imminent peril when compliance with the law is
demonstrably impossible.

Subsequent to Morgentaler, the courts
appear to have assumed that a defence of necessity does exist in Canada. On the later trial of
Dr. Morgentaler, the defence of necessity was again raised on a charge of
procuring a miscarriage. Some admissible evidence was made in support of the
plea and the case went to the jury, which rendered a verdict of not guilty. An
appeal by the Crown from the acquittal failed: R. v. Morgentaler (1976),
33 C.R.N.S. 244. Leave to appeal to this Court was

[Page 245]

refused, [1976] 1 S.C.R. x. The defence also
succeeded in four other cases: R. v. Guenther (1978), 8 Alta L.R. (2d)
125; R. v. Pootlass (1977), 1 C.R. (3d) 378; R. v. Fry (1977),
36 C.C.C. (2d) 396; R. v. Morris (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 163. In a
number of other cases the existence of such a defence was acknowledged but held
to be unavailable on the facts. Some examples include: R. v. Gilkes (1978),
8 C.R. (3d) 159; R. v. Doud (1982), 18 M.V.R. 146; R. v. Byng (1977),
20 N.S.R. (2d) 125; R. v. Walker (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 126 and R. v.
Salvador (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 521 (N.S.S.C. App. Div.), the case most
nearly analogous to the one at bar, of which more anon.

In the present appeal the Crown does not
challenge the appellants’ claim that necessity is a common law defence
preserved by Criminal Code  s. 7(3) . Rather, the Crown claims the trial
judge erred in (1) instructing the jury on the defence in light of the facts
and (2) imposing the burden of disproof of the defence upon the Crown, rather
than imposing the burden of proof on the appellants.

b) The Conceptual Foundation of the Defence

In Morgentaler, supra, I characterized
necessity as an “ill-defined and elusive concept”. Despite the apparently
growing consensus as to the existence of a defence of necessity that statement
is equally true today.

This is no doubt in part because, though
apparently laying down a single rule as to criminal liability, the “defence” of
necessity in fact is capable of embracing two different and distinct notions.
As Mr. Justice Macdonald observed succinctly but accurately in the Salvador case, supra, at p. 542:

Generally speaking, the defence of
necessity covers all cases where non-compliance with law is excused by an
emergency or justified by the pursuit of some greater good.

[Page 246]

Working Paper 29 of the Law Reform Commission of
Canada at p. 93 makes this same point in somewhat more detail:

The rationale of necessity, however, is
clear. Essentially it involves two factors. One is the avoidance of greater
harm or the pursuit of some greater good, the other is the difficulty of
compliance with law in emergencies. From these two factors emerge two different
but related principles. The first is a utilitarian principle to the effect
that, within certain limits, it is justifiable in an emergency to break the
letter of the law if breaking the law will avoid a greater harm than obeying
it. The second is a humanitarian principle to the effect that, again within
limits, it is excusable in an emergency to break the law if compliance would
impose an intolerable burden on the accused.

Despite any superficial similarities, these two
principles are in fact quite distinct and many of the confusions and the
difficulties in the cases (and, with respect, in academic discussions) arise
from a failure to distinguish between them.

Criminal theory recognizes a distinction between
“justifications” and “excuses”. A “justification” challenges the wrongfulness
of an action which technically constitutes a crime. The police officer who
shoots the hostage-taker, the innocent object of an assault who uses force to
defend himself against his assailant, the Good Samaritan who commandeers a car
and breaks the speed laws to rush an accident victim to the hospital, these are
all actors whose actions we consider rightful, not wrongful. For such
actions people are often praised, as motivated by some great or noble object.
The concept of punishment often seems incompatible with the social approval
bestowed on the doer.

In contrast, an “excuse” concedes the
wrongfulness of the action but asserts that the circumstances under which it
was done are such that it ought not to be attributed to the actor. The
perpetrator who is incapable, owing to a disease of the mind, of appreciating
the nature and consequences of his acts, the person who labours under a mistake
of fact, the drunkard, the sleepwalker: these are all

[Page 247]

actors of whose “criminal” actions we disapprove
intensely, but whom, in appropriate circumstances, our law will not punish.

Herbert Packer, The Limits of the Criminal
Sanction (1968), expresses the distinction thus at p. 113:

…conduct that we choose not to treat as
criminal is “justifiable” if our reason for treating it as noncriminal is
predominantly that it is conduct that we applaud, or at least do not actively
seek to discourage: conduct is “excusable” if we deplore it but for some
extrinsic reason conclude that it is not politic to punish it.

It will be seen that the two different
approaches to the “defence” of necessity from Blackstone forward correspond, the
one to a justification, the other to an excuse. As the examples cited above
illustrate, the criminal law recognizes and our Criminal Code  codifies a
number of specific categories of justification and of excuse. The remainder,
those instances that conform to the general principle but do not fall within
any specific category such as self-defence on the one hand or insanity on the
other, purportedly fall within the “residual defence” of necessity.

As a “justification” this residual defence can
be related to Blackstone’s concept of a “choice of evils”. It would exculpate
actors whose conduct could reasonably have been viewed as “necessary” in order
to prevent a greater evil than that resulting from the violation of the law. As
articulated, especially in some of the American cases, it involves a
utilitarian balancing of the benefits of obeying the law as opposed to
disobeying it, and when the balance is clearly in favour of disobeying,
exculpates an actor who contravenes a criminal statute. This is the “greater
good” formulation of the necessity defence: in some circumstances, it is
alleged, the values of society, indeed of the crimi-

[Page 248]

nal law itself, are better promoted by
disobeying a given statute than by observing it.

With regard to this conceptualization of a
residual defence of necessity, I retain the skepticism I expressed in Morgentaler,
supra, at p. 678. It is still my opinion that, “[n]o system of
positive law can recognize any principle which would entitle a person to
violate the law because on his view the law conflicted with some higher social
value”. The Criminal Code  has specified a number of identifiable
situations in which an actor is justified in committing what would otherwise be
a criminal offence. To go beyond that and hold that ostensibly illegal acts can
be validated on the basis of their expediency, would import an undue
subjectivity into the criminal law. It would invite the courts to second-guess
the legislature and to assess the relative merits of social policies underlying
criminal prohibitions. Neither is a role which fits well with the judicial
function. Such a doctrine could well become the last resort of scoundrels and
in the words of Edmund Davies L.J. in Southwark London Borough Council v.
Williams, [1971] Ch. 734,
it could “very easily become simply a mask for anarchy”.

Conceptualized as an “excuse”, however, the
residual defence of necessity is, in my view, much less open to criticism. It
rests on a realistic assessment of human weakness, recognizing that a liberal
and humane criminal law cannot hold people to the strict obedience of laws in
emergency situations where normal human instincts, whether of self-preservation
or of altruism, overwhelmingly impel disobedience. The objectivity of the
criminal law is preserved; such acts are still wrongful, but in the
circumstances they are excusable. Praise is indeed not bestowed, but pardon is,
when one does a wrongful act under pressure which, in the words of Aristotle in
the Nicomachean Ethics, supra, at

[Page 249]

p. 49, “overstrains human nature and which no
one could withstand”.

George Fletcher, Rethinking Criminal Law (1978),
decribes this view of necessity as “compulsion of circumstance” which
description points to the conceptual link between necessity as an excuse and
the familiar criminal law requirement that in order to engage criminal
liability, the actions constituting the actus reus of an offence must be
voluntary. Literally this voluntariness requirement simply refers to the need
that the prohibited physical acts must have been under the conscious control of
the actor. Without such control, there is, for purposes of the criminal law, no
act. The excuse of necessity does not go to voluntariness in this sense. The
lost alpinist who on the point of freezing to death breaks open an isolated
mountain cabin is not literally behaving in an involuntary fashion. He has
control over his actions to the extent of being physically capable of
abstaining from the act. Realistically, however, his act is not a “voluntary”
one. His “choice” to break the law is no true choice at all; it is
remorselessly compelled by normal human instincts. This sort of involuntariness
is often described as “moral or normative involuntariness”. Its place in
criminal theory is described by Fletcher at pp. 804-05 as follows:

The notion of voluntariness adds a valuable
dimension to the theory of excuses. That conduct is involuntary—even in the
normative sense—explains why it cannot fairly be punished. Indeed, H.L.A. Hart
builds his theory of excuses on the principle that the distribution of
punishment should be reserved for those who voluntarily break the law. Of the
arguments he advances for this principle of justice, the most explicit is that
it is preferable to live in a society where we have the maximum opportunity to
choose whether we shall become the subject of criminal liability. In addition,
Hart intimates that it is ideologically desirable for the government to treat
its citizens as self-actuating, choosing agents. This principle of respect for
individual autonomy is implicitly confirmed whenever those who lack an adequate
choice are excused for their offenses.

[Page 250]

I agree with this formulation of the rationale
for excuses in the criminal law. In my view this rationale extends beyond
specific codified excuses and embraces the residual excuse known as the defence
of necessity. At the heart of this defence is the perceived injustice of
punishing violations of the law in circumstances in which the person had no
other viable or reasonable choice available; the act was wrong but it is
excused because it was realistically unavoidable.

Punishment of such acts, as Fletcher notes at
p. 813, can be seen as purposeless as well as unjust:

…involuntary conduct cannot be deterred and
therefore it is pointless and wasteful to punish involuntary actors. This
theory …of pointless punishment, carries considerable weight in current
Anglo-American legal thought.

Relating necessity to the principle that the law
ought not to punish involuntary acts leads to a conceptualization of the
defence that integrates it into the normal rules for criminal liability rather
than constituting it as a sui generis exception and threatening to
engulf large portions of the criminal law. Such a conceptualization accords
with our traditional legal, moral and philosophic views as to what sorts of
acts and what sorts of actors ought to be punished. In this formulation it is a
defence which I do not hesitate to acknowledge and would not hesitate to apply
to relevant facts capable of satisfying its necessary prerequisites.

c) Limitations on the Defence

If the defence of necessity is to form a valid
and consistent part of our criminal law it must, as has been universally
recognized, be strictly controlled and scrupulously limited to situations that
correspond to its underlying rationale. That rationale, as I have indicated, is
the recognition that it is inappropriate to punish actions which are
normatively “involuntary”. The appropriate controls and limitations on the
defence of necessity are, there-

[Page 251]

fore, addressed to ensuring that the acts for
which the benefit of the excuse of necessity is sought are truly “involuntary”
in the requisite sense.

In Morgentaler, supra, I was of the view
that any defence of necessity was restricted to instances of non-compliance “in
urgent situations of clear and imminent peril when compliance with the law is
demonstrably impossible”. In my opinion this restriction focuses directly on
the “involuntariness” of the purportedly necessitous behaviour by providing a
number of tests for determining whether the wrongful act was truly the only
realistic reaction open to the actor or whether he was in fact making what in
fairness could be called a choice. If he was making a choice, then the wrongful
act cannot have been involuntary in the relevant sense.

The requirement that the situation be urgent and
the peril be imminent, tests whether it was indeed unavoidable for the actor to
act at all. In LaFave & Scott, Criminal Law (1972), at p. 388,
one reads:

It is sometimes said that the defense of
necessity does not apply except in an emergency—when the threatened harm is
immediate, the threatened disaster imminent. Perhaps this is but a way of
saying that, until the time comes when the threatened harm is immediate, there
are generally options open to the defendant to avoid the harm, other than the
option of disobeying the literal terms of the law—the rescue ship may appear,
the storm may pass; and so the defendant must wait until that hope of survival
disappears.

At a minimum the situation must be so emergent
and the peril must be so pressing that normal human instincts cry out for
action and make a counsel of patience unreasonable.

The requirement that compliance with the law be
“demonstrably impossible” takes this assessment one step further. Given that
the accused had to act, could he nevertheless realistically have acted to avoid
the peril or prevent the harm, without breaking the law? Was there a legal
way

[Page 252]

Out? I think this
is what Bracton means when he lists “necessity” as a defence, providing the
wrongful act was not “avoidable”. The question to be asked is whether the agent
had any real choice: could he have done otherwise? If there is a reasonable
legal alternative to disobeying the law, then the decision to disobey becomes a
voluntary one, impelled by some consideration beyond the dictates of
“necessity” and human instincts.

The importance of this requirement that there be
no reasonable legal alternative cannot be overstressed.

Even if the requirements for urgency and “no
legal way out” are met, there is clearly a further consideration. There must be
some way of assuring proportionality. No rational criminal justice system, no
matter how humane or liberal, could excuse the infliction of a greater harm to
allow the actor to avert a lesser evil. In such circumstances we expect the
individual to bear the harm and refrain from acting illegally. If he cannot
control himself we will not excuse him. According to Fletcher, this requirement
is also related to the notion of voluntariness (at p. 804):

…if the gap between the harm done and the
benefit accrued becomes too great, the act is more likely to appear voluntary
and therefore inexcusable. For example, if the actor has to blow up a whole
city in order to avoid the breaking of his finger, we might appropriately
expect him to endure the harm to himself. His surrendering to the threat in
this case violates our expectations of appropriate and normal resistance and
pressure. Yet as we lower the degree of harm to others and increase the
threatened harm to the person under duress we will reach a threshold at which,
in the language of the Model Penal Code, “a person of reasonable firmness”
would be “unable to resist”. Determining this threshold is patently a matter of
moral judgment about what we expect people to be able to resist in trying
situations. A valuable aid in making that judgment is comparing the competing
interests at stake and assessing the degree to which the actor inflicts harm
beyond the benefit that accrues from his action.

[Page 253]

I would therefore add to the preceding
requirements a stipulation of proportionality expressable, as it was in Morgentaler,
by the proviso that the harm inflicted must be less than the harm sought to
be avoided.

d) Illegality or Contributory Fault

The Crown submits that there is an additional
limitation on the availability of the defence of necessity. Citing R. v. Salvador, supra, it argues that because the appellants were committing a crime when
their necessitous circumstances arose, they should be denied the defence of
necessity as a matter of law.

In Salvador, Jones J.A. thought it highly relevant
that the accused were engaged in an illegal venture when they were forced
ashore. He would have denied the necessity defence in such circumstances. At
page 528, he said:

Should the appellants who embarked on an
illegal venture be now heard to plead necessity when it was the venture which
eventually gave rise to that necessity? One who undertakes an ocean voyage in a
56-foot yacht loaded to the gunnels with narcotics could scarcely be surprised
at getting into difficulties at sea or eventually running afoul of the law. To
put things in perspective, this was a voyage by a band of conspirators with a
cargo of contraband having every intention of violating the law of nations from
the outset. It is clear from their evidence that they were employed for that
purpose. I fail to see how any self-respecting nation, as a signatory to the
Convention on Narcotic Drugs, could countenance the defence of necessity or
distress in such circumstances.

Macdonald J.A. (Cooper and Hart JJ.A.
concurring) said, in agreement, after holding that the necessity defence was
not available because compliance with the law was not demonstrably impossible
(at p. 545):

Finally I have grave reservations whether
the defence of necessity has any application to the circumstances of this case.
I entertain such reservation primarily because the appellants were actively
engaged in the commission of a joint criminal venture when the circumstances
arose

[Page 254]

that they contend gave rise to, or
supported, the defence of necessity.

Were it indeed accurate that the fact of doing
something illegal when the necessitous circumstances arise will deny one the
benefit of the necessity defence, I would nevertheless doubt that this
principle would be relevant to the present case. The accused here (as
incidentally was also apparently the case in Salvador) were not doing anything illegal under Canadian law when the
necessity arose. They were on the high seas. They were conspiring to import
marihuana into the United States, not Canada. If
such a limitation on the necessity defence were to be formulated, in my view,
the accused should, at a minimum, be violating some law of the forum, not just
the law of a foreign state.

In any event, I have considerable doubt as to
the cogency of such a limitation. If the conduct in which an accused was
engaging at the time the peril arose was illegal, then it should clearly be
punished, but I fail to see the relevance of its illegal character to the
question of whether the accused’s subsequent conduct in dealing with this
emergent peril ought to be excused on the basis of necessity. At most the
illegality—or if one adopts Jones J.A.’s approach, the immorality—of the
preceding conduct will colour the subsequent conduct in response to the
emergency as also wrongful. But that wrongfulness is never in any doubt.
Necessity goes to excuse conduct, not to justify it. Where it is
found to apply it carries with it no implicit vindication of the deed to which
it attaches. That cannot be over-emphasized. Were the defence of necessity to
succeed in the present case, it would not in any way amount to a vindication of
importing controlled substances nor to a critique of the law prohibiting such
importation. It would also have nothing to say about the comparative social
utility of breaking the law against importing as compared to obeying the law.
The question, as I have said, is never whether what the accused has done is
wrongful. It is always and by definition, wrongful. The question is whether
what he has done is voluntary. Except in the limited

[Page 255]

sense I intend to discuss below, I do not see
the relevance of the legality or even the morality of what the accused was
doing at the time the emergency arose to this question of the voluntariness of
the subsequent conduct.

In Salvador, Jones J.A. cited sources in
support of his view that illegal conduct should act as a bar to the necessity
defence. These sources do not support that view but do support a closely
related notion—that if the accused’s own “fault” (including negligence or
recklessness) is responsible for the events giving rise to the necessity, he
may not rely on the necessity defence.

This limitation has found expression in several
American state statutes codifying the necessity defence, such as those of New
York and Illinois and has been adopted by the United States National Commission
on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws which recommended that the defence apply
only “where the situation developed through no fault of the actor”. A parallel
is sometimes drawn between such a limitation and the restrictions placed on the
availability of the largely analogous defence of duress. See, e.g., A.J.
Ashworth, “Reason, Logic and Criminal Liability”, (1975) 91 L.Q.R. 102 at
p. 106.

In my view the accused’s fault in bringing about
the situation later invoked to excuse his conduct can be relevant to the
availability of the defence of necessity, but not in the sweeping way suggested
by some of the commentators and in some of the statutory formulations. Insofar
as the accused’s “fault” reflects on the moral quality of the action taken to
meet the emergency, it is irrelevant to the issue of the availability of the
defence on the same basis as the illegality or immorality of the actions
preceding the emergency are irrelevant. If this fault is capable of attracting
criminal or civil liability in its own right, the culprit should be

[Page 256]

appropriately sanctioned. I see no basis,
however, for “transferring” such liability to the actions taken in response to
the emergency, especially where to do so would result in attaching criminal
consequences on the basis of negligence to actions which would otherwise be
excused.

In my view the better approach to the
relationship of fault to the availability of necessity as a defence is based
once again on the question of whether the actions sought to be excused were
truly “involuntary”. If the necessitous situation was clearly foreseeable to a
reasonable observer, if the actor contemplated or ought to have contemplated
that his actions would likely give rise to an emergency requiring the breaking
of the law, then I doubt whether what confronted the accused was in the
relevant sense an emergency. His response was in that sense not “involuntary”.
“Contributory fault” of this nature, but only of this nature, is a relevant
consideration to the availability of the defence.

It is on this point that the analogy to duress
is especially enlightening. Section 17  of the Criminal Code  provides:

17. A person
who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate death or
grievous bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed
is excused for committing the offence if he believes that the threats will be
carried out and if he is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby
he is subject to compulsion…

(Emphasis added.)

The rationale for the proviso making the defence
unavailable to a member of a criminal conspiracy or association, is the same as
that articulated with regard to the common law defence of duress by Lord Morris
of Borth-y-Gest in Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland v.
Lynch, [1975] A.C. 653 at p. 670:

[Page 257]

In posing the case where someone is
‘really’ threatened I use the word ‘really’ in order to emphasise that duress
must never be allowed to be the easy answer of those… who readily could have
avoided the dominance of threats nor of those who allow themselves to be at the
disposal and under the sway of some gangster-tyrant.

If section 17 and the comments of Lord
Morris of Borth-y-Gest embody a notion of “contributory fault” it is not per
se on account of the accused’s participation in criminal or immoral
activity at the time he became subject to threats, nor on account of any simple
negligence on his part, but rather on account of the clear foreseeability of
his becoming subject to such threats and domination and the consequent
conclusion that he was not “really” threatened.

In my view the same test is applicable to
necessity. If the accused’s “fault” consists of actions whose clear
consequences were in the situation that actually ensued, then he was not
“really” confronted with an emergency which compelled him to commit the
unlawful act he now seeks to have excused. In such situations the defence is
unavailable. Mere negligence, however, or the simple fact that he was engaged
in illegal or immoral conduct when the emergency arose will not disentitle an
individual to rely on the defence of necessity.

e) Onus of Proof

Although necessity is spoken of as a defence, in
the sense that it is raised by the accused, the Crown always bears the burden
of proving a voluntary act. The prosecution must prove every element of the
crime charged. One such element is the voluntariness of the act. Normally,
voluntariness can be presumed, but if the accused places before the Court,
through his own witnesses or through cross-examination of Crown witnesses,
evidence sufficient to raise an issue that the situation created by external
forces was so emergent that failure to act could endanger life or health and
upon any reasonable view of the facts, compliance with the law was impossible,
then the Crown

[Page 258]

must be prepared to meet that issue. There is no
onus of proof on the accused.

The Crown argues, however, that s. 7(2) of
the Narcotic Control Act shifts the burden of persuasion to the accused.

Section 7(2) provides:

7.(1) …

(2) In any prosecution under this Act the
burden of proving that an exception, exemption, excuse or qualification
prescribed by law operates in favour of the accused is on the accused, and the
prosecutor is not required, except by way of rebuttal, to prove that the
exception, exemption, excuse or qualification does not operate in favour of the
accused, whether or not it is set out in the information or indictment.

The Crown contends that the defence of necessity
is an “exception, exemption, excuse or qualification prescribed by law”. I find
no merit in this contention.

The Narcotic Control Act provides for
several statutory exceptions to its broad prohibitions against importation,
sale, manufacture, and possession. The offences created by the Act are
generally subject to the proviso that the accused not have been acting under
the authority of the Act or the regulations thereunder. See sections 3(1)
(possession), 5(1) (importation), 6(1) (cultivation). Section 12 of the Act
implements this scheme by providing for a set of regulations governing the
issuance of licences for, inter alia, the importation, sale,
manufacture, or possession of narcotics. One who sells, imports, manufactures
or possesses narcotics pursuant to such authority does not commit an offence.

It seems clear that it is to these statutory
exceptions that s. 7(2) refers, and not to common law defences such as
necessity. One who wishes to plead the possession of a licence or other lawful
authority in response to a charge of importation bears, under s. 7(2), the
burden of persuading the trier of fact that such licence exists. One who pleads
necessity bears no such burden. Section

[Page 259]

7(2) does not place a persuasive burden as to
the defence of necessity on the accused.

f) Preliminary Conclusions as to the Defence
of Necessity

It is now possible to summarize a number of
conclusions as to the defence of necessity in terms of its nature, basis and
limitations: (1) the defence of necessity could be conceptualized as either a
justification or an excuse; (2) it should be recognized in Canada as an excuse,
operating by virtue of s. 7(3)  of the Criminal Code ; (3)
necessity as an excuse implies no vindication of the deeds of the actor; (4)
the criterion is the moral involuntariness of the wrongful action; (5) this
involuntariness is measured on the basis of society’s expectation of
appropriate and normal resistance to pressure; (6) negligence or involvement in
criminal or immoral activity does not disentitle the actor to the excuse of
necessity; (7) actions or circumstances which indicate that the wrongful deed
was not truly involuntary do disentitle; (8) the existence of a reasonable
legal alternative similarly disentitles; to be involuntary the act must be
inevitable, unavoidable and afford no reasonable opportunity for an alternative
course of action that does not involve a breach of the law; (9) the defence
only applies in circumstances of imminent risk where the action was taken to
avoid a direct and immediate peril; (10) where the accused places before the
Court sufficient evidence to raise the issue, the onus is on the Crown to meet
it beyond a reasonable doubt.

g) The Judge’s Charge

The trial judge concluded that there was before
him an adequate body of evidence to raise the issue of necessity and proceeded
to direct the jury with respect to the defence. As I have earlier indicated,
the Crown disputes whether the defence was open to the accused in the
circumstances of

[Page 260]

the case and submits further that if it was in
fact available, the trial judge erred in his direction.

In my view the trial judge was correct in
concluding that on the evidence before him he should instruct the jury with
regard to necessity. There was evidence before him from which a jury might
conclude that the accused’s actions in coming ashore with their cargo of
cannabis were aimed at self-preservation in response to an overwhelming
emergency. I have already indicated that in my view they were not engaged in
conduct that was illegal under Canadian criminal law at the time the emergency
arose, and that even if they were, that fact alone would not disentitle them to
raise the defence. The question then becomes whether the trial judge erred in
charging the jury in the terms that he did.

The summary of conclusions with regard to
necessity in the foregoing section indicates that for the defence to
succeed, an accused’s actions must be, in the relevant sense, an “involuntary”
response to an imminent and overwhelming peril. The defence cannot succeed if
the response was disproportional to the peril or if it was not “involuntary” in
the sense that the emergency was not “real” or not imminent or that there was a
reasonable alternative response that was not illegal.

In the course of his charge on the issue of
necessity the trial judge instructed the jury, using the specific words that
appear in Morgentaler, to the effect that they must find facts which
amount to an “urgent situation of clear and imminent peril when compliance with
the law is demonstrably impossible” in order for the appellants’ non-compliance
with the law against importation and possession of cannabis to be excused. That
is the correct test. It is, with respect, however, my view that in explaining
the meaning and application of this test, the trial judge fell into error.

[Page 261]

The trial judge was obliged, in my opinion, to
direct the jury’s attention to a number of issues pertinent to the test for
necessity. Was the emergency a real one? Did it constitute an immediate threat
of the harm purportedly feared? Was the response proportionate? In comparing
this response to the danger that motivated it, was the danger one that society
would reasonably expect the average person to withstand? Was there any
reasonable legal alternative to the illegal response open to the accused?
Although the trial judge did not explicitly pose each and every one of these
questions in my view his charge was adequate to bring the considerations
underlying them to the jury’s attention on every issue except the last one, the
question of a reasonable alternative.

This issue was the determining obstacle to the
success of the defence of necessity in a number of the cases referred to
earlier, including Gilkes, Doud, Byng and for the present case most
notably, because of the similarity of its factual basis, Salvador. Indeed
in most cases where the defence is raised this consideration will almost
certainly be the most important one.

In his charge, the trial judge did not advert to
this requirement. He did tell the jury that they must find facts capable of
showing that “compliance with the law [was] demonstrably impossible…” but on
his recharge he put before the jury a significantly different test. The test,
he said, is:

…can you find facts from this evidence, and
that means all the evidence, of course, that the situation of the Samarkanda at
sea was so appallingly dire and dangerous to life that a reasonable doubt
arises as to whether or not their decision was justified?

And again, at the conclusion of the recharge:

There is no need for the evidence to show
you that a certainty of death would result unless the action complained of by
the Crown was taken. It doesn’t go so far as that. You have to look at it as
reasonable people and

[Page 262]

decide on any reasonable view of the
matter, would these people have been justified in doing what they did? That is
all that necessity means.

Both of these passages imply that the crucial
consideration was whether the accused acted reasonably in coming into shore
with their load of cannabis rather than facing death at sea. That is not
sufficient as a test. Even if it does deal with the reality of the peril, its
imminence and the proportionality of putting into shore, it does not deal at
all with the question of whether there existed any other reasonable responses
to the peril that were not illegal. Indeed, aside from the initial repetition
of the Morgentaler formula, the trial judge did not advert to this
consideration at all, nor did he direct the jury’s attention to the relevance
of evidence indicating the possibility of such alternative courses of action.
In these respects I believe he erred in law. He did not properly put the
question of a “legal way out” before the jury.

In my view this was a serious error and omission
going to the heart of the defence of necessity. The error justifies a new
trial.

III The Botanical Defence

The Narcotic Control Act, s. 2, defines
cannabis (marihuana) as “Cannabis sativa L.” At trial, the appellants
presented expert testimony to the effect that there are three species of
cannabis—Cannabis sativa L., Cannabis indica Lam., and Cannabis
ruderalis Jan. The Crown countered with expert testimony that there is only
one species of cannabis—the prohibited Cannabis sativa L.

The divergence in views among botanists is of
recent origin. Before 1970, there were isolated references in the literature to
Cannabis indica (Lamarck 1785) and Cannabis ruderalis (Janis‑chevsky
1924) but the prevailing botanical view

[Page 263]

was that marihuana was monotypic and consisted
only of Cannabis sativa L.

It was proven at trial that the Samarkanda’s cargo
was marihuana but it was not proven that it was Cannabis sativa L., as
opposed to Cannabis indica Lam. or Cannabis ruderalis Jan. The
laboratory tests performed by the Crown were not designed to distinguish among
the three purported species, the Crown’s experts being of the view that all
marihuana was Cannabis sativa L. Counsel for the accused asked the trial
judge to put the question whether marihuana was monotypic or polytypic to the
jury, with an instruction that if they found there were three species of
cannabis and the Crown had not proven that the cannabis in the possession of
the appellants was the prohibited species, they should find the appellants not
guilty.

The trial judge agreed with the accused that the
taxonomic question was one of fact but ruled that its resolution was
unnecessary because Parliament, when it used the term Cannabis sativa L.
in the Narcotic Control Act, meant to embrace all marihuana. In his
view, since all marihuana was prohibited by the Act, it was irrelevant whether
the plant was botanically polytypic or monotypic. He declined to put the
accused’s “botanical defence” to the jury.

The appellants contend that the trial judge
erred in ruling as a matter of law that the term “Cannabis sativa L.” in
the Narcotic Control Act embraces all marihuana. They rely principally
on the rule of statutory construction that technical terms in statutes should
be given their technical meaning.

It is clear that the Latin phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” is a technical term. Botanical nomenclature is governed by an
internationally accepted set of regulations which provide that Latin is the
official language of botany. Pursuant to the Code of Botanical Nomenclature,
plant species are assigned a Latin binomial with the name of the

[Page 264]

author (the taxonomist who first identifies and
names the species) appended in abbreviated form. The first word in the binomial
identifies the genus, or “family” to which the plant in question belongs; the
second word identifies the species. “Cannabis saliva L.” in this naming
system designates the species saliva of the genus cannabis. The
“L.” stands for Linnaeus, the botanist who discovered the plant in 1753.

It is well established that technical and
scientific terms which appear in statutes should be given their technical or
scientific meaning: see Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes (12th
ed. 1969) at p. 28. The question presented in the case at bar, however, is
not whether the term “Cannabis sativa L.” should be assigned its
scientific or technical meaning. The parties agree that it should. The real
dispute, as I see it, is as to when, in temporal terms, that meaning should be
fixed. The appellants argue, in effect, for the meaning which the scientific
community would today give to the phrase. They submit that a jury could
reasonably find from the expert evidence presented that the scientific
community is now of the view that there are three species of the genus
cannabis, of which Cannabis sativa L. is only one. The Crown, on the
other hand, argues that the meaning to be given to the phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” is the meaning which the botanical community ascribed to it when
the Narcotic Control Act became law in 1961. In 1961, botanists were
virtually unanimous in holding that cannabis marihuana consisted of only one
species and that the plants which some botanists referred to as Cannabis
indica Lam. and Cannabis ruderalis Jan. were merely subspecies of Cannabis
sativa L. The appellants, as I have said, ask that we give the phrase in
question the meaning which their experts say it bears at present among members
of the botanical community; the Crown asks us to freeze its meaning at the time
of enactment.

The doctrine of contemporanea expositio is
well established in our law. “The words of a statute

[Page 265]

must be construed as they would have been the
day after the statute was passed…” Sharpe v. Wakefield (1888), 22 Q.B.D.
239, at p. 242 (per Lord Esher, M.R.). See also Driedger, Construction
of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983) at p. 163: “Since a statute must be
considered in the light of all circumstances existing at the time of its
enactment it follows logically that words must be given the meanings they had
at the time of enactment, and the courts have so held”; Maxwell on the
Interpretation of Statutes, supra, at p. 85: “The words of an Act will
generally be understood in the sense which they bore when it was passed”.

This does not mean, of course, that all terms in
all statutes must always be confined to their original meanings. Broad
statutory categories are often held to include things unknown when the statute
was enacted. In Gambart v. Ball (1863), 32 L.J.C.P. 166, for example, it
was held that the Engraving Copyright Act of 1735, which prohibited
unauthorized engraving or “in any other manner” copying prints and engravings,
applied to photographic reproduction—a process invented more than one hundred
years after the Act was passed. (See also Maxwell, supra, at pp. 102 and
243-44.) This kind of interpretive approach is most likely to be taken,
however, with legislative language that is broad or “open-textured”. It is
appropriate, as the judgments of Viscount Sankey in Edwards v.
Attorney-General for Canada, [1930] A.C. 124, and Viscount Jowitt in Attorney-General
for Ontario v. Attorney-General for Canada (the Privy Council Appeals
Reference), [1947] A.C. 127, indicate, to the interpretation of the words
in constitutional documents, whose meaning must be capable of growth and
development to meet changing circumstances. But where, as here, the legislature
has deliberately chosen a specific scientific or technical term to represent an
equally specific and particular class of things, it would do violence to
Parliament’s intent to give a new meaning to that term whenever the taxonomic
consensus among members of the relevant scientific fraternity shifted. It is
clear that Parliament intended in 1961, by the phrase “Cannabis sativa

[Page 266]

L.”, to prohibit all cannabis. The fact that
some, possibly a majority, of botanists would now give that phrase a less
expansive reading in the light of studies not undertaken until the early
1970’s, does not alter that intention. The interpretation given to the Narcotic
Control Act by the trial judge was consistent with Parliament’s apparent
intent in enacting the legislation, and was, in my opinion, correct.

There is no question in my mind that the appellants
were given “fair warning” by the Narcotic Control Act that their conduct
was illegal. It is common knowledge in our society that marihuana is an illegal
drug. It is not common knowledge that some botanists have recently concluded
that there are three separate species of the mother plant, based on
morphological considerations. Against this background, it seems highly unlikely
that the citizen seeking guidance from his country’s laws as to what he may or
may not do, would see in the language “Cannabis sativa L.” a basis for
the three species botanical argument relied upon by the appellants in the case
at bar. It would simply be unreasonable to assume that by using the phrase “Cannabis
sativa L.” Parliament meant to prohibit only some intoxicating marihuana
and exempt the rest. Such an interpretation would be at odds with the general
scheme of the Narcotic Control Act as well as the common understanding
of society at large. Under the circumstances, it seems clear that the statute
gives ample warning as written. Fairness does not demand that it be more
narrowly construed.

This has been the approach taken by the two
Canadian courts who have considered the botanical defence, and both have
rejected it. See R. v. Herbert, Coombs and Spanks (1975), 28 C.C.C. (2d)
423, at p. 439; R. v. Deslaurier, Paskell and Pinney, Ont. Co. Ct.
(District of York), July 1974, Steen J. The American cases are in accord. See,

[Page 267]

for example, People v. Hamilton, 105 Cal.
App. 3d 113 (1980); United States v. Lupo, 652 F.2d 723 (7th Cir. 1981);
United States v. Kelly, 527 F.2d 961 (9th Cir. 1976); United States
v. Gavic, 520 F.2d 1346 (8th Cir. 1975); United States v. Spann, 515
F.2d 579 (10th Cir. 1975); United States v. Walton, 514 F.2d 201 (D.C.
Cir. 1975); United States v. Honneus, 508 F.2d 566 (1st Cir. 1974); United
States v. Kinsey, 505 F.2d 1354 (2nd Cir. 1974); United States v.
Sifuentes, 504 F.2d 845 (4th Cir. 1974); United States v. Gaines, 489
F.2d 690 (5th Cir. 1974); United States v. Moore, 446 F.2d 448 (3rd Cir.
1971).

The trial judge was correct in withdrawing the
appellants’ botanical defence from the jury.

IV Rebuttal Evidence

The British Columbia Court of Appeal concluded
that the trial judge erred in law in denying the Crown the right of rebuttal
and based its order for a new trial on this finding. I have already concluded
that there must be a new trial owing to the error of law in the trial judge’s
charge with respect to necessity. At this new trial the issue of whether in the
circumstances of the first trial the Crown was entitled in law to present the
rebuttal evidence it sought to adduce will no longer be relevant and will have
no effect on the outcome of the case. I do not, accordingly, find it necessary
to decide whether the trial judge erred in law in exercising his discretion to
refuse to allow the rebuttal.

V Conclusion

On the basis of all the above, it is my
conclusion that the Court of Appeal was correct in the result in ordering a new
trial and was correct in sustaining the trial judge’s decision to withhold the

[Page 268]

botanical defence from the jury.

I would dismiss the appeals.

The following are the reasons delivered by

WILSON J.—The factual background of this case,
the history of the litigation in the courts below and the grounds on which the appeal
was taken in this Court are very fully set out in the reasons for judgment of
Mr. Justice Dickson (as he was at the date of the hearing) and it is not
necessary for me to repeat them. Indeed, inasmuch as Dickson J.’s conclusion as
to the defence of necessity seems clearly correct on the facts of this case and
his disposition of the appeal manifestly just in the circumstances, I am
dealing in these reasons only with the proposition very forcefully advanced by
Dickson J. in his reasons that the appropriate jurisprudential basis on which
to premise the defence of necessity is exclusively that of excuse. My concern
is that the learned Justice appears to be closing the door on justification as
an appropriate jurisprudential basis in some cases and I am firmly of the view
that this is a door which should be left open by the Court.

As Dickson J. points out, criminal law theory
recognizes a distinction between justification and excuse. In the case of
justification the wrongfulness of the alleged offensive act is challenged; in
the case of excuse the wrongfulness is acknowledged but a ground for the
exercise of judicial compassion for the actor is asserted. By way of
illustration, an act may be said to be justified when an essential element of
the offence is absent, so that the defence effectively converts the accused’s
act from wrongful to rightful. Accordingly, those defences which serve to
establish a lack of culpable intent on the part of the accused, or which
demonstrate that, although the accused intended to commit the act, the act was
one which the accused was within his rights to commit, may be labeled
justification in so far as they elucidate the innocent nature of the act giving
rise to the charge. Such doctrines as mistake of fact, automatism, etc. which,
in the words of Lord Hailsham in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan, [1975]
2 All E.R. 347 (H.L.), are raised in order to “negative” mens rea, may
be appropriately placed

[Page 269]

in this category as they are invoked in order to
undermine the very ingredient of culpability. Similarly, the accused who claims
to have acted out of self-defence or provocation in utilizing aggressive force
against another individual raises a justificatory defence in that he asserts
the essential rightfulness of his aggressive act.

On the other hand, an excuse requires the court
to evaluate the presence or absence of the accused’s will. In contemporary
jurisprudence the most forceful champion of excuse in criminal law has been
Professor George Fletcher who has advocated a trend toward individualizing the
conceptual basis for culpability so that all circumstances subjectively
relevant to the accused be considered by the court. As such, the jury is
requested to exercise compassion for the accused’s predicament in its evaluation
of his claim: “I couldn’t help myself” (Fletcher, “The Individualization of
Excusing Conditions”, (1974) 47 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1269). This type of
analysis is reflected in the dissent of Seiler J. of the Supreme Court of
Missouri in State v. Green, 470 S.W. 2d 565 (1971), in which the
accused’s prison escape was seen as excusable due to the intolerability of his
confinement with aggressive homosexual inmates by whom he had been repeatedly
victimized. The basis of the defence could not have been that of justification
based on an objective balance of evils since numerous U.S. courts had already
established that the evil of prison escape outweighed the evil of intolerable
prison conditions (see, e.g., People v. Whipple, 279 P. 1008
(Cal. App. 1929); People v. Noble, 170 N.W. 2d 916 (Mich. App.
1969)). Rather, the issue for Seiler J. was the blamelessness of an accused in
committing an act which, although admittedly wrong, was one for which any juror
might have compassion. Thus, the nature of an excuse is to personalize the plea
so that, while justification looks to the Tightness of the act, excuse speaks
to the compassion of the court for the actor.

[Page 270]

As Dickson J. points out, although the necessity
defence has engendered a significant amount of judicial and scholarly debate,
it remains a somewhat elusive concept. It is, however, clear that justification
and excuse are conceptually quite distinct and that any elucidation of a
principled basis for the defence of necessity must be grounded in one or the
other.

Turning first to the category of excuse, the
concept of “normative involuntariness” stressed in the reasons of Dickson J.
may, on one reading, be said to fit squarely within the framework of an
individualized plea which Professor Fletcher indicates characterizes all claims
of excusability. The notional involuntariness of the action is assessed in the
context of the accused’s particular situation. The court must ask not only
whether the offensive act accompanied by the requisite culpable mental state (i.e.
intention, recklessness, etc.) has been established by the prosecution, but
whether or not the accused acted so as to attract society’s moral outrage. In
some U.S. jurisdictions this type of evaluation has been utilized to excuse
from criminal liability individuals who commit intentional offensive acts but
who operate under mental or sociological impairments with which one can
sympathize (see State v. St. Clair, 262 S.W. 2d 25 (Mo. S.C.
1953)), or to form the theoretical basis for a defence where the accused
confronted a desperate situation for which society might well be expected to
express its compassion (see United States v. Holmes, 26 Fed.
Cas. 360 (E.D. Pa. 1842)). In evaluating a claim of “normative
involuntariness” we seem to be told that the individual’s criminally wrongful
act was nevertheless blameless in the circumstances.

The position in English law, by contrast, was
most accurately stated in the well-known case of R. v. Dudley and Stephens (1884),
14 Q.B.D. 273, in which Lord Coleridge warned against allowing “compassion for
the criminal to change or weaken in any manner the legal definition of the
crime” (p. 288). The underlying principle here is the

[Page 271]

universality of rights, that all individuals
whose actions are subjected to legal evaluation must be considered equal in
standing. Indeed, it may be said that this concept of equal assessment of every
actor, regardless of his particular motives or the particular pressures
operating upon his will, is so fundamental to the criminal law as rarely to
receive explicit articulation. However, the entire premise expressed by such
thinkers as Kant and Hegel that man is by nature a rational being, and that
this rationality finds expression both in the human capacity to overcome the
impulses of one’s own will and in the universal right to be free from the
imposition of the impulses and will of others (see Hegel, Philosophy of
Right (trans. Knox, 1952), at pp. 226-27) supports the view that an
individualized assessment of offensive conduct is simply not possible. If the
obligation to refrain from criminal behaviour is perceived as a reflection of
the fundamental duty to be rationally cognizant of the equal freedom of all
individuals, then the focus of an analysis of culpability must be on the
act itself (including its physical and mental elements) and not on the actor.
The universality of such obligations precludes the relevance of what Fletcher
refers to as “an individualized excusing condition”.

On the other hand, the necessity of an act may
be said to exempt an actor from punishment, since the person who acts in
a state of what Dickson J. calls “normative involuntariness” may be viewed as
having been moved to act by the instinct for self-preservation. If so, the
defence does not invoke the Court’s compassion but rather embodies an implicit
statement that the sanction threatened by the law (i.e. future
punishment in one form or another) could never overcome the fear of immediate
death which the accused faced. Accordingly, in such a case the law is incapable
of controlling the accused’s conduct and responding to it with any punishment
at all. Although such an act dictated by the necessity of self-preservation is
a voluntary one (in the normal sense of the word), its “norma-

[Page 272]

tive involuntariness” (in the sense that the
actor faced no realistic choice) may form the basis of a defence if this is
conceived as based on the pointlessness of punishment rather than on a view of
the act itself as one the accused was entitled to commit. Indeed, one finds an
explicit warning to this effect in Kant, The Metaphysical Elements of
Justice (trans. Ladd, 1965), at pp. 41-42, where it is asserted that
“through a strange confusion among jurists” the analysis of the wrongfulness of
an act is often intertwined with the unquestionable futility of inflicting
punishment on a person who has acted in despair or in circumstances of dire
necessity.

It may be opportune at this point to comment
briefly on the need to avoid slipping into what may be labeled an “instrumentalist
analysis” of the purposes of punishment. For example, an analytic focus on
excusing conditions is often premised on the fact that punishment in such
situations will not serve the further goals of deterrence, rehabilitation, etc.
(see, e.g., Glanville Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part (2nd
ed. 1961), esp. at pp. 738-39). Such considerations, however, cannot form the
basis of an acceptable defence since they seem to view criminal culpability
merely as a phenomenon in a chain of cause and effect. From an instrumentalist
point of view the question is not whether liability is demanded in and of
itself (as Lord Coleridge insisted must be the case in Dudley and Stephens,
supra), but rather whether the infliction of punishment will have
some positive consequential effect (see, e.g., J. Bentham, An
Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, vol. II, 2nd ed.,
1823, p. 1).

The view of criminal liability as purposive only
when it serves as a means to a further end is inherently problematic since the
further goals of punishment are by their very nature one step removed from the
determination of guilt or inno-

[Page 273]

cence. Just as we do not inquire into the
socio-economic effects of a particular remedy for determining parties’
respective rights in civil litigation (see, e.g., Shelfer v. City of London
Electric Lighting Co., [1895] 1 Ch. 287 (C.A.)), it does not seem
possible to evaluate criminality with regard to the end results which
punishment will or will not achieve. Accordingly, if the basis for the
accused’s defence is reducible to compassion for his individual attributes or
predicament, or the ineffectiveness of punishment in rehabilitating him or
deterring future acts, the question raised is the type of remedy and the
fashioning of an appropriate sentence. The concerns embodied in such a defence
are legitimately addressed to the sentencing process but cannot, in my view, be
the basis of a successful defence leading to an acquittal.

This, however, is distinguishable from the
situation in which punishment cannot on any grounds be justified, such as the
situation where a person has acted in order to save his own life. As Kant
indicates, although the law must refrain from asserting that conduct which
otherwise constitutes an offence is rightful if done for the sake of
self-preservation, there is no punishment which could conceivably be
appropriate to the accused’s act. As such, the actor falling within the Dickson
J. category of “normative involuntariness” is excused, not because there is no instrumental
ground on which to justify his punishment, but because no purpose inherent to
criminal liability and punishment—i.e. the setting right of a wrongful
act—-can be accomplished for an act which no rational person would avoid.

Returning to the defence of necessity as a
justification, it may generally be said that an act is justified on grounds of
necessity if the court can say that not only was the act a necessary one but it
was rightful rather than wrongful. When grounded on the fundamental principle
that a successful defence must characterize an act as one which the

[Page 274]

accused was within his rights to commit, it
becomes immediately apparent that the defence does not depend on the immediacy
or “normative involuntariness” of the accused’s act unless, of course, the
involuntariness is such as to be pertinent to the ordinary analysis of mens
rea. The fact that one act is done out of a sense of immediacy or urgency
and another after some contemplation cannot, in my view, serve to distinguish
the quality of the act in terms of right or wrong. Rather, the justification
must be premised on the need to fulfil a duty conflicting with the one which
the accused is charged with having breached.

In discussing justification based on a conflict
of duties one must be mindful of the viewpoint expressed by Dickson J. in Morgentaler
v. The Queen, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616 at p. 678, to the effect that “[n]o
system of positive law can recognize any principle which would entitle a person
to violate the law because in his view the law conflicted with some higher
social value”. This statement, in my view, is clearly correct if the “higher
social value” to which the accused points is one which is not reflected in the
legal system in the form of a duty. That is to say, pursuit of a purely ethical
“duty” such as, for example, the duty to give to charity, may represent an
ethically good or virtuous act but is not within the realm of legal obligations
and cannot therefore validly be invoked as a basis on which to violate the positive
criminal law. This illustration exemplifies the essential proposition that
although “a morally motivated act contrary to law may be ethically justified…
the actor must accept the [legal] penalty for his action”: United States v.
Moylan, 417 F. 2d 1002 (4th Cir. 1969), at p. 1008.

Similarly, Dickson J. in his reasons for
judgment in the present case correctly underlines the fact that a utilitarian
balancing of the benefits of

[Page 275]

obeying the law as opposed to disobeying it
cannot possibly represent a legitimate principle against which to measure the
legality of an action since any violation of right permitted to be justified on
such a utilitarian calculus does not, in Dickson J.’s words, “fit[s] well with
the judicial function”. The maximization of social utility may well be a goal
of legislative policy but it is not part of the judicial task of delineating
right and wrong. The case of Southwark London Borough Council v. Williams, [1971]
Ch. 734 (C.A.), affords an appropriate illustration. In raising a defence
of necessity to a charge of trespass the defendants implicitly argued that a
violation of the rights of the property owner was justified because of the
maximized social utility achieved by their using the property in that otherwise
the defendants would remain homeless and the property unused. Lord Justice
Megaw recognized that it was no part of the adjudicator’s task either to
maximize utility or distribute scarce resources on some criterion of merit as
demanded by the defendants since the distribution of society’s resources is a
political process that must be accomplished by a distributive mechanism
encompassing the entire policy. Lord Denning pointed out that if such claims
became a matter of right for an adjudicative body to determine and enforce, the
very notion of right would be undermined. He said at p. 744: “If
homelessness were once admitted as a defence to trespass, no one’s house could
be safe”.

Accordingly, not only can the system of positive
law not tolerate an individual opting to act in accordance with the dictates of
his conscience in the event of a conflict with legal duties, but it cannot
permit acts in violation of legal obligations to be justified on the grounds
that social utility is thereby increased. In both situations the conflicting
“duty” to which the defence arguments point is one which the court cannot take
into account as it invokes considerations external to a judicial analysis of
the Tightness or wrongness of the impugned

[Page 276]

act. As Lord Coleridge succinctly put it in Dudley
and Stephens, supra, at p. 287: “Who is to be the judge of this sort
of necessity?”

On the other hand, in some circumstances defence
counsel may be able to point to a conflicting duty which courts can and do
recognize. For example, one may break the law in circumstances where it is
necessary to rescue someone to whom one owes a positive duty of rescue (see R.
v. Walker (1979), 48 C.C.C. (2d) 126 (Ont. Co. Ct.)), since failure to act
in such a situation may itself constitute a culpable act or omission (see R.
v. Instan, [1893] 1 Q.B. 450). Similarly, if one subscribes to the
viewpoint articulated by Laskin C.J.C. in Morgentaler, supra, and
perceives a doctor’s defence to an abortion charge as his legal obligation to
treat the mother rather than his alleged ethical duty to perform an
unauthorized abortion, then the defence may be invoked without violating the
prohibition enunciated by Dickson J. in Morgentaler against choosing a
non-legal duty over a legal one.

It must be acknowledged, however, that on the
existing state of the law the defence of necessity as justification would not
be available to the person who rescues a stranger since the absence of a legal
duty to rescue strangers reduces such a case to a conflict of a legal with a
purely ethical duty. Such an act of rescue may be one deserving of no
punishment and, indeed, deserving of praise, but it is nevertheless a culpable
act if the law is violated in the process of the rescue.

As Professor E.J. Weinrib has most astutely
pointed out, rescue scenarios often represent the mirror image of necessity
scenarios; to acknowledge necessity as a justification premised on the

[Page 277]

discharge of the conflicting duty to rescue a
stranger could, without much stretch of the imagination, be turned around so as
to enable a potential rescuee to assert a right to be rescued by any stranger
(Weinrib, “The Case for a Duty to Rescue”, (1980) 90 Yale L.J. 247, at pp.
273-74). By way of illustration, in the classic torts case of Vincent v.
Lake Erie Transportation Co., 124 N.W. 221 (Minn. 1910), it was held that a
ship owner was right in helping himself to the use of a dock owner’s property
during a storm, thus invoking the defence of necessity to a charge of trespass
to the dock. The argument was premised on the notion of conflicting legal
duties and was allowed to succeed in large part due to a previous ruling in Ploof
v. Putnam, 71 A. 188 (Vt. S.C. 1908), in which a dock owner in similar
circumstances was held liable to a ship owner for refusing to grant the ship
access to the dock during a storm. The combined effect of the two cases may be
said to turn the altruistic action into a coercive one in that the rescuer is
not only given a valid justification but the rescuee is perceived as having an
enforceable right. For this reason the common law has refrained from
enunciating either an extended duty to rescue or an expansive right of
necessity. In such circumstances “[t]here may be a moral duty to… [perform a
rescue], but it is not practicable to make it a legal duty” (Home Office v.
Dorset Yacht Co., [1970] A.C. 1004, per Lord Reid at p. 1027).
Rather, persons in need of aid from unknown passersby have been left to “be
relieved by the charitable and the good” (per Lord Denning in Southwark
London Borough Council, supra, at p. 744).

In similar fashion the ethical considerations of
the “charitable and the good” must be kept analytically distinct from duties
imposed by law. Accordingly, where necessity is invoked as a justification for
violation of the law, the justification must, in my view, be restricted to
situations where

[Page 278]

the accused’s act constitutes the discharge of a
duty recognized by law. The justification is not, however, established simply
by showing a conflict of legal duties. The rule of proportionality is central
to the evaluation of a justification premised on two conflicting duties since
the defence rests on the rightfulness of the accused’s choice of one over the
other.

As the facts before the Court in the present
case do not involve a conflict of legal duties it is unnecessary to discuss in
detail how a court should go about assessing the relative extent of two evils.
Suffice it to say that any such assessment must respect the notion of right
upon which justification is based. The assessment cannot entail a mere
utilitarian calculation of, for example, lives saved and deaths avoided in the
aggregate but must somehow attempt to come to grips with the nature of the
rights and duties being assessed. This would seem to be consistent with Lord Coleridge’s
conclusion that necessity can provide no justification for the taking of a
life, such an act representing the most extreme form of rights violation. As
discussed above, if any defence for such a homicidal act is to succeed, it
would have to be framed as an excuse grounded on self-preservation. It could
not possibly be declared by the Court to be rightful. By contrast, the
justification analysis would seem to support those cases in which fulfilment of
the legal duty to save persons entrusted to one’s care is preferred over the
lesser offences of trespass or petty theft: see Mouse’s Case (1608), 12
Co. Rep. 63; Ch. corr., Amiens, April 22, 1898, Ménard’s Case, S.
1899.2.1. The crucial question for the justification defence is whether the
accused’s act can be said to represent a furtherance of or a detraction from
the principle of the universality of rights.

In summary, it seems to me that the category of
“normative involuntariness” into which an act done in the interests of
self-preservation falls is characterized not by the literal voluntariness of
the act but by its unpunishable nature. As such, the act may be exempted from
culpability if it arose in a life-threatening situation of necessity. Where,

[Page 279]

however, a defence by way of excuse is premised
on compassion for the accused or on a perceived failure to achieve a desired
instrumental end of punishment, the judicial response must be to fashion an
appropriate sentence but to reject the defence as such. The only conceptual
premise on which necessity as an excuse could rest is the inherent
impossibility of a court’s responding in any way to an act which, although
wrongful, was the one act which any rational person would commit.

Where the defence of necessity is invoked as a
justification the issue is simply whether the accused was right in pursuing the
course of behaviour giving rise to the charge. Thus, where the act otherwise
constitutes a criminal offence (i.e. it embodies both mens rea and
the actus reus) the accused must show that he operated under a
conflicting legal duty which made his seemingly wrongful act right. But such
justification must be premised on a right or duty recognized by law. This
excludes conduct attempted to be justified on the ground of an ethical duty
internal to the conscience of the accused as well as conduct sought to be
justified on the basis of a perceived maximization of social utility resulting
from it. Rather, the conduct must stem from the accused’s duty to satisfy his
legal obligations and to respect the principle of the universality of rights.

I would dismiss the appeals.
