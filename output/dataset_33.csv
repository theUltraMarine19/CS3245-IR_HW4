Earnest Lau, DJ:
Brief facts
1.         The Plaintiff is a family-run company. On 19 July 2003, they obtained a judgment in DC Suit No. 530 of 2003 against Chuang Ye Engineering Pte Ltd (“the company”) for $153,457. At all material times, the Defendant was the director of the company. The judgment proved fruitless for the Plaintiff as the company was unable to pay the sums owed. Sometime in August 2003, the Plaintiff offered the company to pay just $80,000 to settle the judgment debt on condition that the Defendant execute a personal guarantee. A draft deed of guarantee was prepared by Ms Pang Li Yen (“Pang”) (PW2), a qualified accountant and daughter of the Plaintiff’s director Mdm Koh Hwee Kheng (“Koh) (PW1). The Defendant refused to sign the deed of guarantee.
2.         In November 2003, the Plaintiff commenced execution proceedings against the company under a Writ of Seizure and Sale (WSS).
3.         In December 2003, the Plaintiff negotiated with the Defendant to let the company pay $75,000 by 29/2/2004 as a full and final settlement of the judgment debt. This is contained in a letter from the Plaintiff to the company dated 22/12/2003 (“the Letter”). As a result the Plaintiff did not proceed with the WSS against the company.
4.         Unfortunately, the company failed to make payment as agreed in the Letter.  Then sometime in April 2004, the Plaintiff saw a notice in the newspapers that a winding up petition had been made against the company. They then instructed solicitors to send a letter of demand against the Defendant seeking payment of $153,457 on grounds that he was personally liable for the judgment debt. The Defendant, however, denied all liability.
5.         As a result, the Plaintiff brought in these proceedings an action against the Defendant to recover a debt of $153,457 being monies due and owing on a personal guarantee. The Statement of Claim pleaded an agreement existing between the Plaintiff and Defendant that should the company fail to pay $75,000 by 28/2/2004 in full and final settlement of the judgment debt, the Defendant would pay to Plaintiff the entire judgment debt of $153,457. It was further pleaded that this agreement is evidenced in the Letter.
6.         At the conclusion of trial, the respective parties summed up their cases as follows:
(a)        The Defendant maintained that the compromise agreement in the Letter had been unilaterally offered by the Plaintiff who did not demand any security in return. In addition to the terms expressed in the Letter, the Plaintiff further allowed the company to take its time to pay the compromised sums by instalments. Throughout the negotiations, the Defendant had always told Pang that he did not wish to be personally liable for the judgment debt. This was why he refused to sign the deed of guarantee prepared in August 2003. He even informed Pang and Koh he was prepared to let the company be liquidated. At no time did he ever assume personal liability. If he intended to be personally liable, he would have signed the deed guarantee. He also raised the point that the Letter does not contain terms imputing personal liability on him. All this is consistent with the fact that Pang never used the words “personal guarantee” when she drafted the Letter, in contrast with the earlier deed of guarantee which she prepared. Moreover, the Plaintiff never sent any letter of demand to the Defendant when the company failed to pay on 29 February 2004. The Plaintiff only served a letter of demand to the Defendant 2-3 months later when the company was threatened with liquidation proceedings.
(b)        The Plaintiff, on the other hand, held that in all oral negotiations with the Defendant, Pang and Koh had insisted on a personal guarantee. This was why the Plaintiff offered to reduce the judgment debt from $153,457 to $75,000, postpone the Writ of Seizure and Sale and grant an extension of time to the company to pay. The Defendant’s version of the agreement is completely untrue. There is no agreement or evidence to show that the company was allowed to pay the compromised sums by instalments or to pay as and when it could afford to do so. The Defendant lied because he knew he was personally liable. He agreed to be personally liable because he was confident that by 29 February 2004 the company would have collected money on its business projects. The Letter clearly contains a personal guarantee and at all times, he understood the meaning of the Letter because the subject of guarantee was brought up at the meeting prior to the signing of the letter.
7.         On the outset, let me emphasise that the trial court can only look at the issues raised in the pleadings and no other: see 
Multi-Pak  Singapore v Intraco 
[1992] 2 SLR 793
.
 The Plaintiff has framed their case on the existence of an agreement by the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff $153,457 if the company fails to pay $75,000 by 29 February 2004. I therefore am confined to the task of ascertaining whether the Plaintiff has proven the agreement as pleaded. After considering the facts, I found no such agreement exists.
The law
8.         It is trite law that the court adopts an objective test in discerning the existence of such an agreement: 
Aircharter World Pte Ltd v Kontena Nasional Bhd 
[1999] 3 SLR 1
; Gema Metal Ceilings (Far East) Pte Ltd v Iwatani Techno Construction (M) Sdn Bhd 
[2000] SGHC 37
.  In other words, the court must decide whether the Letter when read objectively discloses the agreement as the Plaintiff has pleaded. The court cannot be concerned with what the parties may have believed.
(a)       The classic formulation of the principle was stated by Blackburn J in 
Smith v Hughes
 
(1871) LR 6 QB 597
 as follows:
If, whatever a man's real intention may be, he so conducts himself that a 
reasonable man 
would believe that he was assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief enters into the 
contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other party's terms.
(b)        In SAL Industrial Leasing Ltd v Teck Koon (Motor) Trading (a firm) 
[1998] 2 SLR 325
,
 the Court of Appeal  quoted this passage from R v Lord Chancellor`s Department, 
ex parte Nangle 
[1991] ICR 743
 at page 751 with approval:
[I]n our judgment, that the question whether there is an intention to create legal relations is to be ascertained objectively, and where the terms of the relationship are, as here, to be derived solely from the documents, depends upon the construction of those documents. It is possible for a party to believe mistakenly that he is contractually bound to another when in fact he is not; and conversely to believe that he is not when he is. His belief is immaterial. While this remains a subjective belief uncommunicated to the other party, this is plainly correct. But where such a belief is expressed in the documents it must be a question of construction of the documents as a whole what effect should be given to such a statement.
(c)        The contemporaneous conduct of the parties, in addition to documents, can and should also be taken into account in order to determine the existence of an agreement between the parties: see 
Harvey v Johnson (1848) 6 CB 305; Brogden v Metropolitan Railway 
(1877) 2 App Cas 666
.
9.         The main plank of the Plaintiff’s case rests on the proper construction of the Letter. I note the following from this Letter:
(a)        The Letter was dispatched on the Plaintiff’s letterhead and addressed to the company at its place of business “No. 22 Woodlands link #03-09/10 Singapore 738734”. Reproduced below are the terms found in the Letter:
It was agreed that:-
The sum of S$75,000 is to be the full and final settlement of the judgment entered against (sic) on the 19
th
 July 2003 on the condition that the agreed discounted value will be satisfied by one payment to be furnished before 
31
st
 January
 (29 February – handwritten and signed) 2004;
In the event of any default in payment, all outstanding balance sum under the judgment entered against you on 19
th
 July shall be come due and payable immediately and we shall be entitled to enforce the judgment;
Notwithstanding the provisions of Clause 1 & 2of the agreement the full sum may be repayable at any time prior to 31
st
 January 2004; and
Upon receipt of full payment, Chuang Ye Engineering Pte Ltd is allowed to file the consent to entry of satisfaction within 14 days.
Yours faithfully

(b)        On a plain and unstrained reading I cannot objectively say that the Letter imposes on the Defendant a personal liability to pay $153,437 on the company’s default. Even if one argues from the final paragraph of the Letter that the Defendant has somehow bound himself the 
“terms and conditions as set out above”
, it begs the question: what is he bound to? Clause 1 only obliges him to ensure that the company pays $75,000 by 29/2/2004. It is further evident the liability to pay the judgment sum on default only falls on the company and not the Defendant. And even if I consider the terms of the Letter ambiguous (which I do not), the rules of construction require me to resolve any ambiguity in meaning against the Plaintiff who prepared the document: see 
Edis v Bury
 
108 ER 511
.
(c)        Moreover Pang and Koh’s affidavits only deposed to the fact that a personal undertaking was given without condescending to the terms and particulars of the oral discussions which allegedly preceded the signing of the Letter. At cross examination, Pang displayed uncertainty as to whether the Defendant agreed to be personally liable for the full judgment debt against the company or only the compromised sums.
Ct:        Who was supposed to pay $75,000? Company or him (the Defendant)?
PLY:    If the company does not pay, he will pay.
Ct:        Tell me what you thought was the agreement i.e. that the company was to pay $75,000 in a lump sum by 29/2/2004, and if the company fails to pay, the Defendant will pay; or simply, the Defendant will pay $75,000 by 29/2/2004?
PLY:    Company to pay. If the company cannot pay $75,000, he will pay.
(d)        It was only on re-examination that Pang maintained the Defendant was personally liable to pay the entire judgment sum:
P/C:      You said that the agreement was that if the company does not pay $75,000 by 29/2/2004, the Defendant will pay and be liable. Clarify this statement in view of clause 2 of PA 69. He will pay what sum?
PLY:    $153,000 if the company does not pay $75,000. If the company does not pay $75,000, he will be personally liable for $153,000 which is the judgment debt.
10.       In the circumstances, I did not think the Letter sufficiently expressed the intentions of Pang and Koh to affix the Defendant with personal liability for the entire judgment sum. I also note that Pang had previously drafted a deed of guarantee in August 2003 which clearly spelt out the Defendant’s liability for the judgment debt.  The fact that she omitted to do so in the Letter militates strongly against the Plaintiff’s case. This could well be an oversight on her part, but as I have already pointed out, the objective test does not allow me to look into private thoughts but at published words and conduct.
Another agreement ?
11.       Although the Plaintiff could not discharge their burden on the pleaded case, the evidence, however, suggests there to be another collateral agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant.  I only mention this for the sake of completeness. I am mindful that the Plaintiff has only chosen to sue on the agreement as appears in their Statement of Claim i.e. a guarantee for $153,457. There is no other prayer for relief on an alternative agreement, thus precluding any award in favour of the Plaintiff.  My finding here is based on the law enunciated in 
Moschi v Lep Air Services 
[1973] AC 331
 which was applied in 
Tan Hock Keng v L and M Group Investments Ltd 2001] 4 SLR 428 (High Ct); 
[2002] 2 SLR 213
 (CA).
 In the 
Moschi
 
 
 case, the House of Lords discussed of the nature of the obligation of a guarantee. Most pertinent were the observations of Lord Reid who distinguished between two types of guarantee obligations: see 
Moschi 
[1973] AC 331
 at 344–345.
With regard to making good to the creditor payments of instalments by the principal debtor there are at least two possible forms of agreement. A person might undertake no more than if the principal debtor fails to pay any instalment he will pay it. That would be a conditional agreement. There would be no prestable obligation unless and until the debtor failed to pay. There would then on the debtor’s failure arise an obligation to pay. If for any reason the debtor ceased to have any obligation to pay the instalment on the due date then he could not fail to pay it on that date. The condition attached to the undertaking would never be purified and the subsidiary obligation would never arise. On the other hand, the guarantor’s obligation might be of a different kind. He might undertake that the principal debtor will carry out his contract. Then if at any time and if for any reason the principal debtor acts or fails to act as required by his contract, he not only breaks his own contract but also puts the guarantor in breach of his contract of guarantee. Then the creditor can sue the guarantor, not for the unpaid instalment but for damages. His contract being that the principal debtor would carry out the principal contract, the damages payable by the guarantor must then be the loss suffered by the creditor due to the principal debtor having failed to do what the guarantor undertook that he would do.
12.       The first description corresponds with the type of guarantee pleaded by the Plaintiff i.e. where the guarantor is liable for same debt that the principal debtor is liable for. It matters not if that debt is an outstanding instalment payment or the full sum outstanding. The important point to note is that the guarantor has undertaken to pay an agreed liquidated sum on the default of the principal debtor.
13.       The second type of guarantee described by Lord Reid fits the facts of our case. It is one where the guarantor has undertaken to ensure that the principal debtor performs his payment obligation. Here, the guarantor makes a separately enforceable collateral agreement with the creditor who gives consideration by entering into the compromise agreement with the principal debtor. The guarantor’s liability lies in damages in the event of a breach of compromise agreement by the principal debtor. In my opinion, the evidence in our case supports the presence of this guarantee obligation.       
(a)        In the course of proceedings, Koh and Pang have consistently maintained that they secured the Defendant’s “personal undertaking” in the course of negotiations – notably at a meeting dated 19/12/2003.  This was against the backdrop of a prior attempt by the Plaintiff to secure the Defendant’s personal guarantee in August 2003 and the postponed execution proceedings against the company. Crucially, the Defendant himself admitted in his affidavit at paragraph 13 that he had agreed to do his best to get the company to pay by 31/1/04.    I have also mentioned earlier that Clause 1 of the Letter can be read to oblige the Defendant to ensure the due payment by the company.
(b)        Between the Pang and Koh’s assertions and Defendant’s rejection of personal liability, I chose to believe the Plaintiff witnesses. To me the Defendant’s account of events was unbelievable by any objective standard. He testified that the Plaintiff voluntarily withdrew execution proceedings against the company; voluntarily reduced the original compromise sum from $80,000 top $75,000; and generously allowed the company to pay as and when it could, granting all these concessions without demanding anything in return from the company or the Defendant. These answers defy commercial and common sense. Moreover, the Defendant behaved evasively as a witness often contradicting himself on numerous occasions.
(c)        Thus on the balance of probabilities, I am inclined to find that the Defendant personally undertook the prompt repayment of the compromised sums by the company. This collateral agreement in my view exists coterminously with the main compromise agreement reached between the Plaintiff and the company, and is one where the Plaintiff is entitled to seek damages against the Defendant on the failure of the company to pay by the due date.
14.       For the reasons given, I dismiss the Plaintiff’s claim with costs to be taxed
