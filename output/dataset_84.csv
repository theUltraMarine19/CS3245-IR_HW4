Whether sentence manifestly excessive
 
On 20 November 1992 the appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal trespass and was convicted. She was sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment and appealed against this sentence as being manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal and enhanced the sentence to four weeks` imprisonment. I now give my reasons for doing so.
The charge to which the appellant pleaded guilty read as follows: 
 
You, Leong Shiaw Ling ... are charged that you on or about 23 October 1992, at about 1am, at the 33rd level of Westin Stamford Hotel, Stamford Road, Singapore, committed criminal trespass by entering into the compound of aforesaid hotel in the possession of one, Gunajekaran s/o SN Sinniah, with intent to cause annoyance to him, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Before this court, counsel argued that the trial judge was wrong in convicting the accused on the charge because her intention to annoy when entering the hotel at the relevant time was not addressed in the statement of facts.
The first observation that may be made is that s 244 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides: 
 
When an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court on that plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence.
 
 
 
These words are plain and should not be circumvented. Counsel asked in his skeletal arguments in support of the appeal against sentence that the court`s revisionary powers be exercised, but no petition for revision was filed nor do there appear to be any reasons, let alone good and sufficient ones, why it was not. In this particular instance no prejudice appears to have been occasioned by this procedure so counsel was permitted to address the court on this submission, but some adverse criticism of this method as a habitual manoeuvre is merited.
In any event counsel`s argument did not succeed. In 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 1 a person who entered the Bukit Turf Club in blatant disregard of a prohibition notice was held by this court to have entered with intent to annoy the management of the club. In was held that it would be wrong and unrealistic to insist on further evidence of such intention before a conviction could be founded; the requisite intent might be inferred from the surrounding circumstances and need not have been the primary or proximate intent of the accused.
Counsel sought to distinguish 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 1 on the grounds that the accused in that case had not pleaded guilty but had elected to remain silent at trial, arguing at the end of it that there was no direct evidence as to the intention with which he entered the club`s premises. The utility of this particular distinction to the appellant in the present case is not immediately apparent. Indeed her plea of guilt was an admission as to all elements of the offence charged, including the mental element. As such, on counsel`s argument, she had in fact a weaker case than the respondent in 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 .1 Counsel did not put forward any other arguments to distinguish that case. I therefore turn to consider the facts of the case and the matters stated in mitigation of the appellant`s sentence.
The appellant was at the material time a masseuse. On 10 October 1992 she was served with a persona-non-grata notice by the Westin Stamford Hotel in respect of her soliciting hotel guests as clients for her services. Apparently she had already been prosecuted previously for this particular activity and on 12 October 1992 was fined $500 for it.
The complainant, Gunajekaran s/o SN Sinniah, is a security supervisor at the Westin Stamford Hotel. On 23 October 1992 at about 12.40am the security controller told him that a hotel guest in a room on the 33rd level had complained about being solicited by a masseuse, and instructed him to watch for her. Accordingly he went to the 33rd level and at about 1am observed the appellant walking towards the room of the hotel guest who had made the complaint. The complainant identified himself and questioned the appellant, who said she was looking for the hotel guest in that room. She was then brought to the security office in the hotel.
The trial judge decided that the repetition of her solicitations so soon after the first incident merited a short custodial sentence of two weeks since the $500 fine in respect of the first incident, which was the maximum, appeared to have had no deterrent effect upon her.
I have considered the matters stated by counsel in mitigation. It is appreciated that the appellant has had a personal history of much hardship and unhappiness. Nevertheless counsel had not put before the court any matter which would justify a finding that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive in the circumstances. In fact, her criminal record is not confined to the previous incident of criminal trespass when she was fined $500. In May of the same year, 1992, she had been convicted of two offences of voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, contrary to s 332 of the Penal Code. She was fined $1,500 for each of these offences. She continued to enter the same hotel when she had been served with a notice not to do so, and entered precisely to conduct the very activities in respect of which that notice was served and which she had been prosecuted for already in the recent past. In the circumstances I was of the view that a degree of severity beyond that adopted by the district court was condign. Accordingly I dismissed the appeal and enhanced the appellant`s sentence to four weeks` imprisonment.
